# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2010

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Texas A&M Coach Mark Turgeon. Welcome and
your opening comments?  
COACH TURGEON: Thank you. It is always great to be back in Kansas City unless
you are playing the Jayhawks in this building. It is a lot of fun to be here.  
Excited about the team, we all are as coaches this time of year. Have some
good talent. Just have to mesh it together.  
I have been pleased so far. I think we have a chance to, like last year's
team, just continue to get better and better and have a lot of pieces. It is
just putting them all together. Had pretty good leadership so far out of our
seniors.  
And, once again, it is a fun team to be around. I got a lot of high-character
kids, and I enjoy being around them and going to practice every day.  
  
Q. In the leadership category, I'm assuming that falls to Dash and B.J.
Would you talk about what you have seen there and also Dash's bouncing back
from the wrist surgery.  
COACH TURGEON: I think Dash and B.J. have been our leaders. We have had a lot
of people at practice early season, and they always come up to me and say,
Boy, your guards do a great job leading, talking about Dash and B.J.  
And I think Nate Walkup has taken a leadership role, played a lot of minutes,
has a lot of respect among his teammates. And so he's doing it.  
Dash's injury, it has been a long haul. He tore a ligament. Took a while to
figure it out. Had surgery in June, and actually was just cleared to play and
start shooting about two weeks ago. So he had been out since the season ended
last year. But he is a young man that is never out of shape. He is just a
little bit rusty dribbling the ball and passing. But defensively he is at a
high level. By the time we start playing games, he will be 100%.  
  
Q. Talk about any of the freshmen -- it has been only a week -- but any of
the freshmen jump out of you that say this guy is going to contribute at this
point?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, all three freshmen are really good players for us.  
Kourtney Roberson is probably the furthest along at 6' 9", 245 pounds, really
skilled. Offensively, really has a great feel. He can score in a variety of
ways. So I think he's probably the first long and ready. He has a long ways to
go defensively, but in our six, seven, eight practices, however many we have,
he has come a long ways defensively.  
Keith Davis, you know, almost 6' 10" now, continues to grow, has a great
understanding defensively and a great teammate and a great player. I think he
is a young man that as the season goes on will play more and more for us and
has a chance to be good.  
And then our last freshman, Daniel Alexander from your area, he is a weapon.
The kid can just flat out shoot it from deep. His biggest thing is physically
he has got to put on more weight and get stronger. But in time he is going to
be a tremendous player for us.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about -- because for four years Bryan Davis upfront as
kind of a stabilizing influence. How do you see the guys upfront kind of
filling that role that Bryan had for you guys?  
COACH TURGEON: Bryan had a great career and had a great senior year. We will
do it by committee. We went out and signed four 6' 8" or taller players last
year. Three made it to campus. I see David Loubeau, much improved player.  
Ray Turner really came on last year. Ray has gotten a lot better. I see him
being a lot like Bryan. I think that Bryan -- Bryan was such an intelligent
player on top of it, especially on the defensive end. And then you had
Kourtney, 6' 9", 245 and you have Keith Davis, 6' 10", we got some pretty good
size. We have great length at the guard with Khris Middleton about 6' 8 1/2".
Naji about 6' 5". I think we will do it by committee.  
We could put Bryan on a guy and say, Shut him down, and Bryan could do it and
not foul. These young kids probably won't be able to do that without fouling
for a while, but we will do it by committee.  
I like our inside presence. I think it has a chance to be pretty good. I think
it is definitely a Big 12 presence, and we will get better as the year goes
on.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about B.J. Holmes and how he's developed for you over
these years. He seems like a guy that has been there for a long time and just
every year it gets a little bit better.  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah, he has. That's what players need to do. You know, I have
said this many times to local media. When I first started coaching B.J., I
wasn't sure he was big enough to play in the Big 12 and obviously he has
proven me wrong.  
Made the biggest improvement from his freshman to sophomore year and made a
lot of big shots for us. Now, I didn't think he could play point guard when he
first came into our program. Now he plays two positions. B.J. is a security
blanket for us. He is always in the right spot. He is always doing the right
thing and understands how to play. So the kid -- he is 5' 10" and he's not
overly fast and athletic. He has had a great career. He's real smart.  
He has gotten so much better defensively. He has always been a great team
defender, but he has become a better individual defender. We played in this
building last year and Dash was hurt and he had to guard Sherron and did a
great job for 30 minutes until we made Sherron mad and he made a few shots. A
lot of those weren't on B.J. It was in transition and different things.  
He has become a much better defender. He is just a great kid, fun to be
around. I think he is going to be a great coach some day.  
  
Q. When you reset in terms of talent as much as you did this offseason and
also leadership, do you sort of reset expectations going into the year and
what are your expectations going into the season?  
COACH TURGEON: Well, yeah, I think you kind of reset every year. Personally
our expectation is to be really good again. I think we have built a program
that has been really consistent. We won a lot of games every year and we
expect to do it again this year. We have talent. It is just bringing it all
together. We will be a little bit different than last year's team. We will be
a little bit longer, a little bit taller.  
But, no, our expectations are to be good. We realize there are good teams in
our league, but we expect to have another great year. We expect to be a part
of the NCAA tournament and hopefully go a little further than we did last
year.  
  
Q. You mentioned David Loubeau who probably improved from start to finish
last year as much as anybody in the league. Where do you see his game going
now?  
COACH TURGEON: It continues to get better. He was just dominant in practice
yesterday. His game is expanding. We are trying to get him to shoot more jump
shots, make it harder for us to be guarded. Even stretch it out to the three-
point line. He is one of our better shooters, which sounds crazy because he is
so good on the low block.  
But he has improved a lot. He really worked on his body this summer,
stretching. He is more athletic, stronger, and he is just a tremendous scorer
and left, right hand, 15 feet, even stretch it to three.  
And he made the most improvement defensively and will challenge defensively.
His biggest problem when he got here is he couldn't guard the post or he
couldn't guard a perimeter guy. Now I think he can guard both. Just great,
great improvement. We are expecting David to -- if not, he should be our best
player this year.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2010

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Bill Self from Kansas. Coach, welcome. Your thoughts about
the upcoming season.  
COACH SELF: Good morning. You guys are probably worn out by now. But I'm
excited. I don't think that very often you lose two lottery picks and your
best player and you are supposed to get better.  
But based on what I have seen so far and how hard they work in the offseason,
I think this team has a chance to be very good. We're athletic, we are not as
deep as what we have been, especially inside. But we do have a team that I
think can make plays you can't coach. I'm certainly looking forward to getting
a chance to work with them. And hopefully by conference play, we can be a team
that people have to contend with.  
  
Q. I have a two-part question. First of all, what are your thoughts on the
whole Josh Selby situation? And, also, how are you and your team dealing with
that distraction?  
COACH SELF: It hasn't been a distraction for our team. He has practiced every
day. He is involved every day. He does the same thing everybody else does
every day. So it hasn't been a distraction.  
Now, from the coaching staff's standpoint, we're going to have to see how we
are going to approach things as we learn more information. But the thing about
the Josh thing to me, it is unique. And it is a situation that we knew that we
were going to be dealing with.  
It hasn't come as a shock to us. I do believe that we're hopefully going to
have some answers sooner rather than later, but I'm still confident that he'll
be in uniform. I hope that to be the case.  
And if the NCAA deems differently, then, you know -- or if there is any type
of penalties at all, then we'll certainly deal with that and work with it. But
he is a terrific talent and he wants to be in school and he is doing great in
school. He has totally bought into what we are trying to do. He has been
nothing but an asset since he has been there.  
  
Q. With Cole Aldrich and Xavier Henry gone, what do you think of Marcus
Morris' outlook?  
COACH SELF: We had a guy named Sherron Collins who was pretty good, too. To me
Marcus was our most consistent player last year. If -- he may not have been
our best player in every game, but he was probably our second or third best
player at worst in most every game. He is consistent.  
I think it will be different because the target will be on him more so and he
will be the defense's number one option to stop, whereas in the past he
probably had the luxury of defenses keying in on somebody else. He is ready.
He is ready. He is prepared. He has worked hard. And he is poised, in my
opinion, to have a big, big junior year.  
  
Q. Who do you see as stepping in to fill the team leadership that Cole and
Sherron provided?  
COACH SELF: You know, I would think the twins, I would think Tyshawn, Brady,
Tyrel, Mario Little, you could say the whole team. I don't think we have one
guy that you will say is definitely the guy. But in '08 when we had that great
team, everybody asked all along who our leader was and we never gave a
definitive answer. It was just kind of a collection of guys.  
I think we will have to do it more by committee this year, which I'm fine
with. The guys are holding each other accountable. I think it remains to be
seen who will be that guy on the floor. Marcus will probably be as much as
anybody else because basically he can play anywhere on the floor.  
  
Q. There is a lot of unsold tickets, I understand, at Allen Fieldhouse. Do
you think they will eventually get sold? If they don't, how different would
that place be without a sellout every night?  
COACH SELF: It will be sold out. The games will be sold out. From what I
understand, it will be season tickets -- there are still season tickets
remaining, for a lot of reasons, from what I understand. But when you say "a
lot," you are talking about -- I don't know if it is 5% or 7% or something
like that. But the tickets will be sold individual game no matter what.  
It has been our goal each and every year, Doug, to sell out season tickets
before the season even begins, with just limited tickets on a game-by-game
basis after that. I don't see any problems in us selling those tickets game by
game.  
I do think it is something we have always sold from a recruiting standpoint. I
don't believe Kansas has played for less than a sellout since 2001. You may
know better than me. 2002? I think there was one or two games. But it also is
a reality of the economic times and we've had some things going on that I
really believe it will get done.  
But, you know, whether or not the season is sold out or not, I don't know if
that will be the case. We will just have to wait and see.  
  
Q. What kind of impact do you see from having Mario back? I guess Travis
Releford as well.  
COACH SELF: Those guys really benefitted last year by not playing. It is one
of those situations. They probably could have both been in our top eight or
nine last year. But they have a chance to impact the program in a much bigger
way than that.  
And so Mario can score and Travis is a legitimate big-time college defender
and he can steal extra possessions.  
They're different. Mario is probably a three-four, kind of a bad matchup big
guy or a big guard. And Travis is definitely a tall guard. But I see them both
being in our rotation and both having an impact.  
  
Q. Over his career, Tyshawn Taylor has been up and down. What are you
expecting him to do for your team this year?  
COACH SELF: Be up. (Smiling.)  
You say "over his career," his freshman year he was on an uptick all year.
Last year he had some big games, but he wasn't as consistent. I don't know
this to be a fact, but I believe last year he had quite a few more stints than
he had as a freshman year and far less turnovers, just expectations were off
the charts for him.  
And I believe that he's really prepared to have a big year. He is a very
talented young man. He just doesn't need to deal with any distractions. None
of us do. And, certainly, he's worked very hard to make this a special year
for himself.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2010

  

### [Doc Sadler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15826)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Nebraska Coach Doc Sadler. Coach, welcome.
And your thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH SADLER: Thanks, Peter. First of all, I think a year makes a lot of
difference. And just in my voice from a year ago, I hope you can hear me a
little bit better than you did last year.  
You know, this team that we have, I think, has a chance to be as good a
basketball team as we've had since I have been in Nebraska. For the first time
I think we've got good perimeter players with some inside guys at the same
time with some experience.  
Last season, you know, we were going in the right direction, I thought, with a
12-3 record going into the Big 12 play and just wasn't able to continue the
momentum that maybe we had built for whatever reason.  
I think the biggest reason probably was the league in itself because the games
that we did play, you know, for the most part besides the Texas game, we had a
chance to compete in most of them. And the experience that the guys we have on
our team now got a chance to get last season is going to really benefit us,
even though for the most part we're still a young basketball team.  
The two guys that we lost last year, Toney McCray and Christopher Niemann,
have a chance, you know. The good news is they have a chance now to play for
us and the three other guys that we've added, Andre Almeida, Caleb Walker, and
Kamyron Brown are some pieces that I think fit into what we are trying to do
now.  
So for the most part, we have got the one senior that has played before and
that's Lance Jeter. He has put in a lot of minutes as a newcomer at the point
guard position. It's going to definitely benefit from that.  
And overall, there is no question that, you know, the league in itself is
going to be just like it always is, but hopefully we are going to be able to
be a big -- maybe a bigger part in what happens down the road in January and
February.  
So I'm looking very much forward to it and really like the team that we have.  
  
Q. Will this team still hang its hat on defense, but maybe have to rely less
on that to be successful than some of your teams in the past?  
COACH SADLER: Well, I hope, Mike, that it will look a little bit different
probably because, you know, with a small team, it looks like you are probably
playing harder than maybe you are playing, which in the past that's been the
case.  
I hope this team plays just as hard as any of the teams I have ever coached.
But it may not look that way because we are much bigger. But it does change
some things up the way you can play. I mean, you know, in the past, guys could
catch that ball on the wing or whatever and drive in and not really be
concerned about getting a body put on them that may make them think about
coming back in there.  
So, sure, we want to force things in there. When people do come in there now,
I think we are big enough to make them remember when they do come in. So that
part of it is going to be a little bit different.  
So we will be able to stay out with shooters a little bit more than having to
help on dribble penetration because of the size inside, making guards finish
over us. So hopefully that will help us a little bit.  
And then, you know, defensively, the whole game starts with the rebounding end
and with you being a much bigger team, maybe that's going to allow us maybe to
get out on the offense a little bit better, too.  
  
Q. Brandon Ubel, does he fit in your plans this year?  
COACH SADLER: Most definitely.  
  
Q. Can you talk about his prospects.  
COACH SADLER: Brandon is probably one of the most consistent people I have
ever coached, from being a manager at Arkansas in the '80s to all this time.
"Consistent" meaning everything he does is right, whether it be on, off the
court, and he has improved in his athleticism the year that he spent here.  
But he definitely figures to be a big, big part of what we do. He is going to
be a guy that maybe a lot of people don't talk about, but he is a huge part of
the success we're going to enjoy the next three years that he's at Nebraska.  
  
Q. What's he bringing in?  
COACH SADLER: Just the consistency of doing everything right. You know if it
is an 8:00 class and you get back from a road trip at 2:00 in the morning, he
will be there. You don't have to be concerned about him speaking one word but
doing another. And guys follow that. And he's not a vocal leader as some
people would say, but he is definitely a leader on that basketball team that
everybody respects.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk a little bit about Andre, as someone who is coming
in to your program from the junior college game, is he someone you are going
to have to bring along kind of slowly? Or because he has got those two years
of experience, is he going to be someone who can hit the ground running and
help you right away?  
COACH SADLER: First of all, speaking a little bit about a dude that's big --
that's that big is hard. You know, I think foreign kids play so much more
basketball than kids over here. And the level of play that they play against
maybe sometimes is, you know, against more experience.  
So you are not talking about your typical junior college transfer. You are
talking about a guy that has had some experiences on world teams and things
like that. The biggest thing that Andre has to overcome is the sickness that
he got this spring where he wasn't able to do anything. But once he gets back
into some type of conditioning that is going to allow him to play in the
league like we are playing in, then it is not going to be experience or
anything like that, that's going to keep him back. It is just going to be the
conditioning part.  
  
Q. Lance Jeter really did it all for you last year. Can you talk a little
bit about what he brings to your team and also how his role is either going to
grow or change this season.  
COACH SADLER: I think most of you all that have followed Big 12 basketball
understand how difficult it is to play in this league, more or less be a point
guard in this league and especially one that his first year has put that much
responsibility on. All of the players think they are ready for it, but, you
know, I think it took a toll on him late in the year.  
Now that he was put in the position really where he didn't have a backup for
him and he was put in a position where he had to come every night, and for the
most part he did do that, he's got himself in tremendous shape, probably the
best shape he has ever been in. You know, if you look at Lance's statistics in
the first 12 games, the turnovers were really low. The last four or five, they
kind of went up a little bit.  
I think he is just going to be more ready for that, and there is no question
to have any chance in this league, you have got to have somebody out there
with that ball that has been through it. And now he has been through it.  
  
Q. Your school's last year in the Big 12. What kind of reception do you
think you will get when you play for the last time in Lawrence and Manhattan
and Columbia, places where Iowa State has played for 100 years?  
COACH SADLER: I think in most situations when a coach retires, they give him
nice gifts. So I would expect to get a nice gift everywhere we go. And if not,
then maybe they are just going to give us a win. But I want to tell you
something, I don't think there is a league in the country that is as good as
this one as far as going on the road, being treated with respect.  
Now, it is not always easy to win, don't get me wrong. It is difficult to do
that. But the coaches are tremendous. The fans get into it like no other
league. I will expect they will get into it like no other league again this
year when we come in there.  
But it is fun, it is fun. To me it is going to be exciting, not because it is
the last year that we are going to be playing in this league, I think as a
coach, growing up, you dream of getting a chance to coach in a league like
this. And then when you have the fans and the coaches and everything,
administrators as classy as you think they would be, it's just fun. That part
-- I will be worried a lot more about the teams than I am all that other
stuff.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2010

  

### [Frank Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17664)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Kansas State Coach Frank Martin. Coach,
welcome. And your opening comments.  
COACH MARTIN: Just great to be here. Excited to know where I'm at every single
day at 3:30 in the afternoon for once, just around our players, our team and
doing my job of trying to get our guys better to compete in another crazy Big
12 season. That's what it's all about.  
We're excited. We've made progress every year we've been there, and we look
forward to trying to do the same this year.  
  
Q. Tell us about the new guys you got on the team this year.  
COACH MARTIN: Well, the first one -- I'll start with who is the oldest one of
the crew, which is Fred Asprilla. Freddy, he is a grown man. He has played
college basketball before at the Division I level and he understands a lot of
things about the game at the collegiate level. And he gives us something that
we haven't had offensively. If he can learn to defend like Colon did for us
and play with the nonstop energy Luis played for us, then he can become a heck
of a player, because offensively he's real good.  
We need him to learn the other side of the floor and nonstop, relentless
attack we ask our players to have.  
Shane Southwell, Nino Williams, two athletic, long perimeter guys who just --
I'm extremely pleased with right now. I couldn't be happier with those two
kids, where they are at after six practices.  
And then Will Spradling. Will just -- you can tell that he was raised by a
father who was a coach, understands. When you explain things to him, he picks
them up. He has an understanding for the game and absolutely shoots the cover
off the ball. So those guys, we are excited about them.  
  
Q. Fred has been away from the four-year level for a couple years. How is he
doing in terms of making the transition from being in a junior college
environment back to a four-year school environment?  
COACH MARTIN: I think it's been easier for him because he experienced a four-
year environment before the junior college environment. So it made him thirsty
to get back to Division I basketball. But he has been great. He's lost
somewhere in the vicinity of 55 to 57 pounds, depends what time of the day
it's at. But since he got on campus back in June, I mean, he looks completely
different. He is definitely working his way into someone that should be able
to help our basketball team this year.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about handling the expectations, picked
first in the league, Jacob is conference player of the year.  
COACH MARTIN: I think that's what anyone that has pride works toward, is to
try to be good. I don't like working to hide behind doors. I mean, if we are
going to do this, let's do it right.  
And Jacob has been unbelievable in the commitment he has made to grow as a
human being, as a player, to lead our program. He's embraced that -- a lot of
players won't embrace those responsibilities. They don't want to work to take
a chance to be special because you can't guarantee people that you are going
to succeed if you work. But Jacob was willing to take that chance. And he has
worked, understanding that there is no guarantee for a reward at the end of
the day.  
And we're still not there. I mean, all the preseason stuff is great,
especially when it comes from the coaches that you compete against. That means
that the people that you have to go beat respect your players and the way they
play where they vote you number 1. They don't do that because you are a nice
guy. So that's a compliment to our kids.  
But, still, we got a ways to go before any of that can become reality.  
  
Q. How would you describe your coaching style/philosophy?  
COACH MARTIN: I don't know. Probably fun for you to watch. I don't know. I try
to teach kids, and I demand that people maximize who they are. I don't accept
people not striving to be the best that they can be. That's kind of what I
have been doing my whole life. I just -- I don't accept people doing less than
what they are capable of. And I demand that they maximize who they can be so
they can take advantage of every opportunity that comes their way the rest of
their life.  
So I think a lot of people make the mistake that they put the wagon ahead of
the horse. What do I mean by that? Well, that you put all the importance on
winning "the" game. It is all about winning, but the importance should be on
all the things that happen before the game, you know, all the experiences, the
conversations, the practice time, the preparation, the weight room sessions,
everything that takes place before the game, that's where you put in the time.  
You either prepare to go win that game or you don't, we will try and win. We
don't line up to just have fun. We line up to win. But I just know this,
winning is a heck of a lot more fun than losing. So I'd rather do the work and
take a chance to win.  
  
Q. I know that you preached all last season and talked to your players about
how tough it is to make a run in the NCAA tournament. Curious to see how the
expectations match what you thought it was going to be like in getting to the
Elite 8 and maybe what you guys learned along the way.  
COACH MARTIN: You line up and you win your first game and then you are down
10-0 at the 17-minute mark of your second game, it kind of makes you
understand that there's not a free minute in the NCAA tournament.  
So, the difference between the NCAA tournament and the rest of the season is
that when you are in that tournament, everyone is good. There's not a free
pass in that tournament.  
Number two, every team that is good there understands that the next time they
don't succeed, their year is over. So everyone is more willing to play every
possession of the game. So you don't have free possessions because no one
wants their season to end.  
So if you don't play at your best every game, you are not going to win. That's
what makes it so hard to make a run in that tournament.  
When you watch the people that win in that tournament every year -- and I'm
talking about the teams with different players -- that's what is so
impressive, that they can continue to go in that tournament, continue to win
because it is so hard to win once you get in that thing.  
  
Q. Just talk about how you have seen Curt grow since he has joined your
program from UConn, both in his body and physically.  
COACH MARTIN: First of all, when we decided to recruit him and offer him a
scholarship, the thing that was refreshing is that he never once blamed UConn
or anyone else for his lack of success there. He accepted every bit of
responsibility for him not having success there, and that was refreshing to
me. That give me the belief that he has been humbled and now he was looking to
do better.  
And then since he has been on campus, he has been great. I mean, he has got a
college degree. I mean, he got a college degree last June. If you would have
asked anyone if he had ever -- when he entered school as a freshman that he
would have a college degree in four years, they would say that's not
happening. He went out and had a heck of a year for us.  
Everyone talks that we were a one-dimensional team, that we were the two
little guys shooting every three. Truth be told, Curt gave us an unbelievable
presence at the rim, that as he continued to feel comfortable with who he was
and continued to mature and understand what we wanted, you know, set a school
record in blocked shots, shot a high percentage from the field, rebounded over
six a game. He has got to do that better. But given the inconsistencies early
in the year, that's not that bad of a number.  
But I couldn't be prouder. I couldn't be prouder. Now he has got a big
responsibility on his shoulders now. He has got to be a leader for this team.
He has got to embrace that, and he has got to go do it every day. We can't
have the inconsistencies from him that we had early last year and expect to be
good. He has got to be good from day one.  
  
Q. I wanted to talk to you about, what is the feeling like -- how different
is it from maybe a few years ago around Kansas State right now? And how are
your players adjusting to that?  
COACH MARTIN: I don't -- I think it is the same. I remember the first day I
was on campus. I was eating dinner, Coach Huggins, myself, Dalonte Hill, who
had just flown in to accept the job, we were at a restaurant in Aggieville and
there was a herd of people standing outside taking pictures of the restaurant.
And the first time we went out for Midnight Madness, we were finishing up our
first practice ever at K-State and they opened them doors and then, I mean,
10,000 people body surfing down the bleachers to get to the front row and it
hasn't stopped since.  
Our fans have been phenomenal. And that's why you have seen the bond that you
see between our fans and players. It has been great. And it gets back to what
I have said. On the outside, people might think we weren't going to be any
good or whatever it may be, which is fine. We understand that's part of it.
But internally, our people have believed in us from day one and that makes it
a whole lot of fun.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2010

  

### [Pat Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18927)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Coach Pat Knight from Texas Tech University.
Coach, welcome. And your thoughts.  
COACH KNIGHT: You know, my thoughts for this season, obviously it is going to
be the best team I've had, being my third year at Texas Tech. I really think
it could be one of the better teams that we've had in the ten years since I
have been there.  
Six seniors, three of them this will be their fourth year, and actually have a
year underneath my father. I couldn't ask for a better situation as a coach,
just having leadership like that. It is going to be the most athletic team
we've had since we have been there in ten years.  
I expect a lot out of this team. I know this being my third year, to me this
is either get an extension or get fired type of year. It doesn't matter if you
are a coach or a business. Any time you are the head of something and it is
your third year, you know, by that time you have the type of players you need,
they know what you want from an offensive and defensive situation, it is a big
year for me also.  
We are looking forward to it. I couldn't ask for a better group of kids,
especially having three of my seniors, John, Mike, and D'walyn, who I really
consider all-conference caliber kids, we really have everything we need right
now to be successful.  
  
Q. Pat, I know a big deal was made last year of your sideline attire. I'm
wondering if you bought the jacket and button-down shirts for today's event?  
COACH KNIGHT: Coach Tuberville took me out and wanted to work on my dress. So
he took me shopping for some suits so I could look a little more appropriate
at the press conferences.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difference when you have D'walyn on the court and
when you don't?  
COACH KNIGHT: It is a big difference. As a coach, I don't like to talk about
injuries, but I thought it really affected us last year when he couldn't play
100%. He played a lot of games pretty much at 50%.  
He is a kid that, I think, from a defensive standpoint when it comes to
rebounding or shot blocking has as much effect as a kid like Udoh did last
year for Baylor. His huge force last year really not to have him for a lot of
the Big 12.  
I'm excited this year. We figured out really what's wrong with his foot, and
this is the most pain-free he has been. He feels really good right now. I will
have to watch it and make sure from a practice situation, if he needs rest --
because I really think that he's a key that nobody talks about. He is really
important to our team, does a lot of things that don't show up on the stat
sheet or people, you know, people really don't talk about from a news
standpoint.  
If we can keep him healthy, a lot of good things can happen.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Robert Lewandowski and how he has progressed and what
do you expect out of him this year?  
COACH KNIGHT: He digressed last year, which was disappointing. He had a great
freshman year, started for us almost every game and averaged six points. After
his freshman year, you know, we really thought, we have a kid that has a
chance to be all-conference when it is all said and done.  
But then last year -- and I really think it was mental. He had the sophomore
slump and didn't play a whole lot for us last year. If you look at his
numbers, they were down. I think he might have averaged maybe one or two
points.  
But the kid is coachable. You can get on him and he has really turned things
around. I think we figured out some things that were wrong with him from a
mental standpoint that were bothering him, and he has had a great spring.
Right now is my starting center. And I look for him to carry on what he did
his freshman year.  
If we get the Robert we had freshman year, we will have an inside presence. He
has a Big 12 body, 6' 10", 250, really nice soft touch, soft hands but he's a
tough kid. And he knows it. It is not like I had to bring him in.  
He came and talked to me about why he thought he didn't play as well as he did
his freshman year. It is not a kid that doesn't know what's going on.  
He is probably the smartest player I have on my team, not just from
basketball, but book-wise. To me, I always kid him, he needs to take
basketball serious because he is always going to have a job. He will end up
being like Bill Bradley. He makes him -- being like a Senator. He is that type
of kid. I would like him to be tougher and meaner on the court and get
something out of basketball before he decides to make a better living than I
am.  
And so -- but I expect good things. I think we got him turned around. You
expect that. A kid's sophomore year playing in the Big 12, especially a big
kid that gets beat on, that's probably the toughest position in our league,
being a big guy. He just had a down year. I really expect him to get back to
where he was his junior and senior -- for his junior and senior year like he
was as a freshman.  
  
Q. Pat, you mentioned everything you like about this team. I guess what's
your biggest concern right now going into this season? Where would you like to
see this team improve or where do you think it has to improve?  
COACH KNIGHT: Defense. We have been last in the league in defense the last two
years and rebounding, even though we improved last year, my second year, it
wasn't enough. You have got to defend. You know, it is really ball pressure.
We call it the blue line. We tape off a blue line down the middle of the
court, so we got to be helped by the blue line. If someone drives, there is
three or four bodies there, make a wall, have them kick it out and rebound it.  
So if we defend, I think really good things can happen. If we don't, it is
going to be a long year. In the preseason, you can get some shootouts with
some teams and blow them out. But that's just because of the caliber of team
you're playing in the preseason.  
You can't do that in the Big 12. You got to realize as a player, you know, it
is kind of like -- if we get in a shootout with Kansas or Texas, it is like
the O.K. Corral, we won't be Wyatt Earp. We will be the guys killed on the
other end.  
We have got to get stops. And we can score. The great thing about the motion
offense, you can run it badly and still score enough points. You have got to
get spots. But you also need game management and realize when you need to slow
it down and not take a bad shot.  
So defense we have been preaching since the spring and hopefully, you know, we
will see if these guys get it. Actually, the media has helped me a little bit,
the magazines that come out have talked about if we do defend, you know, we
have a chance to really move up in this league. So that helped me because they
get tired of me saying it. So they all read those magazines. So for once, I
can say, you know, you never heard this -- probably never thought you would
hear this from a Knight, but the media has actually helped me in my coaching
this year.  
It will come down to defense. If we defend, I think we are going to be okay.  
  
Q. John Roberson has played such a big role for you guys the last three
years, but nationally he is in the top 50 list. And in the preseason he
doesn't appear on there despite his great statistics. How does he rank or
compare, I guess, to other guards or good guards around the country in your
opinion?  
COACH KNIGHT: I think he has got to be in the top ten guards. I think Mike
Singletary has to be in the top ten small 4s. That's also our fault. If we
would have had a little better year last year -- really, the three-week
stretch killed us when we lost seven in a row. That's actually the time when
the voting came out for the All Big 12 team. If we win a couple more of those
games, I think you see John and Mike's name on more ballots and they are all-
conference.  
To me, they are all-conference-caliber players. And I think other coaches
would tell you that who play against them. It is just from our standpoint, it
was just bad that we had that three-week period. But I think people are going
to get to know them this year. It is their senior year.  
From a coaching standpoint, I think in the nation, they have got to be listed
in the top 10 or top 15 in the nation. I just -- not our league, but the
nation. We get overlooked sometimes. It is tough, you know, our location, we
have one newspaper. And so I think it would be a little different maybe if we
were in the Dallas area because it is all media. It is all hype.  
A lot of these kids, there are a lot of kids on that list that can play. But
they're in a situation at a school that's a glamour school when it comes to
the media. But it is something we have to overcome. If we have a good season,
they will get noticed.  
So I talk to them about that, don't worry about that. If you win, people will
take notice of you.  
  
Q. What kind of sanctions are you going to face from your dad for giving the
media credit for what you did?  
COACH KNIGHT: He's one of you guys now, and so, I mean, he can't say anything.
That's what he's become. So it is in my family now, so he should be happy. I'm
actually kind of giving him a compliment.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2010

  

### [Fred Hoiberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21399)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Coach Fred Hoiberg from Iowa State. Coach,
welcome to the Big 12. And your opening comments?  
COACH HOIBERG: Thank you very much. Let me just, first of all, say I'm honored
to be here at my first media day in the Big 12 conference.  
Little bit about what's going on with our program right now. We have had a
very good first week of practice. Going all the way back to September 1st when
we had our groups of four, guys came in with the right work ethic. And they
came in with the right mentality, and that was the big thing for me, was to
see an effort that first week with the guys and they showed that.  
Once we started working with the team, once September 15th hit for the two
hours a week, we started implementing our philosophies both offensively and
defensively. And I'm excited about what I have seen. You know, when October
15th hit, we were a little bit ahead because of everything we have put in in
that previous month.  
With the seniors that we have, with Diante Garrett who I anticipate having a
breakout year for us, the ball will be in his hands a lot. A lot of ball
screens for Diante. If he shoots the ball so far like he has in the preseason,
he has a chance to do a lot of great things here.  
Jamie Vanderbeken, who is here for us this year, is shooting the heck out of
the ball right now. I think that was a tough loss for Iowa State when he got
hurt, when Lucca Staiger left. Everybody was able to double down on Craig
Brackins. With Jamie back, it opens up the floor for you. Any time you have a
6' 10" guy that can shoot the ball and space it like he can, it is a heck of a
luxury to have.  
Scott Christopherson, he was actually out right now with a back injury. He
should be back for his first practice on Friday. He is another floor spacer
that has experience in the Big 12. After he got healthy last year, after a
midseason bout with mono, finished the season very well. And I'm excited about
that.  
So we are going to get up and down the floor this year. That's what Hilton
magic is all about, trying to get it back to -- when I was playing back in the
early '90s when Johnny Orr took over the program back in the early '80s and
got the program on the map, I have been talking to Coach Orr about how he
implemented his philosophies that first year, even if he might not have had
the personnel to get it going his way.  
That's what we are trying to do. We want to play an exciting fast style of
basketball. We don't have a lot of bodies this year, with only ten players
right now. We are still waiting to hear on Royce White, a player that we got
as a transfer from the University of Minnesota. We should hopefully hear back
in the next couple of weeks. It is out of our hands right now. We just don't
know what direction that is going to go.  
But I'm excited about the future of Iowa State. We have got a lot of transfer
with Chris Allen from Michigan State. Like I said, Royce White from Minnesota,
two top 30 players in their classes. Anthony Booker from Southern Illinois was
a top 50 players out of the St. Louis area. And Chris Babb, who was one of the
top shooters in the Big Ten conference the previous year, who averaged double
figures.  
I like the future. I like the direction we're heading. This year, we are
picked last by every coach in the Big 12 and we talked about that. We put it
up on the board. And these guys will go out and play with a chip on their
shoulder and try to prove some people wrong.  
  
Q. Can you kind of elaborate a little more on just the whole challenge of
coming home and your arena flooded and just the loss of personnel. Can you
just talk about everything that you have to encounter.  
COACH HOIBERG: It was certainly an interesting first couple of weeks. The
first thing that we dealt with was all the conference realignment talk. It was
a stressful time. I think Dan Beebe deserves a lot of credit for how that
whole thing went down and how everything ended up.  
I think it makes us the toughest conference in the country. I think it is
right now as well. But with our schedule, the way it is going to be, with 18
league games against the toughest teams in the country, it is going to be a
battle every single year going up against that. It is what you want. You want
to go out and compete against the best and get a high RPI, prepare yourself
for the post-season which is what our goal will be every year.  
After that, Hilton Coliseum floods. It flooded back in '93 when I was playing
at Iowa State. And it was -- I would wake up at 3:00 in the morning and see a
purple blob all the way back to Lincoln, Nebraska, and we had about five
straight nights of that. Hilton is scheduled to open up for our first
exhibition game on November 5th.  
FEMA is involved right now. So I don't know how that whole thing works.
Hopefully that will stay on track and we will be back in that arena right
away.  
  
Q. You said you talked to Coach Orr. What advice have you been getting? What
have you learned?  
COACH HOIBERG: I talked to a lot of people when I first got this job. Tim
Floyd is somebody else I have talked to a lot and leaned on. Have a very close
relationship with Coach Floyd, who coached me my senior year and played with
us for two seasons with the Chicago Bulls. Everybody that I have talked to
that has experience in the coaching world, even going to my NBA days, it is a
very close-knit community in the NBA and we are watching games with scouts
every night who are former college coaches. I made a lot of calls. The first
thing they said to me is I have to assemble a staff that has great chemistry
and try to hire people that are smarter than you.  
And the first guy that I went after was Bobby Lutz who was the head coach at
the University of Charlotte in the last 12 years. He was in the post-season
eight times and got fired after winning 19 games last year. He is a heck of an
addition to our staff.  
Big-time coach, very creative. Very similar philosophies. His teams always
played fast. 11 of the 12 years in Charlotte he had the leading three-point
shooter in the conference. That's a pretty good conference, Conference USA and
Atlantic 10 the last few years. That was the big thing first in talking to
people. Coach Orr, Coach Floyd, Gar Forman, who was the general manager of the
Bulls, was on staff at Iowa State. That was the big thing. Getting the right
staff around you.  
And then they talked to me about the ins and outs of recruiting. It is not
that dissimilar to what I have been doing the last five years in the NBA, you
know, as far as going out and watching games and bringing kids in and
interviewing and talking about free agency. It is a lot of those same things,
trying to get in close with the kids and talking about what your program has
to offer.  
Like I said, I think we've done a pretty good job so far with that as far as
the talent that we brought in for the future of Iowa State basketball.  
  
Q. With Jamie back from injury, will he factor in as a leader on the
court?  
COACH HOIBERG: Jamie has been a tremendous leader for us, both he and Diante.
I think those will be two guys that will provide a lot of leadership. Darion
Anderson from Northern Illinois will provide that as a senior who transferred
in, has one year left. He graduated and we got him in a graduate program that
wasn't offered at Northern Illinois. So those three guys I will be leaning on
a lot.  
You talk about successful teams you play on, you know, they can discipline
themselves a lot of times. And I'm going to lean on those seniors to do that.
When we are not in the locker room, they have to pull the guys together and
make them believe in the system we're running that it will lead to success.  
But Jamie is -- he is down to what he weighed in high school. He is down to
240. He is getting up and down the floor, really running well. If you have a
big guy that's 6' 11" that can space the floor and shoot it like to that,
that's tough to guard. Those bigs aren't used to coming out and guarding guys
than can shoot it like that on the perimeter.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2010

  

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: Coach Travis Ford, Oklahoma State. Coach, welcome.  
COACH FORD: Good, thank you. Just seems like we were here just the other day.
Great to be back. How quickly time flies.  
Little bit about our basketball team. We're a very inexperienced basketball
team. Not necessarily young, even though we do have probably over 65% of our
team are sophomores or below, freshmen or sophomore, but very inexperienced.
Even our upperclassmen are inexperienced. Our most experienced player is
Keiton Page, a junior, as far as playing the most minutes. This is a team that
needs to earn its stripes very, very quickly. I think our schedule will do
that for us.  
We have got a very, very tough early schedule when we go to Anaheim in the
Phillips 66 tournament with a very tough field and with some other games,
Alabama, Stanford, Tulsa. This team is going to be tested, but it needs it.  
Our won-loss record may not be great, but it needs the tough games early to
get these guys experience. Because our basketball team, we lose quite a bit of
our scoring when you lose almost 40 points a game, close to 40 points a game
when you lose James Anderson and Obi Muonelo, the top two scorers. I think we
can replace the score and I think we can do it by committee.  
We don't have a 20-point game scorer on our basketball team. We have some guys
that get 20 points a game. Whether it be Marshall Moses, we have some guys who
can put the ball in the hole. We don't have that one guy we have been able to
rely on in the past couple years, kind of that X factor when things aren't
going well, can just create his own shot. But I think by committee we can make
up for some of those points that we have lost.  
But the inexperience is a concern for our basketball team. We have some guys
who we're expecting to play a lot of minutes, make an impact that haven't
played at this level. And that's a concern. You look at some of the newcomers
who are going to make an impact. JP Olukemi, Darrell Williams inside, these
are two guys who will play a lot of minutes for us who we are trying to get
them at this point to understand how difficult it is to play at this level,
how hard you have to play every day.  
I think we have improved our team physically in a lot of areas. We have
improved our team athletically. It is the most athletic team I have had since
I have been at Oklahoma State.  
We should be deeper and have more depth, if everybody stays healthy and if
everybody does what they are supposed to be doing and everybody is ready to
go. We should have more depth. But, again, it is just -- it is inexperience.
And the physical part we have, it is the mental part, the mental comes from
inexperience. Going through a week of practice already, we just got to get
mentally stronger. Some of these guys don't understand how hard you have to
play at this level and how difficult it is. So that's been a challenge for us
so far.  
Luckily we have got returners like Keiton Page who has great experience,
Marshall Moses who is a senior but has been inconsistent throughout his
career. And we need him to be more consistent if we're going to have a chance
to be successful.  
Thus far, through the preseason and through the first week of practice,
Marshall seems to be very motivated to have a great senior year. We just hope
it can continue and he stays focused because Marshall can really make an
impact in this league and within our schedule.  
Nick Sidorakis is somebody who hasn't played a lot of minutes in his career at
Oklahoma State, but is playing great basketball right now and brings us great
leadership within our basketball team. And, again, another senior, Matt
Pilgrim, who is more or less an inexperienced player, we need him to stay
focused and be ready to go.  
So, you know, again, a team that is going to rely a lot on inexperienced
players, but the backbone is going to be from some seniors that you will see
here today, Keiton Page, Marshall Moses, and Nick Sidorakis. We just have to
grow up very quickly.  
I like the makeup of our team. Our young kids have been extremely impressive
in practice this week. It is one of the big bright spots. Our young kids have
been very impressive. I am very excited about that.  
I think we just need to rely a little bit more on our athleticism this year. I
think one of the strengths of this basketball team should be its defense. We
should be a much better defensive team than we have been the past couple
years, especially when you looked at the statistical categories, we should be
able to improve hopefully in some of those stats to make us a better
basketball team.  
  
Q. Given the situation that you face, how much does it help having two,
three guys who can handle the ball out front to help you make those steps?  
COACH FORD: Well, you know, it helps that, you know, Fred Gulley got some
valuable experience last year as a freshman, when Ray Penn went down, Fred
Gulley became the point guard. Ray Penn who started the first 15, 16, 17
games, whatever it was, had a decent beginning of his freshmen year. But we
are still looking for a lot more from those two guys who will be running the
point guard position for us.  
I like that they are not freshmen anymore, but we are still looking for
consistency. We are still looking for better leadership. And plain and simple,
as I told them, we are looking for them to be point guards, to be true point
guards.  
Our assist-to-turnover ratio has got to improve. It is a must. It will be --
if -- from Fred Gulley, from Ray Penn, if our assist-to-turnover ratio doesn't
improve from last year, it is just unacceptable. It has got to improve for
this team to be any good. Why is that? Because we don't have that one guy who
can go get his own shot, like James Anderson could. James Anderson is not
there anymore. So James camouflaged a lot of our weaknesses as a basketball
team because he could go create his own shot and get some shots off and it
camouflaged some of our struggles at the point guard spot at times last year.  
So with that said, though, even though they are experienced and they are not
freshmen anymore, we need more. That's a big position for us. That's going to
be a huge focal point when you look at that position is going to tell a lot
about our success as a basketball team.  
Right now Ray Penn, Fred Gulley are going at it in practice. If we had to play
tomorrow, I don't know which one I would start. I would probably just flip a
coin at this point. It may even be Fred Gulley because he started last year
and make Ray Penn earn it back maybe.  
We experimented with Keiton up there a little bit and that's still not out of
the picture. It is still not out of the picture. Probably somebody who
understands where everybody needs to be and understands the play, Keiton is
probably the best at that. Also we don't want to take Keiton away from the
past two years and had success in the two-guard spot. We don't want to
distract. We just need more from that point guard position. We need some
production, some high assists, low turnovers and a little bit more scoring
from Ray Penn.  
Fred Gulley won't give us that. Ray might give us that because he has the
ability to put the ball in the hole.  
  
Q. You referred to Marshall as a guy who has been inconsistent. What's your
faith that he will be consistent as a senior?  
COACH FORD: He has got to earn that faith, and he is doing a great job of it
thus far. He is here today which is a good step. I wouldn't have brought him
today if I didn't have trust in him. We have talked a lot about where he was
the second half of his sophomore year. We talked a lot about last year and how
much better we want him to be. He totally understands that. He grasped it.
Marshall is a smart, young man.  
It is all about consistency. Marshall is somebody who plays with incredible
emotions. He's got quite a personality. He just at times has to channel those
emotions. I love his attitude. I love his personality. We just need him to,
again, stay focused on having a great senior year, stay focused on being a
great example for the younger kids in our program because we have some really
talented, good kids, younger kids who can be influenced by him in a very
positive manner.  
Because thus far through preseason workouts, through individual workouts,
through conditioning, through the first week of practice, Marshall has been
probably the leader as far as work ethic, which is a good start. I mean, he
sets the tone, energy-wise, in our practice. He sets the tone just how hard he
has been working.  
Now, can he continue to do it every day? Marshall is going to be judged on
every day. Every day is a new day for him. Just because he has done well the
past week and past two, three months, he's got to show that he can do it on a
consistent basis. But thus far I'm very proud of Marshall and we hope it
continues.  
  
Q. You talk about Marshall being a leader in the preseason and stuff. Do you
see him being a leader on the court? Where do you see him falling there?  
COACH FORD: Yeah, I do see him being a leader on the court because of his
physical presence and his emotions and his personality, can be a great leader
as long as it is channelled in the right way. And we've seen a little bit of
both. We've seen a little bit of both where he has been an incredible positive
influence to our basketball team and been a leader for us, even as an
inexperienced sophomore at the end of his year, he hadn't played many minutes,
but he was quite a physical leader when we made our -- when we went to the
NCAA tournament my first year at Oklahoma State, he had a lot to do with that.  
Where he didn't get any minutes, none at the beginning of the year and then
towards beginning of January, end of December when he started understanding
his role and understanding what made him successful, he grew up very, very
quickly and was obviously a very positive influence to that basketball team.
Last year he was just inconsistent. Very inconsistent and had some
distractions that, you know, kept him from being his best, some distractions
that didn't allow him to be the leader we wanted him to be. Hopefully he has
learned from all those experiences, the good and the bad.  
Now he is a senior. There is no -- so we told him there is no making up for
it. At this point in time, whatever he does this year is what he is going to
be remembered for. That's kind of the approach we've taken with him. Hopefully
he has grown up. He can definitely be a leader on the court because he has the
physical presence, he has the personality. Hopefully he will be playing the
minutes that can cause him to be a leader. And he will get those minutes as
long as he is focused and doing the right things and there is no distractions.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2010

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Baylor coach, Scott Drew. Scott, your
opening comments and thoughts.  
COACH DREW: Well, I think, first of all, there is a lot of pressure on all of
us coaches to begin this season because last year with 113-1 nonconference
record and 63-game winning home streak in the nonconference, I think everybody
wants to get off to a good start and doesn't want to be the team that has that
streak break.  
As far as our team goes, last year we were the second tallest team in the
country behind Kentucky. This year, we love Tweety Carter, he was a great
player, but now that we have lost the 5' 10" guy, I think we might have
Kentucky for the tallest team in the country.  
We really like the team's togetherness. I think we have great chemistry. They
really get along. The big questions obviously this year will be will we have
the same type of leadership and will we stay injury-free.  
As far as a couple players that are returning that a lot of people have asked
about, A.J. Walton, people say: At your guard position will that be a weakness
or a question mark this year? I think A.J. has had a tremendous summer and
done a great job in practice thus far. And Tweety Carter really did a
tremendous job mentoring him and helping prepare him for this year.  
Udoh did the exact same thing with Quincy. I think Quincy has taken a step
forward in the leadership department. Also improved his overall skill level.  
As far as Anthony Jones, he is somebody that's returning and with his new fro,
I think he might be listed at 7' 2". He has gotten bigger and stronger.  
And with another person that's returning that will help with the leadership is
Fred Ellis. He is somebody that went on a mission trip this past summer with
the Baylor University and was in Kenya and I think really grew spiritually and
socially and just matured as far as appreciating what we have in the United
States. I think he is going to be a great leader.  
As far as new guys, Perry Jones is here with us today and he is a very pleased
man because he doesn't have to come up here and speak in front of everybody.
So right now he is very happy. But everyone is going to enjoy watching him
play, very talented young man. Not many things he can't do. He is young for
his age, and he is somebody that when he is 28, he is going to be a much
better basketball player than he is right now. But I think everyone in the Big
12 is going to love watching him play this season.  
J'mison Morgan is a transfer from UCLA, he's from Dallas, South Oak Cliff, won
four state championships there. Highly talented coming out of high school. He
received a waiver to be able to play right away for us. I think those two help
replace the size we lost with Ekpe and with Josh Lomers. As far as the other
two newcomers, Stargell Love and Brady Heslip. Stargell is a guard out of
North Carolina, very athletic. Brady is a transfer from Boston College that
will sit out.  
Last but not least, March 5th is a big day for Baylor University having
College GameDay. I know Baylor Nation is very excited about that. It is also a
big day for the Drew family because my wife is expecting that day. Pressure is
on to make sure we get it done in time for game time.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on everything that's going on with LaceDarius
right now?  
COACH DREW: The only thing I will comment on Lace is what we put out in the
last release, and that is that he is back in school and we are pleased about
that. He is attending practice, but he remains indefinitely suspended as far
as competition goes until further notice. That's all we can comment right now
because it is a legal matter.  
  
Q. How have you tried to handle the PR flip from last spring to now given
certain things that have happened?  
COACH DREW: I think part of life is adjusting and handling ups and downs. I
think we do that every day in the sports world from wins to losses to
injuries. And with the good comes the bad. Again, I think it is how you focus
and how you carry on your attitude.  
I know the last two weeks have been tough for Baylor basketball, but we're
hoping the rest of the season is good.  
  
Q. You touched briefly on Perry and what he brings to your program. But
obviously the highest-ranked recruit you have ever had and I know there are
high expectations, but kind of walk us through what do you expect from him?
What can he bring to the court this year?  
COACH DREW: Excellent question. I think one thing Perry's very good at is his
versatility. He is someone who can handle the ball. He can shoot it. But he
also can play inside. And I think if -- for fans, they're going to see not a
6' 11" post player, but a 6' 11" small forward-type player.  
Again, most NBA drafts have him projected as a top 5 pick. What I have shared
with Baylor people is sometimes the NBA doesn't just draft on production but
also potential. And Perry is somebody that in ten years is going to be a much
better player than he is now. If the average fan watches and says, Why isn't
he dominating more, doing more? He just turned 19. If you look at who is
projected First-Team All-Big 12 this year, it is four seniors and a junior.
There is a difference between a 22-year-old and an 18- or 19-year-old.  
But I think fans are going to see his -- Quincy is good for one or two
highlights a game. I think you will see the same from Perry Jones. We have
been so blessed and fortunate in Big 12, look at the great players we have had
in the last few years, people you saw like a Kevin Durant, 6' 10", 6' 11", he
can do those things. Blake Griffin, Michael Beasley. I think Perry will be
able to do some things that is just special.  
It is fun coaching. Every day you come to practice, you see something.
Obviously we can't teach any of that.  
  
Q. Perry, have you compared him to different guys, other people have? Who
does he remind you of? And second part is, it seems like at one point you said
-- maybe last year -- that he is a guy who sometimes needs a little shove. Is
he still like that?  
COACH DREW: I think -- first of all, as far as comparing him, it is tough to
really compare him because he's just different. That's what makes him so
special because someone with his size, he can play outside similar to a Kevin
Durant. But I think he is an inside guy a little bit more than Kevin is as
well. Obviously Kevin is one of the best players in the world. So it is hard
to compare anybody to him.  
But as far as the one thing that Perry is such a good teammate and such a nice
guy, if it is a two-on-one break, you and him, he is going to half the time
give you the ball and let you score. No offense, you are a great player and
everything, but Perry at 6' 11", he needs to finish that himself and he needs
to be more dominant. I would love to be Perry Jones in practice because the
only thing we usually tell him is he's got to shoot it or you got to make a
play.  
Again, it is just his unselfish nature because he is such a team-oriented guy.
At times, Michael Jordan, Kobe Bryant, those people knew you had to take those
shots and we need him taking those shots.  
  
Q. I understand the CCA has recommended eliminating July recruiting. There's
going to be a lot of talk about this before anything is done officially. What
would be your thoughts? Do you think that would be good or bad?  
COACH DREW: Well, I know one thing is in the summertime for coaches, it is
really hard during the season to evaluate players because you want to be with
your team. And the summertime is about the only time where head coaches can
continually get out and look at players. So I do know that we enjoy having an
opportunity to see people we're recruiting personally versus watching
videotape or watching them on T.V. or something like that.  
I know one thing in basketball, we try to stick -- control what you can
control. So my thought is if it is passed and that's the legislation we have,
that's what we will deal with. If it is not passed, then we'll go that route.  
So right now, most coaches are focused on this upcoming season and trying to
get offenses and defenses in for the first exhibition game.  
  
Q. Can you comment about how your team has dealt with a lot of these
distractions these last few weeks and the type of effect this has had maybe on
them?  
COACH DREW: I think the great thing about college athletes, when you are 18 to
22 years old, basketball practice keeps them focused enough and making sure
that they're in the training room beforehand and after-hand taking care of
their bumps and bruises. I know for all the new guys, they're just excited to
be in practice; for the veterans, they are excited to show their leadership.  
And every year, those first couple weeks in practice, everybody is just
excited to be a part of the team and practicing. So the outside distractions
really haven't affected them as far as that goes.  
  
Q. Following up on what Mike asked you, just from the PR aspect, because on
a lot of these things you really can't comment on them right now.  
COACH DREW: Correct.  
  
Q. But people are forming kind of snap judgments maybe about your program,
maybe even going back even before you were at Baylor and resurrecting bad old
memories. Is there any way you can combat that? Are you worried about maybe
the way your program is being perceived?  
COACH DREW: Well, I think, again, coaches control what they can control. I
know media is going to do a fair and honest job. So you put your trust in
that.  
And as far as perception and how people perceive the program, I think the
biggest thing is you get a chance to cover people or get a chance to know them
or see what they're doing. Our last 18 seniors have all graduated. We had a
top 34 APR out of 347 schools. We have had three straight post-seasons, three
straight 20-win seasons. And I know if we're doing things the wrong way, that
will come out.  
So as far as I look at all we've accomplished and covered right now, I think
Baylor basketball is definitely headed in the right direction. And obviously,
you never like to have any bad publicity or bad PR, but, I guess, that comes
with life. The big thing is how you handle adversity. And I'm very pleased so
far with how our team has been focused on practices and just getting better
every day.  
Again, a three- or four-hour practice will keep your attention.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2010

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Oklahoma coach, Jeff Capel. Coach, welcome.
And your comments on the season.  
COACH CAPEL: First of all, it is great to be back in Kansas City. We are
excited about our season. Our guys are working extremely hard and we're
excited to be into practice right now and look forward to getting better every
day and getting to the games in November.  
  
Q. Josh Selby, Perry Jones, some of those other freshmen are getting a lot
of attention. But you have a good one yourself in Cameron Clark. Can be an
impact freshman in the conference. And what kind of impact do you think he
will make?  
COACH CAPEL: First of all, Perry and Josh get a lot of attention. Those guys
are extremely talented, are guys that will most likely not be in college for
very long.  
We think Cameron is really talented as well, think he has a chance to be a
very good player. I love his attitude and his approach to trying to become a
really good player, understanding that he is not there yet, but not being
afraid of work. And then allowing themselves to be coached, that's one of the
things that's been really exciting about him. He is a guy that you can get
after, that you can challenge. You don't have to do it much because he is a
pretty self-motivated kid. But he is a kid that has a really bright future.  
  
Q. Did you experience last summer with the Under-18 team and getting with
this new group sort of renewed the spirit, in essence?  
COACH CAPEL: Well, my spirit was never really dead. I mean, I love what I do.
I love the game of basketball. I love having the opportunity to have some sort
of impact on the life of young people and using our game to teach those
lessons. So my spirit was never defeated. If anything, it challenged me even
more and lit a fire even more, if that's even possible.  
The Under-18 USA World Championships was really exciting. First and foremost,
it was an honor to be chosen by my peers to be the head coach and to represent
our country. And then to be able to get a group of guys, I think we started
with 18, we got down to 12, and in a 16-day period to become a team and to
have an opportunity to compete and win a gold medal is pretty special.  
Probably the greatest satisfaction I took was those guys actually did really
become a team, and you could see that in the gold medal game when we faced
adversity for the first time in that tournament. We were down 8 with a little
bit under 9 minutes to play. And you could see the spirit of our guys.
Everything that we had preached and talked about, you could see it kind of
come into play right there. So that was a great experience for me. I think it
was a great experience for all the guys that participated in it and something
that I will always cherish.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could talk with nine new players, the chemistry of
the team and how important chemistry plays into being successful?  
COACH CAPEL: Chemistry is huge. I don't care how talented you are. Chemistry
is very, very big. And the main thing is that guys have to understand how much
they need each other. That's the main thing. You can't be, you know, one
person or two people trying to do their own thing. Everyone has to be about
one thing and that's winning and doing whatever it takes to win.  
I think our chemistry is really good. It starts in the summer. I have always
been a big believer that especially in the college level, you start building
that camaraderie and that chemistry in the summer once you get guys on campus.  
And then when you start your preseason conditioning or whatever you do, we do
preseason conditioning, it was probably as tough as it's been since I have
been here this preseason, and those are things that can sometimes bring your
team together and I think it certainly did our guys. Our guys probably did the
best job we've done since I have been here at OU or of any team I have had.
And I think that has helped us bring us closer together.  
Now we are in the process of practice. Usually your first week, two weeks of
practice are the most difficult on the players because it's -- you are going
every day, you are getting hit as they cut, as they run, as they bang, ball
screens. Now you are trying to pay attention to detail with certain things.
And so you get some bumps and bruises during this time.  
Again, I have been very impressed with our guys, with how they have come to
work every day and excitement every day about being a part of what we're doing
and about trying to become better.  
  
Q. How do you feel about eliminating the July recruiting period, which has
been, I guess, recommended by some groups?  
COACH CAPEL: I think it is a bad move. I don't think we need to eliminate the
period. I would be in favor of cutting the period back some, but you are
starting to see every year -- I think this year was another record number of
transfers. And kids are transferring for various reasons.  
A lot of kids now want things to happen very quickly, and if they don't, they
want to leave and go somewhere else.  
Not very many people enjoy the process anymore of becoming better. We are in
such a "everything has to happen fast," "everything has to happen quickly."
You see coaches getting fired now at a quicker pace.  
And I think if you eliminate July, you will see more mistakes in recruiting,
which is going to lead to transfers becoming even greater. I don't think we
should do that. I think it should be scaled back a little bit. I think we are
on for 20 days in the month of July. If they cut it to 14 days, I think that
would be good. But I don't think the period needs to be eliminated.  
I think we should be able to have a couple weekends in April as well so we can
be able to evaluate more and to have a little bit more access to players.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2010

  

### [Tad Boyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21400)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: And now we welcome the Colorado coach, Tad Boyle. Welcome to the
Big 12, Coach.  
COACH BOYLE: Thank you. It is great to be here. One of the rookie coaches here
in the Big 12.  
And I have always wanted to be a one and done guy and I think this year we are
going to be. Anyway, it is a great opportunity to come into a league like the
Big 12 and coach against the tremendous coaches and players that are in this
league. It is a great honor for me professionally, and I'm looking forward to
the opportunity to hopefully go out with a bang this year.  
  
Q. Since you brought it up, one and done, for a KU guy to get to coach in
the Big 12 and then, boom, after one year you are one and done, are there
mixed feelings?  
COACH BOYLE: I thought I would bring it up before you guys did. Yeah, there
are mixed feelings. Obviously the Big 12 is a great league and so there's some
bittersweet feelings we have from leaving it, especially being one of the
charter members of the Big 12 in Colorado, and I'm an old Big Eight guy. So
there are some mixed feelings.  
I do think though for our institution and the landscape where college
basketball and college athletics are right now, I think it is a great move for
our institution and certainly for our basketball program. So we are excited
about that. But we are a little sad to be leaving such a great league like the
Big 12.  
  
Q. I'm disappointed you didn't bring out Burks here today. Can you talk
about why he isn't here.  
COACH BOYLE: Cory is the leader of our basketball team. He is a senior. And
Alec has got some class issues he is taking care of. We practice in the
morning and today is our day off. So we just brought Cory. Alec is getting
plenty of attention and certainly he is a big part of our basketball team
obviously this year. And we are expecting some great things from him.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you have seen in him, inheriting him? What do you
see for him?  
COACH BOYLE: The sky is the limit for Alec Burks. He is a guy who I think gets
better every single day. I don't think Alec even realizes how good he can be.
He is a treat to be around every day. He is very humble. He has handled the
attention he has received very, very well. Alec is one of those guys that
offensively, when he has got the ball in his hands, as a coach you feel like
good things are going to happen. He is a guy that can create for himself and
he can create for his teammates.  
I think Alec is an underrated passer. He is a very unselfish player. The big
challenge I have laid at his feet since I got there is as long as you are
taking good shots, I'm going to let you do what you can do offensively, and
you are playing unselfishly. But defensively, there's a lot of room for
improvement in your game and certainly in our team defense as well. So Alec is
going to be a big part of that because he has got tremendous basketball
instincts both on the offensive end and the defensive end.  
  
Q. Other than good luck in the Pac-10 next year, have you received any
advice from your new peers about coaching in the Big 12?  
COACH BOYLE: No, they haven't given a lot of advice other than be ready every
night. I think the league speaks for itself. And I don't care what league
you're in, I have had the fortune to coach in the Pac-10 when I started
coaching and in the SEC and some other leagues along the way, the Missouri
Valley. Any league you are in is a tough league. You recruit to your league.  
We've got some players that are capable of having success in this league. But
the one thing -- and it is the oldest cliche, you better bring it every night
because if you don't, you get embarrassed pretty quick.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what makes Cory such a good player and
why you say he is the leader of your squad?  
COACH BOYLE: Well, I think what makes Cory such a good player is, number one,
work ethic. He works on his game every day. He's fundamentally sound. I think
that's the biggest thing, is that he's -- there is not a lot of weaknesses in
his game. He is a very, I think, underrated defender, although he has led --
or been at the top of the Big 12 in steals, I know.  
And then offensively, he's just a very intelligent player. He has a great feel
for the game. Again, he is a guy like Alec who can create for himself and for
his teammates.  
If I had to put one or two bullet points next to why Cory is such a special
player, it would be his work ethic, his consistency, bringing it every day,
and just his fundamentals that he's got whether it is his footwork on offense
or his intelligence being a help-side defender on defense. I could go on and
on.  
He's a terrific player, and he's a guy, again, that has respect of all his
teammates. The only way you get that respect is by bringing it every day, and
Cory does that.  
  
Q. You do get that one shot at Allen Fieldhouse this year. Can you talk
about that experience and then also going opposite of Danny Manning on the
other bench?  
COACH BOYLE: I saw Danny on the recruiting trail about a month ago and we
bumped into each other. It will be interesting. I haven't been back to Allen
Fieldhouse since I played. I have been back for maybe one game as a spectator.
It has been too long since I have been there.  
Allen Fieldhouse is a great place to play college basketball and obviously I
have been on one side of it, this will be my first time being on the other
side of it. It will be a heck of a challenge and a great opportunity, I know
one our players look forward to. Obviously for me having played there way back
when in the '80s, it will be a special moment in my life.  
Again, it will be another game. That's one of those games you don't have to
get your guys too fired up to play because that kind of takes care of itself.
It will be a fun night.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2010

  

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by Texas Coach Rick Barnes. Coach has suggested
he would just take questions.  
COACH BARNES: I'm ready.  
  
Q. Among many, two of your biggest problems last year were team
chemistry/leadership and point guard play. Look at those particular areas now
as you begin to move into this season.  
COACH BARNES: Well, obviously they are some issues we looked at and knew we
had to address. I can only tell you from the end of last season to where we
are now, I think the returning players had a great spring, a great summer. We
have had a great preseason. In terms of our chemistry, I'm really pleased and
happy where we are right now with our basketball team. And I look at the point
guard position, I think obviously with Dog being able to get back, he will be
back. With the addition of Cory Joseph, I feel that we are going to be fine
there.  
I just really -- I have enjoyed being with this group as many as any group I
have been with for a long time because of the fact they have really, I think,
bought into the fact that it is about the team, about winning and if we can
continue with where we are right now and continue to grow, I think we have got
a chance to have a really nice basketball team.  
  
Q. As far as depth goes, you obviously don't have as much as last year. How
have the big kids who have been around a while, it has only been a week, but
how are they doing so far?  
COACH BARNES: I think okay. I think obviously the newest one to it would be
Tristan Thompson. I think, one, Tristan has come in and I think he would be
the first to tell you that the older guys have really embraced he and Cory and
helped them, let them know what lies ahead as much as they can right now.
Obviously both of those guys, those young guys will have to go through it to
experience it.  
But up to this point, again, Tristan has really worked extremely hard, in some
regards maybe as hard as anybody on our team. I just think if he will continue
with the type of effort he is putting in right now and with the focus that
he's giving us, he has got a chance to have an outstanding year.  
  
Q. A lot has been made with the way the Big 12 conference is going to
change, that without Nebraska and Colorado and with having home and home with
everybody, that it will be a much stronger basketball league. Do you get a
sense that basketball will be even more important in this conference, even a
bigger deal than it has been?  
COACH BARNES: I think because we are going to play a round-robin schedule, I
think it is going to make it, in my opinion, I think it will be the best
basketball league in America. I really believe that. Over the time I have been
in the league now, this is my 13th year, I have watched this league grow. I
watched programs grow. When you start playing a round robin, it is really --
it is going to be really tough.  
And I think, you know -- I hope in some regards that when what we do as a
league right now, that maybe people are going to realize that you don't always
have to expand to be better, but maybe being at ten is the right number. And I
think for the reason that we're going to have great success with all the other
sports as well, but I think basketball-wise, I do think this is going to be
the one sport in our league now that's really going to take off and people, I
do think, will look at it in the near future as being the best basketball
league in America.  
  
Q. With the departure of Jones and Pittman, can you talk about Gary
Johnson's role in the front court this year.  
COACH BARNES: Well, again, Gary Johnson going into his senior year, he has
been with us. Even though he has played somewhat of a -- people might say a
lesser role, I'm not sure I would say that, because he has been a very
important part to our program since he has been there. But, again, what I have
been impressed with with our leadership is the fact that I think he and really
Matt Hill have been the two guys that have really given us great leadership.
And they do it with what they do every day on the court. They -- neither one
of those guys, I would say, are real vocal type of leaders. But their work
ethic, the way they go about their business, they set a great example for
everybody.  
And if anyone deserves to have a great senior year, it would be Gary and Matt.
But Gary is -- again, he's won a lot of basketball games for us. Been in a lot
of big situations for us. We will need that from him this year.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about Jordan and maybe any changes you have seen in
him. Obviously last year he won you some games with his ability to shoot the
basketball, but other times maybe the shot selection wasn't particularly
great.  
COACH BARNES: I don't think what Jordan went through last year is really
unlike any freshman. He is young, coming into the college game, trying to
learn a totally different game. And there is no doubt that Jordan has really
worked and he continued to work all last year to try to improve and try to
understand the game more and more. And I think, again, he had a great spring.
He has had a great summer. He has continued to work really hard into the fall
here.  
And I think Jordan would be the first one to tell you that he still -- like I
would say this about any guy in college basketball, they are still a work in
progress. They are still young. They are still getting started.  
But in terms of his attitude, it has been excellent. As long as -- again,
he'll continue to want to learn the game, and he does want to learn this game.
He wants to be good at it. But, again, he has had a great offseason and he is
building now and he will continue to grow.  
  
Q. Would you talk about the raw ability of your two freshmen. And where is
J'Covan Brown right now in the big picture?  
COACH BARNES: Again, the two freshman, I think if you ask anyone in the
program, from the coaches to the players, I think the first thing they would
tell you is their work ethic. They are two of the guys that are in the gym
first and I can tell you they are the last two to leave every day. And they
have done that from the time they have walked on campus. I think that in
itself speaks volumes about them.  
And I think it speaks volumes to the upperclassmen, that these guys want to be
a part and do their best. Every day they are the two last guys on the court
that leave.  
J'Covan, a lot like, I think, our team in general, is that the season is over
with last year, we knew that we had to improve in certain areas. We talked
about it. We say what we're going to do. And we knew what standard that we
expect our basketball program to live up to. But every one of those guys have
had a good offseason, good summer, good fall right now.  
But I'm happy with all of them. I really am, because I think they truly are
making a conscious effort to do everything the way we want it done. And I
think they understand that for us to have the kind of season that we have to
have and we want to have is togetherness.  
And they stay together, they work together and so there are so many positive
things that have happened that has our entire coaching staff excited. We
think, again, it will continue to grow.  
We have got a chance to have a really good basketball team.

DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 21, 2010

  

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
PETER IRWIN: We are now joined by Missouri Coach Mike Anderson. Coach,
welcome. Your thoughts about the upcoming season.  
COACH ANDERSON: Looking forward to the upcoming year, especially when we sit
down here. This time of the year, I guess your body tells you that basketball
is really, really in the air. I'm excited about this group. We lost some key
guys last year. J.T. Tiller, Zaire Taylor, and Keith Ramsey. And your question
from a coaching standpoint is how do you replace those guys that were your
glue guys? They were the trench guys that did all the work in the deflections,
rebounding, loose balls, didn't worry about scoring.  
So now I got a host of guys that can score. How do you make their roles where
they do some of the blue collar things. That's going to be the challenge for
our basketball team.  
I think the guys coming back, I think they are excited about the guys that are
coming in. We had a class that was kind of heralded in terms of being ranked
in the nation, but these guys hadn't played a single second of college
basketball. So there's some question marks. But I like the potential and
that's why I'm really, really excited about this group here.  
It is year five, and we hope to make another move to another level in Tiger
basketball.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the young guys and just kind of -- I know it is still
early, but what you are seeing from them so far?  
COACH ANDERSON: We have one senior. That will be Justin Safford, a guy who is
in his fourth year. He is coming off of an Achilles tendon -- not Achilles
tendon, but ACL surgery. So he's the lone senior on our basketball team. And
so when you talk about the young guys coming in, you talk about a guy like
Phil Pressey who has practiced well. I think he's -- you would think he is a
sophomore, but he just has great basketball -- he fits what we are doing. What
I mean by that, we play up tempo basketball. I like instinctive guys.  
This guy, I tell you what, he is really crafty with the basketball. He creates
for others. And he can see it before I even see it. And he will throw a couple
up in the stands, but at the same time, I think he'll -- he will make it very
exciting.  
I remember when Laurence Bowers came to our basketball team, I said you are
going to have some guys that will get some highlights. This guy will be a
highlight waiting to happen, where we got highlight No. 2, and that's going to
be Phil Pressey. He has his brother, his sidekick along with him, Matt Pressey
who is in the mode of J.T. Tiller. He is one of those guys that does anything
to make your basketball team win. Got a chance to be a tremendous defender. He
is a junior college all-American. He is one of those glue guys that you got to
have on your basketball team.  
Ricky Kreklow, I got some guys with some pretty amazing genes, his dad played
in the NBA as well, Wayne Kreklow, who is the volleyball coach at Missouri.
Ricky is a 6' 6" kid who can shoot the basketball. The thing I really like
about him is he is gritty. He will not back down from anybody. He passes the
ball well and just plays the game with a tremendous amount of passion.  
So he is -- he competes each and every day and he has been working out. His
workouts have been great up to this point.  
Obviously, they are going against each other. The young man that everyone
probably is aware of is Ricardo Ratliffe, considered one of the best junior
college players in the country. He hasn't disappointed me at all. He's come in
with a tremendous work ethic which really kind of surprises me, especially a
guy that heralded.  
6' 8", 240, if you are going to guard him, you will feel it, too. Our guys
describe him as an ox, a beast. He can give us the guy that can give us a low
post presence. He loves to rebound the basketball. But obviously there will be
a transition for him as well.  
And the last in that class is Kadeem Green, 6' 8" forward that has a 7' 2"
wing span coming off an Achilles tendon tear. He is slowly progressing, but we
think his upside is very good.  
You take the newcomers and put it with the new guys that are returning, Kim
English, Marcus Denmon, Laurence Bowers, who is a guy that's a double-double
waiting to happen for you, that excites me, Steve Moore who was playing real
well at the end of the year because of injuries to our basketball team. He has
come back, and I think he is playing with a lot more confidence. John
Underwood has put 20 pounds on. And, of course, the lone freshman, Mike Dixon,
I think he is a better player now than he was last year. So as a coach, that
excites me.  
But we have got some work to do. As I said, our brand will be we hang our hats
on our defense. And obviously most guys, they practice their offense all
summer long. So I think now is the time to start practicing with the defense.  
  
Q. Kim is obviously your leading returning scorer. Can you talk a little bit
about where he needs to return.  
COACH ANDERSON: I think Kimmy understands this is his junior year. His role
has changed a little bit. Last year he was the primary scorer. I would like to
see him be a guy that would give me four or five rebounds if he is going to be
out there. Defensively, I think he has got to be a guy that can guard people,
lateral quickness. He knows that.  
But I think Kimmy is doing all the things he can to become a complete player.
But I think more than that, I think now he is in a position now that he
hopefully relishes in, and that's to be a leader. This guy wants to be a
leader from day one, but you had DeMarre Carroll, so you had to wait your
time. Of course in year two he wanted to do the same thing, but you have J.T.
Tiller and Zaire Taylor. Now I think he is at that point where his role has
changed. Hopefully that's going to be a big part of it.  
I think he is excited about his junior year. I think he is excited about his
team. I think when you talk to our guys, you will find out they are really
excited about what's taking place at the University of Missouri.  
  
Q. You are pretty deep at the guard position. How do you see the minutes
being distributed throughout the season? And then, secondly, you lost big shot
Zaire Taylor. Who will be the new big shot for 2010-11?  
COACH ANDERSON: It is just amazing, you talk about Zaire, and he was a guy. He
was a Blue Hen before he became a Missouri Tiger and hit some of the biggest
shots, of course, since I have been there. I think he was on YouTube the other
day and he is doing a little clip, he was doing it over there in Belgium,
hitting big shots. He is sitting back there saying, Coach, I'm still doing it.  
That's something that's going to -- it will be interesting with this
basketball team. When you look at the players, I think Marcus Denmon is a guy,
he is a clutch guy. I think Kimmy could be a clutch guy. I think you are going
to see an array of guys that can create and make plays.  
I think the key is to make a play. And there might be another guy that will be
the recipient. I think Phil Pressey is a guy that can create something for
you, Mike Dixon. That will play itself out. And you talk about the abundance
of guards. That's kind of a good problem to have. We'll figure out -- I think
it works its way out throughout practice and throughout the games. That might
be a time you see three guards, you may see four guards. I think the great
thing about what's taking place with our team this year, I think we have got
more balance.  
When you talk about balance, Elite 8 team, it was more -- I think you had
forwards that were more the dominants, DeMarre and Leo, rightly so. Last year
I thought we were more perimeter-oriented. And, of course, this year, with
Ricardo coming in, with Bowers having a little bit more experience, Safford
being a senior, now I think we got some balance with your guard play with
Kimmy and Mike Dixon and Marcus Denmon, those guys can give us some balance.
When you have got balance, that's pretty good. I like the depth. I like the
depth.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2010

  

### [Connie Yori](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13896)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Connie Yori from Nebraska. Your
thoughts before we take some questions?  
COACH YORI: Well, I would like to say it is great to be back to Kansas City,
but if you go back to our season a year ago, we had two losses and both of
them were in Kansas City. I maybe have realized that we've got to quit feeding
our players barbecue because they must be allergic to it or something. I
personally am a big brisket fan, but it seems that our team is not.  
But, again, it is good to be here. I love Kansas City and this is always a
great venue for the Big 12 tournament.  
Little bit about our season upcoming here, of course, we are coming off a
terrific season a year ago. Last year at this time, we were practicing, to
give you an analogy, we were practicing at a level that I would compare to
doing calculus, pretty advanced.  
And right now we are practicing more at a level of learning our ABCs. We are
very young, we are very different. But I think we have an exciting opportunity
here. We have got two very good guards in our program. And I think any time
that you can start with two good guards in Lindsey Moore and Dominique Kelley,
I think that's a great start. We are going to have a change of the guard, so
to speak, in a lot of ways, but I think we got two great guards that we can
really begin to focus on and try to do more things for them to get -- to make
our team better.  
  
Q. Could you talk maybe more specifically with the freshmen, because they
are going to have to play, and what they can do.  
COACH YORI: Right. We have a very good freshmen group. If you look at
athletically where our five freshmen are compared to where our outgoing group
of seniors were at the same stage athletically, our freshmen are quite a ways
ahead of where our outgoing seniors were at the same stage.  
And we do various tests in the fall in terms of conditioning tests and testing
them in the weight room, testing their agility from an athletic standpoint.  
We got a pretty good group. And I think the player right now that has stood
out the most in our practice setting -- in our early season practice is Jordan
Hooper, kid from Nebraska. She has a chance to be a really good player at this
level. I'm never one to blow up kids, and, in fact, I usually do the opposite.
But Jordan is pretty special -- going to be a pretty special player in our
program and talked about athleticism. She is a 6' 2" kid. We do an agility
test and she set an all-time record in our agility test this fall. And that
includes every player that I have ever -- that has ever played under me. That
includes people like Yvonne Turner and Dominique Kelley, kids who are quick
and athletic, and here is a 6' 2" kid who has already done that. She's very,
very skilled and a great shooter. So we're excited about her.  
We have a number of other freshmen. We have the player of the year in the
State of Arizona in our program, Rebecca Woodbury. Again, freshmen are -- it
is going to be a learning process for them. We got a good group, but we have
got to focus on the process every day. And there is a lot there that they need
to learn.  
  
Q. Losing all the seniors last year, how much of a turnaround or building
does it take then for these talented young players to really find their
niche?  
COACH YORI: Well, I think our leadership has been, overall, pretty good.
Unfortunately, we haven't had Dominique Kelley in our practice setting yet
because she has been injured, but hopefully we can get her back here in a week
or two.  
But our leadership is good. We have some upperclassmen who maybe haven't
necessarily played a lot of minutes but have been in our practice setting and
understand our system and understand what we try to do and have done a good
job leadership-wise. But, again, there's a lot of difference between a four-
year senior who has played a lot over the history of their career versus
someone who doesn't really even know where to go to get their equipment,
doesn't even know their way to find a pair of shoes right now.  
So we're real different, but, yet, it's exciting. It is also one of those
things as a coach that we have got to tone it back a little bit in terms of
the progress we're able to make on a daily basis. And we just need to be
patient and we need to be persistent and keep plugging away.  
  
Q. Still looking at the conference, you are the defending champs. How does
the race look this season?  
COACH YORI: Well, to me it's -- there's three teams that have the experience
in itself that, I think, have set themselves apart. I think Baylor and A&M and
I think Iowa State. I picked Iowa State quite a ways ahead of where they were
picked in the overall picture of the preseason poll. And I think Iowa State
has got a lot of kids back and have got a great postgame, had some great young
players that developed.  
But, of course, Baylor coming off a Final Four season and returning virtually
everyone and A&M won the Big 12 tournament. I think Oklahoma is the other team
you got to talk about when they have one of the best point guards in the
country in Danielle Robinson.  
But as always, the race is what it is. And it is going to be a daily grind and
there is not going to be any easy ones. I always say the single hardest thing
to do in the Big 12 is win one game. And that is a challenge in itself on a
daily basis.  
So it will be interesting to see how things fall, but at the same time,
there's going to be some teams -- there is going to be a surprise team. And
who that is, I don't know.  
  
Q. You talked about maybe a little bit of a leadership void. How much do you
feel like the people you do have coming back are going to be able to step in
right away, including Lindsey obviously, even though she is only a
sophomore.  
COACH YORI: Are you talking about those who did not play for us?  
  
Q. Being leaders.  
COACH YORI: Well, Dominique Kelley is one of the best leaders I have ever
coached. And unfortunately, she hasn't been on the floor for us, but, you
know, she is a classic leader by example first. But she is also very
articulate and has got the ability to motivate and always seems to say the
right thing.  
And I think Lindsey has got a lot of those same qualities. Great leader by
example and I think she is going to take on a greater leadership role for us
this year even though she is a sophomore. But she started every single game
for us last year as a freshman and on a very good team. So she learned a lot
from our upperclassmen, and that's normal. And she is a smart kid that was
able to understand what it took us to get where we were a year ago.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2010

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up is Robin Pingeton, who is our new coach at the
University of Missouri. Coach, welcome. Your opening comments?  
COACH PINGETON: Thank you. First of all, it is great to be here with you guys
today. And I just want to thank everybody for coming out and being a part of
this press conference. Certainly an honor and a privilege to be in the Big 12.
Really looking forward to being a part of this great, great conference. I have
been in Missouri now for six months and it has certainly been a dead sprint
and we have a lot of work to do.  
The things that you will always find with me, I'm very real and very
transparent in regards to who I am, what I'm about, where our program's at.
And we've -- we have got just a lot of work to do. And it is going to be a
process. It is going to be a journey. It will take a lot of hard work. I'm
really proud of our players. Our buy-in has been tremendous from top to bottom
out of our players.  
Our seniors have just done an outstanding job in regards to their leadership,
the sense of urgency that they approach every day with, and their productivity
on the court.  
Right now I feel like we go about two steps forward, one step back. Even on
those days that maybe it's not as productive as we'd like on the court, I just
feel like there has been so many great teachable moments for us in regards to
build a family within our program and developing better basketball players,
better teammates and preparing these girls to be successful in life.  
So it is -- we don't get much sleep around there in Columbia. The journey has
been fun. I know we have a tough road ahead of us. Our nonconference schedule
will be extremely, extremely tough for us. And then after that you go right
into the Big 12. It will be a tough, challenging year. I believe our girls
will overachieve this season, without a doubt. I do not know that it will show
up in the record book or on the scoreboard, but just their approach and the
effort they have given us day after day.  
We will become a better program and a better team this season, and we will lay
the foundation for the future in Missouri's women's basketball. And it is in
the best conference in the country and it does not happen overnight. And we
are looking forward to the journey ahead.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to sell veteran players on them being a foundation
stone, a stepping stone, that the success they want right now they may not
achieve?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, I think it's a testament to the kind of character and
integrity that we have within this group of seniors. And it has not been a
hard sell at all. I think they want this not only for their senior year to go
out on a strong note but also, you know, as an alumni of the program and they
want to be the class that really leaves that legacy behind in regards to the
year that we started to turn the program.  
Again, I just -- I couldn't be more proud of that senior class and just the
effort that they have given us, the buy-in. They're hungry. They want to be
successful. And I think it's our job as coaches to lead and to mentor and help
mold and help prepare them to be successful in life. And everything we do in
our program at Missouri will absolutely be a carryover, absolutely we're
committed to winning and that's the goal, is to win games and win
championships.  
But our passion is to impact our players' lives and prepare them to be
successful in the real world and graduate our seniors. And I think they
understand that this is a growing process within our program, and I think
they're really excited to be a part of it.  
  
Q. What's going to be the biggest adjustment going from Missouri Valley to
the Big 12 and how much did your stint at Iowa State help you as far as
understanding what's ahead now this season?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, you know, you are looking at playing against the best
players and coaching against the best coaches in the country. And so I think
the level of play obviously, I mean, it is pretty obvious in regards to the
level of abilities out there.  
But in regards to our approach, it won't be any different. As a coach, you
know, Xs and Os as a mentor, you get an opportunity to work with greater
athletes that have more athletic ability. But I also think the runs that we
had at Illinois State in our post-season, the opportunity to play some of the
Big 12 teams, some Big Ten teams has certainly prepared us as a staff on what
that level all entails.  
My time at Iowa State was so beneficial in many ways and I think there's
probably not one person out here that's not a fan of Bill Fennelly's and just
his approach to what he does and how he does it and learned a lot of things
from Bill that go far beyond the basketball court but about running a program
and being successful.  
And the thing about Bill is he does it the right way and he doesn't compromise
in regards to his values, his character and integrity. And that's the same
approach that we'll have at Missouri. But my time with Bill was absolutely
extremely beneficial, not only in the position that I'm at now but just in my
coaching career.  
  
Q. Do you feel like since you are inheriting so many new players that you
will have to change your style to fit the team that you have inherited or will
you try and run the things that you have done at Illinois State or some of the
things that maybe you inherited from being on Bill's staff?  
COACH PINGETON: I don't know that Xs and Os-wise my philosophy has always been
what they ran at Iowa State. You know, I'm more of a motion offense,
transition, some pressure defense.  
But it absolutely -- I think you have got to be so careful as a new staff
that, you know, it's not just about implementing your style, but it is also
about evaluating your players and putting them in a position to be successful.  
And so it is a little bit of both. Do we want to run and have a transition
style game? Absolutely. But as you work with your players, every year you
tweak your system a little bit, again, so that they are in a position to be
successful and have success and so it is a little bit of both, to be honest
with you.  
I think you recruit players that can play the style that you like to coach,
but as you inherit a program, you have got to be awfully careful of that
because there is a fine line.  
  
Q. What's been the best advice you have received from any of your Big 12
coaches? I know there's going to be -- just in terms of building a program, I
know there is going to be days that are exhilarating and other days where you
really have to keep in mind the big picture. What's some of the advice you
have gotten from other Big 12 coaches in terms of building a program?  
COACH PINGETON: Well, I think -- you know, it has been just a busy six months.
Everyone is busy running their programs from the time I took the job in April
with running their camps to summer recruiting to on-campus official visits.
There hasn't been a ton of interaction, to be honest with you. I hear a lot of
people tell me how tough it is, how tough of a job this is, you know, just the
challenges that lie ahead.  
I have always had kind of the mind-set that it is a great opportunity. I like
to look at it from that angle instead of how tough it is. I think it is a
great opportunity to be part of these young players' lives and to change a
culture and change an environment and change the program and leave a legacy
behind at Missouri. So unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to talk to a lot
of them.  
But early on when I took the job, obviously there is a lot of congratulations
and just all of them, class-act coaches in this league and that's why they are
some of the best in the country.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2010

  

### [Deb Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14194)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Patterson from the University of
Kansas. I said that wrong, Kansas State right off the bat. I knew I did it.
Sorry about that.  
COACH PATTERSON: That's okay.  
THE MODERATOR: Kansas State University. Coach, would you like to make some
opening comments?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, we're excited about the season ahead. I think with our
sophomore point guard Brittany Chambers leading this basketball team, we've
got, I think, one of the best young point guards in the league. And that
definitely excites me. We've had some great point guards at Kansas State, and
I think she lines up with the very best we've ever had. And so it's neat to
think about starting a season with her at the helm.  
I think with Jalana Childs, who is also here at media day, she has the
potential to be one of the great breakout players in the league this season, I
think. I'm very excited about the summer that she's put in. With the loss of
Ashley Sweat, we are going to need a real step-up presence in the post. I'm
very much looking forward to what I expect Jalana is going to bring to the
floor this season.  
So we're young. We're picked, I believe, ninth in the league. But we've never
been too preoccupied with where we're picked. I think we've got a team that
will fight extremely hard all season long and it's our goal headed into the
season to find our way into post-season play. So that's really how we're
approaching the season. And we'll build around those two players and looking
forward to competing in this great league and looking forward to having that
Big 12 tournament here in Kansas City. Very excited about that.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the new rule change that's allowed you guys to
start practice a little bit earlier, but obviously you have to spread those
practices out a little bit more. How have you dealt with your scheduling and
do you like the earlier start?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, I think I'm in the minority, but I love more practice,
and I've enjoyed having the extra days in the gym with our players.  
I think the players certainly enjoy a tighter window relative to the
conditioning, so I think it's more fun for them to be in the gym. But for us,
particularly with the young team, I think it has been real valuable. Really,
we have just worked our extra days around the calendar, when we are
recruiting, when we're not. Logistically we haven't had any special equation.
We really have just worked those extra days in around other things that we
might have obligations with and to.  
But I like those extra days with my players and I think you -- you would have
to ask them, but I think they have enjoyed it as well.  
  
Q. What about Alina. I heard that she had a pretty phenomenal summer for you
and this is probably going to be a season when you do need people to sort of
step out of their comfort zones because -- not just Ashley, but Kari not being
there.  
COACH PATTERSON: Yeah, I think Alina looks good right now in our early stages
of practice. And she had plantar fasciitis procedures in both of her feet last
year. And I think people will be very surprised by what they see from her.  
She's got the potential to be a very agile, almost Ashley-like scorer. She can
shoot the three. She can drive the ball. She's linear. And very agile.
Obviously has not proven herself or had the opportunity to compete much, but
she almost has a game that is a mirror of what you might have seen from Ashley
in terms of the versatility factor.  
The challenge for her will be, again, the speed of the game and making the
transition defensively, but I like her potential as a scorer.  
Right now in the early phases of practice, she's looked very good for us. So
if we can get her to be a physical presence in this league as is required,
then she's got great, great upside and a lot of basketball ahead of her.  
  
Q. With the WNBA season Shalee had, making it to the finals, what does it
mean to have a player of that caliber come back as a coach? She has chosen to
coach as opposed to going overseas, to have her working with especially as
many young players as you have.  
COACH PATTERSON: I think it's a tremendous advantage for us to have someone
like Shalee, you know, walk away from the WNBA finals and come with all of the
knowledge and the experience that you gain competing at that level, whether
you are in the finals or not. But just being in that caliber of basketball and
then walking into the gym with your players and being able to share and
communicate what you've learned, what you know, the intensity required even
off the court.  
The perspective that you gain from being around players from other programs
all over the country, many of whom and some of whom are playing international
basketball. It is just a great piece for your young people to have in their
program each and every day and it is also an element, I think, that in a
recruiting picture is significant to prospects in that it's nice to hear the
perspective of a coaching staff member who is playing at the highest level of
the game and who has achieved great things and who is -- you know, on a day-
to-day basis really competing with and against the best.  
And when you are trying to involve yourself with some of the best prospects in
the country, that increases your credibility, I think. And so, certainly in
all those respects, it is a great positive for our program and for our young
team. She is a great voice of experience, not just from her Kansas State days,
but now from what she has experienced playing for the Atlanta Dream.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2010

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Kim Mulkey of Baylor. We would like to
welcome you to the dais. Coach will take questions right off the bat.  
  
Q. A year ago you weren't thrilled about -- you were unhappy about the team
to beat was such a young team. How do you feel about being number one this
year now that your team is a year older and showed something in the tournament
last year?  
COACH MULKEY: We're honored to have received the votes that we did. I think it
puts a little added pressure on you because if you look at our basketball
team, we only lost one senior last year, but, yet, at the same time, we're
young. And most of those kids that got playing time are sophomores now.  
We will have great expectations, but at the same time, we're realists in that
our schedule both nonconference and in the league is going to make it very
difficult. Somebody has to be picked number one, so we'll take it.  
  
Q. Kim, could you just talk about with the returning starters but also the
newcomers you have coming in, both the freshmen and the transfers, how that
may change the way teams have to defense Brittney. Will she see fewer two or
three -- you know, double teams, triple teams, sagging zone defense, and
simply because of the year of experience and also the talent you have right
now?  
COACH MULKEY: We have more depth this year than ever. This is the most
talented team that I have ever coached at Baylor, but it is also a team that
has more depth than I have ever had. I don't know how teams will defend
Brittney. I'm sure she will continue to see the double and triple teams. I'm
sure we will continue to see a lot of zone defenses.  
But as you saw last year, as we got better and became more comfortable with
each other, Brittney was able to find players around her that could take the
scoring burden off of her. I think we have a great leader in Melissa Jones and
a captain who hopefully will stay healthy all year.  
Kelli Griffin is another senior that comes back at the point position. The
transfers, Destiny Williams will be eligible the day after we play Tennessee.
Brooklyn Pope is playing her best basketball right now.  
Odyssey Sims has been cleared to play from the ACL surgery. And my daughter,
Makenzie, is there and can shoot the basketball. So maybe she'll get some
playing time.  
  
Q. Who is most likely to open things up with shooting for Brittney inside
since you do have so many new players?  
COACH MULKEY: With the depth we have, it would be difficult for me to tell
you. You know Melissa Jones. You know you are going to see her on the
perimeter, and you know you are going to see Kelli Griffin on the perimeter.
You know you will see Brittney Griner in the paint.  
The other two spots change from day-to-day. And that's a good problem to have,
because there is great competition in practice every day. There is lots to
choose from. And when those don't get it done, we try two more.  
So today I can tell you three, but I can't tell you the other two.  
  
Q. As good as Brittney Griner was good last year, do you think we have seen
the best of her? Or do you think she is continuing to grow and improve?  
COACH MULKEY: I hope you haven't. I hope the coaching staff is able to elevate
her game to a new level.  
I hope that Brittney will continue to get stronger. She doesn't have a body
that's just going to put on a lot of weight, but she can get stronger. And I
think in the weight room it is very important that she understood what
happened to her last year when in games she would fatigue or get pushed around
a lot, hopefully she will be motivated by that and take her game to another
level.  
I think the talent around her will continue to help Brittney. Brittney is not
on a basketball team where she has to do it by herself.  
Yes, a lot of attention is drawn to her. And that's understandable. But she
has got a lot, a lot of people around her that will help her game take it to
the next level.  
  
Q. Given Melissa's importance to the team and also the fact she plays so
hard, have you ever considered maybe limiting her minutes at least early in
the season given what she's gone through?  
COACH MULKEY: She probably wouldn't like that and wouldn't agree to it. But,
yes, I've even at times -- last year when she -- it first surfaced with the
leg reaction, will shut her down and took the advice of doctors and our
trainer that if we didn't practice her and only played her in games, that she
would be okay. Well, obviously that didn't work because when it came to
conference, she couldn't go.  
Melissa is always going to have nagging aches and pains because she does play
extremely hard. What you see on the floor in games is what we see every day in
practice. To think that I could ask her to stand on the sideline and not play,
she couldn't do it. There's some athletes that would welcome that. Melissa is
just one that feels like she is not a part of it if she is not out there
playing.  
We will be extremely smart with her. She's healthy. Good to go. No leg
problems. But if there ever surfaces something with her health, I certainly am
always going to ask a physician and a trainer first what we should do and be
very conservative and careful.  
I want her to have a great senior year. I said when she is a freshmen she
would be an all-Big 12 performer before she left Baylor and you saw she is one
of the five picked on the all-conference preseason team and she deserves that.  
  
Q. Obviously you have a very strong sophomore class. I think the Big 12
freshmen last year as a class was very strong. Who are some of the other maybe
young players that we saw last year that might make a big impact this year?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, you saw a lot of the freshmen on our team play when
Melissa got hurt. You saw Kimetria Hayden make the big steal in the Duke game
to help us win that game. And you saw until she got hurt a little bit in the
Iowa State game, you saw Jordan Madden. You will now see two other sophomores
that you didn't see last year, Brooklyn Pope transfer from Rutgers and Destiny
Williams, transfer from Illinois.  
I'm sure I'm missing others. But those four initially jump out in that
sophomore class that will see significant minutes.  
  
Q. Everybody all summer has talked about this Baylor-UConn game coming up. I
know you have games before that. Can you just talk about how important it is
that people think of your program as being a program that can challenge a team
like UConn. You have won a National Championship. Just the fact that you have
elevated the program to that level.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, last year I said it was UConn and everybody else, and that
proved to be true. This year there is not a dominant team, in my opinion, that
we had last year. I think there are many teams that can vie for a National
Championship and UConn is certainly one of them.  
UConn is the national champion until somebody proves otherwise. UConn
continues to have the winning streak until somebody beats them. We will get an
opportunity quickly to play them.  
It is indeed an honor to play them, but more important than the honor of
playing Connecticut, it is the fact that we get to be seen on national
television again, we get to be mentioned in the same breath as UConn and that
just is so valuable to our program and to our university.  
And I guess like the rest of them that will play UConn, we get a shot at
trying to beat them.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2010

  

### [Linda Lappe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21392)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Linda Lappe from Colorado. Coach,
welcome to the Big 12.  
COACH LAPPE: Thank you. It is great to be here. I thank you all for coming.
Being a new coaching staff at the University of Colorado, we are even more
excited than most other coaches at this time because we now get to start to
work with our players and really get to see kind of what they have on the
floor and, you know, what they bring and start to get to implement our new
offensive systems, our new defensive systems and really, you know, start to
develop what we're going to be all about this year.  
I'm very excited and happy to be one of the two new coaches to the Big 12. It
is a great conference. I'm even more proud to be at the school that I was able
to attend, University of Colorado. It is a great place. I'm so excited to get
going with this season, and we've talked a lot about getting back to the
Colorado tradition and the Colorado way and starting to implement the Colorado
way and what that's all about and kind of go from there.  
So we -- our players have done a tremendous job. They have worked really
diligently throughout the last couple of months to help us ensure that we can
have a successful season this year. They continue to improve every single day.
And they continue to learn and be extremely coachable. I think that's one of
the things that I have been most impressed with, with our team, is their
ability to learn and their willingness to learn and look you in the eye when
you are coaching them. It doesn't matter what you are saying to them. And they
take it and they run with it and they continue to get better.  
We're led by one of our seniors, Brittany Spears. She is poised to have
another good season for us. We have asked her to continue to get better in her
game, both offensively and defensively, as well as her leadership.  
Julie Seabrook and Britney Blythe have also been two of our more vocal leaders
throughout this year. They have both done a great job. They are working
extremely hard. Chucky Jeffery and Meagan Malcolm-Peck had good freshman
seasons in the fact they got a lot of playing time and they are ready to have
good sophomore seasons. We have four freshmen that are coming in and starting
to impress us already. And we are going to need some minutes from those guys
as well.  
So we're looking forward to a good year and, you know, we are looking forward
to getting things started off on a good foot and continuing to improve as the
season goes along.  
  
Q. Ask you the same parochial question I asked Robin: Growing up in Iowa,
the things you learned in Iowa, how have they helped you get to where you are
now? Both that and also being at Drake, how has that experience helped you to
progress through your coaching career?  
COACH LAPPE: Well, I have been extremely lucky to have always had really good
coaches growing up, not just in basketball but in every sport that I was able
to play through junior high, high school, and in college. Girls basketball in
the state of Iowa is probably unlike any other, and it has been like that for
a long time. They have storied traditions and so I was lucky enough to be from
the state of Iowa. And really get to know what girls basketball was all about
and to feel really special playing girls basketball in Iowa.  
Coaching at Drake, I think it was great. Amy Stevens was the lady that I
worked for and just taught me a lot about the game and, you know, really
expanded my basketball knowledge as well as how to run a team and I think she
does a great job there. I learned so much in my first three years working for
her. So I couldn't -- I couldn't be happier to have grown up where I grew up.
And I'm extremely fortunate to have always -- I can't think of one coach that
I have ever had that hasn't been good. I don't know too many people that have
been able to say that. So ...  
  
Q. Bianca Smith took and made about a third of the team's three-pointers
last year. How do you plan to replace that perimeter offense?  
COACH LAPPE: Well, we've got to get easier shots. We've got to move the ball.
We've got to set better screens. We've got to really teach our players how to
work with each other, set each other up, and we've got to get some easier
shots. We have got to get the ball in the post. We have to establish a post
game. We have to establish inside, back to the outside.  
Brittany Spears can also shoot really, really well and she will be able to
shoot better when she is open. I think that's a huge part of that as well. A
lot of different ways that you can figure out how to score other than shoot
3s. And I think that's one part of the game. But I think there is a lot of the
other parts of the game, I think the 15-foot pullup jumper is something you
don't see very often, if you can be pretty good at that, you can score a lot
of points and win a lot of games with the midrange jumper as well as the post
game.  
  
Q. Linda, you were part of teams that perennially went to the NCAA
tournament, went as far as the Elite Eight. It strikes me that sometimes it
can be easy to lose that feeling in a program and hard to get it back. Being
an alum and Colorado meaning so much to you, how do you use that to try to
accelerate that process to get that feeling back?  
COACH LAPPE: Well, I think we have to teach our players all about those years
and who came before them. They have to know the players that were able to
establish that tradition and that wasn't me. Those were players that came way
before I got there even.  
And so to start to teach them about the Colorado way -- and that's part of
that Colorado way, is, you know, here's what we have to do and here's how we
play the game and here's how tough we have to be.  
You know, I think the mental side of the game is a part that we are lacking
right now, and we're spending a great deal of time on that. You know, it is
not necessarily all about the Xs and the Os. You know, a lot of it -- there is
going to be a point in every game where you can go one of two directions. You
can either get better and rise through adversity or you can fold. We want to
be a team that gets better in those situations and continues to get better,
and I think that's what those Colorado teams in the past were able to do
because they knew that they had the confidence and the training that they had
been through, and they had confidence in playing on their home floor.  
So we really have to start to implement and teach our players all about the
players and the teams that came before them. And we've already started to do
that.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you need Brittany to get better also. She's done well
her first three years and she has a good work ethic. What specifically have
you challenged her with to do that?  
COACH LAPPE: We have challenged her first and foremost of going hard all the
time. It doesn't matter what drill, it doesn't matter what sprint. We think
she should win every single sprint. We think she should be the best defender
in every drill, and the best offensive player in every single drill and hold
her accountable to doing that every single time and not being okay with not
doing those things. She could be -- she could be one of the best defenders in
the league if she really wanted to and if she really put her mind to it. She
is strong, she is athletic, she is quick.  
When she gets into it, she has a defensive mentality. Offensively, she's got
to continue to get better at reading situations, being patient. Sometimes she
is a little bit impatient with her game and coming off screens too quickly and
those sorts of things. So really challenge her to just learn and wait, and we
watched some film.  
And then vocally, she needs to continue to get better. That's not one of her
strong suits, and she will tell you that. But at the same time, you know, she
says, well, they have never really asked me to do that and we're asking her to
do that this year. And I think she's poised to be able to lead a little bit
more vocally than she ever has in the past.  
  
Q. Is there some -- there is a lot of newness at Colorado, the new staff and
then next year new conference and how you sort of build even though you are
going to be experiencing a lot of new things in the next two seasons.  
COACH LAPPE: I think with anything new comes a lot of excitement and a level
of excitement that you don't necessarily get in any other situation. And so we
have to really use that and build on that and focus on that.  
And, you know, we -- we are in the Big 12 this year, and it is a great
conference. We know if we prepare to do well in the Big 12, that we will be
just fine in the Pac 10. And we focus on one day ahead and we can't focus on
-- too much further ahead than that. We just have to continue to get better
every single day. We have to use all those new experiences and new things that
are to come to really get us excited to be where we are.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2010

  

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome. We are ready to start. We are now joined by Coach
Bonnie Henrickson from Kansas. And, Coach, your opening comments and then
we'll take some questions from the floor.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Sure. It is a pleasure to be here. Good morning to
everybody. Everybody had some coffee, I'm assuming. Ready to get started.  
On our end, I'm very, very excited for a couple different reasons. We've
gotten ourselves healthy over the offseason. Angel Goodrich is cleared and
competing in practice. It has been exciting with our new legislation that we
have been able to start a little bit sooner here and probably had six or seven
practices under our belt by now, which is a little bit unique to what this was
a year ago.  
It has been exciting to get her on the floor. Excited to return Carolyn Davis
and Monica Engelman now returning sophomores, two young woman who finished and
had a fantastic finish to their freshman year. And the experience that those
two gained and in situations we put them in at the end of the year to take
shots and make shots to win games to make them more confident and more
experienced sophomores than had some of those situations not happened at the
end of year to injuries to some key players.  
We got four freshmen, and I have reminded myself daily that I live to tell
about Danielle McCray, Sade Morris, Kelly Kohn, and LaChelda Jacobs, being
freshman at the same time four years ago. So I live to tell about that. I
promised myself I could do the same thing with this group. I love their
energy. I love their competitiveness. We get better every single day and they
are a fun group to be around.  
Aishah Sutherland in particular in the junior class had the most impressive
offseason of everybody we have had in a long, long time from a strength and
conditioning standpoint. She looks good. She has always been very, very
athletic. She finishes stronger right now than she has, so she has had a great
summer between her sophomore and junior year. Tania Jackson locally from
Lawrence, Kansas, is healthy off of her red shirt year. It was good to get her
back in the mix to give us some added depth at the post position.  
So it has been exciting. Every day it is exciting when you have that many
young players. If you look at our most experienced returning players being
Monica and Angel, we are young. But youth won't be an excuse for us. We will
play hard and we will compete. And then we will rely on our seniors, Krysten
Boogaard had a great summer. She stayed on campus in June. Went up and played
and trained with our Canadian national team in July. And did some really good
things and has come back with more confidence.  
And then Marisha Brown is the other senior in that class. Again, gives us a
great rebounding guard, a tremendous defender at that position, looking for
her to help us a little bit more in her senior campaign.  
  
Q. You have had a week to practice now since we last talked to you. What
have you seen so far? Who is standing out? Are you impressed with what you
have seen?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I have been. I think Brooke Jelniker in the freshman class
has been the most consistent. She has shot the ball really well. She spent a
lot of time this summer in the fall working on just changing her shot just a
little bit. She has seen the benefits of that which means we will see the
benefit of that. She's probably taken and made the most 3s in practice right
now, which we need her to be a spacer.  
The kids that are good off the dribble, Keena Mays, Diara Moore, CeCe Harper,
those kids are learning to understand the pace and what the defensive pressure
in practice is like at this level. And on occasion, they have been able to
throw some pretty nice passes. It is just the consistency. We are not very
consistent yet with those young kids.  
But Carolyn and Krysten for the first week of practice, those two shot over
60% from the floor. It is important for the young kids -- if I am a young
player in our program, there are two things I could do to get on the floor.
That is guard and throw it inside. You can figure those two things out, you
have a chance to play for us right away. We have done that.  
Angel's play-making ability, Monica's leadership and her ability to get out
and guard. She has got to be a better defender for us this year and anticipate
her being able to do that for us.  
  
Q. You have been asked this a thousand times, I will be 1,001. What is Angel
Goodrich's return? What does it mean to your team?  
COACH HENRICKSON: This changes how we play and having -- been able to have her
on the floor for 15 games last year and our field goal percentage in the post
were at that point Aishah is in the top three in field goal percentage. She
starts the year shooting over 70%.  
Angel plays how we play because of how we play in transition. It allows us to
make plays off the dribble. She's -- she is as good as anybody in a long, long
time and anybody I have ever coached about beating her guy, making the next
guy play her and making the right decision, making the right pass. She is the
quickest player to 100 assists in the program's history in 15 games. And she
allows us to get uncontested shots which these young kids are going to need.  
She can challenge the defense. We have added some kids that I think can space
the defense which allows her more room to make plays. The most obvious is in
transition because as soon as she went down, it didn't take long for -- and
not by design, we didn't run as hard in transition, we didn't get out, didn't
look for the ball because it wasn't going to come. Not like it had with Angel
for the first 15 games.  
Just our willingness and the anticipation of us -- someone being able to get a
pass and uncontested shot when Angel had the ball in transition, I think these
players, the kids here at media day today, even when she joined us in pickup
it changed again back to how it needs to be and how she allows us to play in
transition. Getting numbers, attacking the defense when it is most vulnerable
in transition. And then being able to make passes that a lot of people can't.  
  
Q. What about the different -- you guys were able to do this last year, but
you didn't do it this year, the different types of lineups you can put out on
the court and how that might help you in terms of the different type of
opponents you have to face, especially in the Big 12.  
COACH HENRICKSON: Right. I think it will be important for us. Two things --
and one requires the freshmen playmakers that we brought into the program and
let me address the second first and I will go back to the playmakers.  
It will be important for us having spent some time in the off season look at
how can we play Krysten and Carolyn together. Krysten -- Carolyn is very
talented and Krysten is very, very talented. Right now when one plays the
other one doesn't. It doesn't make sense for quality post players in our
league.  
So at some point, who is going to take advantage of their advantage? Do we
take advantage of the fact we have got two kids that have great size and great
skill and let them play together. And then does someone try to take advantage
-- one of those guys will have to guard somebody on the perimeter or do you
change up your defense a little bit?  
That is something we haven't done that we will do, and we have been working on
already. Those two have played really well together. And then the playmakers
like Keena Mays can make a play and put it on the floor and make a play. CeCe
Harper has played a lot of point guards. We really have three point guards on
the program right now. Keena is a talented kid from Timberview. CeCe is from
San Antonio. If two of those three are on the floor, we can go closest guard
to the rebound can go outlet and go in transition, where in the past with
Angel, it is always we wanted Angel to have the ball in transition.  
Now Angel can play in a wing and let her go make a play and get ahead of the
defense even more as an outlet up the floor. So those two things based on
personnel will allow us to play a little bit differently.  
  
Q. Could you just comment a little bit about just the conference as it kind
of shapes up and on paper, just how tough Baylor appears to be with all those
starters back.  
COACH HENRICKSON: The league is great again. And that's what's exciting to
coach in this league.  
It is as good as it has been. I think there is even more balance this year.
Obvious with the finish -- the run that Baylor had and all the experience and
the players they bring back from that team, they're very, very talented. You
know, but what's exciting about the league is night in and night out you are
challenged. There are no nights off in this league and I think that's what
people don't understand outside of our league, that there are no nights off.  
It is a league where you have got to learn to bounce back quick because if you
take a loss and carry it in your backpack, it gets pretty heavy and it doesn't
take long for it to get heavy. You have to be able to bounce back and have the
resiliency and that's where your upperclassmen can help you with that.
Sometimes when they are young, they say, Who do we play next? So there is a
trade-off with your seniors and your freshmen.  
The league is grade. The players are great. The coaches are great. It is
talented and it is competitive. It is exciting. Baylor had a tremendous run,
but there are a lot of really good teams in our league.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2010

  

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Gail Goestenkors from the University
of Texas. We would like to welcome you. Get opening comments.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Well, I can't believe it is another season. It goes so
quickly, it seems. Just very excited as always for another season to begin.
And it is going to come fast and furious. And I think -- well, that depicts
the Big 12, fast and furious.  
Once again, I think we all feel we have got the best league in the country.
And I'm excited about my team. As most of you probably know, we have had some
setbacks with some injuries in particular with Cokie Reed. So we will change
our style of play a little bit. We thought we would be a big strong power team
with Cokie Reed and Ashley Gayle on the inside. So we are a little thin and
small in the post. Really only got two legitimate post players, which makes us
pretty small.  
So we will do some different things. I have got five freshmen, six newcomers.
So we are going to change things up a little bit. Run probably more than we
have in the past and use some traps and some different presses to try to
utilize our speed and our guard strength. I feel really good about our guards.  
All of our returners, I think, have definitely improved. They're bigger.
They're stronger. They have worked really hard in the weight room and with
conditioning. So I think we will be a very aggressive, very scrappy team,
which we will need to be. We really don't have a lot of depth, especially at
that post position.  
We're excited, the team's excited. I think they are in better shape than they
have ever been. They have worked harder than they ever had. At the end of last
year, we said if you want to get more, you got to give more. I think these
young ladies have certainly already given more in terms of getting themselves
ready mentally and physically for the rugged and brutal season that we have.  
  
Q. I can't help but think everything you said right now you could have
applied to your 2002 Duke team that ended up with eight kids. It seems like it
was a slasher team. You didn't have a lot of size. You had to play well
defensively in system. Do you sort of see some comparisons? And you have also
had teams where you had big players. So you see the comparison of what you are
going to be doing this year as opposed to maybe what you thought you were
going to be doing.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: It has been an adjustment. But I always -- I love
challenges and see them as opportunities to grow as a coach. So we've had to
kind of go back to the drawing board. I have watched a lot more tape recently,
especially since we knew Cokie wasn't going to be playing with us. And just
trying to find the best way to utilize the talent that we have.  
And I have never thought you needed 15 players to be successful. We all know
that come tournament time and in the big games, you probably play seven or
eight players really quality minutes. So that's what we're going to just start
off with. Usually you finish off with that. We are beginning with that.  
So they know they have to be in great shape. But I'm excited about the
opportunity to kind of turn these kids loose a little bit. They love the new
transition that we're really focusing on. Any kid loves to shoot (smiling).
Right now we are getting a lot of shots off. And hopefully we will get a lot
of makes off as well. We are not to that point yet. So we are still adjusting,
I think, to the up tempo.  
  
Q. Obviously you can't play through Cokie now and don't necessarily have a
true point guard in the starting lineup. So who do you play through, if
anybody, and who is your go-to player?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I think it's going to be a variety, I think. Ashleigh
Fontenette is -- even though she is not a true point, she is a combo point
with a scorer's mentality. And she's -- I thought she got so much better
through the course of last year. It was tough on her because she hadn't played
the point since middle school. I think she took some lumps last year.  
She learned so much, and she is a supreme athlete. And I think a supreme point
guard now. I think she is going to be as good as any point guard in the
country this year. So she's somebody we're relying on. And we expect big
things from her, and she expects them from herself.  
And then Kat Nash, she has always been a steady scorer for her, and I have
talked to her. Really, Anne Marie and (inaudible), and they should make the
most shots on our team. I'd rather have a contested shot from them than a
wide-open shot from some of the young ones that don't know any better yet.  
We are focusing on getting the balls in their hands. Kat will play all five
positions. You might see her. One minute she will bring the ball down and
start our offense. That's one of the things we are doing because we don't have
a lot of point guards on our team, anybody can bring the ball down the floor
with the exception of Ashley Gayle and Anne Marie Hartung, our two post
players.  
Kat may be playing the center position for us, but she may bring the ball down
the floor and start our offense. So we are going to give some people some
different things that they have to defend as well. We know we are not as deep
in the post, so we are going to utilize and force them to defend us on the
other end of the floor.  
  
Q. You kind of talked about it just briefly, but obviously you want to
create mismatches when you guys are on offense. But just in this league,
especially with the size inside, just talk about the challenges you will be
facing and how much they will be on Ashley from a defensive standpoint to not
get in foul trouble and try to be a force in there?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: We have talked to all of our returners in particular
because they are the ones that have those experiences and know what it takes
to be successful in league and we told them they can't get in foul trouble.  
We will be very aggressive and we will trap more and run more. We also have to
be the smartest team that we have been and Ashley Gayle can't afford to get in
foul trouble. She is a hot blocker. She has to be very, very smart (shot). We
will play more zone probably this year than we have played since I have been
here because there will come times when we will have to protect her inside.  
  
Q. What's it like having seven newcomers? Is there a feeling of freshness?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: We have six newcomers. One of the walk-ones has walked on.
But there is an excitement. I haven't had this many in I can't tell you how
many years. You probably know more than I do.  
There's such an excitement about them. I was talking to Kat the other day
about our leadership and some things, and she said, you know, there's -- the
freshmen want to be led. They have high energy. They work so hard and they
want to be led. So it's really a great feeling. You have to have great
leadership. But you also have to have followers. And I think that's something
that we haven't had necessarily, and this year we definitely have both. So it
is a real good feeling, it is a fresh feeling.  
  
Q. This thing with Cokie is fairly recent. How much extra time, long nights,
have you had to put in to do -- to implement all the things you just spoke
of?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: It's been -- our entire staff, I think we have done -- we
have had a lot of long nights and a lot of discussions about what are our
strengths now, what are our weaknesses now. As any coach would, you are trying
to really make sure you utilize your strengths and we have, I think, great
guards, very strong, physical -- Ashleigh Fontenette, Yvonne Anderson,
Chassidy Fussell, who you haven't seen yet, she's a freshman, Tiffany Moore,
those four guards are as strong and athletic as any guards that we will see.
We have got to utilize those guards.  
And then with Kat we have somebody that's so versatile that can play so many
positions, that's where we're going from. And then a great shot blocker
obviously in Ashley Gayle. We have talked through things, really trying to
scrutinize our team and understand fully what our strengths and weaknesses
are.  
  
Q. Gail, you talked about the injuries obviously and that has been a setback
for you. When you look back at it, even though you have been a regular NCAA
team, has it been more of a struggle at Texas than you thought it would be
when you first took the job? Were you fairly realistic about where things
stood?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I don't think I was realistic. You know, I think any coach
that's been successful expects success and expects it immediately. So I think
we have been successful being able to get into the NCAA tournament these first
three years. It wasn't as easy -- it was a struggle, especially that first
year. We had to win maybe -- I don't know what -- six games in a row to get
into the tournament. But I think we all -- if you are a winner, you have high
expectations and you expect to win immediately. So it has taken longer, but
now I think I have a better perspective on it. I understand how far we truly
had to go and also that we are going to do things the right way and sometimes
that does take a little bit longer.  
I have come to terms with it now.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2010

  

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Bill Fennelly from Iowa State.
Welcome. And your opening comments?  
COACH FENNELLY: Good morning, everybody. Certainly appreciate you being here
and it is always fun to come to Kansas City. This is a very, very special
place, a place that loves women's basketball and great facility here. Like
everyone else, we are excited to start the new season and certainly appreciate
all you do for our athletes and what you do is important. Certainly not just
for our league but for the kids that you cover. So thank you very much for
being here this morning. Enjoy your day.  
  
Q. You mentioned facility, two questions. One, how's your facility? And
then, two, you talk about this facility but you don't play here. Do you like
Minneapolis and would you like to play here? Would you like to see a separate
week? Talk about facilities.  
COACH FENNELLY: Our facility, I think, will be ready. The people have worked
very hard to get Hilton ready to go. As far as I know, we have an exhibition
game November 4th and we are anticipating playing. It might not be completely
done, but we can play there as far as we know.  
I think any time we can come to Kansas City, I love coming here. Our fans love
coming here. I think Minneapolis is a great facility. I love playing there. I
have a lot of fond memories. Certainly the Sprint Center is one of the nicest
arenas in the country. If we could play here, great. I don't -- the court is
the same. I'm in the minority maybe worrying about where you play, what you
play.  
But I am totally -- the first question I am going to get in trouble of the
year. I am absolutely, totally against separating the tournaments, have been,
always will be. This is basketball. It is a week of basketball that our fans
love, look forward to. People plan their vacations around a week of Big 12
basketball. It is a special time of year. So I certainly hope they always do
it the way we are doing it now.  
Like at home, they don't ask my opinion.  
  
Q. You are probably the most prolific Tweeter in the Big 12. Can you talk
about the philosophy behind your Twitter and who you recommend following?  
COACH FENNELLY: Who do I recommend following? Darren Lavelle is a great guy to
follow if you are a Twitter person. Business guy, has a great business mind
for sports. So that's one of the people. And, of course, the Big 12 always.  
You know, it is just something I fell into. I really don't know why I started
doing it. I enjoy it. I think our fans like it. I think our fans like to be
engaged. I love talking about sports. I love talking about St. Louis Cardinals
baseball. I love talking about anything Iowa State. It has probably gotten me
in trouble a few times by some of the comments I have made.  
None of them are malicious, but it is who I am and I like to be engaged with
people on a daily basis. And it is fun. I enjoy it. My wife hates it. She
thinks it is stupid. But I really do, I enjoy doing it.  
Number one, it is a way for our fans to be connected to our program on a daily
basis and feel like they know things about our team and makes you feel like a
normal person because unlike most coaches, most people don't think coaches are
normal and have a life. I think it is encouraging to show people that you do
have other things besides basketball that you're passionate about and you
enjoy. I enjoy doing it. It is fun.  
  
Q. The point guard question, that's obvious Lacey went on to win a WNBA
championship this past season. It just seems like this is a little bit
different situation. Sometimes when Iowa State has been in, you maybe have
more answers in the post than you do immediate answers at guard.  
COACH FENNELLY: You are exactly right. It is the first time in my 16 years at
Iowa State that we don't walk into practice feeling like we have a point guard
that is really good. I mean, every point guard we have ever had at Iowa State
has been drafted. It started with Tara Gunderson and all the way through.  
It is the first year where you don't have someone like that. We have five
people we are trying. And it will be a little bit more by committee than in
the past. I like the kids that we're using, Chassidy Cole has done a good job,
Lauren Mansfield will probably be the two people that have the best that have
a best chance. Kelsey Harris is a freshman guard from California, is not a
point guard by nature but I think she can play the position.  
Alison Lacey, we recruited her as a small 4 and she turned out to be a first-
round WNBA pick as a point guard. Practices are harder. I could leave practice
last year for 20, 30 minutes and come back and Hoss would say, We are fine,
you can go back. This year I have to be there more and act like I know what
I'm doing.  
But we'll find someone. But you are right, for our point guard to be a good
player, the players around them have to be better. Kelsey Bolte, our post
players, Jessica Schroll, if those kids do what we are supposed to do, our
point guard play will be enough to have a chance to be successful.  
  
Q. Kim Mulkey was up here saying she thinks she has probably the most
talented and deepest team she has had at Baylor. I guess, what's your
perspective how salty they might be?  
COACH FENNELLY: I'm on the preseason -- I do the ESPN Top 25 poll, I voted
them second in the country and I believe that. They are. They're very
talented. I think -- obviously they have the most unique player maybe in the
history of the women's game in Brittney Griner. When Melissa Jones is healthy,
that's a kid that changes their team.  
We beat Baylor at our place. Melissa couldn't play. And I think that kid
changes their team, changes the dynamics of how they play, her competitive
spirit. She acts, she plays like Kim played. So I think you put her on the
court with those other kids, they are, there is no weak spot on their team.
And you are talking about a team that it is a lot better. And oh, by the way,
they were in the Final Four last year. Without question I think they are a
team that has a chance legitimately to the be a National Championship
contender and certainly -- and I think -- I have been in the league a long
time, longer than anyone.  
And so my reward this year is we get to go to Baylor to start the Big 12
season on national television. So I want to talk to the Big 12 people
afterwards over here to ask how that happened.  
So we get them right off the bat. So get it out of the way.  
  
Q. Baylor is the team to beat. Who looks like the top challengers in your
opinion to maybe contend with?  
COACH FENNELLY: The two teams that I would say have a chance -- and you are
talking about a 16-game schedule. I think Texas A&M is very, very talented,
well-coached, play a different style. They will certainly be there at the end.
I think Kansas is a team that will be very good. They're deep. They're strong.
They are in the post. I think last year unfortunately for Danielle McCray, she
got hurt. Those kids played at the end of the year.  
I can see them like Nebraska. Two years ago Kelsey Griffin got hurt, all those
kids had to play a lot key roles and, by the way, you throw Kelsey Griffin on
their team. I think Kansas is that kind of team.  
When I did my poll, I did Baylor, A&M and Kansas.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2010

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Kristy Curry from Texas Tech University now. We will
let Coach Curry make a couple of opening comments and then we will take
questions.  
COACH CURRY: We are extremely excited. For the first time we have everyone
healthy. We have put our third class back to back to two other really good
classes, so we are really excited about what this season holds.  
Have a couple of transfers blended in with everyone back and healthy and our
four freshmen. Again, we are extremely excited and looking forward to heading
over this weekend for scrimmage and then opening up at New Mexico on November
12th.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just getting to start practice a little bit early with
the new rule this year and how you're scheduling things. Do you like the
earlier start?  
COACH CURRY: I love the earlier start for one year. I think that it allows you
to take more of a poised approach where you can definitely give the kids more
days off for more fun events. We are able to take Saturday off, our only home
football game in October.  
So for reasons along those lines, we are able to give our kids fall break for
one of the first times. So those reasons, I think, it is extremely early. I
think it is going to make for a really long season, so as coaches you kind of
have to slow down and make sure that you give the kids a break along the way.
But, you know, we have our 12th practice tomorrow, obviously going to Canada.
We had ten practices with our upperclassmen and five with our freshmen. So we
feel like we really have had a great jump-start to our season with the
Canadian tour blended in with the fact we got it started a little earlier.  
I also like the fact that the first week of October everyone gets tired of
your conditioning coach. That gets old. So being able to put the ball in their
hands, you can tell they have enjoyed that aspect of it. So there are
positives and negatives.  
But overall, we are really excited about having 15 bodies out there and that
we've gotten to take a chance also to take a deep breath and give them a
Saturday off and give them fall break.  
They seem a lot happier when they come to practice.  
  
Q. Do you think the Rangers can do it tonight?  
COACH CURRY: I'm a little worried about C.C. Sabathia. I actually was married
to a Ranger season ticket holder when we first got married, but he doesn't
have season tickets in Lubbock. We did get a chance to see them play three or
four times this summer. But a big Rangers fan in my house. I hope they win
tonight, but I feel good if they don't. They get to go back to Texas.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your upperclassmen this year and what you
expect from them in terms of leadership. You have a lot of young players that
need to learn the reins.  
COACH CURRY: We are definitely a young basketball team. We don't see that as a
negative. We don't see the fact that you may say that's inexperience. We
started three freshmen at the end of the season with Monique Smalls and Chynna
Brown and Christine Hyde.  
But I am so pleased with our leadership. Jordan Barncastle, Kierra Mallard,
Lindie Kimbro are all juniors. They really have taken on a leadership role.
They have embraced that role. That's part of the reason they came to Texas
Tech. They understood the situation they were inheriting. And you couldn't
have a better leader in Barncastle. Someone that certainly is the kind of role
model and also vocal leader. She leads by her actions. She is a tough, hard-
nosed country girl, so that fits well into Lubbock.  
Really pleased as well to have Monique Smalls, our point guard, who is a great
leader. Both of them are with me today. They are an action vocal workaholics.
Those are great leaders for us. We have one senior, Teena Wickett who I think
will possibly maybe be the newcomer of the year by the time we get to March. I
realize probably no one has a clue who she is or what she's about. I think she
too will provide some leadership because she is so hungry to play.  
So I think we're good in the leadership role even though we are a very young
basketball team. We are very experienced. We have been through a lot. They
will thrive upon their past experiences and we have had a great off-season.  
  
Q. I know Nebraska last year kind of showed what their recruiting and what
they're building toward could finally come to. Do you feel like you guys with
another top 100 coming in November and the good recruiting class you have this
year will get you to that point pretty quickly?  
COACH CURRY: Well, I will say I have so much respect for Connie and how she
has built that Nebraska program. She is certainly an inspiration to me being
in the situation we were in and seeing her in her seventh -- I think it was
her seventh, eighth year being able to accomplish that Big 12 title. It takes
time in this league.  
You know, it takes back-to-back-to-back classes. I love our sophomore class.
It is special. We were able to back up that junior class with Jordan and
Kierra and Lindie and then we were able to sign, you know, a couple of players
in this freshmen class now with Kelsi Baker who was a top 100 prospect, Ebony
Walker out of Sandy and Albuquerque, and probably the surprise of the class, a
young lady out of Clovis, Antiesha Brown has been amazingly surprising to me
as far as how much she has adapted to the system so quickly.  
And then Haley Schneider at 6' 6", a local prospect for us, who has a long
tradition with her mom being in the Hall of Fame and playing at Tennessee.  
So, you know, those four really get it and have really backed up. And then we
will sign another top 100 prospect in November. We only have one spot. That's
what it takes, especially in the Big 12 South.  
THE MODERATOR: You had an injury last year and she sat out. Tell me about her
progress.  
COACH CURRY: Shauntal Nobles really would have been a big presence for us
inside. We don't look back on that. She really embellished the situation last
year and put herself in a position to learn the system. And she looks great.
She really has impressed me as far as how she has responded just being a
first-year player. She's going to play an awful lot of minutes and be able to
play Kierra a few less minutes.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2010

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Sherri Coale from Oklahoma. Coach,
your opening comments?  
COACH COALE: Excited to be back in Kansas City, ready to kick off the 2010-11
season. I really like my young guys, been on the floor with them just a little
bit. Six new faces, which is a lot. But I like them. I have enjoyed teaching
them. I love our leadership. Great seniors and seasoned veterans to go with
those new guys, so the teaching should move along at a good pace and just
enjoying where we are right now.  
  
Q. Talk about the prospect of three Final Fours in a row. We were talking
with the girls about it. Been kind of two different teams, two different years
you were a number one seed. Last year you were a Cinderella. What would a
third Final Four mean?  
COACH COALE: That would be rare air, that's for sure. It is one of those
things that when you are in the midst of it, I'm not sure you realize the
significance of it. You step back and you look at how hard it was between 2002
and 2009 to do that again. Boy, it takes on a whole new level.  
You know, for our young guys, Whitney Hand and Jasmine Hartman, they think
that's all you do, you go to college and you go to the Final Four. This is
fun, this is great. For guys like Danielle and Carlee, they understand it is a
little bit more difficult than that.  
I think our guys have a great appreciation for what we have done. I have a
great amount of gratitude for their teammates and the way things have gone the
last two years, from two completely different circumstances to be able to end
up there.  
I think the greatest thing that comes from that is their sense of confidence,
that anything is possible, it doesn't have to go this way or it doesn't have
to go that way. We can make something really good happen. And I think they're
still really hungry, but that's the thing about it. If you go to two in a row,
it is great, it is awesome, you appreciate it. You understand what a special
thing it is, and then you are also irritated because you got to go and you
didn't get to win. And it is not very much fun.  
I can say the first time in 2002 it was really fun to go and we were very sad
that we didn't win. But it was just the coolest thing I had ever been through.
And then in 2009 we go and we lose, it is just awful and you don't want to
stay for any of it, you don't want to hear about it and you want to try to get
started to get back there and you want to win. That's how we feel right now.
Let's get back there and let's win there.  
  
Q. Talk about your post play specifically. With Abi rerouting and Amanda
Thompson. Who steps in to fill those roles this season?  
COACH COALE: We were fortunate in the fact that Joanna McFarland developed and
grew right before our very eyes over the course of her freshman season. I
thought you could watch her late in the year game by game getting better and
getting more comfortable and more confident.  
Jo is a warrior. She is a kid that will fight you. She will find a way to be
successful. She won't be the biggest kid, won't be the fastest kid, but she
will win. She comes from a household that is accustomed to competing and we
know that's what we get from Jo.  
I speak about her mainly there because you mentioned the post presence of Abi
and what Amanda brought. And Jo is somewhere in between those two kids. She
doesn't have the size of Abi. Doesn't quite have the athleticism of Amanda
and, yet, she does many of the things that both of those kids did for us last
year.  
When you move past Jo, Lyndsey Cloman is developing as a sophomore. We have a
freshman, Nicole Griffin to 6' 6". I don't know if she is the tallest player
we ever had, but she is the longest one. And Jelena Cerina who is 6' 5". So we
have a lot of different-looking post players who will do different things and
our team will move around differently based on whichever one is in the game at
a given time.  
  
Q. Last year's time, you had the opportunity to play a variety of different
ways. You could go small and quick. You could go big. You could go half court.
What defines this team this year?  
COACH COALE: Too early to know yet, truthfully. I know what will define this
team is great point guard play. Danielle Robinson is going to break people
down off the dribble and late in a shot clock or late in a game, and everybody
will run to the sides of the floor and Danielle will try to make a play. We
did that a number times last year. It was my best coaching move. Get out of
her way and let her score.  
We know we have that. I think there are question marks in terms of our three-
point shooting. We have got kids that can do it. They have to do it when the
lights are on and everybody is looking. They have to perform. I think in terms
of comparison, I had several questions at the back about the way we played in
2002, the way we played in '09, the way we played in '10, the different types
of teams that went to the Final Four.  
I think this particular team will be more like the 2002 team in terms of style
of play. Our most talented kids are our guards right now. We have a lot of
different guards who can do different things and a crew of post players who
can rotate through and give us different looks. I do think we will be
versatile. We can put a really fast lineup on the floor, which is not
something we have been able to do year in and year out. We can go with some
size if we need to have 6' 5" Jelena and 6' 6" Nicole on the floor. We can do
that and Carlee has a great size as a wing. We can do some different things.  
Style-wise, you know what I hope is that we are quintessential Oklahoma
basketball, compete like crazy and share the ball and find ways to win games.  
  
Q. What about the football game Saturday night?  
COACH COALE: I love the Sooners and the football game on Saturday night. Are
you kidding me? Bob Stoops for president.  
  
Q. General big-picture question, the sense of this being the last two years,
in the end, yeah, UConn wins again, they have lost three starters from last
year. They have the streak going. Baylor is going to face them early. Your
thoughts over all? Do you think the streak will end any time soon?  
COACH COALE: Well, I think Baylor versus Connecticut is a great way to kick
off the college women's basketball season. I think it will be a game that
draws great interest. I think Baylor has great pieces and parts to go against
Connecticut.  
I think that one thing that makes it a particularly interesting matchup is the
fact where Connecticut may be a little bit vulnerable this year due to the
graduation of Tina Charles. That's Baylor's area of strength with Brittney
Griner. It will be an interesting matchup. I think it will be a great game for
our sport.  
As far as whether or not Connecticut loses then or loses in early December or
loses sometime in February, eventually they will lose a game. I don't think
anybody should run out and feel sorry for Geno because Tina Charles graduated.
Lots of talented basketball players on that basketball team. Last time I
checked Maya Moore was still on the team.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2010

  

### [Kurt Budke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14197)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're up here with Coach Kurt Budke from Oklahoma State. Coach,
welcome. And your opening thoughts before we take questions.  
COACH BUDKE: Obviously great to be back in Kansas City. Me being a Midwest
person, I love this site and love this tournament. I think it's an awful
special place to play basketball, always have and always will.  
I doubt there's very many people that are going to sit up here today and talk
about losing the all-time leading scorer in the Big 12 and losing 15 points
and 19 rebounds a night and then also tell you that they're having the most
fun that I have had in a long time.  
We've got a very young group, one of the youngest groups in the Big 12, if not
the youngest. And we're -- but they are practicing so hard right now. And I
think they just see an opportunity that maybe you wouldn't have at another
program right now that have a whole lot of people back.  
And we're having a great time. And, you know, Andrea Riley, how do you replace
Andrea Riley? Well, you don't. She's an unbelievable player, an unbelievable
person. And we just try to do it with everybody else getting a little bit
better. And Toni Young, Lakyn Garrison, and Precious Robinson, those people
stepping up a little bit.  
You know, people talk about Andrea, but they forget about Tegan Cunningham,
too, who I thought had an unbelievable senior year with us last year, too. So
it is going to be interesting. I don't have any predictions, but we are sure
having a good time.  
  
Q. Kurt, do you have an example of the basketball team in the past, college
or professional, that lose a great player or a star player and then they are
okay or pretty good the next year?  
COACH BUDKE: I wish I had an example of that. I don't. I can't think of that.
I mean, I -- I mean, no, I really don't. You are talking about not just one,
you are talking about two great players. Tegan Cunningham was playing as well
as any wing in America at the end of last year. She went down to Australia and
is tearing up it up.  
You are talking about two great players. We ran -- everything ran through
Andrea. That's probably the difference between what we lost and other teams
have lost that we're trying to think of, is that they probably didn't run
everything through them.  
Like a Kevin Durant from Texas, he receives on the receiving end. Well, Andrea
led us in assists, led us in scoring. And when other people got shots, it was
because of her. She had great assist totals last year, too.  
So I doubt there are very many examples of what we're going through right
here. We've chosen to go with youth instead of going out and trying to fill it
with a JC kid or a kid we think maybe had 60 games under their belt in junior
college. We just decided to do what we did with Andrea four years is throw the
keys to her and let's see what happens. That's what we're doing. We've got two
freshman point guards on campus that we really like. What I hope is that
people, they compare these freshman point guards to Andrea when she was a
freshman and not when Andrea was a senior. That's what I'm afraid they're
going to do.  
No, I can't think of an example that was as unique as ours.  
  
Q. Obviously when you have someone who took all those shots and scored all
those points, somebody else is going to get those shots and get those points.
Do you have any idea who that is or is it wait and see?  
COACH BUDKE: Well, one of the things that I think helped us last year -- I
mean, we weren't really excited about at the time, but playing that first
round NCAA tournament game without Andrea last year, you know, it gives us an
opportunity -- a kid like a Toni Young to step up and go get 25 points and
figure out that, you know what? I can do it.  
All the kids that played last year, again, I think they hesitate a little bit
looking to score because you had Andrea and Tegan out there and in their mind,
they thought they were better options.  
I think that Chattanooga game really helped us. I looked for Toni to step up
and Lakyn to step up. We didn't get Lakyn Garrison enough shots last year. We
will get her more shots.  
Precious Robinson had her best practice of the year yesterday. She had some
very good time in the league last year. All the kids that are back, we all
hope they step their game up a little bit.  
You will see a lot of freshmen out there for us this year. You might even see
five freshmen on the floor at one time.  
  
Q. When we were walking up here we were talking about Keuna Flax. Can you
talk about her and what excites you so much about her, a player nobody has
really seen yet?  
COACH BUDKE: She is a tremendous scorer. As coaches, we are looking for people
that can finish and put the ball in the hole.  
The problem is she blew her knee out last year, sat out, red shirted. She is
coming back this year. We really thought she is the best scorer in the gym
again. She breaks her foot and she is out till Christmas at least.  
So, you know, we all -- we need scoring in this league and she is someone that
can do it. She is like a Danielle Green that you remember. She is that kind of
player that can just get it done in a lot of different ways. We are just going
to have to -- not even think about that right now. Find other people to step
up and get it done. Hopefully she can come back and help us.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of leadership, losing Tegan, losing Ally, losing Andrea,
losing Megan, who is your biggest leader? Who do you see stepping up and
taking those four guys' places?  
COACH BUDKE: I think Lakyn Garrison has done a wonderful job in practice
leading by example. I would like her to be really more vocal. It is not really
in her nature, but nobody outworks her every single day.  
And I think my two freshman point guards have been leading by example, too.
And it is hard for freshmen to jump in and be the leader and get up -- get on
the upperclassmen.  
But I think those two will earn the right because of their work ethic every
day. So at this point -- you want your point guards to be the captain, the
quarterback. And I think those point guards ultimately will before the year is
done.  
  
Q. Speaking of Lakyn, what, in terms of on the court, is she a leader? Do
you feel her stepping up and being that person on the court?  
COACH BUDKE: I think she is someone -- she is just such a solid person that
she is really -- she doesn't make very many mistakes in my eyes on or off the
floor.  
And I think the girls, especially the young ones, recognize that. And when
Lakyn talks, they listen because she does things right all the time. So I
think that's -- she is the one that can still go to another level for us and
help us with that.  
  
Q. Talking to Lakyn and Toni over there, they said you guys are doing
everything a lot more athletic, a lot of running and getting harder on
defense. Is that something that you think goes with athleticism with a
freshman, or do you want to play more full court this year?  
COACH BUDKE: Well, we didn't have the ability to press as much as we'd like
to, pick up full court as much as we would like to because Andrea would love
to go for the steal and before you knew it, she would have two fouls in ten
seconds. We didn't pick up much because she had to be on the floor. I think
you will see a different style from us this year, kind of how my teams played
at Louisiana Tech. We will cause a little more havoc in the back court.  
And I think we have the depth to do it finally. So, I think they see more of
the running right now just because we're playing at both ends harder than we
did in the last four years.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Tiffany Bias and what she brings to the
program.  
COACH BUDKE: I have never had a kid in my life win sprints by 20 feet every
time that she runs a sprint. It is unbelievable.  
I mean, she's -- I don't know if you can be as quick as Andrea was, but this
kid is fast. And, I mean, her work ethic is that she never wants to finish
second. She always wants to win every sprint, win every race. Be first in
line. That's what we are hoping for out of a freshman point guard.  
Her and Carissa Crutchfield out of Ft. Gibson, Oklahoma, have both worked that
hard in the fall so far. But I think they're going to give us the ability to
pick up and get after people more than we've done in the past. And we have
never had a lot of great depth at the point, and I think we do now.  
  
Q. Do either one of those two remind you of Andrea when she was a
freshman?  
COACH BUDKE: Tiffany does. Tiffany, again, has that little jet in her that she
can get by people. She is not afraid to shoot a three-pointer three feet
behind the line if she thinks it is a good shot.  
The thing that Tiffany does a lot better than Andrea is play defense. And so
that's also exciting, too.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will ask everybody to introduce yourself, your year, your
university, but also add your hometown and how many people were in your
graduating class from high school.  
Lakyn, do you want to start?  
LAKYN GARRISON: I'm from Wickes, Arkansas. That's my hometown. I play at
Oklahoma State University. I am a senior this year, and I graduated with 50
students.  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: Hello. I'm Dominique Kelly from the University of Nebraska.
I am a senior, originally from Lincoln. And I graduated with about 15 to 1,600
students probably.  
MONICA ENGELMAN: I'm Monica Engelman, I am a sophomore from the University of
Kansas. And I graduated from San Antonio, Texas, with about 900 students.  
SYDNEY COLSON: I'm Sydney Colson from Texas A&M University. I'm a senior. I'm
from Houston, Texas. And I think I graduated with 900 people. I don't really
remember.  
KELSEY BOLTE: I'm Kelsey Bolte from Iowa State University. I'm from Ida Grove,
and I graduated with about 70.  
MELISSA JONES: I'm Melissa Jones, I go to Baylor University. I'm a senior from
Thornton, Colorado and I think there is a little under 500 in our graduating
class.  
  
Q. You are a veteran up here, Melissa. I want to ask you a question first.
Following off of something that Coach Mulkey said when she was up here giving
the synopsis of the team this year, she said you are a player that has
tremendous drive that will not want to stand on the sideline, even though you
have greater depth and talent than Coach Mulkey has ever had at Baylor. What
is it about your makeup, your personality that allowed you to overcome the
injury last year, to help your team get to the Final Four and then this year
with all the talent you have, what is it that's special about the way that you
play that stands out to all of us that watch you?  
MELISSA JONES: Did she pay you to say that?  
  
Q. No, she didn't.  
MELISSA JONES: I don't know what it is. I think I just -- the love for the
game really. I just -- I love basketball, and I love just being out there,
playing with my teammates and knowing what kind of potential we have and just
wanting to do the best that we can.  
  
Q. Is there something specific about your drive or what motivates you? A lot
of times there are things that have happened to us in the past that bring out
the best in us when we step on the floor.  
MELISSA JONES: Well, you just never know when the abilities you have can be
taken away from you. And so I think just knowing that there is people around
the world that aren't as fortunate to be able to be playing or being able to
play at this level even and just go ahead and using that ability to its full
potential, I guess.  
  
Q. Dominique, this summer you went to the NCAA in Indianapolis to be a part
of a leadership conference. Can you tell us a little bit about that experience
and some things that you took away from that.  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: Yeah. I attended the Career and Sports Forum in
Indianapolis. I was there for about four days. And I'm interested in pursuing
that profession of coaching, so I went to the coaching aspect of it.  
And I just listened to coaches from all sorts of sports share their
experiences, how much time goes into it, and I also did a lot of networking
and met a lot of really awesome people.  
  
Q. Lakyn, you said 50 people in your high school graduating class. We hear
that you are a big hunter and fisherman. Tell us about your experiences, where
you grew up and some of the other things that you do to hone your basketball
focus out on a boat.  
LAKYN GARRISON: Well, all there really is to do beside hunt and fish is play
basketball. The gym is the only big facility we have. That's where I spent
most of my hours, I enjoyed playing the game. That's all there was to do.  
I was telling my teammates on the way up here, I was telling her the closest
mall is an hour and a half. You don't have much of a choice but to go out and
fish. You don't have a choice but to like those things.  
And I was telling a story about my first cast when I was about 5. My first
cast when I started fishing, I didn't get the line out and I pulled it back
and the hook got caught in my eyebrow and my grandma had to pull it out with
pliers. So I had a pretty bad experience the first time, but I have come to
enjoy those activities other than basketball. But there is not much to do
where I'm from.  
  
Q. Do you actually get in a stand and hunt deer? What do you hunt? And from
a fishing standpoint, I have never met anybody who fishes that doesn't have a
big fish story to tell.  
LAKYN GARRISON: I really -- I am a horrible fisherman. I try. I really enjoy
it. I do the whole worm thing. I put my worm on the hook and whatnot.  
But I have killed two deer, no bucks. One buck that I did shoot at, I couldn't
find it. But other than that, I mean, I just -- I just do it to pass time most
of the time because there is nothing else to do. But I enjoy it.  
  
Q. I love watching the reaction of everyone else as they get to know each
other better up here on the stage. We need to do this more often. We need to
do this throughout the season. Monica Engelman is sporting a new haircut this
year. Decided to go with the Mohawk. Is this the Jayhawk Mohawk that you are
sporting and why did you decide to make the change?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: Over the summer, me and my teammates were going to go
swimming. I kind of woke up and I was like, I am kind of bored. It was really
random. I hadn't planned to do it. I woke up and it was spontaneous and I got
my haircut before we went swimming. I tried to grow out my hair, but it got
annoying with the curls and flipping. So I am going to try to keep it
throughout the season.  
  
Q. Will you ask your other teammates to do it?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: I wouldn't dare.  
  
Q. You will not ask Bonnie to go with a faux hawk?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: No. I think she should keep her hair that she has now.  
  
Q. Sydney, you have battled some injury throughout your career. You have
shown tremendous leadership on the floor. You guys have a lot of talent coming
back. You always talk about how your family inspires you. What is special
about your family that is such an inspiration for you as a player?  
SYDNEY COLSON: It is just I grew up, I guess when I was around 10 years old my
parents separated. Just seeing my mom, she is such a hard worker. She fought
for everything she needed and she really inspires me and makes me want to do
better in whatever I am doing.  
My brother and sister are always there. My dad are always there to support me
in whatever I want to do.  
In high school I didn't really want to play basketball my senior year. They
were there to support me whether I wanted to or not.  
I think really it is just having their support and having them to have the
best for me, wanting me to do whatever I feel is right. I go out and play for
them most of the time really.  
  
Q. Family is important from you, too, Kelsey. You said you are from a very
small town, Ida Grove. Iowa State Fair is a big deal. You were telling me
earlier about some interesting activities in your county fair. You want to
share with everybody?  
KELSEY BOLTE: I can say exactly what Lakyn said. There is not much to do. So
when you have the opportunity to go to the county fair, it is something
completely different. Like I was telling you earlier, they have different
things, like hog and pig wrestling where you can do it with one of your
friends and compete for T-shirts or prizes or trophies or just gift
certificates around town, which in Ida Grove isn't a ton. (Laughter).  
But it is just something fun you could do with your friends in high school. I
don't think I was ever part of a winning group because at the end it would
just be a part of where you would just want to throw the other person into the
mud or push someone else's face into the mud or most of the girls were scared
of the pig. It was fun.  
  
Q. So the hog and pig wrestling, does that get you ready for action in the
lane in the Big 12?  
KELSEY BOLTE: No.  
  
Q. Monica plays a couple of instruments, including the guitar. Dominique,
you are a pretty good player.  
SYDNEY COLSON: I play the harmonica.  
  
Q. Anything else? Backup singers? Dancers? I think we might get a theme
here. We could develop a Big 12 band. What is it about music that you two
enjoy?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: Well, I listen -- I listen to a diverse mix of music. And I
don't know, it's fun for me. I was in jazz band when I was growing up and I'm
attracted to the sound of the guitar. It was just fun for me and easy for me
to pick up so it kind of stuck with me.  
  
Q. What do you play? Do you have any original music?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: I make up stuff. I don't really write songs or anything like
that. I'm into metal, I'm into rock.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Why don't you sing us a little something?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: I can't sing.  
  
Q. We are looking for theme music for the Big 12 basketball. Maybe you can
collaborate on something there. What about you, Dominique?  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: I don't sing, but my sister sings very well. So it is just
kind of a little inside joke that her and I have going on. She gives me a hard
time about it. That's it.  
SYDNEY COLSON: I do sing.  
  
Q. What do you sing?  
SYDNEY COLSON: In the shower. I got to be in the shower.  
  
Q. I personally know all the girl parts to "High School Musical" at my
house. Kelsey, everybody played in the band. Didn't we all play an instrument
in the band?   
KELSEY BOLTE: I did. It was just the first year, fourth grade, we get the
option and you get to pick your instrument. And I picked the French horn. It
didn't stick with me.  
MONICA ENGELMAN: I love the French horn.  
KELSEY BOLTE: I didn't work real hard with the notes. I gave it up after the
fourth grade year.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Didn't we all get a recorder?  
  
Q. You have been on some missionary trips, Melissa. Can you tell everybody
about what you have done with that.  
MELISSA JONES: Sure. This past summer was the second year that I went to Kenya
in Africa and we were actually in Nairobi. It is just such a great experience
to get over and set up sports clinics, go to some orphanages, schools, and
just play with some kids and really to spread God's word and have a good time.  
  
Q. How long were you there?  
MELISSA JONES: About two weeks both times.  
  
Q. Kelsey, the devastating floods in your community and how those floods and
the changes that happen in your community, how has it affected you guys as a
team? Not just your day-to-day and practice and things you had to do, but just
overall the camaraderie of your team and inside the community because Ames is
such a wonderful basketball town.  
KELSEY BOLTE: I think that's something everyone asks me, whether it is at the
grocery store, at Wal-Mart, a fan comes up to me and asks, Is Hilton going to
be ready, how is everyone doing?  
That's one of the biggest things. We are not really -- the biggest thing is
not knowing if we will be ready or if it will be ready. But the people are
doing a great job getting it ready. Hoping for sure that we will be in there
for our first game. Especially for the volleyball team and their seniors on
their team, you kind of feel for them because they have played in Hilton all
four years and having to play not somewhere where they have a really good fan
base. Now they are playing where they don't get as many fans or can't fit as
many fans, I should say. Really feeling for the volleyball team. Hopefully
they will be able to get in there by early November. Keep your fingers
crossed.  
  
Q. Does that mean we will have new luxury suites, new media accommodations
for Ames?  
KELSEY BOLTE: Probably not for you and me. But maybe in a couple years.  
  
Q. Dominique, I was thinking about wearing that same shirt but I'm glad that
I didn't today. Showing off your guns. I know you are a very strong athlete.
Why don't you just brag a little bit. Can you tell us what you bench and what
you squat, some of your top lifts.  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: Griesch was having a really hard time coming up with a fun
fact about me. I decided to go ahead and let him put that I can bench over 170
pounds. But I was kind of born like this. I had these muscles when I came out
of my mother's womb. So Nebraska has just helped me be able to tone up.
Thanks, Griesch. (Smiling)?  
  
Q. Lakyn, something that everyone wants to know is what Oklahoma State
basketball is going to look like without the Big 12's all-time leading scorer
in Andrea Riley. What will we expect to see in terms of style of play or
anything new? I know Coach Budke has done a great job of getting you guys
ready with a scheme and system. What will be new and different?  
LAKYN GARRISON: First of all, you can't replace Andrea Riley. She is a very
great player and I enjoyed playing with her very much.  
We do have a young team. However, this team is very talented, they work
extremely hard. I have never seen a group of kids work so hard. Being that I
am a senior, you know, I'm very fortunate to have such a hard-working team. As
me being -- fixing to leave, they come with energy every day. Our chemistry is
wonderful. I think you are going to see a lot more defense out of us. The
girls are very quick, and their passion for the game is really high.  
So, I mean, you are just going to see a whole different team. We are going to
move the ball. Everybody is going to get to shoot.  
  
Q. We can all laugh at that because that is funny. Everybody will get to
shoot.  
LAKYN GARRISON: I mean, we don't have a scorer like Andrea Riley. You have to
pass the ball. She did what she had to do last year which was shoot the ball.
She is very good at it.  
This year we are going to have to work the ball around to get shots up.  
  
Q. No question a great player and one of the greatest we have seen in the
history of the Big 12. Your range, am I going to have to carry a tape measure
with me all season to measure how far beyond the arc you are going to be
dropping 3s?  
LAKYN GARRISON: You can bring one. I'm anxious to see. I really don't know how
far some of my shots. I know I am way back there.  
  
Q. There are a couple of players in the league that I need a tape cache for.
Maybe Kelsey Bolte. 84 3s last year. Can you get 100?  
KELSEY BOLTE: I can try. I will take 100, I know. (Smiling.)  
  
Q. Monica, I know you are not allowed to do this anymore, at least during
basketball season. I understand you are a skate boarder.  
MONICA ENGELMAN: I'm an ex-skate boarder. I'm retired.  
  
Q. Are you going to pick it back up after basketball is over?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: That's something I would have to worry about after I
graduate. I had to retire that. I haven't been on a skate board since my
freshman year in high school when I got serious with basketball. That's
something that I think can be put on hold until afterwards.  
  
Q. Is that something that you were pretty serious about?  
MONICA ENGELMAN: Yeah, I was a tomboy growing up. I was always with the boys
in the neighborhood. And as soon as I woke up, I would be outside skating. And
it was something that I was really passionate about, something I can do, go
out and find. I wouldn't be in trouble. It was something that I loved and
enjoyed.  
  
Q. Besides Monica, everyone else is a senior. Postgraduate expectations,
plans, Melissa, next for you?  
MELISSA JONES: I was hoping to win the lottery. (Smiling.)  
  
Q. You didn't eat anything this year or do anything crazy? I know you can't
jump out of an airplane anymore, Coach Mulkey cut that off.  
MELISSA JONES: Yeah, right. Haven't done anything like that since.  
  
Q. What would you like to do?  
MELISSA JONES: I don't really know. I mean, if I could still play after, that
would be great. But I just don't know what's in store for me. It is still a
big question mark at this moment.  
KELSEY BOLTE: Same with her. If I have the opportunity to play, I definitely
will. And I'm not really sure otherwise if I don't have the opportunity. I
guess I will have to start searching for a job. I don't really want to go home
and live with my parents.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Yeah, I want to play overseas if I can or find a good man
that's willing to take care of me for the rest of my life. (Laughter).  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: I am actually hoping that Coach Yori is going to find me an
awesome graduate assistant job somewhere. That's my plan.  
LAKYN GARRISON: I'm in the same boat as them two. I really am not sure what I
want to do. I may want to counselor coach, but my ultimate goal is to go to
law school one day eventually before I die.  
SYDNEY COLSON: That's good before you die.  
LAKYN GARRISON: One day when I have time.  
  
Q. Sydney, we also know you want to go into broadcasting. Have you had a
chance to have any experiences in front of or behind the camera there at A &M?
  
SYDNEY COLSON: Wade Robinson works for FSN, and I got a chance to watch some
Astro games and went to see everything that went on behind the camera. Even
though I want to be in front of the camera, I guess I want to do some work
behind if that's possible. And, you know, he was just showing me the ropes a
little bit, introducing me to people.  
Whenever he is in town in College Station, he told me he will let me come on
the truck and see everything that happens. So I'm blessed to have that
opportunity from him.  
  
Q. We heard about Kelsey from Twitter that maybe you were hypnotized at your
high school prom or something like that.  
KELSEY BOLTE: I was hypnotized.  
  
Q. Tell us about that experience, any funny stories you want to share or
that you were embarrassed about?  
KELSEY BOLTE: I wasn't on stage when I got hypnotized, but all of a sudden I
would pass out in the audience. So everyone is pointing at me that I was
hypnotized. They snapped me out of it. I got back on the stage and they told
me to come up. And I think -- like, I started crying when I was hypnotized.
Someone was killing puppies, so I was devastated.  
And they told you to imagine you are in a convertible and you are driving down
Sunset Boulevard and I was making a fool of myself. You are supposed to act
like you were at a strip club or something like that and there was people
around me throwing dollar bills out. I was so embarrassed when everyone told
me what happened. I started crying because of, like -- someone was -- a puppy
got hit by a car or something. It was awful. It was so embarrassing.  
  
Q. And then, Melissa, congratulations, we hear you have just been nominated
as a student-athlete representative to the homecoming court, is that
correct?  
MELISSA JONES: Yeah. I don't know how that happened, but --  
  
Q. It speaks to a lot of things about your character and how you represent
Baylor, doesn't it?  
MELISSA JONES: Unless someone like Coach Mulkey had something to do with it or
it is a big prank.  
  
Q. There is one coach in this league that has been a former homecoming
queen. I won't tell you who it is and see if you can figure it out before. I'm
not saying right now.  
SYDNEY COLSON: In the south or the north?  
  
Q. No hints. It might have been Coach Blair actually. He might have been in
the homecoming court, I'm sure he was during his day.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Homecoming queen for sure for him.  
  
Q. How much does he talk to you guys about the ties he wears? We know his
ties are something that's really special and important when he is getting
ready for a game.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Sometimes he doesn't run the idea by us. I wish that he would
because we would tell him what we thought and help him out a little. He
doesn't talk about his ties. Sometimes they are nice.  
That one is nice, Coach. I like it. Give me some playing time, yeah.
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. I think you have already earned your playing time.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 20, 2010

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Gary Blair from Texas A&M
University. Coach, welcome. Your opening thoughts?  
COACH BLAIR: It is nice to be up here with you again. You are the only person
here that's older than I am. Everybody else looks a little bit younger than
us, Peter. It is good to be here, it is good to be back in Kansas City, next
to Dallas and College Station, this is probably one of my favorite towns.  
We went to the Final Four here in '95. We won the Big 12 championship last
year and two years prior to that my wife got her doctorate here. We are always
looking for somebody for the Texas Rangers to beat and it is usually Kansas
City. I am a Rangers fan, by the way.  
THE MODERATOR: How about them Rangers?  
COACH BLAIR: That's why I am doing the morning so I can get home and see the
game in the afternoon. We are hoping to win it in five to rest our Cliff Lee
so we don't have to pitch him.  
  
Q. Who is your Cliff Lee on this basketball team this year? Who is the
player you can count on to get it done?  
COACH BLAIR: I think it is going to have to be Sydney Colson because she's
healthy for the first time and she is such a fun person to play with, to coach
and to be with off the court.  
I think you are going to -- she doesn't have Danielle Robinson's speed, but
she is probably about a step behind once she is healthy and can go. She is
just quick with the ball. She makes things happen.  
It is hard to have one player. I mean, Carter and Danielle Adams aren't bad
either. But you ask for one, I gave you one. But she's a pretty special
individual. Some day she is probably going to be in Peter's place up here
because the kid's a communications major. She is very, very good at expressing
herself. And like on Friday afternoon, we had the Aggie 100 -- top 100 Aggie
entrepreneurs all over the world. She will be one of the leaders up there.
They use ten students, and Sydney will be one of them that will be calling the
names out of these people that are receiving the award. She is a special young
lady.  
  
Q. Who is the Josh Hamilton on your team?  
COACH BLAIR: That's got to be -- that's probably got to be Maryann Baker, even
though she is not putting -- Maryann Baker is one that will run through that
wall. The problem is she has run through too many of them in three years and
has not been healthy.  
This year she is healthy. She is ready to go. She is going to be competing to
start at the three position for us, bat third like Josh. But she will do
whatever it takes for her team, a very good team-oriented player, a very good
leader that none of y'all have ever heard anything about because she has never
been in a press room after a ball game.  
But I promise you, she will have a good senior year, if we keep her healthy,
and you will get a chance to talk to her in person.  
  
Q. Colson has been a team captain for four years. You already said she is a
Cliff Lee. Do you think she is the point guard of your team? Talk about how
she is going to lead the squad.  
COACH BLAIR: Well, she is going to be playing more than 22 minutes a game this
year. We have been sort of sharing -- because we -- Colson couldn't go for 40
minutes. This year she is going to be up in the 30-minute range and we will
probably be backing her up with Adrienne Pratcher and playing Carter more at
the two position. And sharing that position with Tyra White or moving Tyra
White down to the three spot.  
But you are going to see Carter more of a scorer this year and more of a
defensive stopper.  
Colson, I think to win at the highest level, you cannot play your point guard
22 minutes. She has got to be out there on the court longer. That's where you
win championships is at the point guard position. And I think she is going to
be a good one.  
And I think we also have some five players this year that can score down low
instead of just defend. And I know we will in a couple years, but she's going
to be very good for us. And I think her assist total will go up to around 150
range instead of the 120 or 30 or where she's been.  
  
Q. Gary, I won't ask you who your Benjamin Molina that is on your team. But
I did want to ask you about --  
COACH BLAIR: God, he's slow. Do you see how slow he is? (Laughter.)  
My gosh, he didn't even get a chance to get down to second to break up that
double play last night because, my God, he is slow but he can hit. Don't throw
him a fast ball.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about Karla Gilbert because obviously even with the
success you had --  
COACH BLAIR: That's Molina. (Laughter). That's Molina.  
  
Q. What kind of low-post presence will she bring? She is a freshman
obviously. She has got an awful lot of talent?  
COACH BLAIR: She is 6' 5". She is a great kid. Her dad was a very good player
at A&M, Jimmy Gilbert in the '80s, and her mom was a very good player at North
Texas. In fact, I recruited her mom and lost her. I was at Stephen F. Austin
at the time. She chose to go to North Texas. I kid her mom all the time, I am
wearing rings and you just got a degree.  
Karla has got great hands. She was MVP. Correct me, in the McDonald's game or
the WBCA game, one of the two, she was -- no, she was MVP in the state Texas
All-Star game but she played in the other two games. Had 15 in one of them.
She needs a little bit of room. She is not going to be as quick as, say, a
Griner is, but she has got the size and she has got the bulk.  
We just got to get -- we are not going to get her faster. We just need to get
her quicker at getting to spots. She plays hard every day and she's got to
give us at least 15 minutes a ball game, regardless of how well she plays or
how bad she plays.  
She has to give us 15 minutes because of the size of the Big 12. Everybody has
sort of changed their recruiting because of Griner coming in. Colorado has got
a 6' 7", Oklahoma has got 6' 5" again, Oklahoma State has got 6' 6", Iowa
State, they are all large.  
But the game has changed, and we are trying to change with it to be able to be
able to do something with the Griner factor that everybody has to face.  
And so we've got size and we've got size coming, and that's the good thing.
And now I have been playing small ball for so long and playing my five player,
taking charges, running the floor and all that, we're going to have to make a
few adjustments ourselves.  
But Karla is a great kid. You are really going to love her. She has got a
nice, quiet, soprano-type voice. I want her to growl and get a little meaner
in there. She will work on that.  
  
Q. With Danielle Adams, I know you are still pushing her. You want more
consistency, more fitness, more to be there all the time. Can she reach the
level that you want her to reach in this season?  
COACH BLAIR: I hope so. As some of you know, sometimes it's tough for that kid
that's had a weight problem all her life to consistently lose that and all of
a sudden, all of a sudden there is training camp and all of a sudden you have
got to be in shape and the whole nine yards.  
She is a kid that's always played well by being overweight, okay? What can she
do if she ever gets down to the weight that I would like to see her at? I'm
not sure. It might happen when she gets to the pros. I'm not sure. You saw it
happen to Ashley Paris. She had a very good career after that. You saw it
happen to Abi Olajuwon. She is still playing.  
So sometimes -- this is a kid that has so much game, I mean, she is the best
passer I have ever coached for a big player. And she loves the game. She knows
the game. She can shoot it. She can drive it.  
But I hope not to have to play her at the five spot this year. But due to
circumstances, due to who we are playing, you might have to see her down there
some. But if that happens, you tend to get into foul trouble in this league if
you are playing the five against some of the giants that are in this league.  
But Danielle has got such a big heart. I have used the analogy before, she has
got a George Foreman personality and a Charles Barkley's game. And someone
that I coached in 1994, Leslie Johnson who played at Purdue, but Leslie was
strictly an inside player. Leslie had a little bit of that weight problem, but
she was all Big Ten, I believe, for four years.  
A little bit of the same type but Danielle is more of a perimeter player than
an inside. And Leslie Johnson will wear you out inside. If you want to go back
even further than that, Pam Kelly, Louisiana Tech 1980 to '84, won a couple of
National Championships with a young lady like that. But she was also strictly
a five player.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will do a very similar format to this morning where we have
the student-athletes get to provide some stories that may be different than
what you typically cover or maybe just some of the off-the-court sort of
things.  
We would like each of the players to start with the typical, tell us your
name, your year and your university, but also tell us your hometown and the
number of people in your high school graduating class.  
RAESHARA BROWN: My name is RaeShara Brown. I go by RaeRae. I'm a senior at the
University of Missouri. I am from Little Rock, Arkansas. I had 863 in my
graduating class.  
KATHLEEN NASH: I'm Kathleen Nash. I am a senior from the University of Texas.
I'm from Plano, Texas, and I had over 1,000 in my graduating class.  
JORDAN BARNCASTLE: I'm Jordan Barncastle. I'm from Texas Tech. My hometown is
Martin's Mill. And I'm a junior and I graduated with 26 in my class.  
BRITTANY SPEARS: I'm Brittany Spears. I go to the University of Colorado, and
we had a lot, like thousands, like 9,000, 10,000. I don't know. I don't know.  
  
Q. You had a big high school?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: We had a big high school, so I don't know.  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: I'm Carlee Roethlisberger, I'm from the University of
Oklahoma. I'm a senior. I'm from Findlay, Ohio, and graduated with a class of
around 500.  
JALANA CHILDS: I'm Jalana Childs, I go to Kansas State University. And I'm a
junior. I'm from Orlando, Florida. And I graduated from a class of over 1,000.  
  
Q. Variety of backgrounds and that's what brings us together. Jordan, we
will start with you. With people in your class now, that doesn't make this any
less significant, that you were President of the senior class, President of
the National Honor Society, president of the student council, vice president
of the science club and you want to major in premed. Sounds like you have a
pretty good idea of where you are going and particularly how it relates to
this team, about being a leader for your team with Texas Tech.  
JORDAN BARNCASTLE: As you said, those things in high school, they're a little
bit insignificant, in my opinion, for 26 people in my class. But leadership on
the court-wise, we only have one senior on our team. And me being a junior
kind of puts me in that leadership role just because of my age.  
But I think that the fact that I have been here for three years, which is most
on our team with transfers and underclassmen and things, I think that it is my
year to step up and lead the team on and off the court.  
And I'm trying to make things happen, surprise some people.  
  
Q. Jordan, I have you beat. I had 21 in my high school class. So you can
come from small beginnings, right? RaeShara, I know that you like to travel a
lot and your family went on a lot of family vacations. Where was the favorite
place that you went on a family vacation? And why is it your favorite?  
RAESHARA BROWN: I think that my favorite was when we went to Kissimmee,
Florida, and we drove a little ways to Orlando and went to the Island
Adventures. That trip was my favorite because we actually won YBOA national
championship that year. The theme park was amazing.  
  
Q. Did you drive there?  
RAESHARA BROWN: We did take a bus trip there, 18 hours. That was a lot of
bonding and a lot of extra stuff you would get to know about people that you
probably shouldn't know (laughter).  
  
Q. Carlee, please tell us about your experiences in Haiti and what you saw
and how you were able to bring some of that back to your community.  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: As a team this past summer, we went to Haiti and did a
mission trip with the Mission of Hope there and just got to do -- it was an
orphanage, a school and they also have a church on-site.  
Basically, our job was to minister to these little kids and just to bring joy
back to their lives through the game of basketball.  
  
Q. You ran several clinics. What did you do in your downtime when you
weren't on the court?  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: We were just playing with them, anything we could do.
We took bubbles, we took jump ropes, took extra basketballs. So anything
between that -- some of us took a day to do some work, they had medical
supplies that were shipped there that they had in boxes there that had
expiration dates that were coming up and they had no idea what they could do
with them.  
A lot of us took time to organize those so they would be able to help them.  
  
Q. When you experience that as a team and as a group, how does that come
back to helping you guys put things together from a chemistry standpoint on
your own team?  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: Definitely, it was a bonding experience. You do a lot
of team retreats and things like that, that bring you together, but it is just
a whole other level. People's -- different sides of people, they just open up
and their eyes are open to seeing things that a lot of us would never
experience. And we were able to do that and to be able to share that, it's
something that is going to affect the rest of your life.  
  
Q. Brittany, I want to talk to you a little bit about your academic journey.
Before you came to Colorado, you went to a year of prep school and now at
Colorado, you are scheduled to graduate on time this spring in sociology. So
tell us a little bit about how your journey through the academics, what it
means to your family and how it's been to get to the point of being able to
graduate on time?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: It is a big deal for my family because they want to see me
graduate. I had lots of support system, so everybody helped me. My tutors and
everybody at school just helped me get through this.  
  
Q. Just the fact that you took that extra year with prep school to get
ready. Has it been easy, has it been challenging, how has that part of your
journey been?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: Mostly with basketball and get away from home, like the home
sickness went away when I went to prep school. So when I got to Colorado, I
was fine. Because at prep school, I was like crying and wanted to go home and
everything. But as soon as I was there for a little while, I was fine. I think
it helped mostly with my school, of course, but mostly my home sickness went
away.  
  
Q. Kat, I was disappointed to find out that Zig Ziglar has moved out of the
neighborhood. I was looking for something inspirational from you to share. You
are a finance major. You had an internship this summer. Tell us a little bit
about that.  
KATHLEEN NASH: I interned with an investment banking company downtown in
Austin. It was just a good experience to be able to get out into the finance
world and carry over some of the stuff that you learn in the classroom. It is
pretty boring in the classroom and you don't really know how it will ever
apply. It was --  
  
Q. It is the real world, Kat?  
KATHLEEN NASH: It was nice to see how it transfers over and work with people.
It helps mature you.  
  
Q. When I think about finance, it makes me think about numbers and for you
the number I think about is 47% outside the arc last year, which was third in
the nation. How do you improve upon that and how will that factor into your
team this year?  
KATHLEEN NASH: I mean, we have a very versatile team. We have different
things. We like to run and we have Ashley Gayle in the post. So, I mean, I
tried to expand this summer going deeper, which is usually something I don't
do. Hopefully it will just be an outside threat, to pull people away from the
basketball and give Ashley Gayle some more looks inside.  
  
Q. I must be on an academic theme. Jalana, you actually changed your major
this summer from nutrition and exercise science to --  
JALANA CHILDS: Well, my freshman year I was nutrition and exercise science.
After my first kinesis class, I was out. I changed to sociology, which I
didn't figure was going to get me anywhere. Hotel and restaurant major now.  
  
Q. To catch up, you took 20 hours this summer. Did you have time to do
anything else besides go to class this summer?  
JALANA CHILDS: No. I actually -- I was in study hall every single day, night
for hours and hours. I lived in the ALC, the athletic learning center. It was
a struggle because I -- I didn't go home for that three-week break after
school ended. And I hadn't seen my family in so long.  
I was just like, basketball is the only thing I have. I had school, actually.
I had an inter-session class that was from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. So that was fun. I
was really focused on basketball.  
  
Q. Fun?  
JALANA CHILDS: I was really focused on basketball and I would get stressed
because I had tests every Friday in biology and I didn't know what I was doing
in that class. I had breakdowns every single week this summer. When it was
over, I was hallelujah. It was a struggle. I did learn a lot about myself that
I can actually do it. I dealt with that stress and now I'm -- I'm back to 12
hours (laughter). I'm normal.  
  
Q. Coach Patterson runs a pretty complex offense, angles, spacing. I always
hear him bring up the same concepts. For you to carry that academic load, it
should be no problem for you to move into season with that very thick playbook
that she provides.  
JALANA CHILDS: You are right. I love being a junior right now because I have
learned so much from my freshman year and last year, not really being as good
as I thought I could be. And now I'm learning these concepts and I'm -- it is
clicking in my head. I'm trying to take that leadership roll-over, and it's --
it's hard, but I'm enjoying it.  
I'm excited for this season. Coach P teaches us a lot, and it is good to see
that we can actually learn and turn it over and be good.  
  
Q. It is amazing how you can learn some things as a freshman and then by the
time you are a junior you can actually vocalize to the rest of the team what
you are supposed to be doing, where you are supposed to be doing it and when.
Jordan, playing for your dad, your dad being a basketball coach, was there
ever a moment when you weren't talking basketball at your house?  
JORDAN BARNCASTLE: We actually had a rule at my house that we couldn't discuss
controversial basketball topics at the dinner table, like, if I got in trouble
that day, I couldn't bring it up. If he was mad at me, he couldn't bring it
up. So needless to say, we finished dinner pretty quickly and would go into
the living room and talk about what we needed to talk about.  
Yes, there is another aspect to our relationship. I mean, typical father-
daughter relationship. We are really close. But him being my basketball coach
all through high school, it definitely brought us together overall. We had
those times where, you know, we butted heads and wanted nothing to do with
each other for that day. But all in all, it brought us closer together and
we're still close today and I think a lot of that has to do with basketball
from high school.  
  
Q. RaeRae, you are known for your defense and your tenacity. It is really no
surprise probably who your favorite football player is. But why don't you tell
people who that is and why he's your favorite football player.  
RAESHARA BROWN: I fell in love with Ray Lewis the year they won the
championship. He came out of the smoke and out of the locker room and he just,
like, had a different kind of -- just vibe about him. And he's very exciting
to watch. When he hits somebody, you literally cringe. And he enjoys it. And I
think to enjoy your job that much is something that's -- you know, just
amazing.  
And I feed off of that. You want to bring that same type of intensity and that
same type of excitement to the defense because defense is tough to play. It is
probably one of the hardest things to teach in basketball.  
And I think that if you have fun with it, you know, try to set personal goals
because Big 12 has some of the best offensive players. If you set a goal that
you are going to try to stop one of them, I think that's a pretty good thing.  
Take a lot of pride in playing defense. Yeah, I love the Baltimore Ravens and
Ray Lewis.  
  
Q. Carlee, I wonder who your favorite football player is.  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: Definitely not Ray Lewis (laughter). Ray Lewis scares
me as well and definitely cringe every time I see him come on the field.  
My brother, definitely. I'm very proud of him. And was happy to see him back
on the field this last Sunday.  
  
Q. We were, too.  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: Thank you.  
  
Q. We found out in our first session there is a lot of hidden musical talent
inside our student-athletes. We had -- Monica Engelman is quite the musician,
can play a lot of different things. We found some singers. I think there were
even a few dancers. We're working on this concept of a Big 12 band. We need a
theme song for the Fox Southwest Big 12 conference. Can any of you add?
Brittany Spears certainly has the name. Can you sing? How many times have you
been asked that question? A zillion times?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: A lot of times.  
  
Q. What do you say?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: I say yes sometimes, no sometimes.  
  
Q. I understand recently you had a little fun, Brittany, in the cafeteria
after a swim workout or something like that. Is that something you would like
to share with us, explain kind of the fun you had in the cafeteria one day.  
BRITTANY SPEARS: One day I was eating and I had my swim cap with me. And I put
it on my head in the cafeteria and I started going like this (indicating) and
talking about Michael Phelps and everybody started watching and videotaping.
It was silly.  
  
Q. It got you on YouTube somewhere?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: I hope not.  
  
Q. Back-to-back Final Fours, Carlee. What will be special about this year's
team?  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: We have six new girls coming in. We have one transfer
and five freshmen. So it is a lot of learning and a lot of teaching here real
early. We started off after preseason. We went to four days of a defensive
camp and four days of a motion offensive camp just to kind of get their feet
wet before we started practice. They are quick learners, and it has been fun.  
  
Q. In those four days of defensive camp, was there a basketball involved?  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: No basketball.  
  
Q. That doesn't sound like that much fun.  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: It was rough.  
  
Q. Jalana, I heard you are going to be the next American Idol. Why didn't
you jump up?  
JALANA CHILDS: No. I like to sing in the locker room to annoy my teammates in
the morning when we have some early morning workouts. I sing a little Alicia
Keys. My singing voice is terrible. Mariah White, I will put her out there,
her favorite rapper is Eminem. And I swear she knows every word to his songs.
And she -- when "Forever" comes in by Drake and Eminem, she is Eminem. She is
a rapper. She might get a record deal one day soon. I don't know.  
As for my singing, it is just in my dreams (laughter). I have no vocal talent
at all.  
  
Q. Jordan, high expectations at Texas Tech, a lot of new players.
Improvement every year for Kristy. This is her first team that will be all
Curry, if you will. What can we expect to see out of style?  
JORDAN BARNCASTLE: I'd say that what we bring is versatility and depth this
year as opposed to previous years that I have been a part of. We have new
freshmen. We have people who are now eligible off injuries last year. So it's
new faces to you guys but a few new faces from freshmen-wise. People who just
haven't been eligible but have had that year to grow and learn and gain some
experience in our program. And I think that this being the first full Curry
recruiting class team, I think it's going to be great and we have very high
expectations. Fell short last year and we're not looking to repeat that.  
And like I said earlier, I think we will surprise some people and open some
eyes.  
  
Q. Kat, there was a chance during your high school days that you could have
played another sport. You were an all-American in volleyball as well as being
a terrific basketball player and you still carry the same passion for the game
that you had when you made that choice to be a basketball player and not just
follow your sister who we will not see this year, right?  
KATHLEEN NASH: Right. I'm still very passionate about basketball. And I'm
still very happy with my decision to choose basketball over volleyball. I feel
like I've had a good career at Texas and I have been really happy to play
under Coach G.  
It wasn't as I was expecting, I would say, when I committed and stuff, but
everything's gone well.  
  
Q. Even though you and your sister were a year apart, you guys looked like
twins out on the floor. It would be hard sometimes to figure out which one --
you know what I am talking about? Which one is the shooter, which one is the
rebounder? You're both. What's your sister doing? Give us an update on her and
how she is carrying on in her life as a regular student.  
KATHLEEN NASH: She is in grad school -- advertising grad school at Texas. So
she's just studying all the time basically. She has a lot more free time, I'd
say. We still live together, so we see each other all the time, just not at
practice. We have a few hours every day where I go to practice and she just
does whatever.  
  
Q. I wanted to make sure Carlee we asked you the same question. You made the
same decision as far as foregoing a volleyball career and choosing basketball,
any regrets or any feelings about your choice?  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: Definitely not. I'd say to make it back-to-back Final
Fours is one thing. I don't think anyone could ever regret it.  
But make it to a lot of OU volleyball games, but you miss it, but definitely
no regrets.  
  
Q. Is there a chance in your fifth year that you would go play volleyball?  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: The thought has crossed my mind, but probably not.  
  
Q. We could break some news right now if you want to announce it.  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: I think I will wait until after basketball season to
make that decision.  
  
Q. We can finish up with just some of you seniors, others underclassmen.
What are your aspirations after your career is over? Just kind of go down the
line.  
RAESHARA BROWN: For me, I want to stay in sports. Right now my major is
nutrition and exercise fitness. When I get done playing basketball, I plan on
going into sports med for grad school and I want to think about becoming an
athletic trainer.  
KATHLEEN NASH: I'm actually not sure what I'm going to do when I graduate. I
will either get a job, maybe move somewhere like New York or something totally
different like that or I could continue playing sports. I am totally undecided
yet.  
JORDAN BARNCASTLE: I am hopefully med school bound and that's what keeps me
motivated. I'm a biology major.  
BRITTANY SPEARS: Hopefully I will play basketball. After that work with
juvenile kids. That's it.  
CARLEE ROETHLISBERGER: I'm hoping to go back to Pittsburgh and possibly work
with one of the three professional teams there in some way.  
JALANA CHILDS: I am hoping to stay in the hotel and restaurant business. I
mean, I've done an auction this past year at our school, and that was pretty
fun. It was basically event planning, but I definitely want to work for a
hotel. Hyatt maybe, Embassy Suites.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for your time. We wish you well as the
season moves forward.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  72  
Kansas State - 64

  
CHARLIE FISS: We offer our congratulations to Bill Self, the Kansas Jayhawks,
and our two student-athletes, Tyrel Reed and Marcus Morris.  
COACH SELF: I thought it was a really good championship game. There won't be a
better atmosphere in America for a final in conference tournament. Big 12
obviously did a great job putting on the tournament. Kansas City was a great
host and the Sprint Center is awesome. You had two of the best teams in the
country playing today. And we're fortunate to win, but feel really good about
how hard we competed against a really outstanding K-State team.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for our two student-athletes. Marcus Morris and Tyrel
Reed.  
  
Q. You've had three different leading scorers in three different games
against K-State. How difficult does it make it to prepare for?  
MARCUS MORRIS: It makes it very difficult. Sherron is our leader. Some games
he's going to be off. We still have Cole and we have X and still have a lot of
guys coming off the bench, and Kieff has been playing well and Brady has been
playing well, and I've been in a little slump with foul trouble. Guys keep
backing me up. And just having different leading scorers just show how deep we
are.  
  
Q. Tyrel, if you would, could you talk about your foul shooting tonight? You
were 7 of 9 and the team was 24 of 31. Offensively, what do you feel like you
guys did well that allowed you to get to the line and make those shots?  
TYREL REED: I thought we were aggressive tonight. Different guys stepped up
and took the ball to the basket and getting fouled, getting big rebounds. And
I was just proud of our guys knocking them down in tough situations and just
proud of them.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about how you feel about the team headed into the NCAA
tournament?  
MARCUS MORRIS: We feel great, you know what I mean. Today we're going to
celebrate and tomorrow we have the selection show. But Monday and Tuesday is
back to work. We can't dwell on wins, and it's just time to get back to work
after today.  
TYREL REED: Yeah, I'm just proud of our guys. I thought everyone came out and
competed hard today. They were really focused, and I think we have some
momentum going now going into the NCAA tournament. But we'll celebrate tonight
and starting tomorrow we'll start focusing for our first-round opponent.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, guys. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. K-State leads the nation in free throw attempts. Only 14 tonight. What
did you guys do to keep them away from the free throw line?  
COACH SELF: We played a lot of triangle and 2. We didn't give them much in
transition. They put so much pressure on you when they come with the full head
of steam. And a lot of their free throws are out of transition, where they
force help or attack the rim.  
And we did a good job of kind of neutralizing that. Then we played triangle
and 2 which created long possessions and a lot of jump shots. But still they
whipped us on the offensive glass, which is that's what they do.  
But I thought we competed hard, and even though, you know, we didn't foul that
much. We still had -- Cole fouled out and we still put them in situations
where maybe they could get to the line. The big key was the first half. We
shot ten and they didn't shoot any. So there's 8 points right there that
because we were 8 for 10, if I'm not mistaken. There's eight points right
there. That was really a bonus for us. And we, you know, they're so aggressive
on the perimeter, we did a good job driving pressure. And we did a good job of
sealing and throwing it in for the most part.  
  
Q. For a 40-minute game, was that one of your better defensive performances
this year, you think?  
COACH SELF: I think so. I don't know exactly. Because I'm kind of stubborn in
that regard, because we didn't play man the whole time.  
You know, if you talk about not fouling playing man and doing the same things,
I probably feel more proud. But we did what we were supposed to do. We played
to the scouting report very well. And for quick turnaround in a 45-minute
scout, that's all we did, just to talk about it. I thought our guys responded
to that very well.  
But we did compete hard. There's no question about that. Both teams competed
hard. A lot of 50/50 balls that went their way. A lot went our way. I thought
it was a hard-fought game. Wasn't much trash talking at all. Two teams
respecting each other. And fortunately we were able to pull out a victory.  
But nothing but respect for the K-State program. And to add, beating the Top
5, Top 6 team in the country three times, I think, also bodes well to how we
competed and played.  
  
Q. Could you comment, please, on the guard play that we saw tonight with the
seniors on both teams, Sherron and Denis, seemed like a pretty special night
for those two guys at the top of their game as seniors?  
COACH SELF: Clemente -- Denis is a good player. He's so fast. And he played
well. He had 17 and 4 and only one turnover. And Sherron didn't get a lot of
shots up but that wasn't his deal tonight. He had 12 and 7 and only one
turnover. But Sherron's had a really good tournament. He played really well.  
And hopefully -- he bumped his knee. Hopefully that's not an issue, but he's
hopefully on an uptick. But, really, he played well. But you could talk about
Tyshawn, how he played, didn't turn it over, handled pressure. You could talk
about -- Brady was a big plus for us.  
And then Tyrel was great for us. I mean, that's probably the best game he's
had since he's been at Kansas. So when you look at our guard play, I think you
could look at everybody and say that we played pretty well handling the
pressure.  
  
Q. Quick question, Xavier tonight didn't shoot incredibly well tonight. Do
you see him being an X factor for this team in terms of where he can go in the
tournament?  
COACH SELF: No, not really, because he didn't need to shoot well tonight. I
mean, that's kind of -- we always want him to make shots, trust me. And he's
as important as anybody making shots for us, because he's the guy that you can
run bad offense and come away with nine points in three possessions. And every
team needs a guy like that.  
But the way that they play, they don't really let you run your stuff. And
basically you just kind of have to go make some plays. So he didn't make shots
tonight, but I'm not sure he got three good looks.  
Because we were putting it down and driving it. So that doesn't concern me at
all. I thought he played pretty well. He just didn't score the ball. He was 1
for 5 the first half. Took two shots in the first possession out the second
half, and then after that he really didn't look to shoot the basketball, but
he really didn't have opportunities to because of the way we were playing. But
I still thought he played well.  
  
Q. It's always special to win a title, but is there anything extra doing it
against your rival?  
COACH SELF: Yeah, probably. I mean, you know, the K-State game in Manhattan we
could have gone either way, obviously a one possession game. The game at our
place was a tie game with about 17 left. So to me we haven't really shown the
way that I thought we were capable of playing, and they probably felt the same
way.  
And this is one of those games where, I'm sure Frank told his team the same
thing, hey, this game ain't going to affect seeding much or anything like
that. Just go compete and play for pride and have fun. That's what we told our
guys.  
And I thought our guys just competed so hard. But it would feel good winning
regardless of who you're playing. But having a chance to beat in what our
estimation one of the best teams in the country in a great atmosphere against
your state rival in Kansas City, I think, makes it a little bit more special
than if we had been playing somebody else.  
  
Q. As far as Kansas State is concerned, you said it spoke to what you guys
had done beating them three times but the fact how they competed against you
guys three times. How tough a team are they going to be in the tournament?  
COACH SELF: They're good. I don't know what seed they'll get. They're not
going to get worse than a 2. They're good. And whenever you have guard play
like they have -- and we were fortunate Jacob didn't make shots tonight, but
whenever you have guard play like they have they can beat anybody at any time.
Jacob didn't make shots but how about Samuels. We dared him to shoot it a few
times and he made us pay. They can score from different spots. They're always
going to guard you.  
I certainly -- I think their team could seriously make a Final Four run.  
  
Q. Bill, you've talked about how physical K-State is. In fact, you've said
they're the most physical team in the Big 12. Are there any teams in any of
the major conferences that you might see if you go deep into the tournament
that even come close to the physicality?  
COACH SELF: Oh, yeah, there will be somebody. But I don't study the other
conferences and I don't know -- I'm not going to name any schools off the top
of my head. But I don't know if we'll play anybody that pursues the ball like
K-State in the tournament. And we haven't been a great rebounding team in
stretches this year. Today we were much better. But still, yet, our first shot
defense was great. They still got 18 offensive rebounds. That's something that
-- that is one of their offensive weapons.  
We may use dribble penetration or throw the ball to the post or run a play,
one of their best offensive weapons is pursuing the ball when it's coming off
the rim. But they're physical, and depending on how officials call it in the
tournament, but the thing about it is when you are physical and have depth
inside, officials can't call them all. That's one great thing about having
four or five big guys, you can run those guys in and force the other team to
play your style. And they do a great job of that.  
  
Q. You mentioned the rebounding. There's been lapses at times this year. Are
there other areas where maybe these lapses, I guess they kind of concern you
or things to look out for going into the tournament?  
COACH SELF: We have a lot of things. We haven't defended man to man like we
can.  
There's a certain style of team that has a perimeter 4 man that screws up our
ball screen defense, at least we've got to really focus in on that this week.  
But there's a lot of things that we can improve. We made two 3s today. I'm not
sure that we're going to have a lot of success moving forward if we don't
stretch the defense from beyond the arc.  
But we just need to keep doing what we're doing and just continue to get a
little bit better and stay away from distractions and have fun and be
confident. If we do those things, I'm confident that we'll play well.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

## March 13, 2010

  

### [Frank Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17664)

### [Jacob Pullen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19462)

### [Jamar Samuels](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19463)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  72  
Kansas State - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: Frank Martin, student-athletes Jacob Pullen, who is a member of
the all-tournament team and Jamar Samuels. Coach, first for your thoughts.  
COACH MARTIN: Hats off to KU. These guys where our uniforms came out and
fought their tails off. I couldn't be prouder of a group of guys, the ride
they've given me up to this point in the season. KU is the best team in the
country. Every time we made a push today they answered. That's what makes them
so difficult to beat. They never give in.  
And we have to -- we've got to take this as a tremendous experience for our
basketball team, something to keep our heads up about, be excited about, that
we're competing with the best team in the country.  
And I'm not into moral victories. I just told the team, it's okay to hurt.
When you invest and take a chance on being special, you gotta understand
there's a chance that you might fall a little short of your dream, of your
goal. And when that happens, it should hurt. But once you get past that pain
you become a better person or a better team for your commitment and your
investment and your perseverance. And that's what we did today. Not into moral
victories; it's something that I've talked to you guys about before, and it's
something that we're not going to accept. But it's okay to hurt right now,
because we've invested a lot and we've taken a chance to be special. But
nothing to be ashamed of.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for the student-athletes, Jacob and Jamar.  
  
Q. Jake, you guys came off with two losses and make this run to the finals
here in the tournament. What does that say about how prepared this team is for
the NCAAs?  
JACOB PULLEN: I think we just do a great job of focusing. We understand that
there's quick turnarounds and we understand we have to prepare for teams
faster than normal. I think as a team we do a great job listening to the
coaches and coaching staff and giving in depth scouting reports and stuff like
that. We're able to put together things we need to do fast and we understand
them and we go out and execute.  
  
Q. Jacob, what's it like to go through this three times, the game plan, to
throw your guts out there on the court with these guys and come up short.
Right now what's the emotions?  
JACOB PULLEN: It hurts. You know, it does. It hurts. But we get a chance to
play next week. Hopefully, get a chance to start over and we just gotta win
six games. And we're capable of doing it. But it hurts to lose in the
championship.  
  
Q. Jamar, you guys both look like you took the loss pretty hard. Why does it
sting so badly? Is it just because you gave it everything you had?  
JAMAR SAMUELS: Yeah, we left everything on the floor. It was just a tough
game. And we tried our hardest. I mean, emotions are kind of down right now,
but we still know that we have another season to play.  
  
Q. Jacob, talking with Coach Mark Turgeon last night, he said the biggest
improvement he'd seen in Kansas from mid-season on was their defense. Could
you talk about the way they're playing defense right now?  
JACOB PULLEN: They do a great job of just making you shoot over the bigs.
Their guards do a great job of giving you false hope, that when you get around
them, you know, their bigs are there.  
It's tough to shoot shots over Cole and the Morris twins. They do a great job
of contesting everything. And they rebound the ball very well. So you don't
get a lot of second opportunities, which we're really good at.  
  
Q. Denis was saying the other night that this team kind of needs to play
with a little bit of a chip on its shoulder and have kind of a sense of anger.
Do you see you guys over the next few days maybe taking this hurt that Coach
Martin discussed and being able to channel that and to making you a tougher
basketball team and aggressive basketball team?  
JACOB PULLEN: I think we're tough. I think we're a tough team. But KU is also
a tough team. They do a great job of matching our physicality. So I think that
we learn every time we play from them, and hopefully we can take this game and
build on it and just understand what we need to do going into March Madness
going into the NCAA tournament.  
JAMAR SAMUELS: They're just preparing us for the tournament. We have two of
the most physical teams in the Big 12. I would say the country, too. All I can
say is they're just preparing us for the tournament.  
  
Q. Jamar, just talk about what you're feeling right now, knowing in the next
24 hours it's going to be another change of emotions and beginning another
season?  
JAMAR SAMUELS: I mean, I'm down right now. I'm saying we lost in the
championship. Anytime you get to the championship and you fall short, you
always feel down. But tomorrow's just another season for us.  
So I expect our emotions to get up and be ready for practice on Monday.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Along the lines of KU's defense, how good was it tonight, and how much
has it improved since the first time you played those guys?  
COACH MARTIN: Mark's exactly right. He's exactly right. Mark Turgeon, that is.
Defensively, from when we played them at home back in whatever day that was,
January 30th or whatever, to now, they're just difficult to score on.  
I thought we -- we didn't turn it over today, which is a big thing against
them. You can't turn the ball over against Kansas. I thought we got halfway
decent shots. We missed, I don't know, four or five point-blank, Curtis missed
a couple dunks and Rodney missed a layup. Dominique missed a layup. When you
get an opportunity against their defense to score those easy balls, you gotta
put them in the basket.  
If not, it's hard. But defensively -- that's what makes Bill Self as good as
anyone in this country, because he takes big-time talented players and he gets
them to play unselfishly and as hard as anyone in the country defensively.  
That's why the bear is so difficult to take down, because the bear's always
sharp and ready to go. He never lets his guard down. When you fight a bear now
you need a weakness so you can attack it. And that bear is pretty good.  
  
Q. Kind of like in the game you guys played down at Fieldhouse, you made
runs at them in the second half but they always tie up or pull back within 2.
What have you seen -- what would it take to get over the top there, what do
you need to get that extra push?  
COACH MARTIN: It's hard. It gets back to the same thing. When we played at
their place, we didn't bring the fight. We didn't bring the fight. We went in
there and we got pushed around, and we were lucky to battle and get back in
the game.  
But we didn't bring the fight. That's why they got away from us at the end of
the game. Today we brought the fight. We missed free throws and we missed some
-- when you play a good defensive team, they give you an opportunity, you
better capitalize on it. If you don't -- that's the difference with them. I
thought we defended them well, I thought we tried defensively. But when they
got two-foot shots, they made them. You know, we didn't. At the end of the day
that's the tell-tale story of today's game.  
  
Q. In each of the three games you've played against them, they had a
different leading scorer. So even though you know their team inside and out,
you guys played so much, how tough is it to prepare for a team that has as
many different options as Kansas has?  
COACH MARTIN: Listen, they're good. I'm of the opinion that to be a good team,
I don't care what sport you play, you better be good down the middle.
Baseball, they talk about your catcher, your pitcher, second baseman, short
stop, center fielder. In football, your quarterback, your center, nose guard
and safety, you can fill in everything else. Kansas has a point guard that
refuses to lose. On top of being a very good player, they've got a center that
refuses to allow you to shoot layups and then puts tremendous pressure on the
rim.  
So you've got to start with those two guys, and then you've got to do
everything you can to take away the other guys. The big problem for us when we
played them at their place, we gave up too many 3s because we didn't do a good
job handling ball screens. Well, today we did a lot better job of handling
ball screens. I think we made three ball screen mistakes. They made us pay all
three times.  
So that's what good teams do. They get an opportunity, they take advantage of
it.  
  
Q. Same question I asked Jake, you came off two losses and your guys said
they need to rediscover their swagger and hunger. You guys make a run all the
way to the finals, Big 12 and the best RPI conference in the country, and just
play the number one team in the country. How prepared do you feel like this
team is to make a run in the NCAAs coming off what you guys have been able to
do?  
COACH MARTIN: I got no idea. That tournament's crazy. You don't know what's
going to happen in that tournament. I've seen people hit 70-foot shots to beat
people.  
It's a hard tournament to win in. But I know this, these kids have set a
school record for wins in a season. We had the number two strength of schedule
in the country going into tonight's game, playing the number one team in the
country. So I can't see how our strength of schedule went down after that.  
We won 11 games in the Big 12. We sit second seed in the Big 12, the number
one RPI conference in the country. Went to the championship and went nose-to-
nose with the bear. We were right there and just couldn't finish it off. So
we're not going to be any more prepared because of the lessons that this
season has taught us. Now, like I told the guys, I said, listen, it's all
right to hurt. There's nothing wrong with hurting right now, but understand,
last year when we were in the locker room and lost to Texas in the Big 12
tournament, we understood we were headed to the NIT.  
I said tomorrow at 5:00 when you see your name go up on that board, you're
going to feel good again. We're going to go in practice on Monday and lay it
on the line and go take a chance to be special, which is what we've done all
year.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Xavier Henry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20666)

### [Markieff Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20667)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  79  
Texas A&M - 66

  
CHARLIE FISS: We want to offer our congratulations to Bill Self to Bill Self
and Kansas Jayhawks and student-athletes Xavier Henry and Markieff Morris.
Coach, your comments.  
  
COACH SELF: I thought it was a great game. I thought both teams played very
hard. A&M controlled the game for the most part, the first 30 minutes. And we
were just a basket or two behind the entire time. I thought we tried really
hard the first half. A lot of defensive breakdowns from a mental standpoint,
but it wasn't from a lack of effort.  
Then Sherron put us on his back to keep us in contact, and then last 12, 14
minutes everybody played great. So it was a good win for us.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Xavier, talk about the telling part when you all went on that long run,
what you thought the key to that was, and within that context, how big
Sherron's steal and conversion was.  
XAVIER HENRY: Our run started on the defensive end. We switched up our defense
a little bit, and it kind of got them just out of sync. And once we started
playing better defense and rebounding the ball, we started scoring too. So it
just led on and kept going on. And Sherron's steal at the end was big, it was
big. Got him another bucket and put us ahead and gave us a little more cushion
towards the end.  
  
Q. Markieff, could you take me through those back-to-back layups you made?
First one was with nine-and-a-half minutes left, and the second one was with
eight-and-a-half minutes left that gave you the lead. What kind of looks were
they giving you that allowed Sherron to lob the ball in to you?  
MARKIEFF MORRIS: I think they put a lot of pressure on Sherron because he was
making a lot of shots. I kept working, and when he threw it over me I should
have dunked it but I was a little tired, so I made sure I got the bucket. And
I know coach told me as soon I came to the sideline to dunk the ball next
time, but they was releasing on the post and I was getting a lot of buckets.  
  
Q. Markieff, what happened with the double technical? And secondarily, how
do you guys like being judged from game to game this time of year whether
you're into it enough emotionally getting ready for next week?  
MARKIEFF MORRIS: What happened was I stepped in, Sherron was arguing a little
bit. I stepped in. The ref thought I was talking to him. What I was doing was
actually pulling Sherron back. He gave us a double tech. But we don't want to
have the image of bad guys. But we won't back down. And I just think we're
going to keep playing hard.  
  
Q. Markieff, what do you make of this Aggies team in terms of physical, how
tough they play? Do you feel they're a team that can do some damage in the
tournament?  
MARKIEFF MORRIS: I do, they real tough. Last game we played they had 20
offensive rebounds on us. They've got real good guard play with Sloan, and
their big fellas, they're bangers, and I think they can make a good run, just
keeping it together.  
  
Q. You had 11 points when you guys went on that 21-2 run in the second half.
What keyed that run for you guys? What triggered that?  
XAVIER HENRY: Just our defense. Our defense and ability to rebound. And my
points, it was all my teammates finding me. They looked for me all the time
and I just tried to find the open spot.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Bill, what did the switch to the zone do for you?  
COACH SELF: Well, probably, you know, had as big an impact in the outcome of
the game as anything, because we didn't really guard them well man-to-man or
they were able to beat us off the bounce a lot.  
And I think when we went zone or went triangle and two, I think maybe for
whatever reason just got them out of rhythm and it's hard for them to get it
back. We don't practice the zone a lot, but I thought our guys did play it
pretty well. And we actually rebounded pretty good out of it, which is
something when you don't practice a lot it's kind of hard to do.  
But whether the zone or offense or whatever we play, we played pretty good the
last ten minutes. We got the ball where it needed to go and our first shot
defense was good and we rebounded very well.  
  
Q. I'll ask the same question I asked the players, how do you like the team
being judged from game to game this time of year, number one, just trying to
get ready for next week, the emotion? And even Texas A &M missing two key
players to come out and play a game like that?  
COACH SELF: Texas A&M, you know -- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to cut you off.
But tonight, in our league you had four of the top 12 RPI teams in America
playing. No other conference has that. And so I think A&M is either 11 or 12,
if I'm not mistaken. Baylor and K-State are like 5 and 8, and I could be
wrong, and I think we're 1. That didn't happen anywhere else. So you expect
other teams to play good when you play good people.  
And we weren't very good defensively early on. Our ball screen defense was
awful because we didn't play behind it the way we were supposed to do. And
they got some easy baskets and got some uncontested looks that gave them
confidence. But top 12 team in the country, that should happen.  
Just like if they give us confidence, we should play a little bit better. And
we had a lot of careless turnovers. But I'm not going to defend how we played
tonight, because if you told anybody before the game you'd win double figures
against A&M tonight you'd think you played very, very well. The situation was
instead of playing great the first ten minutes, we were great the last ten
minutes.  
And I do think in games like this you can really learn and grow from it,
because we're going to be behind again. And guys have to step up and make
plays. We may have to switch things on the fly a little bit. But I thought our
guys responded very well to that.  
  
Q. I was wondering, when you get to this point in the year every year and
the games get more intense, Big 12 and NCAA tournament, how important is it
for the teams across the board to have really good guard play?  
COACH SELF: I think it's imperative. The thing about it is you can have great
post guys but somebody has to get the ball to the post guys where you can have
great guard play, and you don't have to pass it to them. They can go get their
own shots or create for others. The further you go -- even though I will say
this, a lot of times your offense is potentially better in the NCAA tournament
than it is in your conference tournament, what not, because other teams hadn't
scouted you as well, they don't know you as good.  
The key is when you have good guard play, you can manufacture things without
running anything. Like, guys can just beat their man forced help and pass it
to a guy and he makes a shot or a guy can just make a play defensively, or a
guy understands time score and momentum. And I really think in the NCAA
tournament it's imperative you have that because teams will come up with a
scheme to keep the ball out of the post a lot of times.  
And you need both, obviously. But if I had to pick anything to have, I'd say
great guard play is the most important thing in the tournament.  
  
Q. On that theme, Donald Sloan, does any team rely as much on any one player
as A &M does with Donald Sloan? Seemed when he got the third foul and went
out, both times he went out you guys took advantage of the quick runs.  
COACH SELF: He got his third foul and went to the bench, that was positive for
us. Like it would be for anybody when you take the best player off a team and
set him down a little bit. But they rely on him a lot. I don't know if they
relied on him tonight more than we relied on Sherron.  
But we do have some nice pieces around him. I thought Donald played great. I
thought he made some hard shots. He got them off to a great start. He had 13
in the first 17 minutes or whatnot. And didn't force anything. Made some
guarded shots. He is a terrific player. And that's one of the big reasons why
A&M has a great chance to have success moving forward, is because when you get
the ball to a guy and you're being defended well and he can just go and get
you two points, that's an advantage that a lot of teams don't have.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the other semifinal game tonight, will you allow the
guys to watch the entire game or do you put them down early, or is the scout
done for both teams?  
COACH SELF: The scout's done but our coaches will watch the game. Our players
aren't going to stay and watch it. We'll watch it back at the hotel when we
eat as a group or whatever. But it's going to be a fabulous game. You've got
two really good teams that are so explosive offensively, both of them, when
their guards are making shots.  
Tweety and Dunn and obviously Pullen and Clemente, they're as good offensively
as any guards in the league, period. So I think it will be a fun game. You've
got length. You've got guys that pursue the ball. You've got athletes, both
teams play hard. Kind of different styles defensively. But it will be a fun
game to watch. And whoever we play, obviously, will be a very difficult game
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Could you comment, please, on Xavier's development as a freshman shooting
confidently all over the floor and playing a key role?  
COACH SELF: Xavier has been a key player for us. He's played really well the
last month and a half or whatever it's been, six weeks or five weeks. I mean
really good. Like as good as anybody we have on our team. I wasn't happy with
him at all the first half. I thought that he wasn't aggressive. They took his
ball a couple times. Really labored.  
And then the second half I pulled him and the next thing you know he comes
back and he reacted like a player's supposed to react. Water off his back.
Next play as opposed to dwelling on the negative. And he was able to spin it.
Of course, he made some huge shots for us.  
He's a terrific shooter, but he's become a better player, too, and that's the
thing I like most, is that because he's becoming more whole, basically, each
and every day.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2010

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [LaceDarius Dunn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19451)

### [Ekpe Udoh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20649)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas State  82  
Baylor - 75

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're ready to begin with the Baylor Bears. Coach Scott Drew,
student-athletes Ekpe Udoh and LaceDarius Dunn.  
  
COACH DREW: Coming into the game, we talked about how similar both teams were.
Both teams were 25 and 6, both teams 11 and 5 in the conference. We were 7 in
the RPI. They were 6. And the first time we played, it was back and forth the
whole way. So we knew it would come down to a few possessions, and tonight
they made the big plays down the stretch and credit to them for doing that.
Credit Coach Martin for getting them ready and executing down the stretch.  
Obviously we think they'll go far in the tournament. And hopefully we see them
again, Final Four, somewhere at that level.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lace, talk about that stretch there at the end. You guys at one point I
think had a one- or two-point lead. What was the difference down the
stretch?  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: I think we just stopped executing well. They really took us
out of playing our game doing the things we do well. So hats off to Kansas
State.  
  
Q. Lace, can you talk about Pullen's performance, even when you all were on
him, seems like he's awfully tough to guard?  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: He's a great player. He do great things for his team. I'm
sure he's a leader, and he just came out tonight and led his team to a
victory. Hats off to him and good luck to them for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Ekpe, do you see Jacob as kryptonite to you guys; second time he's
delivered a victory to you?  
EKPE UDOH: Just had a good game. Big players make big-time plays. I wouldn't
call a player kryptonite, though.  
  
Q. You guys were down 5 when you went out with four fouls. Watching it from
the bench, did you feel pretty good about the situation as far as you guys
actually cutting into the lead and how tough was that to sit there and come
back in kind of cold after being out?  
EKPE UDOH: It's tough, but I made those fouls, so I had to deal with it. I'm
confident in all my teammates. When I went out I didn't have like a worry that
we were going to get like beat by 20. So I just knew we were going to stay in
the game. When I came, I have to make plays.  
  
Q. Ekpe, about two minutes to go, they had an offensive rebound. They had a
miss inside to get an offensive rebound, and Pullen hit the 3. How critical
were the rebounds? I think they only wound up with one rebound difference, but
how critical was that particular rebound?  
EKPE UDOH: It wasn't as big -- it was just the last stretch, you know what I
mean? Kansas State got us out of our comfort zone. We kind of melted a little
bit tonight. We have to build on it, look at it, get ready for the tournament.  
  
Q. Lace, kind of glad to be done with the Big 12 play and moving on to the
rest of the NCAA?  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: Not really, because our goal was to come here and win the
whole thing. We're going on to the big tournament. We'll have to step it up to
another level. Hopefully, we can go down there and play Baylor basketball and
do the things we do well and come off with the victory. But the most important
thing is you lose one, you're done. We're going to go down there with a chip
on our shoulder and play.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. You have to feel good about where you're probably going to be seeded,
especially after the way you've been playing. Could you just talk about
that?  
COACH DREW: Hopefully they take into account, obviously, our RPI. If they do
that, we should be in good shape. Normally you look at the non-conference
record. I mean we beat Xavier. We built South Carolina at South Carolina. We
beat Arkansas at Arkansas. We beat Arizona state at Arizona state. So
everything they normally look for in criteria, high RPI, good road wins and
then strong conference performance, we have.  
So hopefully we do get a good seed. I know our guys would like to put in a
request for Oklahoma City or New Orleans, but I don't know if they'll take
that.  
  
Q. Was it the energy level that Sutton was playing with or did you lose
track of him? Why was he able to cause so many problems?  
COACH DREW: Good question. I think we have to credit him, because he came out
and really was aggressive and really performed well. I mean, 14 and 14 is,
eight offensive rebounds. He definitely was a difference-maker tonight.  
  
Q. What were they doing specifically on Tweety or was that just a credit to
Clemente? Tweety didn't have one of his normal nights. Six turnovers.  
COACH DREW: I think, first of all, coming into the game I think he was a
little wore out from the Texas game. And I think Kansas State is so deep and
they rotate so many players in there, they kept fresh people on him. But they
do have size and they do have length once you get around Clemente. So you put
all that together, credit Kansas State's defense in how they kept rotating
fresh guys on him and they did a great job.  
  
Q. I was wondering, just in general when you get to this point in the
season, how important do you feel that guard play is across the board?  
COACH DREW: Guard play is huge. It makes coaches and programs look good. And
that's why we have two of the best in the nation in Tweety and Lace. And
that's why we are what we are. You look at Clemente and Pullen, the exact same
thing. The difference is the last we played Kansas State twice, and both times
both of those guys have had great games. And tonight both of them had a great
game.  
  
Q. Will it be a little bit of a relief to get to the NCAA tournament after
getting through the Big 12? And how much does this kind of game and playing in
the Big 12, how much does it get you guys ready for NCAA tournament play?  
COACH DREW: I think, first of all, we have good momentum. We've won -- we're 8
and 2 in our last ten games. So I think we're playing good basketball. I don't
think there's anything after tonight's game where you say, wow, you're in
trouble.  
I think we just take our hats off and credit Kansas State, and I think it's
going to be a tough ticket tomorrow to watch this game, and we'll cheer for
every Big 12 team and hopefully we'll show the nation that we are the best
conference, and we have teams who do real well and advance far in the
tournament.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  79  
Texas A&M - 66

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined now by Texas A&M, Coach Mark Turgeon and his
student-athletes, Bryan Davis and Donald Sloan.  
Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game.  
  
COACH TURGEON: I thought we were great for 32 minutes. My guys gave it
everything they had. They executed. They defended. We're not going to make any
excuses. But for 32 we were really good. And give KU credit. When it was time
to make plays, they made plays. They made seven or eight straight shots. We
missed seven or eight shots. Really good looks at the eight-minute mark. Wide
open. Didn't make them. They made them at the other end, that was the game.  
Then there was a couple of minutes in there where we weren't ourselves. And
they built the lead from 6 to 12 and 14. That was the only disappointing part
of the day. But besides that I wouldn't trade my team for anything. They
busted their tails today. They were great. Tough environment against a heck of
a basketball team, and we just came up short.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Donald, how big of a momentum shift was it when you picked up foul number
three?  
DONALD SLOAN: It was pretty big. But we got the guys that stepped up and did
what they had to do in order to keep the lead, keep us in the game at the
time. Actually when I got back in, that's when the lead kind of shifted.  
But I don't really think that that was key to why we lost the lead. And they
were able to get momentum and come back. Because we were fine. So it was big,
because I love being in the game. I sat on the bench in foul trouble. But I
think that was the least of the problems, why we came up short tonight.  
  
Q. Donald, you hit the jumper, I think 57-56. Then after that KU was in a
zone. You didn't really get to touch the ball a whole lot until the lead had
really gotten big. Offensively, was it guys just having trouble finding you?
Was it tough to get the ball or what was going on in that period?  
DONALD SLOAN: No, not at all. I think we're very team-oriented group. KU
played excellent defense. But I touched the ball, to say the least. I had
touches. I was actually trying to get other guys shot. B.J., Khris. Trying to
hit B.D. in the middle, kind of giving other guys the opportunity to make
plays, because I did feel like KU were keying in on me while they were in that
zone. And we had great opportunities all night. And just fell short in the
end.  
  
Q. Brian, talk about the physicality of you guys being able to match Kansas
through most of two games and that five, six-minute run they went on, that was
the first time they've been able to do that on you. How good are they when
they're doing what they do?  
BRYAN DAVIS: They're really good when they're really physical like that. And
they were able to make some runs. And they hit three big 3s in the corner. And
just the physicality of the game throughout the whole -- throughout this whole
game and the last game that we played against them has been pretty much even,
until like the last eight minutes of this game, and they were able to pull
away from us.  
  
Q. Bryan, how do you describe your team? I've heard blue-collar, strong-
willed. And moving forward, what kind of team does A &M have?  
BRYAN DAVIS: We're a very tough team. We don't back down from anybody. We're
going to fight until the end. We're going to play you 40 minutes on tough
defense the whole time. We're a team on offense. We don't really just look to
one person to score everything. We spread everything out and just do
everything we can to execute and play the way that we play.  
  
Q. Donald, did that zone kind of force you guys to take too many jump shots,
too many 3s, without working your way inside?  
DONALD SLOAN: Yeah, I would have to say so. I think, if we can play the game
again, guys would be a little more aggressive as far as trying to drive and
force the defense to collapse and have kick-outs for even better 3s or better
shots.  
And so, yeah, I really have to say that it forced us to shoot shots that
weren't as open as we'd like. Gotta give KU credit. I guess they had a good
game plan, as far as the second half, at least.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Mark, you've been into the NCAA tournament with a few other teams now.
How good do you feel about this bunch, as you begin play next week?  
COACH TURGEON: I've got a lot of confidence in this group. Playing the number
one team in the country in this kind of environment gives me confidence,
without your starting point guard; we're not making any excuses, because that
was the way it was today.  
But hopefully we can get Dash healthy. We can get better between now and next
week whenever we play. But we didn't guard this weekend the way we normally
guard. Teams shot a really high percentage against us.  
So if we can get back to playing the way we can play defensively, I like our
team. They've been fun to coach. And today was fun. I mean, that four-minute
stretch we just weren't very good. And besides that, they were great. So I've
got a lot of confidence in them. Hopefully we can get healthy. We have guys
that are playing that are hurt. So it affects practices.  
They play in the game, but they're not practicing. So hopefully we'll get
everybody back and have a good week of practice next week.  
  
Q. I think you said last night or today you were sick of losing to KU. I
wonder your emotions now. Immediately after that bounce against the effort
without those two key guys.  
COACH TURGEON: I say silly things, but I'm used to winning. And so I'd like to
beat Kansas sometime. They've been pretty good for three years. They've had a
national championship team, and a team that's 31 and 2. Not many people beat
them. Our effort was great both times against them. I thought we played --
even though the score doesn't indicate it, we played much better today than we
did at College Station and I thought our guys played like they knew they could
beat Kansas. College Station, I didn't feel that way all the time.  
So some day. If we play them enough times, maybe we'll catch them on a good
night.  
  
Q. When Sloan picked up that third, automatic decision to sit him down?  
COACH TURGEON: Yeah.  
  
Q. And also when he hit the two free throws, put you up 55-51, sat him down,
had a word with him for just a second, why take him out at that point?  
COACH TURGEON: He had three fouls. And I took him out with, I don't know, he
picked up his third at 17:41. We were ahead.  
The boxout foul was a bad foul. And get a cheap one like that, which he did,
leads to the third. And then he hit his two free throws. We still had command
of the game. I didn't want him to pick up his fourth.  
I took him out, what did you say it was, 10:13? And I was going to try to get
to the eight-minute mark and play him the last eight minutes. He didn't sit
there very long because we started to panic a little bit, which we don't do.
But we did today.  
And I was just trying to get him through, I just didn't want him to pick up
his fourth with ten minutes to go. I think if I could have gotten to the
eight-minute mark we were good. But his third foul was big. It was really big.
He was playing. And that was big. And especially with the lack of guards that
we have for the tournament. For him to pick up three was big.  
  
Q. Could you comment, please, just on the quality of play that we're seeing
here this weekend in the Big 12 and what that can do for these Big 12 teams as
you're moving into next week and beyond?  
COACH TURGEON: I think the league from top to bottom is great. When you can
play a 12 seed like we did yesterday and they take you down to the wire, it
shows you how good our league is.  
We're not going to see a team better than Kansas out there. So it's great for
us. The competition throughout the league, whether it's Oklahoma State, Texas,
Baylor, Kansas State, it's gotten everybody ready for the NCAA tournament.
There's not a team you're going to run into that's any better than what you've
seen. And it's just how well you play on that day.  
So I think it's been great for us. Knock on wood, I think it's going to be an
exciting stretch for the Big 12.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the altercation? It looked like it might have woke up
Kansas a little bit.  
COACH TURGEON: Which one?  
  
Q. When the teams got together, looked like there was a double foul
called.  
COACH TURGEON: I don't know if it woke them up. They made some shots and we
didn't. I don't know. I don't know.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas State  82  
Baylor - 75

  
CHARLIE FISS: Coach, congratulations on your victory tonight, Coach Frank
Martin and student-athletes Jacob Pullen and Denis Clemente.  
COACH MARTIN: Two great teams. They're good. Both times we've played, it's
been like today's game, down the last 20 seconds and just real proud of our
kids. Baylor, a lot of credit to them. Tweety Carter is as tough as a kid that
I've ever had to coach against. And their team has grown so much. They're real
good. They have components to make a serious run, I feel. I'm proud of the
team. I'm proud of the kids sitting next to me, the way they've continued to
lead our basketball team. They coach me now; I don't coach them. They tell me
what to do and they tell me to shut up sometimes, which is the best thing
that's ever happened. Real proud of our guys.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions.  
  
Q. Last night Coach Martin mentioned that at this point at tournament time
that you just want to be one better than opponent. You want to survive, keep
playing. What did you feel like that you guys did right the last five minutes
that allowed you to go from Baylor being 1 point better than you to finish win
by 7?  
JACOB PULLEN: I think we got stops. We made them shoot tough shots, which they
shot all night. They made some, they missed some. I think Dominique did a
great job of just helping us rebound. He really fought down there tonight and
I was just -- I was impressed by Dom. He had a will tonight, and he just
decided that he wanted to get every rebound that came off the rim, and every
time he got the ball inside the free throw line he was going to score it. That
was really the difference in his game.  
  
Q. Jake talk about getting another crack at Kansas, what it means to you in
a Big 12 championship game?  
JACOB PULLEN: We wanted to win the regular season Big 12, and we felt like we
lost it at Kansas. We just want a chance to get a ring. Denis never got a
ring, I never got a ring, I don't think Frank got one. I want to get one while
we're here. That's our goal right now. We have the opportunity in front of us.
That's our opportunity tomorrow.  
  
Q. Both you guys, early in the game, Denis, you carried things and Jacob got
hot there, starting the second half Dominique dominated. Jacob, was it a
little bit of a tag team relay race where it's one guy did something and the
other guy took over?  
JACOB PULLEN: As a team, I think we're playing great off of each other. We
really are unselfish team. Denis sees me make a shot. He tells you regardless
if it's five or ten people guarding, he tells me shoot it, shoot it. I think
as a team we do a great job trying to find the person who has the hot hand and
try to ride them. Today we took turns. Denis made some shots. Frank called
some plays for him. Dom made some shots inside the free throw line and got
aggressive going to the paint. We called some sets for him. I made a few in
the row. Denis and Frank called some sets and got me the ball again. As a
team, we did do a great job sharing the ball, I think.  
  
Q. Jake, just talk about your game tonight. What was going well? You hit
half your 3-pointers, five of ten. Talk a little bit about what was going
right for you.  
JACOB PULLEN: You know, last time we played them, they're a zone team, man. I
just tried to be ready to shoot, Frank, told me since the day I got on campus
if you're going to shoot the ball, you better be ready, step into it. I made
one, Denis kept calling the play so I could get in that same spot. Once you
get in a rhythm, it's really just muscle mass and repetition. So I just -- I
kept letting it go and it started to fall for me.  
  
Q. Jake, you've seen LaceDarius Dunn in two different forms. What was he
doing today that he didn't do in Waco?  
JACOB PULLEN: He made shots. We contested them. He has a Sam Young type pump
fake. Our coaches screamed at us all the game, but when you're guarding a play
like that with a quick release, and when he shows you the ball you have
tendency just to leave your feet. He made some tough ones. He made some over
our hands, splitting the ball screen. So I thought we made him shoot tough
shots, but when a good shooter sees the ball go through the net he gets a
rhythm. He had a chance to get a rhythm tonight.  
  
Q. Denis, when was the last time you told Coach Martin to shut up?  
DENIS CLEMENTE: That's a good question. I don't know.  
Coach Martin: The last timeout in the game there.  
DENIS CLEMENTE: I'm not going to respond you, you have to understand.  
COACH MARTIN: He did. That's the God's honest truth there.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on getting to the Big 12 tournament game, playing for
it something you guys worked for and also playing Kansas?  
COACH MARTIN: It's what you practice for. That's when we're doing all our
lifting and conditioning and all that, everyday in the summer and our guys
committed to all being there the whole summer. Then they continue that into
the preseason. That's what you practice for.  
You practice to play in that game when it comes to your conference
championship. It's what it's all about. I'm just proud of our kids. I'm happy
for K-State, all the great coaches and players that have reached out to us,
that have embraced our team, that are starting to take pride in K-State
basketball again.  
And I'm happy for our kids, because they're the ones. These are the guys that
make the sacrifices, that listen to what we're trying to say and then believe
in everybody and go out and do their jobs. I'm just real happy for the kids.
They've earned the right to play for the championship. Now, we've got to go
deal with the best team in the country who we've been nose to nose twice
before. So it's a great opportunity. KU is great.  
I've got to think that it's going to be the best environment of any conference
championship game in the country. I just hope we play well, because if not, it
might be a long day against those guys.  
  
Q. Dom always plays a lot with a lot of energy, but can you talk about the
lift early on, especially when you guys were struggling a little
offensively?  
COACH MARTIN: You talking about Dominique? He had a bad last week of a season.
I don't know why. He's had a great year for us. And at Kansas he didn't play
well. Against Iowa State he didn't play well. But he's a great kid. And that
play he made, God, I think it was a 2-point game at the time, where he comes
out of nowhere and chases an offensive rebound down. And that's something that
we instilled into our guys because we stopped doing it, which is going to that
offensive glass. He chased that ball from the weak side, to the weak side,
from the weak side, to the strong side corner. Then he made the pitch to
Denis. Then he makes the extra pass to Jake for that 3 that kind of made it a
two-possession game. That's a big-time play. That's a guy that's making a play
that has an unbelievable desire to win.  
And he was great. At halftime -- we told them going into the game -- we tried
to do some things against their zone to get him to be a facilitator and a
scorer. And he tried. First half he just missed some shots. But he in the
second half he came out and he was aggressive and he started the half with
that dunk and it kind of, Dom's a confident guy. That dunk to start the second
half just made him feel good and obviously he played his tail off the rest of
the game.  
  
Q. Frank, could you talk about the job that Denis did on Tweety. Everything
starts with him on Baylor's offense. You force him to six turnovers and hold
him to eight points.  
COACH MARTIN: Denis has been great for us. He wants to win. He might have been
the worst offender in the history of basketball when he arrived on campus. And
his desire to be a good player, his desire to make our team win has made him
grow as a defensive player. Tweety Carter is tough as nails. I'm just telling
you, there ain't too many better than him out there.  
Denis was phenomenal. Tweety got some going right. Runners, floaters on us.
But that's what good players do. They're going to make some plays. But for the
most part I thought we were rock solid on our defensive assignments there with
Tweety. Starts with point guard. When your point guard plays good defense then
you've got a chance behind them.  
  
Q. You mentioned that hustle play by Dominique and the 3 that Jacob hit.
Baylor comes really close to deflecting the pass that went out there. Just the
fact that these kind of games come down to that kind of play, and the fact
that the four teams that play here are in the top 12 of the RPI, and I guess
you guys are going to be happy to get away from the Big 12 and go wreak some
havoc on the NCAA. Just the fact that the four teams playing here were really
good.  
COACH MARTIN: I'm glad you asked that, because I hope, when you play, I think
we've played the top five schedule in the country, and you're in the number
one RPI league, and you're the second best team in that league. I think you
deserve a little more credit than when the so-called talking heads are trying
to give our kids. We're playing for our conference championship. There are a
lot of teams that are supposedly better than us that have been penciled in as
1 and 2 seeds in the NCAA tournament. And when you schedule the way we try to
schedule this year and you challenge your kids and they answer the bell and
then you're the second best team in your league and you line up and play for
your conference championship and the number one RPI league in the country, I
hope our kids get rewarded. But it's not about that. You've got to win games,
and we lost some games here earlier in the year that we should have won, but
that's what makes me the proudest of our kids, is what they have done. See,
they just set a school record for wins in a season.  
With all the incredible tradition that Kansas State basketball has, they just
set a record for wins in the season. They set a record for most conference
wins in the season in the Big 12. These kids, what they've done, is off the
charts.  
And I'm just extremely proud of them. I just hope we've got some gas left in
the tank here, because by the time they're done with media responsibilities
and we get back to the hotel, it's probably going to be 1:00 in the morning.
Kansas has been in bed since 6:00. I hope we've got some juice left in the
tank to try and compete with the best in the country tomorrow.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  70  
Nebraska - 64

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined by Mark Turgeon. Coach, your assessment of today's
victory.  
COACH TURGEON: First, it was a great win for us. Defensively, we played just
well enough. They shot the ball extremely well. They played with a lot of
fight. Built the lead up to 14, I believe, and had chances to put them away.
Couldn't do it. Got stagnant against the zone. Missed shots against the zone.
Turned the ball over against the zone and stopped guarding during that
stretch. Let our offense affect the defense. Got them back in the game, and in
the end we did just enough to win. Khris -- Sloan hit a big 3 when it was a
1-point gain, just a huge 3. And then Khris hit a big 3, also, and then Sloan
got the one in the paint.  
We really executed against the zone late. Wish our defense would have been a
little bit better down the stretch, but all in all it was a good win for us.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Talk about the guard play without Dash, no turnovers out of the starting
guards, you and B.J.  
DONALD SLOAN: I thought it was big for us. Dash is the guy who runs our
system, runs our stuff very well. He's the glue to us offensively. Not to have
him, it's a pretty big knock for us. Like you said, our guards stepped up
tonight -- or today, and got it done.  
  
Q. Donald, along those lines, talk about not having Bryan most of the day.
How did that exacerbate some of your offensive problems?  
DONALD SLOAN: Bryan is one of our key guys, especially down low, and for him
to be in foul trouble, something that we've had to adjust to over the course
of the season. We're used to it. But when he's in, he's one of our better
guys. We play better with him.  
He knows that. We all know that. Just circumstances, I guess, of getting in
foul trouble. It makes everybody else pick the game up and try to do a little
bit more.  
  
Q. Khris, talk about your 3, when they cut it to 2. 57-55. How big was that?
Talk about how the play unfolded.  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: Just wanted to have confidence in my shot. I shot it knowing
it was going to go in to put my team up. And it was just a shot I knew I
needed to knock down.  
  
Q. It was a big shot for the 2. But how about the one where they got within
1? That was probably the longest shot you took all day.  
DONALD SLOAN: I think so. I really wasn't, I guess, measuring it before I shot
it. Just kind of in the flow of the game. Knowing that we needed something
big. It feels good when you make it. But had I missed it, totally different
story.  
It's just things like that, being in the flow, the rhythm of the game.
Sometimes you just, you just do things that you don't normally do. That was
one thing that I normally don't shoot I guess deep balls with.  
  
Q. Donald, did you come into this game feeling you were going to have to do
more with Dash sitting on the bench there?  
DONALD SLOAN: Actually, I didn't know that -- I had no idea that he wasn't
going to play, I guess, until this morning, shoot-around. I thought he was
just kind of resting, he would be ready to go.  
But I found out, I guess, hours before the game that he wasn't going to be
able to go. And, yeah, just had in my mind that we can't let this one get away
like we did last year in our first game.  
If I have to do more, I would. We have a great team. I think everybody picked
up the slack from not having Dash for B.J. being in foul trouble, things like
that. So I think everybody pretty much had it on their mind this was going to
be a game that we all would have to play good.  
  
Q. Donald and Khris, what do you think about your match-up with Kansas, you
had a great opportunity to beat them before, what do you think about meeting
them here again?  
DONALD SLOAN: We had an opportunity earlier in the year. Kind of let it slip
by. This is another chance. I guess walking through it, we'll see tomorrow. I
think our guys are ready. We're prepared. And come tomorrow I think our guys
will be ready.  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: We have to be ready, tough game, be ready for a 40-minute
game. We have to be ready the whole time, I think.  
  
Q. I think Bryan only had one basket, and you found him on the pass there on
the baseline late. Did you just see him flash, or did you know he was going to
be open?  
KHRIS MIDDLETON: When I caught the ball, I looked up, saw him cutting back
behind the zone. Right when I saw I was going to have him, I passed it to him
and he made the play.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Just talk about your guards gutting it out, your whole team, gutting it
out without Dash but particularly B.J. and the job he filled and if you have
an update on Dash?  
COACH TURGEON: This team just keeps doing it. And B.J. I knew would play well.
He's done that before. I knew Sloan would play well. But Naji I thought 16
minutes really good minutes for us. Khris, another freshman, good minutes for
us. Darko was in there for four minutes, he helped us.  
We've gone through a lot of injuries. Derrek Lewis is still hurt. He's not
even practicing. So I was really proud of our guards except for Khris against
that zone, two or three possessions in a row turning the ball over which he
doesn't do, our guards were really good today. And they made big shots and
they took care of the basketball. And we got a little -- we didn't flow as
well without Dash out there against the zone.  
And it showed at times. But we did just enough, and I think Dash is day-to-
day. I fully expected him to play today and he just couldn't do it. So we'll
wake up tomorrow and see if he's ready to play. If he's not, if we're lucky
enough to win we'll see on Saturday. But he's day-to-day.  
  
Q. You got outrebounded. Looked like Ray had a pretty good first half.
Didn't play too many minutes in the second. What was your reasoning behind
that?  
COACH TURGEON: It became a really close game quickly. They were zoning us and
certain guys are better in zone offense. Ray really helped us in the first
half. Ray had nine good minutes. Defensively, I was concerned about him.
They're so small. Haven't been able to teach him since he didn't start
practice until December all the things I need to teach him to be a better
defender, especially perimeter defender. So Ray helped us, KU will be a big
lineup tomorrow, Ray will probably get more than nine minutes tomorrow. Yeah,
I thought he had a great nine minutes. Really helped us right before half.  
  
Q. You've been on the other side of this. You know what it's like to play
Kansas, to beat Kansas in Kansas City. How do you prepare your team for what
comes out of the stands tomorrow?  
COACH TURGEON: We won't care what comes out of the stands. We know there will
be a lot of Jayhawks in here. But we've become a pretty good road team down
the stretch. We've won four of our last five road games. We'll treat it like a
road game tomorrow. We'll have that approach to it. I just hope we can get
healthy overnight and give them a good game. That's the whole key. And seeing
Bill's face at the end of the game, I don't think he was happy with his guys
so I imagine the Jayhawks will be ready to play tomorrow evening, and we have
to match their intensity.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the end of the first half that was a key situation
that they were coming back and then they also had the ball in 5 and then you
hit a 3 and had a good stop?  
COACH TURGEON: Went two for one. Ran a play for Sloan. And he got the ball in
the paint, and they had two guys try to block it so Ray got the offensive
rebound, got foul, made one for two. And made a big steal. We ran, which we
like to do, and just unselfish. Khris found B.J. B.J. found Sloan. He's wide
open and knocked it down. That was big. I think it put the lead back to 9.  
All day I felt like we were dominating the game, that they were just 8, 6, 5,
9, ten. You knew they would make a run, especially where we had the stretch we
couldn't hit a shot. We were around 49 forever. Our guys are tough. Told them
to relax, attack the zone like we were attacking with our man defense and they
started to do that and we got better.  
  
Q. Looked like Bryan played pretty well when he was out there. But obviously
didn't get a chance to be out there, get in the flow of the game. How fired up
do you expect him to be for tomorrow as a senior to spend some time on the
floor and get in the flow of it?  
COACH TURGEON: I didn't think any of our post guys played well. Probably Ray
played the best. He played the fewest minutes. But I expect David to play
better tomorrow. He wasn't very good. And Bryan has to play smarter than he
played. He's been through too much to be sitting. It's his fourth foul. It's
just not very bright. He's got to play smarter than that. Big three-point
play. That was a lucky play. You have to be good and you have to be lucky.
That was a lucky play for us. He'll be fired up. Hopefully all of us will be,
and hopefully our bench will play better tomorrow and we'll be able to give
them a game.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas State  83  
Oklahoma State - 64

  
CHARLIE FISS: Joined now by coach Frank Martin of the Kansas State Wildcats
and the student-athletes Jacob Pullen and Jamar Samuels. Coach,
congratulations on your victory. Your thoughts on today's game.  
COACH MARTIN: Obviously, we went out, and our guys were phenomenal in practice
the last three days. And we got back to some of the things that makes us a
good basketball team.  
We obviously played a very good Oklahoma State team that we have a tremendous
amount of respect for. But it's a three-game journey in three days, and that's
one down. And we can't get overly excited, because right away we got another
hard game tomorrow night.  
So I can tell you I'm happy. It's the first time in my career I get to use a
second suit at the Big 12 tournament.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jamar, we had seen you do some things this season. Talk about that first
half.  
JAMAR SAMUELS: I can't even really explain it. The past couple of days in
practice I've just been trying my hardest trying to go out and help out my
teammates the first five and everybody on the team, know what I'm saying? Just
trying to get this win, trying to get the Big 12 championship.  
  
Q. Jacob and Jamar both, right, he hits a 3 right at the end of the half,
you guys are going off. Jacob, what were you yelling at him? You obviously
were happy but what were you saying to him? It seemed like quite a bit of
stuff going on there.  
JACOB PULLEN: The whole game I was telling him he could control the game.
We've played games this season where Jamar, he has the ability to just control
the game like as far as rebounding, and he's a mismatch because he's a 4 man
that can step out and shoot the ball and really get to the rim and get to the
free throw line. Sometimes he has a tendency to fade away. I try to keep
motivating him, telling him this is his game to take over, keep rebounding and
keep scoring the ball.  
  
Q. Coach was establishing a big lead early, was that something talked about
in practice leading up to the game?  
COACH MARTIN: We just wanted to score one more than him. It's tournament time.
You want to play your best. You want to do everything in your power. If you
have a choice, that's the way you would like to do, go into halftime up 25.
That allows you to play zone, because you've got to win three games in three
days. And save some of the wear and tear for the next couple of days.  
But it's tournament time. It's about surviving and advancing, and when you win
a game at this time of year, you're happy because you get to play again. And
that's -- we just wanted to score one more than them. We weren't interested in
big leads or anything like that.  
  
Q. Jacob, you guys got production like you got from Samuels off the bench.
When Oklahoma State got in foul trouble, had to go to their bench, they didn't
get much of anything. Could you tell there late in the first half, when you
got into their bench, that you really had a big edge?  
JACOB PULLEN: Yeah, we figured out that they didn't have a lot of depth,
especially inside. We really tried to attack the rim and get the ball into the
paint to put them in the position where they had to make decisions whether to
foul or just give up easy layups. So Frank did a great job continuing their
own plays to Jamar and Curtis to really keep attacking and telling us to
attack in transition so they had to foul. So we put them in a tough situation.  
  
Q. Jacob, after losing two straight games to come in here and build a
30-point lead, what do you think a game like this kind of says about you guys
to everybody else?  
JACOB PULLEN: You know, we lost some games, but we understood what we did
wrong. As a team, we didn't play the blame game like I said before. We didn't
come into the locker room and say it was your fault we lost this one, and your
fault. We understood as a team we didn't play well those last two games. We
wanted to come out and be physical and do the things we did, and we started on
the defensive end. We tried to limit them from getting open 3s and
transitioning, they're a really good three-point shooting team. So we tried to
little things we usually do defensively during the course of the year, and we
had to get back to doing that.  
  
Q. You lost to them, it was weighing on your mind. How much did it weigh the
loss coming into this game and how much did that play into your emotions at
the start?  
JAMAR SAMUELS: I think the couple losses we had to them, I just think they
outphysicaled us, and we just weren't really ready to play. But tonight we had
it on our minds, and it was somewhat of a revenge type of game.  
We had coach Brad Underwood they outreboundeded us for at least three or four
days. We took that to heart.  
  
Q. Jamar, what did you guys do to keep James Anderson out of a rhythm there
in the first half. What did you do to do that?  
JAMAR SAMUELS: We just tried to pressure him as much as possible. And it kind
of worked a little bit, but you know what I'm saying, James Anderson, he's a
great player. He's going to score his points. But I think we did a great job
pressuring him tonight.  
  
Q. Jamar, just talk about your aggressiveness and the passion you played
tonight as well?  
JAMAR SAMUELS: I haven't played with as much passion the last few games. I
wanted to come out here and show I still had it. Six boards, Coach Underwood
said it's good but it's not enough, and hopefully we'll be playing a good
Baylor and a good Texas team, and I have to get more than that.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Denis Clemente's decision-making tonight seemed like it was at the
highest level I've seen all year, ten assists and just two turnovers, could
you talk about Denis's play?  
COACH MARTIN: He was great. He's been great all year. People don't understand
-- when I say people, I don't like how that sounds. But people that are not at
our practice every day and see us play every single game don't understand just
how tuned in he is with what we have to do.  
He's got tremendous pride. Sometimes he takes some shots early in transition.
That's okay. That's who we are. And I have allowed him and Jacob to do that.
They've earned my trust where we can do that. But as far as the understanding
of distributing the basketball, what we want to run, that last play where
Jamar made that 3 at the end of the half, that's all Denis.  
I was trying to run something else. He overruled me. That's the kind of trust
that you have in a good point guard. And obviously that was the right call to
run at the time. And he zoned, and he's got the heart of a lion. He has
tremendous pride. And where I was happiest with him today was the effort that
he defended with.  
He just pressured the ball tremendously. Our assist numbers were also up,
because we jumped up and made shots. And that usually helps your assists. But
he just -- he started that defense up at top and really disrupted their
offense. And that's where I was proudest of Denis today.  
  
Q. Do you remember the last time that you had a player outrebound a team in
the first half? That's what Jamar did. Could you talk about what Jamar brought
to the table tonight?  
COACH MARTIN: Jamar's a sophomore. A lot of people -- he's a young kid. He has
tremendous talent. He's still learning his talent. He's still learning just
the consistency with which you have to approach every day. In the past, when
he's had these kind of games, then he slipped for two or three games, that's
normal young kids. That's life.  
When he plays with the enthusiasm and the effort that he played with today,
he's a heck of a player. And he spent a lot of time in the offseason working
on shooting the basketball. Obviously, you guys see him now where he's earned
the right to shoot when he's open.  
You guys should have seen him that year he came in where he red-shirted, he
couldn't shoot a free throw. The ball would leave his hand and everyone would
put their head down. You don't know where it would go.  
And he's worked at it. And like I tell him and the rest of the team, when you
earn the right, then you can go do those kind of things. And I'm happy for
him.  
  
Q. Was there any thought to starting Jamar in the second half or getting him
in any earlier than you did in the second half?  
COACH MARTIN: No, we have a rotation kind of set. And we're going to stick
with it. We understood that we had that big lead at halftime. So we played a
lot more zone than we normally would in the second half. We were just trying
to get home, and we were trying to shorten the game, shorten the possessions,
limit fouls. Obviously by doing that, then we allowed them to get a little bit
of a rhythm.  
But, no. The two teams that are playing here in a minute got a lot of big
strong guys, those front line guys their minutes had to be down. With that
lead, we had to just get home. That's what we were trying to do.  
  
Q. I'm sure this is something you have done before this season, but did you
extend your defense, in the first half, particularly trapping, was that to
kind of get everybody just fired up and going? It seemed like kind of
everything fed off of each other.  
COACH MARTIN: That's who we are. People that watch us play, that's what we've
done to everybody. And the other day when I addressed the media, I said I've
kind of gotten away from that a little bit. It affected the edge we play with.
That's who we are. That's how we're going to play from now until when the
season ends. That's what we've worked to build as a program, is to play with
that tenacity, that edge, just that relentless defensive pressure.  
Now, on some teams we'll extend it more than on others. Today we thought we
needed to extend it to try and disrupt so James Anderson couldn't just come
down and catch the ball in comfortable spots.  
  
Q. If you could define your message to your team entering this tournament,
what might that have been?  
COACH MARTIN: Let's play the way that we've played all year. Let's take a
chance to do something special. I told our guys that back in September, I
said, you know, you guys have busted your humps for this program, to grow as a
team, to grow as individuals. Well, this season it's our time.  
And I hadn't said that to them in a while, and I told them before the game
today. I said, remember what I told you back then now. We've gone through all
these lessons and all these games to prepare for this time of year. And the
whole secret is you don't want to erase all the good we did as a team because
we don't play well -- we don't play as good as we are supposed to this time of
year. I just wanted to get back and play the way we've played for 90 percent
of the season, not the other ten percent. And those guys, listen, we lost -- I
don't mean to give you a long answer here -- we lost to Ole Miss in Puerto
Rico. The next day in practice, I didn't have to say boo. It was an
unbelievable practice. That's what we had for the last three days. I said you
ain't coming now, then you're not playing and you and me are going to have
some issues. And they were unbelievable in practice.  
Our practices the last three days, tremendous edge to them. And the way we
play, that's how we gotta practice, because it carries us right into games.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  80  
Texas Tech - 68

  
CHARLIE FISS: We'll introduce Head Coach Pat Knight and his student-athletes
John Roberson and Mike Singletary. Coach, your comments.  
COACH KNIGHT: Okay. I'm really proud of these guys. We've had a rough three
weeks. Losing seven in a row. And we came in the tournament figuring if we
could just win one, the first one, it would give us a chance to be considered
for the NIT. And being able to win like we did yesterday and play as well as
we did, especially after losing seven in a row, I don't know how many teams
really could have done that.  
And that was big for us yesterday and today to go against a number one team
and to compete, play as well as we did, I think it was a very good two days
for us.  
And now instead of being in a slump that we had for three weeks, we now have
some momentum going into NIT if we get selected. So I'm proud of these guys.
They played their butts off today. And many kids would have quit after the
three weeks they had. They came back, won a game we had to win yesterday, and
then gave Kansas everything that we had.  
And I can't ask for more from a group of kids.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. John, I'm just wondering how different the game feels if you take the
lead. You had a chance, down I think it was 65, 63. At least a chance to tie
it at that point. Do you think if that happens, maybe, I don't know if this is
a different outcome, but it feels different?  
JOHN ROBERSON: Yeah, I put the blame on me. I had a chance to hit a free throw
and I missed that. And then I had a little shot to tie it up, missed that. I
put that on me. I thought if I would have hit those shots it would have
changed the game for us. But I didn't get it done, so...  
COACH KNIGHT: I'd like to intervene on that, at least the kid had the guts to
take the shot. So many kids would have backed off of that. That's what makes
players like Bird and Magic so good. They want the ball in their hands at
crucial times. I wouldn't have wanted anything more, in anybody's hands than
these two guys. It just didn't fall for them. I appreciate him feeling bad
about it, but at least he had the guts to take the shot.  
Because I wouldn't have taken it. I would have passed it off to Calbert
Cheaney or somebody like that. I have to give him credit for at least taking
it.  
  
Q. What did you guys do particularly in the first half to disrupt them so
much on defense?  
JOHN ROBERSON: We just played hard. I think, Kansas, we were a little bit
intimidated by them. But this time around, we knew we could, if we played hard
we could have a chance. We just played hard. We were communicating on defense.
We just followed the game plan.  
MIKE SINGLETARY: I think we just -- we controlled the boards a little bit, and
that's a big key whenever you play teams like Kansas because they offensive
rebound like crazy.  
We controlled them from getting a lot of offensive boards, and we made some
shots. We knocked down a few buckets. I think that's what kept us in the game?  
  
Q. You guys get a little bit of accomplishment like the Coach said, it was a
rough three weeks, and you know to kind of turn it around and win a game and
give Kansas everything it wanted?  
MIKE SINGLETARY: It always feels good to get back that winning taste in your
mouth. After the three weeks we had, it was a rough three weeks for us. We
just wanted to come out in this tournament and just play hard and just put
everything, lay everything on the floor. And I think we did that in the two
games, and we gave Kansas all they can handle. They're a great team. And we
were right there with them?  
  
Q. John, how do you fight the feeling that in this case a team like Kansas
is inevitable? You know they'll come back, even if you're ahead by ten you
know they'll come back. How do you fight off that?  
JOHN ROBERSON: It's hard, but I think the coaches did a great job of calling
timeouts when they were making runs and when we were ahead in the first half
for a little bit. We knew they were going to make a run.  
But it's just all about not making turnovers and you know helping them out and
helping them make a run. And we kind of did that. We kind of had a little bit
of a stretch where we had turnovers and we let them get a conversion and make
shots, wide open shots. So if you can take care of the ball and control the
boards, I think you can stop them from making a run?  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. The last 5:55, after John tied it up, you had two buckets. Was it you
guys getting shots that didn't fall, or do you feel like they ramped up their
defense a little bit, what do you think happened there?  
COACH KNIGHT: I think it's both. Even John, we were talking about it in the
timeout. I just asked him is there anything you guys want to run, one of our
entries.  
And he talked about they're so solid in their half court defense that if we
could try to get a couple quick buckets. But I mean, they are solid. You drive
the ball. Cole's there to help. They helped down in the post. They rotated
really well. They're as solid as a team we've played from a half court
situation.  
I think we missed some shots. But that's part of playing good defense. You
force a team to make shots by pressure. But then the problem is if you start
playing faster they want you to do that, too, because they're so good at that.
But that's why they're so good. But it caught up to us. We made some mistakes,
and the good teams will capitalize.  
You have a chance to tie it. They go down and hit a 3. Now they're up 3. Come
down, if we don't hit a shot they come down. So now they're up 6.  
But that's what good teams do.  
  
Q. You guys had your defensive problems coming down the stretch of the
season. Now you put together two good defensive games. What's the difference
there?  
COACH KNIGHT: Kids just listen. You know, they followed the game plan the last
two games. I don't think they did it very much the three weeks. And I was
careful about talking about that. I mean, you don't want to throw kids under
the bus, especially when you're going through a losing streak that we did.  
But honestly we didn't change anything from the first Kansas game to this
game, and we didn't change anything from the first Colorado to the second
game.  
I think they just focused and they listened and played as a unit. And it's not
all five guys. Man-to-man defense it takes one guy to not do his job and then
everything goes kaput, because now you've got guys having to help with the
rotation.  
It gets pretty messy. And finally, these last two games, I think we had all
five guys on the same page.  
  
Q. Pat, it looked like Darko gave you a lift knocking down some shots. Could
you talk about the offensive contribution you got from him?  
COACH KNIGHT: That was huge. Because he's been missing that shot the last
couple of weeks. But he's allowed to shoot that shot and now for him to hit
it, because he's going to get open. A lot of big guys defensively don't want
to come out that far, ten to 15 feet to defend it. So with our offense, it
helps us when you can hit that shot down there. It opens up things. Especially
after he hits a couple now they have to come out and guard him, now it opens
the driving lane. It was big for us. It helped us keep us in the game, not
just by him scoring but it brought attention to him and now I think some of
the other guys got some easy buckets that we wouldn't have gotten if he would
have missed those shots.  
  
Q. Pat, how good were you feeling at halftime, forcing them into some
uncharacteristic mistakes I thought for them?  
COACH KNIGHT: We felt good. Because it was a 20-point turnaround. We were down
22 up there and just out of it. And then just to be down by 2. We felt good.
But we know how they are. Like we talked about earlier, a team like that you
know is going to come back. If you get them up ten they can come back. They're
so potent from an offensive/defensive standpoint. You just can't get too happy
with yourself.  
But since what we've been through we try to keep our guys' confidence high and
praised them for the job they did. In the back of your mind you know it's
Kansas and you try to keep fighting along with them.  
  
Q. Pat, Aldrich, does the guy's just very presence alter games, and is there
anybody like him in the college game today? Doesn't look like he has to move
and he alters shots?  
COACH KNIGHT: I think we've got two of the best defensive big men in the
country. I think those two you'd have to add Udoh to that. I mean, they
changed things around. I mean, when you drive now, you really have to go
inside and out. You can't drive like you're in high school go off one leg like
it's the lay-up line because they're going to get it. The other thing is he is
good on the help side, on the drive side you're focusing on the man guard and
now you go up and all of a sudden here comes Cole or Udoh covering from
behind. You don't see it. That's what championship teams need. I think that's
why Kansas is one of those teams, why can't they win it all. Bill is a buddy
of mine, I don't want to put pressure on him, but I think to be that good you
have to have that presence. And I think Scott's got that, too, with Udoh. It
makes all the difference in the world. You can talk about I'd like to have
that player or that player from a guard or wing situation, but if you want to
win championships, you want that guy like Cole or Udoh because they make such
a big difference from the defensive end.  
If you make a mistake on the ball, at least you know you've got somebody there
that can back you up.  
  
Q. You talked all season long about this team needing to show improvement
last year to this year. Other than the winning record and a possible NIT bid,
what did you improve on the most and what did you need going into next year?  
COACH KNIGHT: You know, again we were good offensively. We put together halves
where we score 50 some points. But defensively I think we improved.  
Now, overall, you look at the stats, it's just a little better. But last year
we didn't have, we didn't put together any good halves of defense. We've had
halves where we kept teams in the 20s, the 30s, but now we've just got to get
to a point where you do it for two halves. And again defense would be a focal
point right after we get done with this season. Because offensively I like
what we have. I mean, we have enough. We're more talented, we're more athletic
but we're more athletic to the point where I think we should be better
defensively.  
And like we were talking about the post presence, we've got to work with
Robert and the new big guys we're bringing in just getting a post presence.
Because that can really help you from a man-to-man situation. Now that we've
got a guy that's always there on the help line. He doesn't have to be a huge
shot blocker. Robert is big enough to cause some problems. And so defensively,
again, we just have to improve. But I'm thrilled to death with these guys.
We've got more talent. We're more athletic. They played hard. They played all
the way to the end. I didn't have a problem during the three weeks. I have
people call me: Are you doing okay? What are practices like? They're waiting
for me to talk about my kids are a pain in the butt, they've quit. I had no
problems. It's like we're sitting there 25-2 the way they competed. And so
these guys have been a joy to coach.  
They're my kids, and I look forward to next year. We'll have six seniors.
Great core of returning. Yeah, should we have won more games, I think so. I
think we could have won three or four more in the league. And I got lucky as a
coach. I keep getting better just like my players. I think people kind of
confuse -- they kind of put my dad and I together like we're one in the same.
This is only my second year of coaching, and it's in the Big 12. So many of
these coaches have had the opportunity to start on a smaller league.  
I'm like the amateur boxer that decides to go pro after golden gloves. And
they tell me go fight Muhammad Ali. So I'm working on that. I have to get
better each year. And I've got to go back and see what happened with those
three weeks. There's got to be something I could different not to fall in a
rut like that.  
But overall I'm pleased with these kids. I love these guys, and I really look
forward to having them all come back next year.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  86  
Texas - 67

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined by Baylor Bears, Coach Scott Drew, and his three
student-athletes Tweety Carter, LaceDarius Dunn, and Ekpe Udoh. Coach, we'll
call on you first for your thoughts on tonight's victory.  
  
COACH DREW: Well, I knew in the beginning of the game, especially waiting
around as long as we had to play, early on wanted to make sure we took care of
the ball, got high percentage shots. And we were able to withstand any surge
Texas would have early on.  
And when Lace got in foul trouble, I thought the team really rallied, did a
great job going into halftime. We felt good from the standpoint we were up,
and we knew with Lace coming back and we knew we could play a little bit
better as far as the rebounding goes, especially. We were excited for the
second half and I think the first couple minutes in the second half really
were big for us.  
All year long we've had great upper classman leadership, Josh, Tweety, Ekpe,
and Lace, and I thought once again they did a great job. When you have good
leaders like this, you have good team chemistry. It makes your coaching job a
lot easier.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Lace, what happened on the tech?  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: Got caught up in the moment. One of my players,
unfortunately, got into it with one of their players. I got caught up in the
moment.  
COACH DREW: I thought it was algebra you were talking about.  
[Laughter]  
  
Q. LaceDarius Dunn and Tweety, can you talk about getting to four in a row
against Texas. Did you see it in their eyes that they were done in the final
four minutes of the game? What did you see out there?  
TWEETY CARTER: No. We knew we had to come out and play 40 minutes. Texas is a
good team. They play and fight hard. We knew we had to come out and play 40
minutes. Like coach said, we did a great job when our leading scorer was out.
The first half we did a great job maintaining the lead. And second half we
were able to get him back in and keep him out of foul trouble, and fortunately
we got the win.  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: Well, he really summed it up. We knew we had to come out,
play 40 minutes against a team. I think we did a great job just coming out and
messing with their intensity. They beat us on the rebounding, but I think we
just gotta do a better job of that tomorrow against K-State. They're a little
bit better team. We'll try to do a little bit better tomorrow.  
  
Q. Lace, how eager were you to come out and make an impact in the second
half because you didn't get to play that much in the first half?  
LACEDARIUS DUNN: I wanted to come out and just provide for my team. Just
really didn't do the things that I do, that I been doing throughout the year.
Score the ball, rebounding, whatever it takes to get the victory. So I think I
did a great job of it.  
  
Q. Ekpe, it looks like you guys aren't satisfied even though you know you're
in the NCAA tournament. You all really came out and played with a vengeance
tonight.  
EKPE UDOH: We're here to win the tournament. That's what our mindset was. So
just coming out this game, we got the win, but we can't dwell on it.  
Frank Martin has Kansas State playing really well. We've got to get ready for
them.  
  
Q. Damion James said last night this game was personal for him. I guess it
was personal for you guys, too. Did that comment mean anything?  
TWEETY CARTER: I mean, anytime you hear a comment like that you're always
going to come out with another boost of energy. Yeah, every team we played we
take it personal because we want to win, every game.  
So we just wanted to come out and show that we belong here. And I mean, that
was his opinion. You know, it's been like that with every team we've played.  
  
Q. Tweety, you were at Baylor when Baylor lost 24 games in a row to Texas.
And now you've won four in a row. Can you kind of talk about how the series
has changed? Now it seems like you expect to beat them, and really have them
frustrated playing against you.  
TWEETY CARTER: You know, when I first got here, you never know what you're
getting yourself into when you come to a program that had been down for so
long.  
I always wanted to be a part of something special. And when I was getting
recruited, I felt like this was a special program, special team. And first
year didn't go like we wanted it to. But every year you want to come out and
play. And our season is big in beating Texas.  
And fortunately we got four wins in a row. That's a great thing. But you never
know. We might see them again.  
  
Q. Ekpe, you and Lace keyed the 13-0 run to start the second half. Could you
talk about what was working there and how key that was to kind of build the
lead there to start the second half?  
EKPE UDOH: I mean, we were just having fun out there. You could see on our
faces, we just came out. Lace got hot. That's what he does. We just had fun
and stayed together.  
  
Q. Tweety, talk about, you had a pretty good performance against cans sass
state the first time around. You're going to need some help this time. Kansas
State is playing pretty well. What will you have to do, and Ekpe, the same for
you, too. Because their front line was good tonight?  
TWEETY CARTER: We've got to come out and play Baylor basketball. Take care of
the ball and rebound. Like Lace said earlier, we've got to rebound, because
like tonight we got our rebound tonight. But we got the win. We've got to come
out and match their intensity tomorrow. But most importantly take care of the
ball and just come out and play Baylor basketball.  
EKPE UDOH: We've just got to stay aggressive. You know, I mean, Kansas State's
front line was probably more aggressive than we were. It starts out with me
being the defensive player I am, I gotta get us going on defense. And offense
is going to take care of itself.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. I don't know how much it means to you, but at the end of the game fans
were chanting four in a row against Texas. Can you appreciate how much this
means to Baylor fans and the family beating a rival like this four times in a
row?  
COACH DREW: I think we just approach it one game at a time. I know Texas is a
very good team. And Coach Barnes does a great job. He's made it an elite
program in the nation. Anytime you beat them, period, you're doing something
well.  
And I think it just shows where our program's at right now and what we've been
able to accomplish, and again all the credit goes to the players, because when
you have players coaching, they make us look pretty good.  
  
Q. You guys just don't seem satisfied at all. It seems like these guys just
want more every time.  
COACH DREW: I think part of that is from the standpoint that we've been on a
roll. And it's fun playing when you're hot, when you're doing good things.  
We held them to 36 percent defensive field goal percentage. And I think
Tweety, up front, really set that tone in the second half for that spurt. And
Ekpe, and they're enjoying themselves right now. I think their hard work is
paying off and it's showing.  
  
Q. Scott, can you talk about just being able to hold the lead there in the
first half with Lace out as long as he was?  
COACH DREW: Anytime you're able to be up, period, when you're missing your
leading scorer for 15 minutes is a pretty good thing.  
I think Fred Ellis really stepped up, hit two big 3s for us, but all year
we've had different players step up and do good things when time was needed.
And again, that's what makes a good team. I think people can see we have great
team chemistry. And again, the upper classmen deserve all the credit for that.  
  
Q. There are sometimes coaches know that there's a game coming up or a big
game, and sometimes it maybe has a feel that it could be one of those really
good games. Is that the kind of feel you have with Kansas State coming up
tomorrow?  
COACH DREW: In the Big 12, every one of those games, you have a feeling like
that. And, again, I mean you're playing the number one conference in the
country. Number one RPI. 28 and 12 against other BCS schools. 106 won
nonconference record. If you're not up for every game, you're getting beat. I
think this tournament shows that by the upsets we had to begin it.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what you expect from Kansas State? It's
going to be pretty much a home game for them?  
COACH DREW: We're hoping that all their fans have to go to work tomorrow, but
I think it's a situation where we have two very good teams, two teams in the
RPI's top ten in the country. And I know last time it was a great game. Came
down to the last nine seconds. And probably it will do the exact same thing
tomorrow, if we play well.  
If we don't play well, then we don't have a chance.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  86  
Texas - 67

  
CHARLIE FISS: Joined now by Coach Barnes from Texas. Let's go straight to
questions for him.  
  
Q. Can you sum up what happened out there?  
COACH BARNES: I think it sums up our whole season in the last couple of
months. We go through a four-, five-minute period where we just come
unraveled. And all at once everybody thinks or someone thinks that I've got to
go do it to try to turn it around as opposed to staying together.  
Again, this game pretty much sums up the inconsistencies we've had all year.  
  
Q. Speaking of that, there was a point where I guess it was 71-63, J'Covan
takes a 3. Kind of a bad shot. Dunn comes down, hits a 3.  
COACH BARNES: Wide open shot there. Think about it, he probably had a better
shot than the one -- I know the play you're talking about. Again, at that
point in time, you know, again, he's wide open, and it's hard not to take that
shot.  
And, again, Lace goes down and hits one and we miss it. I didn't have a
problem with him taking that 3 because he got a great look at it.  
  
Q. Rick, you guys cut it to 5 and seemed to have it going. Then they made
another run. How did it get away at that point?  
COACH BARNES: Well, again, I think we go through a period where, again, what
we really wanted to do was obviously continue going inside putting pressure on
their post players. They've got some guys that can really score the ball. And
I think we missed a couple free throws there. And then we did have some shots.
But, again, it goes back, when we get away -- and we had a couple turnovers
there at the start -- I thought the way we started second half was not good.
Again, it's a period we go through.  
For whatever reason, we get down. Then we get aggressive, and we wanted to be
aggressive all night long. But, again, this game pretty much sums up what our
season has been the last two months.  
But it's like I told the team, you know, the whole deal is every year is to
get to the NCAA tournament. And we've built our program to where, you know, we
are where we are right now. And people are disappointed in the season we've
had up to this point, but, yet, there's a lot of teams that would like to
trade places with us right now, and one of them is the defending national
champion that's not in that tournament. And it's not something -- so, again,
we go back. We've got a week here to try to improve on some things that we
continue to talk about.  
But one of our goals was to get to the NCAA tournament. We're going to be
there. And I just hope that we can do what at times we've proven we can be a
really good team. But we have to stay together for 40 minutes. And we haven't
done that consistently in a long time.  
  
Q. At this point in the season, what can you do, I mean, to kind of minimize
some of those lapses and get this team together as you head into this NCAA
tournament that you --  
COACH BARNES: We tried all year. If I had put my finger on it, I would have
done it a long time ago. It's right when you think you've turned a corner in
some ways, guys you're really counting on, they don't -- you know, they're not
as consistent.  
Again, honestly, if I could put my finger on that, I would. And we would
change it. It's just consistency. And, again, those stretches, and I wish I
had the answer to that. If I did, I would have tried to already put it in
place.  
  
Q. Baylor hit 53 percent of its shots tonight. Were they just good shot-
makers hitting shots?  
COACH BARNES: They made a couple tough shots. But they're an outstanding
offensive team now. I mean, one, I think they've got a guy in Tweety Carter
that's been around and played a lot of minutes. And he's going to make a lot
of teams good by what he does and the things that he creates.  
Obviously tonight, you know, Udoh played extremely well. We have done a better
job on him than we did tonight. And LaceDarius Dunn, their two guards, I
mentioned last night that Iowa State had two of the best forwards tandem in
the country. You look at Baylor's guards, they played a lot of minutes
together and they both were very explosive offensively, very difficult to
guard. But offensively, they're a really good team. They really -- they have
some guys that can make some shots and they can make some tough shots.  
  
Q. Rick, your guys got it going when they got into transition, and they were
getting up and down the floor a little bit. Seems like that's when they have
the most fun playing together and when it all comes together. How do you get
that?  
COACH BARNES: Again, we talk about all year running, getting down the floor.
Again, I can tell you this, at no point in time this year, until maybe it gets
to the end of the game when it's a situational-type game, if we ever, as a
coaching staff, said we're going to walk the ball up the floor. We always
encourage, run, run, get down the floor and try to flow.  
And we are -- we're better when we do that. But again it goes back to
consistency.  
CHARLIE FISS: Joined by student-athletes from Texas Damion James and Justin
Mason. Let's direct some questions to them.  
  
Q. What happened when you got that technical? You look frustrated with
something when you slammed the ball down?  
DAMION JAMES: Yeah. I let my emotions get the best of me. They was talking a
lot of noise. And, you know, just me being a player, I just got frustrated,
and coach said I can't do that. I let my team down. I gotta keep my composure.
So I really disappointed myself. But I can't do it because it's not about me,
it's about the team.  
  
Q. Damion, last night you said you wanted this to be personal. What are you
most disappointed about, you and Mason, after this game?  
DAMION JAMES: To be honest, I think we really competed. We just gotta go
through our game plan, man. We broke down a couple times where we were making
a run and coach emphasized we need to get the ball inside. And, you know, it's
just difficult, man, because, you know, we was right there where we need to
be, and we broke down as a team. So we can't point the blame on no individual
player. We just broke down it's just a new season, and we've got to keep going
forward.  
  
Q. Justin, could you just kind of sum up where this team is now mentally as
you go home to await for Sunday?  
JUSTIN MASON: Well, a 0-0 record. We have to take this loss, the hurt that we
all have, the feelings that we have after this loss. We didn't want to go into
this game and for it to turn out this way. But we get another chance. A lot of
teams don't get another chance this time of the season. We gotta go home and
see where we go on Sunday. And use this fuel to our fire and realize we're
still a good team. And I think all of us are going to be confident.  
  
Q. Damion James, coach said that this game just was inconsistent, it's a
small picture of what's been going on all season long. Would you just describe
that?  
DAMION JAMES: Playing together as a team -- we gotta stay together as a team.
Even when the other team is making a run, we gotta stay together on offense
and defense on both ends of the ball. We just can't break down.  
It's tough, man, because like I said, I really thought we competed. And at the
beginning of the second half, you know, they was talking and I let that get
the best of me. And I broke down. I can't do that. When they did that, they
made their run. And we tried to come back, but you can't let five minutes get
away from you like that, because it could be a one possession game.  
That's all you need is that one possession and we let that five minutes go,
and we could never get it back.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Rick, do you think that you face a psychological task here in the next
few days with these guys?  
COACH BARNES: You know, Mike, I feel like we faced that all year in some way,
some shape or form, whether it's with individual guys or as a team.  
I mean, it goes back -- we've just been so inconsistent. And not just one guy.
I think every guy has. Like last night, I thought we came in here and beat a
team that's been playing really, really good.  
And to be quite frank, I'm baffled that we could go and do what we did today
through a five-minute period. I thought we had taken some steps forward, which
we seemed to do. Then we'll take a step backwards.  
And like the question earlier, if I knew how to fix it, I would. And I mean, I
know what it is, it's inconsistency. It's from game to game wondering who is
going to do their job, night in, night out. And it's not so much sometimes
effort-wise, it's mentally.  
It's like Damion James said, it's sticking with our game plan and executing
it. And it takes all five guys to do that. And if one guy breaks down, whether
it's on the offensive or defensive end, it gets away from you. But, yeah, I
mean, again I just -- and what's really unbelievable as a group this year, we
haven't had very many bad practices now. We've had situations where some guys
aren't as good as they need to be every day. But as a group, you know,
overall, I mean it hasn't been a team that hasn't practiced well, we just
haven't gotten to carry over mentally where we need to stay with it. I don't
know if it's psychological.  
I don't know if it's continuing to grow as a team. You know, some of the
younger guys, I mean, we know Gary has been terrific, for whatever reason
tonight he had a tough night. He had a really tough night.  
And right from the get-go. I can't tell you that -- there's times when other
guys turn the corner and then they're not there. Again, it's inconsistency.
And I think it's more mental than it is physical, I really do. So whether you
put it psychological, I don't know, we'll go back and see if we can -- again,
first of all, and I really believe this, I hope they get really excited about
the fact that we're going to be part of what every team that starts the season
wants to be a part of.  
And I've said before, you do not take that for granted. And so we're going to
be 12 years in a row now, we've been a part of what I think is the best
sporting event in the country. And I hope we can, again, do something with it.
I've had teams in the past that I've coached that have been just where we are
mentally. And believe it or not, they've been able to go and get it turned
around and had a team that, I'm telling you, exact same situation, we end up
going to the Sweet 16, and ended up losing to a team in triple overtime that
went to the Final Four. When we left the ACC tournament that year, I was as
bewildered as I am right now.  
And so how we flipped it, to be quite honest with you, they flipped it. And
hopefully we can or they can do it right now, because if I could flip it, I
would have flipped it two months ago.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas State  83  
Oklahoma State - 64

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined by Oklahoma State. Coach Travis Ford and student-
athletes James Anderson and Matt Pilgrim. Your assessment of tonight's game.  
  
COACH FORD: We have to give Kansas State a lot of credit. Played extremely
well. Came out, took it to us really.  
I thought we were a bit flat. And we knew we were going to get an incredible
effort from them. After the game earlier this year, and then we were in a big
game last year. We knew they were going to come out ready to play.  
And we just -- you know, they made a big run at us early in the game and got
up a lot of points. And we cut it all the way back and got it to 5 respectably
and weren't playing really well. And then we were devastated with foul
trouble. And that hurt us tremendously.  
And just give the credit -- we were just sluggish, didn't bring our A game. It
was a bad combination for us. They played extremely well. We didn't play
particularly well tonight. But just one of those nights. But give Kansas State
a lot of credit. They played real well.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. James, Obi got his third foul and then Matt got his third, and you're
playing with sort of a lineup you don't generally play with. And that's when
Kansas State took over the game. Could you talk about how out of rhythm
everything got during that stretch of the game when you were playing with
Dowell and Gulley and whoever else was on the court?  
JAMES ANDERSON: I think it was pretty much the lineup we had. I know Matt and
Obi, we need both of those in the game, and I mean it hurt our team when they
go out. But it wasn't the lineup. The plays we were making, we were making
more positive than negative.  
Anytime you make more negative than positive, it hurts your team.  
  
Q. James, you didn't shoot it particularly well here for two nights. You be
glad to kind of leave this building behind?  
JAMES ANDERSON: I wouldn't say just leaving the building. I didn't shoot good.
Last night or tonight. I wanted to stay here and play another game and compete
for the Big 12 championship. And I mean, it didn't happen that way. So we're
on to the next game.  
  
Q. Matt, can you talk about Kansas State? Seems like they've got a bunch of
guys about your size and your athletic ability. Seems like they can run a lot
of different people at you and Marshall when he's in for you. And it seemed
like you got overwhelmed by the numbers.  
MATT PILGRIM: We was prepared for that, because coach prepped us for game
rebounding. We knew that was going to come. They just got a great, great front
court. So can't really complain. All you can do is go with what you've got.  
  
Q. James, last time you guys faced Kansas State, Jamar Samuels, No. 32 only
played 13 minutes and fouled out of the game with five points. Did you have
any inkling heading in that he was capable of putting up the type of numbers
that he did tonight?  
JAMES ANDERSON: We knew from the scouting report that he was a big kid who had
-- he was like the glue guy of their team. He would get all the offensive and
defensive boards and just a hustle guy.  
We knew that he was capable of putting up numbers. And I mean, he just
outhustled us tonight and that's something that we can't let guys do. And he
came in and made some big plays for them.  
  
Q. Matt, you might talk about that maybe hustling is just part of the answer
to this. But the rebounding numbers are ugly, especially in the first half, 25
to 8. And I guess Samuels outrebounded by himself your team. Can you talk
about the problem there?  
MATT PILGRIM: Honestly, we just got out-toughed. We were a bit sluggish but
that's not an excuse. The numbers speak for themselves, really, so...  
  
Q. Guys, would you both talk about just moving on now? You've got bigger
things to play for down the road.  
JAMES ANDERSON: Yeah, this game is over. I mean, we just gotta get back to the
gym and start preparing for whoever we are going to face in the tournament,
and just start getting our team back on the positive side. Start from the
second half of last night's game, carry it over to today, we made more
negative plays than positive plays, and we've just got to get back to the gym
and get our team on the positive side again, and just get ready for our
opponent.  
MATT PILGRIM: We can learn from this game, because Kansas State is going to be
or 1 or 2 seed. So we finally know what it takes to win an NCAA tournament.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you very much. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's guesswork, but where do you see yourself as a seed?
And did today really hurt that much given how good K-State is?  
COACH FORD: I thought we could only help ourselves. I thought we helped
ourselves last night. I thought every win that we could get in this tournament
would help us.  
A lot has to do with other teams as well. You know, I don't understand -- I
think if you sit and try to figure out the whole thing it would drive you
crazy. There's no way to figure it out. Because you don't know exactly what to
do.  
But who knows. Who knows. But I thought we could improve our seeding with
every game that we played. But, again, a lot of it depends on what other teams
do.  
  
Q. Along that same line, at the end of the game you were talking, it looked
like, to your starters. Were you looking forward with them talking NCAA
tournament, or take us inside that last conversation?  
COACH FORD: When you play like we did tonight, you try to figure out as many
-- you try to make a positive out of a negative as much as you can. And you
try to learn from it. And I didn't want -- at this time of year, win or lose,
you've got to move on.  
I didn't want our team being down. They knew they didn't play well. They knew
that. They knew they ran into a great basketball team who we had beaten
earlier in the year in their own gym.  
We knew it was going to take a special effort today. I thought we were ready
today. I thought we had a good shoot-around. Last night, us not playing well
in the second half carried over a little bit. We had to probably use a little
bit more energy than we thought we were going to after the first half of last
night's game.  
But I was proud of our team. The other team came back, made a run, cut it down
to 20. If there's a positive. And I did. I told them in timeout let's get this
thing under 20, let's see if we can do that.  
Let's set some mini-goals here, and we did that. But I just wanted to talk to
them about, hey, now the fun begins. And we've got 22 wins. Young basketball
team. And we've won some great games this year, and now we get to go to the
NCAA tournament, and let's get back on the court, let's practice and let's put
this aside. We got beat by a great team. We didn't play very well. All right.
Move on.  
  
Q. Coach, again this shows what a contrast this time of year is. I mean,
last night, couldn't miss. This night -- talk about that contrast and the
difference in how important it is to have that A game every night when it's
single elimination.  
COACH FORD: That's the name of the game this time of year, which team can
bring their best game the most consecutive nights. That's the key to this time
of year.  
And we played pretty good basketball last night. Not great, okay basketball.
Good enough to win by 14, 16, whatever it was. But tonight we ran into a very
hungry basketball team, a team that -- I'm sure they talked about when we beat
them last year at our place in a big game, playing for the NCAA tournament,
beat them there.  
Then we go to their place this year, they're a top ten team, and we won there.
Last night took a little bit out of us. I don't think that's an excuse. It
magnifies it when you dig yourself a hole like we did tonight. It magnifies
being tired a little bit, to try to dig out of a hole like we did.  
But we did, we dug out of it early cutting it back to 5 after digging
ourselves a huge hole. But foul trouble killed us tonight, because with their
pressure we need Obi on the court and with their rebounding ability we need
Matt on the court.  
  
Q. Travis, big picture, not this tournament or next week, big picture: Did
this game show that while you've made great strides, you just need more good
players? You've got good players. Your good players are about as good as their
good players, they just seem to have a lot more.  
COACH FORD: Yeah, we've got some work to do. No question. We've had two good
years. We've got to go out and continue to build this thing. We're still
building, still a ways away. We have to continue to get good players to
compete at the level we need to compete at in this league. But we've been able
to compete with the best in this league with what we've got. But there's just
so small room for error for our basketball team because we're not overly deep.  
Some guys have to step up, who got an opportunity tonight and we didn't play
particularly well.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  70  
Nebraska - 64

  
CHARLIE FISS: Joined now by Nebraska, Head Coach Doc Sadler and his student-
athletes Sek Henry and Ryan Anderson. Coach, let's go to you first.  
COACH SADLER: First of all, you've got to give Texas A&M credit. They came
out, especially the first half, and I thought they were the aggressive
basketball team. As I told our team at halftime, you know, I thought they were
the team with their backs to the wall instead of us. And we had to pick up the
effort to have a chance to win.  
And the first minute to two minutes in the second half, it was difficult and
it got us down I think 18 -- 16-18. But as this season's unfolded, this
basketball team, because of Ryan and Sek and Chris and Ben being the leaders
to this whole thing, they just came back and fought as hard as they could
fight. And I actually had a chance to -- actually had a chance to maybe win
the basketball game.  
To be honest with you, that doesn't surprise me, because that's the way this
team has competed every night. Obviously, we're disappointed, disappointed in
the end of the season. But as I told the team, the character in that locker
room is really, really strong.  
And you know, I hear stories that athletics is supposed to teach you lifelong
lessons, and if that's the case then these guys are going to be very, very
successful people, because their character is unbelievable.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. How much does it erase the bad feeling from the regular season, the fact
that you played so well here, won a game and could have won the second game?  
RYAN ANDERSON: Like Coach said, I think it showed the character of our team.
We fought hard all season. At conference time we fought really hard. And we
came out here and we fought really hard, you know what I mean?  
And the outcome, they made some plays. Hats off to those guys. They made some
shots. And capitalized on some mistakes that we made. But overall, you know
what I mean, it's just -- it's tough, man. You know what I mean? It would have
been nice to win this game, keep going with these guys. Because this is it for
us, you know what I mean? But it's just a great season overall, even though we
didn't win as many games as we wanted, it was just a great experience.  
  
Q. What will you take from your careers at Nebraska? What sticks out in your
mind?  
SEK HENRY: How Coach taught us to play hard and stay with the focus to just
play hard no matter what and never give up. And that never-give-up attitude by
Coach spread out like cancer on the team. That's how we played all year. The
previous years we did pretty good. Like last year we finished 8-8. And this
year we had a pretty tough year for us. And we still played hard every single
game.  
And that's one thing I really love about our team, is that we never did give
up, because we could have easily gave up and just said it's all over, but we
didn't. We gave ourselves a chance to win this game today even though we were
down a lot of points. Just the fight, the team and believing in our Coach?  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. There was a play late in the game where I think it was Richardson tried
to take a charge, didn't get a call, and they swung it around and got a
3-pointer. Did the fact that he's on the ground cause people to move and give
them that open shot?  
COACH SADLER: I think you ended up with two bodies on the floor. And you ended
up getting a shot. And they made the shot.  
So, you know, I told the coaches afterwards -- I mean, Donald Sloan is their
A.C. Law. A.C. Law made so many big shots that senior year. Donald Sloan did
the same. He stepped up and made that play.  
And so you gotta give him credit for it. But was it big, no question it was
huge. But he made the shot.  
  
Q. How do you get this thing back on track? What are the lessons you take
from this year?  
COACH SADLER: Well, I know a lot of people probably don't like this answer,
but I don't think it's that far off the track. I mean, if you look at our
record, it was not good. But if you watched our team for 16 games, I think
they gave everything that they had.  
So that part of it is the hardest thing to get. And, you know, we've got to
have -- at Nebraska you've got to have some luck. We can't lose-going every
season losing guys that you think are going to be starting for you. And that's
what happened this year.  
I mean, you lose two guys before the season starts. But hopefully they'll be
back, if everything goes well. So I think all of us in this room knows how
hard it is to be 2 and 14. But there's very few in this room that really
probably understands how competitive and how giving this team has been,
because you hadn't had a chance to see them as much as I have.  
So if you look at wins and losses, which is that's what it's judged on, we've
got a lot of work to do. But the good news is I truly believe that 80 to 90
percent of the work to get you over the hump has been done. So I don't think
it's as far off as maybe some people.  
But if you look at wins and losses, it's a long ways.  
  
Q. You talked about the beginning of the game kind of starting slow, then
you came back in the first half. And the last minute or so kind of killed you
with all the work that you had done for those ten minutes. Can you talk a
little bit about that?  
COACH SADLER: Yeah, the last minute of the half and in the first minute and a
half or the two minutes in the second half. That three-minute period right
there really -- it made it difficult for us, the 3-pointer at the end of the
half was difficult. But then they came out and I think -- did we give up five
straight points, maybe, in the start of the second half, which made it
difficult also.  
So those probably three possessions, as you said, made it really, really
difficult. But to these guys' credit, you know, they fought their way back and
had a chance.  
So that part of the game was not a good part for us, the last minute or the
first two minutes.  
  
Q. Were there any signs of progress in your mind this year or any signs of
optimism for next year? Anything you can take out of this year and build on?  
COACH SADLER: Again, Tom, I think the biggest thing is I can't imagine wins
and losses being any tougher than it's going to be this year. And to continue
to practice the way we practiced all year, that's what gave me hope each day.
But I'm sure sitting back now and reflecting on this season, that's what's
really going to give me a lot of hope. So that part of it -- do we need to
fill some pieces, no question.  
We've still got to get a guy, as you well know, Tom, we've got to get a guy
that can go make that big play for us and that can go make it offensively. But
I challenged these guys. I challenged them a lot, and you've seen how they've
responded.  
So especially in today's world, I mean, a lot of guys you probably can't
challenge the way I've challenged them and get the same response. But that's
the positive -- of all the other things, that would be the most positive thing
I'll take from it.  
  
Q. Were you surprised without Dash that you weren't able to force a few more
turnovers; did that disappoint you at all?  
COACH SADLER: No, not really, because they don't turn the basketball over.
Mark's teams take care of the basketball. They don't turn it over. You know,
we're short on the guard end also. It's not like we can pick up and try to
force the issue. And on top of that, after playing yesterday. I wouldn't
change anything that way.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

### [Cole Aldrich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18488)

### [Sherron Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17030)

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas  80  
Texas Tech - 68

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're ready to begin with the Kansas Jayhawks. Coach Bill Self
and his student-athletes Sherron Collins and Cole Aldrich. Coach, we'll go to
you first for your thoughts on today's victory.  
COACH SELF: Pass.  
[Laughter] No, I thought today we played very well. I never thought we guarded
them or got any rhythm defensively. I thought they played good. I thought that
we obviously played much better the second half, and we had some guys step up
and make some big shots. But that wasn't the energy level that I would hope
that we would play with from this point forward.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for Sherron Collins and Cole Aldrich.  
  
Q. Sherron, it's your senior year, are you trying to basically extend it as
long as you can by lasting in the Big 12 tournament?  
SHERRON COLLINS: Last year we took an early exit. This year we're trying to
prevent that. We already won the regular season so we know we still gotta
motivated to win the tournament as well. So we're trying not to have any
slipups.  
  
Q. Cole and Sherron, obviously you guys didn't play as well as you wanted
to. But was this a little bit, maybe, NCAA tournament atmosphere, enough of a
tough game to get you guys cranked up for what's going to be coming up here in
the next week or so?  
COLE ALDRICH: Like Coach said in the locker room, this is going to be a better
atmosphere than we will wherever we get seeded in tournament.  
It's one of those things we've got to come together as a team and create our
own energy and get the whole team involved with getting pumped up for the
game, whether it's at 11:30 in the morning or 8:00 at night.  
SHERRON COLLINS: I agree with him. Like he said you have to build your own
energy, got to be ready to play. It only takes a few possessions and you could
be going home, especially in the tournament game. And this was a tournament
game with a tournament atmosphere. This is better than tournament atmosphere.
But it is a like a tournament game.  
  
Q. Sherron, could you talk about, about six minutes to go when Tech cuts it
to 2 and then you and Xavier hit back to back 3s and how that swung the
pendulum little bit?  
SHERRON COLLINS: We got the ball's moving. We didn't move the ball as well as
we should move it the entire game, but we got some -- we got a good reversal
and I was open and I hit a shot. Then we got a steal. It was off a rebound. We
ran the floor. We were able to get it and he hit a 3. We hit some big shots.
That's what we needed. The crowd got into it, and we fed off of that.  
  
Q. Sherron, could you just talk about your game including the foul trouble
and the way you shot it tonight, too?  
SHERRON COLLINS: I think I shot it pretty good. Took a couple of bad shots.
But I gotta do a better job staying out of foul trouble and putting my team in
tough positions.  
No matter what calls were made, there were fouls. I've just got to do a better
job playing on my feet and playing with my head.  
  
Q. Cole you were on the floor, I don't think Sherron was. Describe the play
with five minutes left, and I think Roberson sprayed it up on the floor and
caught you guys napping and cut it to 2.  
COLE ALDRICH: It was just kind of I think a dead ball, and then they just
threw it in quick, and I think like you said we fell asleep, didn't realize
that the ball was in until kind of the crowd kind of gasped and, you know,
it's one of those things that we really got to touch up, because those things
that can really hurt us in the future.  
  
Q. Sherron and Cole, could you comment on the 2000 victories for the
program?  
SHERRON COLLINS: It means a lot. Right now it means a lot to us right now. But
right now we've got a lot of the game still ahead of us. We don't want to put
too much focus on it. But it means a lot to people who support us and people
who played before us. And all the people who support the program and it means
a lot. It was for them. We won it more for them than for us, and we enjoyed it
and it's great to be a part of it.  
COLE ALDRICH: It's exciting to be part of the 2,000th win because very few
programs have that opportunity. I think when we're all done playing basketball
we'll look at it kind of have a reunion and just kind of hang our hats on just
being a small part of that 2,000. And having so many great players at the
university that played before us is really special.  
  
Q. Their offense, motion offense and Darko stepping out, what kind of
problems did they create for you guys defensively?  
COLE ALDRICH: It was a struggle. First half we didn't really defend them at
all. I mean, the second half was also a struggle. But the one thing that we
gotta do, and we talked about it earlier, is just gotta have energy. The more
energy we have, the more we're able to move our feet on the defensive end. And
I think that the more turned up the better we are defensively.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Cole touched on it. He said there were a lot of things you guys have to
touch up. It seemed like the first half was full of those moments.  
COACH SELF: Yeah, I thought they played better than us for sure the first
half. We were fortunate we were up 2 at the half. And our energy level, like
the guys said, it wasn't very good. And that's the way that we have to play in
order to look good.  
I also thought we missed some easy shots the first half. I thought we got some
lay-ups and didn't finish in transition. First half, we had or for the game we
had 12 opportunities to score in transition, which were pretty good transition
team and scored on five of those.  
And where we had numbers and ended up shooting the ball and coming away empty.
So, yeah, we can improve on a lot of things. You know, we played -- we were
the 2 seed I think and played Oklahoma State a one-point game in Dallas. The
next year we struggled with Oklahoma in the first round.  
The next year we played Nebraska after handling them pretty good. And they got
us down 15 or whatever. So we probably played better today than we did those
games, if that's any consolation for us at all. But certainly we have to play
better tomorrow.  
  
Q. You talked about Cole and Sherron needing to step up in the post-season,
do you feel they took it to heart today?  
COACH SELF: I didn't think either one played very well the first half. Sherron
had points, but had a couple of bad fouls, and I didn't think Cole was a
factor at all. He got ten rebounds but I didn't feel he was a factor at all.
Challenged them at halftime pretty good.  
I thought they both played very well in the second half. Cole's got to be
hungry to score. He's not as hungry to score as he was last year at this
particular moment.  
And that's one thing that we have to do. We've got to be able to throw the
ball to him, have him come away with points or fouls. And I think he can do a
better job of that.  
I thought the second half he did a much better job.  
  
Q. You talked about the energy level. How much impetus is that on Sherron to
get those other guys to raise their energy level?  
COACH SELF: You know, Sherron would tell you it's all on him, that he takes
responsibility for everything going on with our team. Which he should. He's a
point guard. That's what point guards should do. They should be an extension
of the staff and whatever the staff feels they need, that's his job to
implement it.  
But they're a hard team. We came out. We kind of messed around with a little
press. They went right through it. So we just weren't anywhere to create any
momentum. And we didn't have those two or three good possessions in a row
defensively that led to easy baskets like we normally do.  
But give Tech credit, they're a hard team to pressure because they run motion.
Then they had a five-man that was always a pressure release. No matter how
hard we pressured them, Cole's man caught it.  
That will happen against certain teams, but we didn't expect Darko to come out
and make four 18-footers, or five. They played well. We shouldn't say we
played poorly because that takes away from how well they played.  
  
Q. Could you comment, please, on the 2,000th victory for the program?  
COACH SELF: I think the guys, we talked about it. But we have played a very
minimal role in that, obviously. We were joking on the way in. Jim Marchiony
and myself, I think Max Falkenstien has been there for 1700 of them. That's a
joke, but probably not far off.  
But I think it does mean a lot to our fan base and just to certainly be, I
know Carolina has 2,000. I think we've got 2,000 now and Kentucky is 2,015 or
20, whatever it is, to be the only programs in America to reach that
milestone, I think it does speak volumes worth of history and tradition of the
program. We're very proud of it. It hadn't been a big point of emphasis for
this team, but I think the guys respect the past enough to know it's a big
deal.  
  
Q. Why do you think Cole has looked for his shot more, I guess, at least
lately, and how have you addressed it?  
COACH SELF: We've addressed it. And to me -- I could be wrong, which I am
often, but to me he can manufacture points off transition, off board play, off
scoring before he catches. I mean, what I mean by that, they throw it to him,
it's just an easy basket. Teams have done a good job defending him. It's not
all on him. We have to do a better job getting him the ball. No question about
that. I want him to be hungrier to demand it and hungrier in areas where he
doesn't have to bounce it. It's something that most guys go through that's not
being negative. That's a technique thing that he can get better at as we move
forward, hopefully.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

### [John Roberson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20592)

### [Mike Singletary](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19435)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas Tech  82  
Colorado - 67

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined now by the Red Raiders, Coach Pat Knight and his
two student-athletes John Roberson and Mike Singletary. Coach, we'll come to
your student-athletes in just a minute. Right now let's call on you first for
your thoughts on today's victory.  
COACH KNIGHT: Well, it's a game we needed. You know, last year we were playing
for pride, you know, during this time of the year.  
And this year we're playing to get into the NIT. And even though we've had a
rough three weeks, you know, my guys haven't given up. We're still playing for
something.  
And we needed to -- these kids, they haven't given up. A lot of teams, I
think, they go through something like that for three weeks, give up. But I
haven't had a problem with these guys. They've been competitive in practice,
and they just kept on wanting to win one more.  
And I think it showed today, that this was a very good win for us. Because
like I said, we're still playing for something.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for our student-athletes. We'll come back to Coach at
the end.  
  
Q. Pat, can you talk about what you changed match-up wise from Saturday to
today?  
COACH KNIGHT: We didn't really change anything. They just actually followed
the game plan, you know, to be honest. You can ask them. I don't like burying
my guys after losses.  
And so, you know, as a coach you just take the hit, because it's not right
calling out kids. But now that we won, I can call them out.  
You can ask them, we didn't change the game plan at all. We just decided to
follow it. I mean, that's all it was. I mean, it's just a defensive situation.
We win every time we give up 70 or less, and we get beat almost every time we
give up 80 or more. So it's right there for you in writing.  
Honestly, we didn't change anything up.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the starting line?  
COACH KNIGHT: Just from a defensive standpoint, we have to start small anyway,
and we just decided to change that up a little bit. But that wasn't a major
deal. We just wanted to shake the tree a little bit.  
  
Q. For both John and Mike, talk about the difference in this team today and
the team that has played most of the time for the last three weeks.  
JOHN ROBERSON: I think we played together as a team. We were down by 10 early
in the game and it wasn't a sense of panic at all. We were just talking
amongst each other and trying to get things right, instead of, you know,
bickering at each other.  
So I think we played more today more like a family and we just stuck together.  
MIKE SINGLETARY: Yeah, I think we just defense-wise we just buckled down and
we just guarded people, and that's what we had been doing the past three
weeks, and that's why we gave up 101 points to Colorado last time. It was just
all about defense and just all about getting the right thing to do out there
and just locking up.  
  
Q. John and Mike, the fact that you guys have just played them as far as
defensively, did you all know a little bit more what they were doing? It
seemed like a lot of times you guys were jumping passing lanes that sort of
thing.  
JOHN ROBERSON: The first time we played them we kind of got mixed up because
they run so many cuts and all that stuff. They have a pretty hard offense to
guard. But this time around we were locked in defensively. We knew exactly
what they were going to do. Like Coach said, we followed the game plan. And we
just -- a lot of communication was going on on the defensive end.  
MIKE SINGLETARY: We knew whenever they were going to back cut and we knew most
of their sets. So we got -- we had a little bit of time -- a little more time
to go over their sets and kind of figure out what they were going to do on
each play. So I think that really helped us out that time we had to prepare
for them a little bit more.  
So I think that really helped it out with the game today.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the last time you played with this kind of energy.  
JOHN ROBERSON: It's been a long time. I think the last time we actually, you
know, played 100 percent but didn't get it done was I think A&M, and maybe
Texas. We came out with a lot of energy there.  
But, man, everybody was on the same page today, and it was just fun to watch.  
  
Q. Mike, I think last time against KU, I don't think you scored any points,
if I remember right. Is that kind of a match-up you want back again?  
MIKE SINGLETARY: It's always fun to play Kansas. It's always fun to play the
so-called best team in the country. So I'm going to take that as a challenge.
I think we're all just going to take it as a challenge and just go out there
and play with the same energy we played with today, and just, hopefully, you
know, we'll come out with a win.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, for Mike and John, last year you guys -- Baylor was
in the same spot as you guys and knocked off Kansas. Does that give you guys
some hope for this year playing against them.  
JOHN ROBERSON: Yeah, we know anything can happen. When we're playing -- when
we're on our A game we're playing good. We're playing on the offensive end and
the defensive end, I think we can beat anybody in the country. So we're just
going to see what happens, just try to play with the same energy we played
with today.  
MIKE SINGLETARY: Well, I think Kansas is a good team. And it's just a matter
of just going out there and just being in the right spots and listening to the
scouting report that we're going to have today. And it's all about just
containing their guards and trying to limit their big men to offensive
rebounds and stuff like that.  
So it's going to be a big challenge for us, but I think we're ready for it.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thanks, guys. We'll go to questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Pat, they talked about doing the things that you guys had talked about
since the last game. You kind of had to remind them there, though, that first
time out, didn't you?  
COACH KNIGHT: Also the second time out. You know, everyone as a parent knows
what I'm talking about. When you're dealing with 18- to 21-year-olds, you've
got to remind them constantly.  
And defense isn't something that's imbred in kids, everybody wants to be the
offensive guy. It's been a problem for us. All the games we've won, we've held
teams teams pretty much 70 points or below. And all the games we've lost it's
been 80 or more. So we've just been harping and harping on the defensive end.
I think anytime we can hold anybody to 70 or below, we have a chance to win.  
  
Q. How do you feel about your NIT chances now?  
COACH KNIGHT: I think we should be in. You know, we're the only other team
with a winning record. I know it's been a tough three weeks, but we're also in
the best league in the country. Five out of those teams we played were ranked.  
We've played good basketball this year. And, you know, for them to overlook us
and overlook a team in the best conference league would be a shame. But
there's always human error when it's not a computer doing it. So when you've
got a group of guys there deciding people's fate, you just don't know what's
going to happen.  
But I honestly believe that we deserve it.  
  
Q. Pat, just talk about the challenge you've now got in front of you with
the quick turnaround and then facing Kansas.  
COACH KNIGHT: Yeah, it's going to be tough. It's like comparing my win/loss
record to my old man's. It's going to be tough. But you have to look at it as
a situation from a college coach and player. You get a chance to play the No.
1 team in the country, and anything can happen on any given day. We just have
to go out there and play hard and just compete and see what happens. Because a
lot of funny things happen in these conference tournaments.  
You know, we have to be careful. We have to go back to playing in the passing
lanes, getting into the ball, because we had to back off all that because the
Princeton offensive that Colorado runs. So that's really all we can do. Then
we got to talk to them about helping down the post. We've just got to go out
there and play hard. That's all you can ask.  
  
Q. You mentioned those two timeouts you took. Colorado had a break away and
they turned it over. And Mike was really angry at somebody on the floor. Then
you guys, you had to call a back-to-back timeouts because you couldn't get the
ball inbounds. Was that the pointed that you think maybe it finally clicked?  
COACH KNIGHT: Yeah, they finally realized from a defensive standpoint you just
can't have three guys realizing it or four, you've got to have all five. One
guy breaks down and then we're in trouble.  
So I think finally after the second time out, all five guys -- and my guys are
good they make everybody accountable, but you know how losing affects teams.
Bickering and back stabbing starts going on. And we haven't had that from the
standpoint in the locker room or practice situation, but just in tight
situations lately, guys just don't want to take the blame themselves.  
And finally guys have stood up tonight and, really, okay I'm not playing well,
let's get it going. Then I had to be careful, too, I couldn't get too negative
on them even though I wanted to after some of the plays. So I had to watch
myself also just to keep them in a positive mind frame just because of what's
transpired the last three weeks.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just how John played and is this what you want to see
out of him?  
COACH KNIGHT: Yeah, he defended. That's the main thing. It always helps when
your best player defends. And plus he has to be a key defender for us because
he's always on the guy that has the ball, makes the other team go.  
And then, you know, he passed the ball well, hit key shots. But he was talking
again. He's out there trying to calm guys down. He was talking in the timeout.
You know, he's back to being the leader and trying to run this team.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  81  
Oklahoma - 67

  
CHARLIE FISS: Okay. We're ready to begin with the Cowboys of Oklahoma State
with Coach Travis Ford and Obi Muonelo and Keiton Page. We'll call on you
first for your comments.  
COACH FORD: Very proud of our team's effort in the first half. I thought both
ends of the court was terrific. I thought our offense, we were really passing
the ball. Had ten assists at halftime. Obviously Keiton made some great shots
and deep shots. It gives your team great confidence on both ends of the court.
Defensively I thought we were great. We gave up a few 3's in the first half,
and in the second half I thought our team came out a little bit flat, but
you've got to give Oklahoma a lot of credit.  
They had a lot to do with making some deep shots and played well in the second
half. You know, it can be human nature at times to let up a little bit. You
would hope your team wouldn't. Obviously, we didn't play the best second half,
but you learn from it and you move on at this point in time. But I thought for
the most part we did what we needed to do to win and to move on. But the first
half was very, very good for us.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Keiton, could you talk about the zone you seemed to be in. You were
swishing every shot, and then when you missed one, it hit the rim and bounced
up and came in.  
KEITON PAGE: We've been stressing in practice ball reversal, moving without
the ball, and when a play breaks down, making sure we don't stand around that
we keep moving, and that's what we were doing tonight. My teammates were
giving me good open looks, and fortunately they were falling.  
  
Q. Travis, the first ten minutes of the game, is that as good defensively as
you guys maybe in a ten-minute stretch when it was 24-5 at that point?  
COACH FORD: It was very good. I don't know if it was our best. When we shoot
the ball the way we are, it kind of overlooks our defense. We've been a very
good defensive team this year for the most part.  
We take a lot of pride in our defense. We spend more time in practice on
defense. When you make shots like that, it makes everything else look so much
better. But we've had some stretches this year where we've really, really
defended -- Nebraska, last game, we held them to 19 points in the first half.  
We've had our moments defensively, but, yes, it was very, very good, no
question. I thought our guys did a terrific job on scouting report, knowing
what was coming from Oklahoma. Making them -- when they did score, they scored
tough shots.  
We made them earn all the points they got. In the second half I thought they
scored a little bit easier shots. In the first half I was -- again, I was
really pleased with both -- that was a good half for us, no question. One of
the better halves we've played this year.  
  
Q. Obi, when they cut it to ten there in the second half, you had a little
spurt where you took over. There was one where you got the drive and the
3-point play. Were you trying to attack the basket a little bit more in that
situation? Seems like you guys were missing a lot of jump shots up to then.  
OBI MUONELO: Offense was looking really dry at that point. I wanted to get
something going, try to get my team going with a lay-up or maybe a steal or
something, anything we could -- anything I could do to get my team going at
the time, I was trying to do.  
So I was trying to be aggressive to get a drive or find somebody for a shot
and maybe we can get going by that way.  
  
Q. I was actually going to ask you that. So, Keiton, I'll just ask you, one
of the plays that kind of was symbolic of the game was when you stole the ball
from Tommy Mason-Griffin. Had you been playing low and looking for that
opportunity?  
KEITON PAGE: Yeah. Couple possessions before that, I mean, he was kind of
dribbling down the floor looking at coach a couple times and I was thinking
about doing it then I didn't. He started to do it again, and I took a chance
and luckily I got it.  
  
Q. After you got off to the quick start, it seemed like everybody started
having fun. And you were throwing the ball all over the place and dunking and
trying to get all ten plays on ESPN's top ten of the night. Could you talk
about that stretch where everything was going great, and it's almost like --
almost like a street game for a while?  
OBI MUONELO: We were having fun. Coach said at this time of year we've already
worked hard. We've worked on everything we need to work on. At this point now
it's just time to have fun. And we were playing hard. We were playing as hard
as we could out there.  
We were having fun together. I mean, we made a couple of mistakes out of those
plays, but we're just having fun while we were playing. That's all that was.  
  
Q. Keiton Page, unbelievable first half. From a shooter's standpoint you had
your ups and downs this year. Talk about the first half, what it meant
personally for you and for your ball club obviously.  
KEITON PAGE: Felt like I got us off to a good start. We needed to jump on them
early. For the most part it was our defense that was leading. We were getting
in transition. Like I said earlier, we were moving the ball real well, moving
without the ball. Like I said earlier, my teammates were just penetrating,
getting me open looks.  
  
Q. Keiton, you had a good game last year against them in the Big 12
tournament last year. You got a great game in Stillwater, this one. Anything
about playing Oklahoma, did they just kind of forget about you at some point?
How did you get your offense against them?  
KEITON PAGE: I don't know. Like I said earlier, it was my teammates tonight,
James did a good job, Obi did a good job, Nick did a good job. Everybody did a
good job tonight penetrating and finding the open man, and I was just trying
to move without the ball and find the open spots in the zone and even against
the man.  
  
Q. Keiton, in addition to the scoring, you had three assists and four
steals. You even had a blocked shot. Can you tell that the rest of your game
has fallen into line pretty good besides your shooting?  
KEITON PAGE: Yeah. That's something that Coach has been stressing to me the
whole season, is that I don't need to just rely on my shot. I need to try to
get in there and do the other little things. That's what I've been trying to
do, is get in there, get a couple of assists, couple steals. I don't know
about the blocked shot part. But I've been trying to do other things other
than scoring.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Travis, Gulley hit a 3-pointer. You gave it a big fist pump. That was
probably the most demonstrative you were in the game. Just talk a little bit
about that. He almost had another one. Is getting him going offensively, is
that going to help you guys, maybe, in the tournament?  
COACH FORD: I was excited for him for the fact that if you look at his
percentage, not the best 3-point field goal percentage. But I keep telling him
shoot it. Shoot it. If you're open, shoot the basketball. You're not going to
make it unless you shoot it. And he makes them in practice.  
I was excited for him, and I thought it was a big shot. I thought -- actually,
when he made that, I thought that was it.  
I was excited for him because I thought he had been passing up a few. But we
needed him to shoot it. I'm one of these guys, I just always think the next
one's going to go in.  
I was glad that he shot it. I'm glad that it went in and I'm glad it was a big
one. So if that's what I did, I'm sure that's the reason. I don't remember
half the things I do. So if I did, that's why.  
  
Q. I was wondering, you have a game against Kansas State tomorrow, two
pretty good guards when you go up against playing them. Is that where it
starts in preparation, those two guys?  
COACH FORD: Yeah, you hit the nail on the head. Those are two great guards,
two of the best guards in the league. Two guards that can control a game, two
guards that are capable of getting 30 a night. They apply great pressure.  
But they've got a complete team. I've said all along, I said it after we
played them the first time, I said it before we played them the first time
after watching film, they're the type of team that can make it to Final Four.
They've got great high-level athletes. Very well coached. They've got a lot of
good players. But I think you would probably start with those two.  
But then they've got Curtis Kelly who gives you mismatch problems. They're
just a really good basketball team. There's a reason they've been ranked in
the top 10 most of the year. Very good basketball team.  
  
Q. The mantra, of course, win and advance, win and advance, talk about the
significance of this victory moving on to the next round here in the Big 12.  
COACH FORD: It's always important, first game, especially when you've got six
freshmen on your team. And yesterday when we came in, you know, we have a
pretty loose group that likes to have fun. Just a really neat group of guys,
fun to be around.  
We walked in here yesterday for the shoot-around and nobody -- we walked on
the court, nobody said two words for 20 minutes. I'm like, oh, they're scared
to death right now. I mean, it was the quietest we ever had anybody. I didn't
know, ah, either they're focused or they're just in awe, and the experience.  
So first game it's good to get it out of the way. And, you know, when you play
bedlam the first game of the tournament, there's no question you know it's a
big game.  
It adds to being the first game of the tournament. I don't know if it's added
pressure, but there's extra meaning to it, no question. It's a tough first
game to play. Very tough game to play.  
So we're just glad to get it over with. Proud of the effort our guys gave. We
have a lot of respect for OU and Jeff. But, yeah, glad to get it over with,
move on. And I don't want to say the first game's always the toughest because
now we've got Kansas State. That's not the case, but it's good to get the
first one out of the way.  
  
Q. Coach, you might just elaborate on how good it must have made you feel to
start off as well as you did, because you go into a game like that, you're
supposed to win. But at the same time you know that it could be open for
you.  
COACH FORD: As you all know, when you play bedlam you can throw the records
out the door. You don't worry about wins and losses of the other team either
way. But we wanted to get off to a good start. Something we talked about, you
know, try to go with these guys early. Let's try to establish -- we wanted to
get off to a good start defensively. We didn't talk a whole lot about
offensive end. We wanted to break down all their plays and tried to do certain
things to certain guys and try to let our defense get us off to a great start.  
And I think they worked well together. I thought our defense was playing
extremely hard. I thought we were cutting off some of their play. We were a
step ahead of them when they were doing things. All of a sudden we're making
shots on the other end. That just gives you so much confidence and energy to
play defense on the other end.  
But, yeah, it's good to get off to a great start. But, you know, you just hope
you can sustain it. We've all seen many, many times when teams get off to a
great start like that, at some point they deflate. It's usually in the first
half.  
We sustained it in the first half. And kind of, you know, we were a little bit
flat in the second half. But we made enough runs in the second half to close
it out.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  81  
Oklahoma - 67

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're ready to begin with the Sooners of Oklahoma and Coach Jeff
Capel, and his two student-athletes are Tony Crocker and Cade Davis. Coach,
we'll call on you first for your assessment of tonight's game.  
COACH CAPEL: Congrats to Oklahoma State. They were the better team. They got
off to a great start. Shot the heck out of the ball in the first half. Keiton
Page was really, really good.  
And I thought we played better in the second half. Our goal was to gradually
chip away and get back to our game plan defensively. I thought we did that.
Our goal was to have it to 10 by the ten-minute mark. We had it there with
about 12 minutes to go and gave up two 3-point plays in a row. And that kind
of broke our back. When Crock picked up his fourth foul that hurt us. We had
smart match-ups out there. And Oklahoma State took a good job of taking
advantage of that. Congrats to them. They were the better team. And good luck
to them going forward.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Coach Travis talked about the importance from his standpoint of starting
strong defensively against you guys. Did that disrupt you more than anything,
or was it something that you guys didn't get accomplished, offensively. Same
question, the coach was talking about OSU the importance of them playing
defensively strong in the beginning. They had you backing up, was that
something you were doing or --  
CADE DAVIS: We were losing shooters in transition. They were getting shots up
and knocking those down. That dug ourselves a hole right there at the very
beginning. Whatever that did, our defense dropped off. And it was really never
there in the first half. And they just kept making shots and kept digging
ourselves in a bigger hole.  
TONY CROCKER: I think them coming out, making shots like they did, really hurt
us. Their pressure on defense, we practiced that throughout the whole time. It
may have caused a little bit of trouble but not too much because we knew that
was coming. But what hurt us was them getting out to such a big lead so early.  
We fought back and got it to 10, and we just couldn't get it over the hump.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about just how frustrating the season's been with the
injuries and then closing out the way you did?  
CADE DAVIS: Well, certainly not the way we wanted it to turn out. Like you
said, there's some factors we couldn't control with injuries and things like
that.  
But, you know, there's times where we can show effort and things like that.
There's things we could control and try and make a positive note out of
things. But with the ups and downs and with the streaks of losses, it's
difficult to kind of come back from that. But it's never fun having a season
like this.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the season, obviously it's your last one, your last
game. Obviously a disappointing season for you the way it ended for you?  
TONY CROCKER: This season, it was different from our past years. It was sad
that it ended the way it did, but we had fun out there a lot. And we just try
to do the best with what we had. And we just -- we struggled but we had fun
out there. And I'm going to miss those guys?  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, one win away last year from Final Four to this season. Kind of
reflect on that and your thoughts on it?  
COACH CAPEL: It wasn't fun for me. Not one second of it. A very difficult year
from the beginning. It's not just the wins and losses. We had a lot more
losses than wins. Frustrating, difficult from every angle. For me, frustrating
I wasn't able to do a better job for my team. Frustrating I wasn't able to
help them have more success than we did this year. I felt I let them down.
Frustrating year, and this is an opportunity for all of us to learn and get
better. It's going to make me a better coach. I don't think I'm a worse coach
than I was last year. I didn't think I was a better coach at the end of last
year than I was the previous year.  
But this will definitely help me grow as a coach, help me in some decision-
making processes going forward. And I look forward to getting ready for next
year.  
  
Q. James Anderson, 11 points, five turnovers. Mission accomplished? Did you
think that would be enough? What was your plan with him?  
COACH CAPEL: Obviously we knew we had to contain him but we didn't do a good
job on Keiton Page. I think Anderson, being such a great player that he is,
also such a great kid, he didn't force it.  
He didn't come out where: I have to do this. I have to just jack shots up. I
have to get my average. That's what really good players do. They don't play
necessarily to a stat sheet or to points. They just play. And I thought he did
a great job of reading some things and just kind of letting the game come to
him but he also knew that those guys were playing really well in spite of him.  
But also you still see his impact, because those other guys get so many open
shots and so many open opportunities, because you're paying so much attention
to him.  
  
Q. I'm wondering, from your perspective, when you get to this point in the
season, the intensity rises in every game, just how pivotal do you think guard
play is? Does it rise? Is it as meaningful as people make it out to be?  
COACH CAPEL: Yeah, it is. When you have really good guards, mature guards,
because they can control the game on both ends of the floor. They can control
it defensively if they're intelligent and understand how to follow a game
plan. They can control it offensively because everything goes through them.  
And I thought, you know, Keiton Page did a great job of that tonight. Again,
Oklahoma State has some veteran guards. But as you watch this Big 12
tournament and as we get into the NCAA tournament or any of these conference
tournaments, you see the teams that are winning and winning consistently. You
look throughout the year. They have really good guard play.  
  
Q. After the game, you went through the line and shook hands with the
Cowboys. You stopped and chatted with Obi and Anderson. Could you share what
you told those guys?  
COACH CAPEL: I told them good luck. I think those two guys are really good
kids. And I think they embody what's right about college basketball, about
being student-athletes.  
Anderson was not only Player of the Year in our league but he was on the All-
Academic team.  
And Obi continuously has gotten better in his career and just competes, As a
person that loves the game of basketball, I admire good teammates. I admire
guys that play the game the right way. Doesn't mean they do things right all
the time and they don't mess up, but I admire the beauty.  
And it's that and wishing them luck in the tournament, for those two guys,
obviously Obi's last year, and it's probably Anderson's last year. You know, I
want those guys to have success in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, normally you would want a season to continue to go on and on, stay
alive. Is it fair to say that you're relieved, happy that this one is over,
and also what did you tell your club after the game?  
COACH CAPEL: No, I'm not. And if I ever get to that point, Joe or whoever is
my AD, should fire me, if I ever get to the point where I'm relieved that it's
over. Or I will just walk away, because I shouldn't be doing what I'm doing.
So, no, it wasn't. I was maybe crazy enough to believe that we could come here
and win the Big 12 tournament.  
So, no. And what I told our team, I thanked our seniors. I told those guys
they're winners, in spite of how this season turned out. All three of those
kids will graduate. Ryan's already graduated. Tony and Bo will graduate in May
and they have a lot of experiences that will help prepare them, that hopefully
have helped prepare them for the real world and wherever life takes them as
they move forward. I thanked those guys, really. It was pretty short.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you, that first half, when Oklahoma State got on that
roll, seemed they couldn't miss. They seemed to be having a lot of fun. How do
you try to stem that kind of tide? You guys in the second half came out and
made a game out of it. How did you stop such an after language when it's
obvious that they're in some kind of zone?  
COACH CAPEL: Look, they have good players. They run good stuff. They do a good
job. But I didn't think we did a good job with our game plan in the first
half.  
I thought in the second half, you know when they called a timeout, that's when
I told our guys, all we're doing is executing our game plan, what we worked
on, it's taken us 20 minutes to do it, but we're finally doing that. We're
finally playing ball screens the right way. We're finally closing out to guys
in the right way and getting to shooters. And when you shoot the ball as well
as they do and then you give them open looks like we did in the first half, I
could see why they were having a lot of fun out there.  
But, again, I thought we did some better things in the second half. And our
goal was to get it to 10 by the 10-minute mark.  
We talked about it at halftime. We're going to slowly walk it back, defend and
rebound, first two things, and execute. And we'll slowly get it back to 10. We
had it about the 10-minute mark, gave up two 3-point plays. Crocker picking up
his fourth foul was huge. We don't have that much depth as it is. It's
difficult to match up playing two bigger guys, because one of those guys have
to guard Obi.  
When Crocker picked up his fourth foul we went with a bigger guy, and they
took advantage of it. He got a 3-point play, and then Keiton Page just took
the ball from Tommy and went down and got a 3-point play. And all of a sudden,
after all that momentum we had, just like that it's back to 16 and they have
the momentum again.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2010

  

### [Alec Burks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20591)

### [Jeff Bzdelik](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13815)

### [Dwight Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19422)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
Texas Tech - 82  
Colorado - 67  
  
CHARLIE FISS: We'll start with Colorado: Coach, an opening statement.  
COACH BZDELIK: First of all, congratulations to Texas Tech. We jumped on them
early, 18-8. They came storming back, and we never recovered from their run. I
told our players after the game that successful people only momentarily get
discouraged.  
We accomplished a lot this year as a young basketball team. We need to, when
we reflect back on the year that -- the way we finished the year and the
things we accomplished both on and off the court, we're building this program
the right way, in a very competitive way. And we need to understand that.  
It's hard right now. But we need to keep things in perspective.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach. Questions for our two student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alec, after you guys got off to such a good start, what do you think
happened that changed the game?  
ALEC BURKS: I think everybody started staying in place and the ball started
sticking. We weren't passing, giving our teammates better looks. We were
trying to do it ourselves and be the hero. I feel like that was our downfall.  
  
Q. Did they do anything different from the last game, or did they just do
what they do better --  
ALEC BURKS: They just made shots. They scored more. That was the name of the
game. They did it better.  
  
Q. You guys have been good at taking care of the ball all year. What
happened the second half of that first half where you guys had quite a few
turnovers in a row?  
DWIGHT THORNE II: We just got complacent, as Alec said. We weren't making the
right passes and weren't being sure in our passes. But we can always --
turnovers we can always control usually if we play defense and get back and
play hard. We didn't do that.  
  
Q. Dwight, it's a tough way to end your career, but can you assess your
career? And I know you're disappointed that you didn't get to post-season
play, but how do you see this team next year moving forward?  
DWIGHT THORNE II: This team is going to be a good team next year. I'm the only
guy leaving, to have everything pretty much coming back. So I'll be excited to
see where they're headed and with the administration and with the support from
the community and see the direction they're going. And it's going to be up.  
  
Q. Alec, you started a little slow and then you really got in the flow. Did
it just take a while to get into the rhythm of the game?  
ALEC BURKS: No. Other teammates was just making shots, so I didn't feel like I
had to do anything right away because we were scoring. But then I saw people
wasn't making shots, so I was trying to help my teammates to get a win.  
  
Q. I want to ask about wrapping up your freshman year, and, obviously,
you're disappointed today. But overall, how would you assess your season?  
ALEC BURKS: I think I had a good one. I had a lot of ups and downs. I feel
like I learned from my mistakes from the start of the year to the end of the
year. I feel like I played better. It was a great freshman season for me.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Jeff, did Texas Tech do anything different or did they just play well?  
COACH BZDELIK: They seemed to have -- they were a step quicker than us today.
They stayed in the possessions longer in a more disciplined way than we did.
They seemed to come up with more loose balls than we did.  
It just seemed like they were just -- they had an edge to their game that we
lost after we started off in such a good way. And give them credit for what
they did well, and we'll leave it at that.  
  
Q. Do you think despite today's loss the way you guys finished the season
will carry over into next season, which you guys project as the year you'd
really take a step forward?  
COACH BZDELIK: We've taken a step forward this year. And we need to just keep
taking steps forward. We've won three out of -- we finished our season winning
three out of our last four. We're knocking on the door. We just need to bust
it down and bust through it.  
I told our players that -- they all feel awful. I do, too, with the way we
finished it. But at the same time, as I said in my opening statement, we need
to keep things in perspective and reflect back on the things that we were able
to accomplish and move forward.  
If you look back, all you do is get a stiff neck. And we just need to keep
moving forward. We need to get stronger. And we need to learn from this. We
need to defend better. We need to rebound better. We need to go out and
recruit and continue to strengthen this basketball team.  
  
Q. Jeff, when a team gets an 18-day lead and remembers what happened four
days earlier, there's that human nature that they let up a little bit or was
it mostly Tech turning up the next gear?  
COACH BZDELIK: Well, I think it's a combination of both. I think, again, you
have to give Texas Tech credit. They responded. They hit us back and we didn't
respond very well.  
Yes, I guess you can refer back to the human condition of the situation. But
at the same time that would be an excuse. And mentally tough teams, physically
tough teams, that's where toughness -- that's one of the definitions of
toughness, is to play as well as you can controlling what you can control,
with turnovers and effort, defense, staying in your stance longer, cutting
hard offensively, sharing the ball. That's the discipline of all of that needs
to improve. And that's my job, is to get them to understand how important
playing through each and every possession, how important that is.  
And Texas Tech did a better job of that tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of coaches have said that players make their biggest
improvement from their freshman to sophomore years. With that in mind, what do
you think Alec is capable of over the next off-season going into his sophomore
year?  
COACH BZDELIK: It's interesting. A couple of days ago he got on the scale and
said, hey, I gained two pounds, Coach. And he'll continue to get stronger,
which is very important to be able to defensively -- he moves his feet well.
We have to improve his defense, his positioning. We're working on that. It's
getting better. But ten extra pounds of added strength will allow him to slide
and chest and keep people in front of him. It will enable him to defensively
hold his position better.  
Offensively, I mean, he does a great job of driving it to the basket and
avoiding charges and making good decisions. Now he'll be able to finish a
little bit better with that added strength. When he takes a hit he'll be able
to control his body a little bit more, which he does a great job of anyway.  
You know, shooting the 3, for example, he improved that drastically from the
start of the year to now. You saw tonight he just rose up and shot it, whereas
in high school he never shot from that kind of distance. So his strength from
his fingertips to his elbow wasn't quite there like it should be.  
And through the course of repetition, repetition, repetition of shooting long
shots like that, he developed that strength, kept his form, and he shot the 3
better.  
His head and heart are in the right place. He's a wonderful young man. And
he's a very special player right now and he's going to continue to grow and
he's going to be one of the very special players in this nation. Not just this
conference, but in this nation next year.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2010

  

### [Craig Brackins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18160)

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  82  
Iowa State - 75

  
CHARLIE FISS: Let's introduce the Cyclones from Iowa State. Coach Greg
McDermott and his student-athletes, Diante Garrett and Craig Brackins. Coach,
we'll call on you first for your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH MCDERMOTT: I think one of the key things that happened in the game that
was really a detriment to us was Justin Hamilton's foul trouble. You know,
there are some front lines across the Big 12 that maybe you can afford to have
a guy in foul trouble. We only have three front line players available.  
Texas's front line is not one of those. You know, with Johnson and James and
Pittman -- and Coach used Matt Hill a little tonight to run fresh bodies at
us.  
I think in the end we really wore Craig Brackins and LaRon Dendy out. Marquis
Gilstrap, we couldn't get him off the floor with foul trouble. That ended up
being a big factor in the game, because Justin was a guy that was playing
almost 30 minutes a game for us down the stretch here, and we only had him out
there 11.  
Our guys didn't quit. They continued to compete, but Texas, and in particular
their front line, was just too much for us tonight.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach. Questions for our two student-athletes.  
  
Q. Craig, in particular, what Coach said, was that really kind of difficult
when Justin went out with the foul trouble and they just kind of kept coming
at you in waves, was that kind of difficult as far as handling the boards
against Texas?  
CRAIG BRACKINS: Texas's front line, they have multiple players that can come
in, give them a quick lift. Justin, he leads our team in offensive rebounds.
He's a big guy. Dexter Pittman is a real strong guy. And Justin would have
helped out with that with bodying against him.  
So with him getting into foul trouble, and then when he comes back into the
game, he has to play conservative and not get another foul. So I think it wore
a couple of us out. But I think it just hit Justin where he couldn't come in
and get his rhythm and help out like he really wanted to.  
  
Q. Craig, you guys doubled Johnson a lot, and he passed out of that and got
some baskets and kind of left Pittman open. They said that was a little
different than what they usually do. How did you guys handle that? Was that
something that surprised you or was it different than when you played them the
first time?  
CRAIG BRACKINS: I don't really remember the first time what we really did. I
think we doubled a little bit, too. But it was difficult having them pass it
out then them passing it in leaving the guards stranded with Dexter. We did
our best to rotate and get out of that. But we were doubling the posts, and it
worked out couple times. I think a couple times some of us front line players
was a little late.  
But the game plan was there. And sometimes we didn't execute it, and I think
we paid for it.  
CHARLIE FISS: All right. Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. With them using the bigger lineup, and obviously you said you had foul
troubles also, but the bigger lineup they played, how much trouble did that
just, with them starting that kind of lineup, what kind of challenges did that
present?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: When we got in foul trouble, it presented huge challenges.
Because we had nowhere to turn. And when Justin got his third, we were really
forced to leave him on the bench the rest of the first half and not start him
the second half as a result of that.  
But we were, as Craig alluded to, we were late on the double teams a few
times. There were several times we got a hand on it, and deflected it and just
didn't come up with it. But they did a good job of burying Pittman under the
basket. Our guards were a little late getting there at times. And that becomes
a tough match-up. And to their credit, you know, I think it was 60-59 and we
had a good, solid double team and Damion James hit a 3 from the top as we
rotated out of it.  
And that's what great players are supposed to do. He misses that and we come
down and score and we get the lead and we get the momentum. Maybe it's a
different story.  
  
Q. You mentioned James, 28 and 16. Rick said he was pretty much a man on the
boards. Was that with everything and the foul trouble, was that hard to just
keep hill under control?  
COACH MCDERMOTT: I think some of it he outworked us. And there were other
times we were right there and he just went over the top of us. He played
tonight like a man on a mission. I thought his aggressiveness tonight compared
to what I've seen on tape recently was at a different level.  
When you have seniors, you know like James and Pittman that have been in the
program, they don't want it to end. And they played like it tonight.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas  82  
Iowa State - 75

  
CHARLIE FISS: Let's go to questions first for Coach, then we'll have the
student-athletes here in just a second.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the contribution you got from Damion and Dexter
tonight? Seems like this is the time of year you would want to see your
seniors start to step up?  
COACH BARNES: I thought both guys were good. But I thought our interior guys,
Matt Hill's minutes were huge. He did some really good things. I thought Jai
Lucas played maybe as good a game as he's played out there tonight. But Dexter
and Damion again, you look at what he did. 16 rebounds, he just became a man
on the boards. He just went and got everything.  
But we got great play from our interior. I thought our guards, for the most
part, took pretty good care of the ball.  
  
Q. You started Gary tonight. He had a pretty big game for you, played a lot
of minutes in the last few games. Could you talk about what's he's been doing
lately, and, in particular, what he did tonight?  
COACH BARNES: Again, he's done a good job. We knew they were going to come out
and double early. We thought we were ready for that.  
And again, we were, really, for the first time we were posting him on the
first side more so than we were Dexter tonight and letting him handle the ball
and looking to pass out of it. We knew they would double. He's done a really
good job defensively. And, again, you look at him on the boards, again ten
rebounds. And it's hard when you -- Damion was just a man out there on the
boards tonight.  
But Gary's been good. He's been good for a long time. Like you said, Dexter
did some good things. But overall I thought Matt Hill's minutes were really
big, too. I really do.  
CHARLIE FISS: Let's move to our student-athletes. Gary Johnson and Damion
James and Dexter Pittman. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Damion, you seemed to have a look on you tonight that you were going to
win the game tonight no matter what anybody else did. Where did that
determination come from?  
DAMION JAMES: To be honest, before the game, we were getting ready to run out,
I told my teammates, I'm like, me and Dex and Mas are only promised two more
games. And I was like I'm not ready to go home. So we gotta do whatever it
takes to win the game.  
And I really focused on my defense, because I have let my team down on
defense, I was just focusing on that and I was going to let everything else
come to me.  
  
Q. Damion, looked like you were having more fun out there than we've seen
from a couple of months from you. Was it fun tonight?  
DAMION JAMES: It's not fun when you're losing, man. And I just felt like we
got right back where we need to be, like we were at the beginning of the year,
attacking on offense and defense. When you're doing that you're having fun.  
And we came out. We executed our game plan early, getting rid of the ball and
making a lot of plays out of the post. We couldn't let this game go.  
  
Q. Gary, you started for the second time tonight. Did that change your
thinking at all, and what's happened to your offense that's come on so much
lately?  
GARY JOHNSON: I had four assists tonight. I think that's big, because I don't
usually pass the ball.  
COACH BARNES: It's kind of unusual.  
[Laughter]  
GARY JOHNSON: I think that opened up other opportunities for me to score, just
trying to get everybody else involved.  
  
Q. Dexter, seems like with the three of you in there together, you somehow
get -- even though it's three big guys taking up space, you get more
opportunities. How does that come about?  
DEXTER PITTMAN: Because it's hard for a team to double both of us. So I mean,
like Coach said, we were running 45 for Gary. Whenever he would come across,
they'd double Gary and I'd look for the short corner and not be wide open,
because my man would leave me and go over there and Gary passed the ball to
me. It's kind of like a high-low set.  
  
Q. Dexter, this is a spot where your game kind of came together last year in
the Big 12 tournament. Did you think about that the last few days, and did you
do anything similar as last year?  
DEXTER PITTMAN: Yes. It's another season. Everybody is 0-0 right now. It's
post-season. Like Damion said, we have to come out and play it like it's our
last game because we were only promised two games. But we live to fight for
another game and that's tomorrow against Baylor.  
  
Q. Speaking of Baylor, if you guys could just talk about that, that last
game, what kind of taste it left in your mouth and what you're looking forward
to tomorrow?  
DAMION JAMES: To be honest, we just come out and play our game. Coach said
they had 15 dunks. That's never happened. So we gotta take it personal.  
And that's all we're going to say about that situation. We're going to take it
personal and see how it goes tomorrow.  
  
Q. Damion, can you talk about Gary's game a little bit. Have you seen kind
of a light switch go on in his game?  
DAMION JAMES: Man, if Gary and Dexter are playing like that, our two guys
inside that really dominate, because both of them can dominate the ball game
inside. So we've just got to keep them guys going. And he was unbelievable, a
double-double tonight, and Matt Hill played a great game for us coming off the
bench, him and Jai. We have to keep those guys going. We have to run through
those guys and just continue to play hard.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, guys. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What do you like about this, the three big-guy power game you're using in
there?  
COACH BARNES: Well, again, I think you look at it like tonight, we had Dexter
on the backside. What happens is it really gives him a chance to -- I mean,
you look at him tonight. Dexter had four offensive rebounds on the backside.  
So when he rebounds, it's very, very difficult for guys to get to him when
they do double him, and Gary does a good job. Dexter does a good job passing
out of it.  
But we were really trying to get the ball moved from side to side. And, you
know, Damion, I thought, did a good job. He's big enough to pass over the top
of it. We put the ball inside, and, again, we knew they would double us.  
But, again, I just like, one, defensively we've done a pretty good job with
that lineup, too. And again they're a very hard team to guard. You go back and
look, and I've said coming in, coming down the stretch, they've been very,
very close in a lot of games and they've had a lot of tough luck.  
Offensively they just execute so well, and tonight at the end they started
bombing the 3s, and again, I like the lineup. I do. And it all depends on,
sometimes, match-ups.  
But from game to game, that's what it will be based on. From here on out you
have to look at match-ups where you can get guys on the floor. Tonight was a
night we thought Jai could have a pretty good match up on the end, and
offensively I thought he did a good job with the ball. There were a lot of
things that happened tonight. It wasn't just those guys. But this time of year
you need to do what you've got to do, and that's kind of where we are right
now.  
  
Q. You mentioned match-ups. Is part of the reason for that lineup because
Gilstrap is a pretty good size?  
COACH BARNES: Again, they're pretty good. But again, Matt Hill does several
things. One, as you watch tape, Brackins, those are tough guys. You put some
length on them at times where you try to get them to shoot over a taller guy.
But Matt did a really nice job of screening, popping, keeping the ball moving.
That's where -- he does subtle things. And he did a really good job. I thought
Jai did a good job of that for that, for the most part, getting the ball
moving. When we bog down, we don't visualize and see what we need to see. But
again, it was a good team win.  
  
Q. Rick, Gary Johnson's game, he's got the mid-grade jumper going, does it
look like he's looking to score more than he ever did in his career?  
COACH BARNES: You go back to the beginning of the year when we started, I said
no one on our team, I think, had improved more than Gary. He spent a lot of
time with his jump-start. He feels comfortable with 15 feet. We feel
comfortable with him at 15 feet.  
But tonight a couple of times we told him we wanted him to drive it, which he
did. When he got himself in trouble early, he was coming around. He was
getting below the block, and he had nowhere to go.  
And I just told him to space up, space out. And he did. And we cleared out for
him, let him go. But, again, defensively he's played on both ends. I think
he's really worked. He's played enough minutes now that what he does tonight,
we expect it from him.  
  
Q. Was it just match-ups or is Jai ahead of J'Covan now?  
COACH BARNES: Well, I don't know. It depends -- again, I was happy with Jai.
We came back after the Baylor game. Sunday went in, had a real hard practice.
I was impressed with the way he responded, impressed with the way Matt
responded. And so, again, we felt tonight that there was a match-up here he
could handle. He played very well at Iowa State when we looked back at the
tape. And Jai does a lot of subtle things for you. And so we put him out. I
thought he was ready, and he handled it very, very well.  
  
Q. You said a lot of good things happened tonight. Can you remember the last
time you were able to say that?  
COACH BARNES: You know, I don't know what day of the week it is right now. I
don't know if my memory can bring it back that far. But we did some good
things -- I think our next-to-last game was Oklahoma, right? We did a lot of
good things in that game. We've done that. But I thought tonight our mindset
was good. I thought Damion James, again, he was terrific.  
I mean, what he did, couple times I got on him for a couple of shots he took
because I thought he should have kicked it. But yet what he did on the boards
-- I mean, he came over and said I'm getting them all. I don't think he liked
the fact -- I mean for two days I just kept talking about Marquis Gilstrap led
the Big 12 in rebounding in conference play. Every time I said it, I'd look at
him. I could tell he kind of took it personal. I kept saying to him, now you
understand he's been the leading rebounder in the Big 12 in conference play.
And he corrected me one time in terms of overall games. I said no, I'm talking
conference. And tonight he came out and did what he's known for.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2010

  

### [Mike Anderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15828)

### [Laurence Bowers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20597)

### [J.T. Tiller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19476)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Nebraska  75  
Missouri - 60

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined by Coach Mike Anderson and the student-athletes,
Laurence Bowers and J.T. Tiller. Thoughts on today's game.  
COACH ANDERSON: First, I want to put a blame on myself on this one here. I
didn't have our guys prepared. Always think the first game in your tournament
is the most important. You never know how your guys are going to come out, the
psyche. So we talked about that, and we thought we had them prepared coming
out.  
But I thought Nebraska was much hungrier than our basketball team. They played
hard. They got every loose ball. I thought they played looser. I thought they
played with nothing to lose and everything to gain.  
And I just didn't think we had the energy that you gotta have, especially in
this setting, in a tournament setting, where it's one game and you're done. So
that goes in terms of defending the championship, we won't be able to do that.
But Nebraska, I thought they played better than we did. They outplayed us
tonight.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions now for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. J.T., Laurence, just talk about what's going through your head there when
it seems like every 3 they're throwing up there, especially when they needed
it, you guys start digging into leads, down to 10 or 9. They get that 4-point
play. Brandon Richardson. Seemed like a lot of their 3s were falling tonight.
Talk about what is going through your head when you see that happen?  
J.T. TILLER: Today seemed like it was Murphy's law, what could go wrong would
go wrong; and everything they were putting up there, I see it as it was their
day and they really wanted this game and it really showed in the results.  
  
Q. J.T. and Laurence, you have a little time until NCAA bid day. What's job
number one as far as is it getting the shooting turned around or something
else?  
LAURENCE BOWERS: I wouldn't say it was just getting shooting. I think it's
just getting -- becoming a better basketball team.  
I think we're a lot better than what we showed today. And like Coach said, we
just gotta get back in the lab and hope we have another season, which is the
NCAA tournament. If they do decide to let us in, we have to give it our all,
because it's survival or go home.  
  
Q. You talked about defensively, it seemed like it was a little bit of
Murphy's law. How about offensively? Seemed like guys were trying to be the
guy that could help break through, but nobody's shots were falling. Seemed
like everyone was struggling with their offensive game a little.  
LAURENCE BOWERS: Well, like you said, it seemed like we were trying to go get
the game. One person was trying to do it because there wasn't nobody else on
the team scoring anything.  
And, I mean, here lately we just haven't been shooting the ball well. I don't
want to blame the game on that. But it's hard to beat a team if you're
shooting 35 percent. And, I mean, the games where we haven't shot the ball
well, our defense can only hold us in the game for so long. You gotta put up
points. Since we haven't been able to do it, we've been suffering for it.  
But I think if we get another chance, I think we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Laurence, could you describe how your wrist is and elaborate on how you
aggravated it? And, J.T., looks like you're limping a little bit. Anything in
particular going on there?  
LAURENCE BOWERS: Well, it was just a bad sprain, and it just got reaggravated
in practice. And I just gotta deal with it.  
I can't afford to go down. We already had a player out in Justin Safford,
which is the key part to our basketball team. And I think my team needs me.  
So I just gotta battle through it and just learn how to play with the splint
that I'm playing with on.  
J.T. TILLER: I'm fine. Just the wear and tear on the legs. I caught like a
knee. That was it. Nothing serious.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about maybe just kind of where you feel like
your NCAA tournament chances are at this point now?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think if you look at what has taken place, I always say, you
know, you win games and I think all those things will take care of itself.  
And I thought in the number one RPI conference, we finished fifth, one game
outside of finishing second. I think we'll be fine. I think we'll be fine.
Obviously it's disappointing in this particular game.  
I think we're a much better basketball team than we displayed today. But at
the same time I think we've done -- these guys have done a tremendous job.
They've overachieved. When people counted them out, they were picked seventh
in the league and they finished fifth, again one game out of second place.  
So with that being said, I think we've done what we are supposed to do.
Obviously the winner of this tournament is the one that gets the automatic
bid. And we were fortunate last year to do that.  
  
Q. The players had talked yesterday about how much this tournament meant to
them to defend their title, yet when they came out they seemed a little bit
flat. And they were disappointed in that. As a coach watching them all year
long, can you kind of explain why something that meant so much to them they
came out with so little energy at first?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think, again, it goes back to me. I guess I'll take the
blame for that. I thought we were prepared. I really did. Obviously we were
playing a team that we played early in the year. We shot the ball well at
their place.  
But I think if you look at this team, a lot of things have taken place with
this team. Justin Safford went down and now we've got to make adjustments. And
Laurence got banged up a little bit. And so with a team like ours, things have
to go right. And obviously we didn't shoot the ball well.  
But, again, coming out the way we came out tonight, I thought we would come
with more energy. We are an energy team. We're an attacking team. I thought we
settled for more jump shots than we did in terms of attacking, getting to the
basket in terms of the free throw line. If you told me, hey, Coach, you're
going to have four turnovers and we get beat by 15, I'll be scratching my
head, wondering whoa.  
But you have to put the ball in the hole. And guys -- I can echo it, too. What
could go wrong did go wrong. We had them with the shot clock running down and
they just throw it up and it goes in. It was a day for Nebraska.  
  
Q. You were talking about preparing the team to play. Looking to the big
tournaments, do you go ahead and continue practicing at this point, assuming
that you're going to play in the NIT or the big dance, or do you wait and see
how everything shakes out and then go accordingly?  
COACH ANDERSON: We'll get back. We'll get back in the gym and do some things.
And get prepared for what's going to take place. I'm confident that good
things are in store for this team.  
  
Q. How fixable do you think some of the offensive problems are now?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think it's fixable. We've just got to continue to trust one
another. We are getting some good looks. Tonight we just -- I didn't think we
attacked the basket. We're an attacking team.  
Our defense has been the strength of our basketball team, so I think it
creates some easy opportunities for us. But, as I say, as you keep having to
adjust, you know, with this basketball team, I think it's very apparent now
that we miss a guy like Justin Safford. No question about it.  
Because your rotation -- now your rotation is kind of changed a little bit.
But Zaire Taylor, Kim English, we counted on those guys to knock down shots
for us. Marcus Denmon. And for some reason they hadn't. Hopefully with a
little time, maybe a little rest, those guys can find their rhythm and find
their groove. I think it's -- shooting is rhythm. I know we're a much better
basketball shooting team than we've been showing here lately. I really do.  
So it's something I think confidence has a lot to do with it when you put the
ball in the hole. It's about confidence.  
  
Q. Dixon was having a pretty good game providing a pretty good spark off the
bench. Then he picked up three fouls in 48 seconds. How much did it hurt to
lose him?  
COACH ANDERSON: I think he was one of those guys -- as a coach you try to find
someone that can spark you. And he was that spark that we needed. And before
we could even -- he got those fouls and then before we can get him out he got
the fifth one.  
I thought that hurt us, because one thing about our team, it's kind of like a
chain reaction; you get somebody going, then it can trigger somebody else.
Shooting is kind of contagious. And I guess missing, too, is kind of
contagious, too.  
But I know in my heart we're much better. We shoot the ball a whole lot
better, I know, in practice. And we've shot it well in games.  
  
Q. What changes did you see in this Nebraska team than the previous three
times you all played them?  
COACH ANDERSON: I thought they were much more hungry. They've had tough ball
games where they've been in it. It's one of those games where everything went
right for them.  
They were making shots beyond even the 4-point shot, the shot clock running
down. Seemed like every loose ball they got. And we made a run at them and,
boy, for some reason it just didn't take place for us. They beat us on the
boards.  
We beat them both times, I think, at their place and our place on the boards.
They were more aggressive. When you put the ball in the hole like they were
tonight, then it makes you a little bit more aggressive.  
Again, I thought they came out and they were a little bit more relaxed. They
just played loose and had fun, I guess.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Nebraska  75  
Missouri - 60

  
CHARLIE FISS: We're joined by Coach Sadler of the University of Nebraska and
his two student-athletes, Ryan Anderson and Brandon Richardson.
Congratulations on the victory. Your thoughts.  
COACH SADLER: You know, it's obviously for the people that follow us know our
season. It's been a tough season. But as I've said, from the toughest losses
to the few wins that we've had, that this basketball team has continued to
compete and show great character.  
And I think for you all that's the first time that you've seen us play this
year. We haven't won many games. But I don't think any of you that have
watched us have left the game thinking that this team didn't at least play as
hard as they could play.  
Today we just made some plays and we shot the basketball well. We went into
the ball game wanting to handle their press and not give enough second-shot
opportunities. And then understanding, I think, that when we get the
opportunity to get something against them, we either have to shoot a lay-up or
we have to shoot a stand-still, three-point shot, and nothing in between.  
And the last couple of days we've talked heavily about offensive execution,
and I thought today, you know, it looks a lot better when you shoot the ball.
But I thought for about 32 minutes it's about as good as we could execute
offensively.  
The last eight minutes, I think all of us, including myself, probably didn't
do as good a job of coaching or executing in the last eight minutes, but we
continued to play on the defensive end. So besides the two 3-pointers they hit
on us on the defensive zone, I don't think we could have played much better on
defense.  
CHARLIE FISS: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Ryan, it seemed like when you guys are in the half court, you were kind
of using their pressure against them. They got kind of scrambled. You guys got
some nice backdoors and maybe got some open 3s. Was that part of it, knowing
that they were going to try to even pressure you guys in the half court?  
RYAN ANDERSON: Yeah, it goes along with what Coach said, executing offensively
using our press releases on offense, people pressure us in certain positions,
there's counters to pressure. And like you said, the backdoors, for example,
is one of the counters to a lot of pressure they try to put on.  
And pressure release. They pressured us and we executed offensively and got
some layups.  
  
Q. What did you guys take from your two previous games against Missouri, how
did you adjust to them?  
BRANDON RICHARDSON: The first two games we played against them we just didn't
run offense. We watched film over and over. We had a low percentage of how
many times we ran offense.  
And in this game we really executed, really slowed the game down. And we made
them play our game. And the outcome was good for us because we ran offense.  
RYAN ANDERSON: Like he said, again, Missouri wants to play a fast-paced style,
and one of the problems we had last game was we made shots early. Coach kept
telling us you're making the shots but with the style they play, it kind of
sucks you in and makes you think it's going to happen like that. You keep
shooting those shots, they're not going in. They're going against your favor.
So try to execute and take the shots the whole game this time. And, hopefully,
tomorrow we can do it for 40 minutes not 32, 38.  
  
Q. Brandon, can you think back to the Texas A &M game, I know it was a ways
back. What do you remember about that game? And talk about getting the chance
to play them again.   
BRANDON RICHARDSON: Well, I remember, like, throughout the game we had, I
don't know if it was winning or a close game, but like towards the end of the
game we kind of got on our own pages. And we got away from the team concept,
slowing the game down, and trying to throw the ball into the low post, because
when the game is played inside/out, it's a very high percentage of you scoring
the basketball.  
So that's what we have to do tomorrow, and, hopefully, we can execute.  
  
Q. Brandon, you talked about that three-point shot where you're fouled
seemed to be one of the pivotal plays, kind of set the game apart. Did you
feel that way? Kind of take us through that shot.  
BRANDON RICHARDSON: Well, the credit goes to Brian Diaz. They committed two
guys to him. And I was able -- he kicked it out, and I was able to make a
shot. So like I said, it's no credit to me. If it wasn't for Jorge who was
doubled, I wouldn't have been able to get that shot. So the credit goes to
him?  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Talk about the rebounding advantage. You were plus 16. Talk about being
able to go against the Missouri team minus Justin Safford, one of their bigger
guys.  
COACH SADLER: They asked me that question yesterday. And I think all of us, to
some point, aren't full strength, and obviously Justin adds a lot to their
basketball team, and him not playing, I'm sure it's affected them.  
But the rebounding situation is, I think, our perimeter defense was pretty
good, and, therefore, they missed, you know, some shots and we were able to
somewhat hold them down on offensive rebounds. And so that's probably where
the disparity comes on the glass, because if you look at the offensive
rebounds, they actually out re-bounded us 9 to 8. And that's probably because,
you know, they missed more shots than we did.  
So that's where the rebounding difference is probably at.  
  
Q. If you would, could you talk about balance in your scoring offensively in
general? You had four guys in double figures and four guys with at least three
assists.  
COACH SADLER: Again, I think a lot of it goes back to our players executing.
And Nebraska, you know, we know a lot about offensive efficiency because of
football. And I think our offensive efficiency was pretty good. And we're not
going to make every shot. But we've got better shots, I think, and we stayed
with our offense a little bit more than you normally do.  
So that's probably why we shot the percentage that we shot. There's been some
games that we probably had a lot better looks than we had today that we just
didn't shoot it good. So maybe it's just the day and hopefully the day
continues.  
  
Q. It seemed like -- can you comment on the number of, like, 50/50 balls.
Seemed like you got 90 percent of them.  
COACH SADLER: Missouri's going to continue to play. You know, we gotta win. I
mean, that's the only chance we got. And so if we're not going to get the
50/50 balls today, then we've got some serious issues. And not that I'm not
saying that Missouri was looking forward or anything else, because I thought
they played extremely hard.  
But our guys, I think, understand that, you know, there's not much room
between their back and that wall. And we've got to come out and give
everything we've got and see what happens.  
  
Q. Talk about Brandon's 4-point play there, considering when it came it was
pretty significant.  
COACH SADLER: I think it came in a stretch that we were struggling
offensively. You know, with over eight minutes to go, you know, I used two
time outs to tell our guys to continue to be aggressive, but we were being
aggressive from the free throw line to the mid court instead of from the free
throw to the basket.  
And then we were getting ourselves into situations where he was either going
to make or miss the shot. We missed a couple of opportunities on some
backdoors that could have really helped us. But at that particular moment,
obviously, I think they may have had cut it to 10, hadn't they, and when he
hit the 4-point play? So I'm not very smart, but it's probably a pretty big
play, yeah.  
CHARLIE FISS: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2010

  

### [Greg Monroe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19371)

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

### [Chris Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19364)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

West Virginia -60  
Georgetown - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. John, what did you expect them to run on that last play as opposed to
what you got?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: We expected them to put the ball into Butler's hands
and let him make a play.  
  
Q. What makes West Virginia so tough to box out especially on the offensive
glass?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: They're just persistent. They have guys that go after
it.  
  
Q. I think you were 4 of 16 from three tonight. Do you think some of that
might have been four games in four nights?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: No, I don't. I think if anything, you have to give
credit to them and their ability to contest shots. We got some looks we
normally make that didn't go in, long guys running at you.  
But I don't think it was a question of fatigue.  
  
Q. I have a question for Chris: Chris, why did you foul with 27 seconds to
go in a tie game?  
CHRIS WRIGHT: I made a mistake.  
  
Q. Coach, you came into the tournament on a little bit of a downer. But it
seems like everything flipped around for you in this tournament. How do you
look at the way you're coming into the NCAAs?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: It's hard to analyze that right now just because I'm
extremely disappointed. We got three guys up here with me that are extremely
disappointed. We have a locker room back down the hall with a bunch of other
guys that are disappointed.  
You know, that being said, I don't think -- you said we came into this
tournament on downer. I don't think this group has ever lost confidence in
what we're doing, lost confidence in each other. And that's still true right
now. You know, I said this prior to tonight's game, I said this after last
night's game, we're playing well. I like where we are going into the NCAA
Tournament, and I probably can still say that. We did some things tonight we
have to do better, obviously.  
But I like the way this group -- I like where this group is right now heading
into the tournament.  
  
Q. Can you just elaborate a bit on what you like them to do better going
forward?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Not right now. I'm not sure.  
  
Q. Coach, do the four days like this have any lingering effects for next
Thursday or Friday, or does it play any role?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I don't know. I think that you look at the previous
three games, this group -- we said it before, we know that we can play with
anyone. But that's not necessarily -- we didn't learn that coming out of this
tournament; we knew that.  
Lingering effects, I'm not sure. Get over this quickly and move on. This is
not the time. It's March. And we are extremely disappointed, but this too
shall pass. We need to move on and get ready for next week. That's hard to say
15 minutes after the fact. It's hard to -- I'm not at that point yet, neither
is this group. We will get there and tomorrow find out where we go and who we
play. Whenever we are scheduled to play, we're going to be there and we're
going to be ready to roll.  
  
Q. In terms of going up against their front court, what's most challenging
in their scheme out there?  
GREG MONROE: They were denying really hard and making it very difficult for me
to get the ball in the post. They were sending two. I mean, they were sending
extra help from both sides, from the top side and from the baseline. So they
kind of made it real hard for me to score and get the ball.  
  
Q. Chris, was there ever any thought to pull up for a jumper? When you got
the ball did you think I'm going to get the basket on that last play there?  
CHRIS WRIGHT: No. I was thinking of getting to the basket. Trying to finish,
try to get a lay-up. I had time on the clock. I wasn't thinking of pulling up
or anything. Just get over to the basket and get it to overtime.  
THE MODERATOR: Georgetown, thank you.

West Virginia -60  
Georgetown - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bob Huggins, Da'Sean Butler, Kevin Jones, Wellington
Smith.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, talk about the shot at the end.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: We ran the same play that we set up for the Cincinnati game.
Waited for Casey (Mitchell) to come off. They kind of overplayed one side and
went the other way. I came up to the top of the key, and I had to come get the
ball and they kind of switched. I think Monroe was on me. And I think he had a
feeling I was going to shoot a three. I had a little hesitation, went around
him and Freeman stepped up, and had a little hop step and scooped the lay-up
off the glass, and it fell.  
  
Q. For Coach and Da'Sean: Do you think with a couple of the teams that were
ahead of you falling in their conference tournaments, do you think you've
shown enough to the Selection Committee to get a No. 1 seed?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: We have 18 top 100 wins. We have nine top 50 wins. The 18
is the most of any team in the country. Our non-league RPI was second. Our
strength of schedules is going to be one. We're going to end up in the top two
or three in the RPI. They say do those things, we've done those things.  
You know, that being said, we're going to enjoy this. We're going to get
together tomorrow and watch the Selection Show, find out where we're going to
go and who we're going to play.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, (inaudible).  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Definitely. I kind of put that -- texted him (Evan Turner). It
was like this shot, I hope you know I'm going to match it the next time I
play. I didn't think I was going to match it. I was just talking to them.
Lucky me. And we won.  
  
Q. Do you think fatigue was a factor in how you were able to outrebound them
so much?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: We practiced three hours a day anyway.  
  
Q. For them.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: For them, probably. I don't know how they were feeling. We did
what we had to do as far as boxing out and keeping a body on Monroe and Vaughn
and everybody else. We just did our job. It worked out for us.  
  
Q. Coach, two years ago you went to the Duke game, several players spoke
about the lack of respect they were getting. Do you think the team gets the
respect they deserve now?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I don't know. I was told, I don't know but it was a pretty
good source, Digger (Phelps) said if we won today, that the league wouldn't be
as good as what it is. Now how you can say something like that is beyond me. I
like Digger. Digger and I are friends.  
But if this isn't the best league in the country, then I just need to quit
coaching, because I don't know anything. And the gauntlet that you go through
in this league, and the coaches that you coach against in this league, the
players that they play against in this league night in and night out, and, you
know, I said our non-league RPI was second. It was number two. I mean, I don't
know what else you have to do.  
But, you know, that being said, we don't care. We know what we are. And we
talked about that before the game. We know what we are. John F. Kennedy said
when they asked him to run for vice president, because he was young,
aristocratic and Catholic, he replied, "Why settle for second when first was
available?" And that's how we're going to go about things. I mean, that's what
is in us. So, you know, I learned a long time ago you don't worry about what
other people say.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, as if winning this thing wasn't good enough, can you just talk
about winning it here in New York City at Madison Square Garden. You're from
Newark, all the guys are from New York.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: It feels good. Our families are here and our friends are here.
That's good and everything. But we kind of wanted to win this for our state
first, because the people there love us so much and they support us so much.
And I definitely know it means the world to them. And then for our school and
for us. We have a lot of people depending on us to do a lot. Especially in our
state. That was our main concern, not letting the state down.  
  
Q. Up and down the roster tonight, the three games, three solid
contributions there, everybody from starters to the bench. It's kind of what
you guys had been looking for. Is that accurate?  
KEVIN JONES: Yeah. I mean, from the starters to the bench, everybody
contributed. When we got tired, the starters got tired, Cam and Deniz and
Casey and John just came in there and did a great job contributing. Just
getting rebounds, guarding their man. We did what we had to do to win. They
did a great job. We had a great bench tonight. We have six more games to get
to the National Championship. We're going to keep on needing that bench.  
  
Q. This is for Wellington: Tonight you've done a very good job on Greg
Monroe defensively and also on offense you had some shots early but came back
and hit some shots. Your mental approach?  
WELLINGTON SMITH: On Monroe, I was trying not to let him catch the ball. Try
to deny him as much as I can. He's the engine that runs their team. So it's
important for us to not let him touch the ball. My mental approach to offense,
I just got a couple of shots up. Coach did a great job just coaching me. How,
I was shooting the ball. I kind of just keep on playing instead of thinking
about the last play. That was huge for me. And it's all mental with all of us.  
Just happy to be here and just being able to go over the hump with my missed
shots the past two games.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Joe Mazzulla with seven assists and no
turnovers.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: Yeah, honestly I don't think Joe would mind me telling you
this, I didn't think Joe was giving us what we needed Joe to give us. And he
and I had a talk about that. Joe brings such great enthusiasm, he brings such
great toughness. He competes so hard. And I thought he was kind of -- he
wasn't Joe, you know. Everybody loves Joe because of what Joe is. And Joe
doesn't need to be anything else than what Joe is. I thought the last --
what's it been three games -- he's been really, really good. I thought he ran
our team. He broke the defense down, got the ball to the basket for us. For a
guy that they don't think can shoot because of his shoulder, he went to the
free-throw line and made shots for us. That's what these guys are about.  
I told them at halftime, we're just going to have to compete and stay
competitive and do whatever it is that we have to do to win. We shot 38%
against -- and that's a heck of a team now. They're very good. Very well
coached and very good. You shoot 38% and win, you're doing some things right.  
  
Q. This week and this game tonight, is this closer or close to what you guys
are capable of?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I wish we would make some shots, you know. I think it would
be a little easier. But, you know, we talked about it all at time. We are what
we are. We're just going to keep competing. If the day comes we're going to
lose in the next few weeks, we're going down swinging.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of stayed back and watched your team celebrate, and I
know these guys obviously worked very hard. What kind of things were you
thinking as you watched them celebrate winning the championship?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I've never gotten involved in that, because I don't think
it's about me; I think it's about them. They're the ones who come in and go
through what they go through on a day-to-day basis. They're the guys who have
to go out and produce on the floor. All I do is stand over there. I can't sit,
so I stand. If I could sit I would probably sit, but I can't.  
I just, you know, I want them to enjoy it and receive all the accolades that
they deserve. And I think, you know, I think Day (Butler) said it, and I think
this is what's special about a group like this. They understand how much it
means to the people in the state of West Virginia. And they understand how
much it means to the students at our university, and that's because they are
part of it. They've done an unbelievable job of becoming part of the
community. And it's like the governor told them, you guys might have to help
me with exactly what he said, but basically what he said, "You are all West
Virginians and you're always going to be." And I think they appreciated that
and they take that to heart.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? West Virginia, thank you. Congratulations.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2010

  

### [Lazar Hayward](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18122)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Georgetown  80  
Marquette - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Buzz Williams, Lazar Hayward and Jimmy Butler.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I thought Georgetown was outstanding. They absolutely
annihilated us. Annihilated us inside. Got beat by 20 on the boards. It's hard
to beat a team when you score 50, 60% of your points in the paint. I thought
they were great. I thought that every single player that played was really
good, was hard for us to guard.  
We were as bad as we've been all year long defensively. Didn't play with very
much energy at all. Considering the stage and considering the implications of
the game in and of itself. We're proud of what we've accomplished up until
this point. It's way more than most people anticipated. But within having said
that, disappointed in our effort and disappointed in our execution tonight.  
  
Q. You guys were within a point with about 13-and-a-half minutes left.
Things kind of spiraled out of control from there. What were you thinking as a
coach at that point and how did things get so out of hand?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: It was 47-46 at that point, that specific timeline. I
think we were down four with 10:26 to play, I think. I haven't looked at the
book. And then we scored six points. We were on fire the last ten minutes of
the game, we scored six points. Very few of our shots tonight were assisted
shots; we had nine assists on 20 baskets. And I think that two of those
assists came within the last two-and-a-half minutes of the game. Didn't think
that we created for others very well.  
Allowed way too many paint touches. We did not create enough paint touches.
But we've never had an issue with offense. Over the last ten minutes tonight,
we were awful, and they were super defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously Greg Monroe had a height advantage over your guys. But
in addition to that, could you speak about what he's able to do with that
length and height?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I've known Greg since he was in high school. He's a great
kid. Comes from a great family. I think he's an early-entry pro. I thought we
did a great job on him in our place. You asked the same-type question in post
game at the Bradley Center. I thought he turned over his right shoulder every
single time tonight. He used his left hand every single time tonight. We
didn't play to the scouting report. And we looked really, really bad. And he
looked really, really good.  
  
Q. That was the first time I heard you talk in a long time about efforts and
in a bad way with your guys, is that concerning at this point in the season?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: No. We're here because of our effort. We won 22 games,
we've lost 11. We won 11 games in the BIG EAST. We have a winning record again
on the road in the BIG EAST. We've won seven of our last eight games decided
by five points or less. And 14 of the 20 games -- 14 of the 21 games now that
we've played in the BIG EAST were decided by five points or less. I think our
effort maybe has been as good as any team in the country. Definitely you could
match our effort against any team in the country. But I thought over the last
ten minutes I thought we were bad. I thought we started the game bad. That's
the first time I think I've called a time-out that early since Maryland-
Eastern Shore. Because we weren't hooked up and ready to go.  
  
Q. Jimmy, Lazar, that same point, 13:34 mark, things started spiraling out
of control. What are you guys thinking on the floor at that point?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: We just didn't -- we were flat. We weren't playing -- we
weren't doing very well.  
We talk about that all the time. We just couldn't find a point in the game to
just try and turn it around. And that was because we started off very badly,
and when we play great teams like that, you can't dig yourself in the hole and
get out of it. Especially a team like that. Great team, great coach.
Especially on the stage like this, it's hard to get out of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Do we have any other questions, please? Marquette, thank you.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Thank you.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Georgetown  80  
Marquette - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: Greg Monroe, Austin Freeman, Chris Wright, Coach Thompson.  
  
Q. Coach, when Greg comes out as aggressively as he did in the first half,
you know, what kind of tone does that set for you, and does everybody sort of
play off him?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Yes, and no. You know, I think the same thing happens
when Austin comes out aggressively, when Chris comes out aggressively. When we
come out aggressively and focus, it sets the tone in general.  
  
Q. Have you noticed over the past three games you seem to have come out to
very strong starts. Has that been a point of emphasis coming out aggressive
from the opening tip?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Yes, of course. Absolutely. It's a coaching change we
made.  
We always when -- we want to have good starts, good middle, and good ends. I
think the guys have -- you are correct, the last couple of games we have had
good starts and we were able to -- we hit a little lull there. I shouldn't say
we hit a little lull. They got the rhythm of the game after we went on a spurt
and they settled in into the rhythm of the game. And then we just were able to
slowly and methodically as the second half went on, to pull away from them. I
think that our attention to detail at the defensive end was very, very good.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys have been saying that fatigue wasn't going to be an
issue, and it hasn't. You guys seem to be getting stronger. What do you
attribute that to?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: We're in shape, we're ready to play, we want to win.
Fatigue is not an issue.  
  
Q. This is for John and then Greg can follow it: John, there are positions
in college sports that have the highest team level, linebacker Notre Dame,
center in Georgetown. How has he graced taking that mantle? And then Greg if
you can talk about being the next in line of great centers in Georgetown.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I think it's too early to give him that label. But
he's played well. I don't think Greg Monroe is Greg Monroe. And I don't think
that he went into this, has gone into this, thinks about how he relates or
compares or contrasts to the people of that played the position here at
Georgetown before him. I think that's something that once your time here is
over you can sit back and make all those analyzations and comparisons. Right
now, I think he's just focused on playing as hard as he can to win games and
help his teammates out.  
GREG MONROE: I'm honored to follow people of that -- people that were so good
here. But I don't compare myself to them. I just come out and try to do things
for my team. The things they accomplished and did and went on to do great
things at a high level. Me just being here two years, I can't put myself in
the same category as those players.  
  
Q. Coach and for Greg: Greg showcased all of his skills tonight, his varied
skills. How much of a big part of the game plan was he attacking Marquette and
their lack of height?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I think that they have not had height all year. And
they've done a very good job of not letting people expose that or take
advantage of that. They know where their deficiencies are. Maybe "deficiency"
is a wrong word. They know that's a point of emphasis. So they do a very good
job of not letting you just take advantage of them in the paint. We were able
to do that today. There's no doubt about that. And I think we just got on a
roll. I think Greg and Julian and Austin got down in the post. We tried to
post up Chris and he threw it away. But I think he did a good job of knowing
when there was a time to score and when there was a time to kick it out.  
  
Q. Chris, in the second half, you guys got on a 22-5 roll. You scored 8 of
the first 10 points. What happened there to break it open for you?  
CHRIS WRIGHT: Well, it was just the flow of the game. You know, it was nothing
that, you know -- we had some guys that were rolling early. Jason hit some big
shots in the start of the second half. Greg was being dominant the whole game.
Austin was rolling. I just think it was time for me to make a play. And I just
read the defense and made the correct plays. I wasn't trying to be selfish or
anything. It was just there was just openings, and we were capitalizing on it.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like after last yesterday's win against Syracuse, your
team might have been entitled to feel very self-satisfied and maybe take
breath. Did you give any thought, any concern that they would not be this
ready to go after that?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: No. It's March. And there's no time to take a breath
and pat yourself on the back in March. Your next opponent is very good. Your
next opponent is well coached. Your next opponent is trying to kick your
behind. So no, we weren't satisfied at all.  
Yes, we're satisfied with yesterday's win. But I think Chris said it, we
didn't come here to just say we would beat Syracuse.  
  
Q. Coach, can you expand on what challenges you see from either Notre Dame
or West Virginia?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: We have a lot of challenges. Both of them have beaten
us already. And I mean can I wait until we see and just talk about -- catch me
in a couple of hours and I can talk about who we're playing.  
  
Q. For Austin and Chris: You seen men come into this league and score points
and grab rebounds. When you see Greg run the floor, are you impressed? What's
your reaction when you see that part of his game?  
CHRIS WRIGHT: I would say that when he first got here, we were amazed at what
he could do. Especially the way he passes. He has a very -- he sees the court
very well. I mean, it's nothing new. We all know Greg is a phenomenal player.
It's nothing that we -- it's not like he just started doing this in the BIG
EAST Tournament. So we know he's a great player. We know he can pass, he can
score.  
And one thing that we really, you know, have come to notice is that he
rebounds like anybody. And he's getting all the rebounds. There's not a lot of
second shots or third shots for anybody.  
So Greg is doing what he has to do. He's playing his role. He's a major part
of our team.  
AUSTIN FREEMAN: Chris said it best.  
  
Q. The three teams you just played and whoever you face tomorrow are all
teams that beat you during the regular season. Is that providing any extra
motivation to kind of get back at those teams?  
GREG MONROE: Yes.  
CHRIS WRIGHT: Yes.  
AUSTIN FREEMAN: Yes.  
GREG MONROE: For the record, yes.  
  
Q. What's it like playing obviously in New York City, but now you're in the
final of the BIG EAST Tournament. Can you feed off the crowd? Can you feel it
out there?  
GREG MONROE: Yes. It's Madison Square Garden and it's the BIG EAST Tournament.
Our fans have showed up in a big way for us. We're very grateful for them. At
the end of the day, now it's the championship game. It's at Madison Square
Garden. I know as a team we came here to win this tournament, and I mean
tomorrow the lights are going to be on. We have to be prepared to play.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: A good friend of mine after yesterday's game said,
I'm looking for him, I don't see him, there's nothing better than Friday night
in New York City, other than Saturday night in New York City. So we're going
to show up in New York City on Saturday night.  
  
Q. For Greg, there was two-minute stretch where you had a drive, a jam, a
three-pointer, an assist and a break and a blocked shot. Did you decide to
take this game over and say, this is my game?  
GREG MONROE: No. I was trying to make plays. The shot was an overshot. The
drive was there. They were all kind of high. Blocking that's just playing
defense. It wasn't anything. It was opportunities that I took. It wasn't
anything trying to take over. We had control of the game as a team. And I was
just trying to make winning plays to close out the game.  
  
Q. It's for Austin: I hope you don't mind a question about your health. But
could you just sort of bring us up to date on how these last three days have
gone for you? How are you feeling?  
AUSTIN FREEMAN: These three days have been great. I'm feeling good. Nothing is
wrong with me right now. I'm happy right now. We're winning. So it makes it a
little bit better too. I'm good.  
THE MODERATOR: Georgetown, thank you.

## March 12, 2010

  

### [Da'Sean Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17188)

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Kevin Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20651)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

West Virginia  53  
Notre Dame - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: Da'Sean Butler, Kevin Jones, Coach Bob Huggins.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, you guys are from this area. The whole starting
five is from New York and New Jersey. What is it like to be in the finals at
The Garden? And do you feel more comfortable playing here because you guys are
from the area?  
KEVIN JONES: Definitely. When you get to play in front of your friends and
family, it's always a great thing. And we just want to perform well for our
fans and I think we did a good job of doing that tonight. And hopefully we can
come out with a win tomorrow. And bring home the championship.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Honestly, I feel the same way. It's tremendous to be here. The
number of times we came to the semifinals pretty much every year except for my
freshman year. Even then we played tough and hard and but it didn't come up.
This opportunity, we can't blow this opportunity. I'm looking forward to this
game tomorrow really bad. It's just an honor to be in this situation right
now.  
  
Q. Coach Huggins, how did you get all these New York kids to come to
Morgantown?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: My effervescent personality.  
I mean, it's the BIG EAST. And I think anybody from the BIG EAST, people are
going to listen to. I knew some people in Mont Vernon. And so I thought maybe
we had a chance to recruit KJ. We were fortunate enough to get him. Actually,
I think Truck (Bryant) before that. I think Truck committed in the summertime.
Truck just wanted to play in the BIG EAST.  
And then Devin, the situation in Indiana, came down to he visited I think five
schools. We were fortunate. I think having the opportunity to come in and
play, particularly for Devin, because Joe Alexander was leaving.  
  
Q. For Da'Sean, what was going through your mind when Jackson puts up that
three the last possession?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: I don't think about it. I just get ready to box out. But at
that time I saw him shooting the ball. I said "don't go in." Bad shot I had
just taken. He came down and put it up. Either you win or lose on that one. I
just prayed he didn't. I boxed out. Thank God he didn't.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, what would it mean to you to bring home West Virginia's first
BIG EAST Tournament championship?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: It would mean the world to me just because it would be our
first one and I was a part of the team. And I was part of something special.
That's something the coach has been talking about all year. If you want to be
special, you have to do special things. Can't just have good talent, great
coach and great schemes and come up with nothing. We have to win things, and
win special tournaments and whatever the case may be.  
So this is an opportunity for to us do something special in the BIG EAST. So
hopefully we take advantage of it tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the decision to go to the 1-3-1 in the first
half and how effective it was.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: Well, we had had some success in the past, and we had a
1-3-1 lineup. We can't play that with every lineup. The lineup we had in at
that time was a lineup that we play pretty well. We play the 1-3-1 pretty
well. And I thought it was effective. And Mike does a great job coaching. And
he made some adjustments in the second half, and got the ball to the guy that
was making shots. We were supposed to shadow Hansbrough a little better than
what we did in the second half. He made two big threes.  
You know at the end of the day, 1-3-1 has been good for us, but at the end of
the day if there's a time-out and I think it was a one-point game and I say to
them, what do you want to do, to a man it's always, "Let's just guard them,
Coach. Let's go guard them." Because we work so hard at trying to guard
people, and they have a lot of confidence that they can go out and stop
people.  
  
Q. Kevin, Coach obviously has track record of sending guys to the NBA. How
much is that a motivation for you and the other guys and the New York guys to
come play for Coach because he has that history?  
KEVIN JONES: I mean, definitely. I look to his background when he was coming
after me. I mean, he's a great coach. Had a lot of great players go to the
NBA. Definitely that was attractive to me. And I just see it as a chance to
get better. He demands so much of you. I also demand so much of myself. I
think the rest of my teammates can say that, too. So it was just a great
opportunity for me, I thought.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, with Syracuse losing and you guys kind of being next in line, do
you think also about getting a No. 1 regional seed for the NCAA if you win
tomorrow?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: I think it's possible. I don't think there's any reason why we
can't, if we don't lose any games. We haven't lost any games in the tournament
that we were supposed to lose. We took care of business. All the other teams
fell out. We take care of business and win this game tomorrow, I don't see why
we can't be a No. 1 seed at all.  
  
Q. Not trying to be funny, but you're up 10 with 8 minutes left. Did you
have a sense they might come back, and given the way you played, can you hold
on and focus in the end?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I am starting to have a lot of confidence in our guys
screwing up enough to let them back in the game, if you're asking.  
We had opportunities. You think about the transition opportunities we had and
we blew, and we have not shot free throws nearly as well as we're capable.
Devin struggled in this tournament. He's an 80% free-throw shooter. We didn't
take care of the ball the way we need to take care of the ball. But, you know,
I tell them all the time, you know, I'm not very happy about it. We're going
to try to keep fixing it. But at the end of the day we're 26-6, playing for a
BIG EAST championship.  
  
Q. Is there a New York feel to what's going on in Morgantown?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: You've never been to Morgantown, have you?  
  
Q. I'm in Morgantown every year. Is there a New York feel to what you guys
have going on in Morgantown?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I'm not sure what you're trying to ask me, but Morgantown
is a great college town. It's a great place to go to school. I would like to
do it again. I tell these guys all the time, if I was 18 years old again, wow.
Of course I kind of know the ins and outs, too. It's a great college town.  
Honestly, I think if we weren't in the BIG EAST, we can't recruit those guys.
What the people in this league have done over the years, I mean, it's the best
league in the country. And I've been around enough and been in other leagues.
And I've said this a lot, when you're in the other leagues, you say, man, it
ain't that good. And then you get in here.  
You ask about a No. 1 seed. You think about the gauntlet we've just gone
through. And John helps me so much with the scheduling, you know, having
Georgetown and Villanova to end the year.  
THE MODERATOR: It's working out ok so far.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I know it's a stroke of genius on your part. The league
sells itself. And then I think to a degree, like Kevin said, you look, we've
been fortunate to win some games. And I've had wonderful guys. And I have had
whatever it is, 17, 18, 19 guys go play in the NBA.  
So I think everybody wants to be challenged. I think everybody loves this
league, particularly here in New York loves this league. And then you have an
opportunity -- you know, it's kind of like I tell these guys, you know, you
take a heck of a chance if you go with somebody who hasn't done it before. And
we've been fortunate to do it before, do it multiple times before in getting
guys in the league. So those things help.  
But they're great kids. I tell you this, this is a great bunch of people.
Coaches are always talk about low maintenance; I have basically no
maintenance. They do what they're supposed to do.  
  
Q. Coach, for Da'Sean kind of a two-part question: Some things you haven't
got in the past two games, penetration and scoring inside. And with Joe
Mazzulla, how did that help you? Da'Sean did that help free you up some?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: A lot. Joe always gives us a lot of everything as far as
defensively and running the team offensively. Any day him just attacking the
basket, especially if they're overplaying me a lot and overplaying Kevin a
lot. Joe just attacked and found spots and just took care of business. That's
what we looked to him to do, because he's a leader as well on the team.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the challenge of playing Georgetown, specifically the
how well they've been playing these past few games.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: They're really good. Extremely well coached. John does a
great job of coaching them. Monroe is terrific. We jumped on them pretty good
in Morgantown early and then they came out the second half and played
extremely well against us. And Monroe was a large part of that. You know, it's
the BIG EAST, you know? I'm not trying to be redundant. You look around the
league and who do you play who doesn't have great players? Everybody has great
players. And I think Mo said after the Syracuse game, he is the best skilled
big man in the country, which I would agree with. He passes the ball, he finds
open people, he can lay it down, he can score in the post. Quite frankly,
people with size bother us, because we're not that big.  
  
Q. Coach, sorry if this has been asked already, this win tonight put you
past John Wooden on the all-time list. I'm just wondering if you've ever had
any meetings with Wooden in the past? Does this hold any special meaning for
you?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: Well, yeah, I have had three or four guys that were top ten
on the Wooden list invited to go to L.A. So I've spent some time with Coach
there and we've played in The Wooden Classic several times. So I got to spend
some time with him there. I honestly don't think about those things.  
I'm worried about -- I've told this story, but it's an absolutely true story.
A year ago we were kind of young, we were playing three freshman and we go to
Georgetown and the 13th or 14th in the country and have a huge win on the
road. I go out and sit on the bus. I give him a Jimmy John sandwich. I want to
eat my Jimmy John sandwich and watch a replay of the game. And my assistants
walk over and drop about seven tapes on my seat on the bus and I said, "What's
this?" They said, "Coach, come on, we have Pitt on Monday." They were No. 2 in
the country at that time at the time. You don't have time to think about those
things. And I really never had.  
I've told you this, I grew up in Midvale (Ohio), 500 people, two stoplights,
nine bars. I got in the truck with this guy one time and he said -- and I
looked and he didn't have a rear-view mirror. I said, "You don't have a rear-
view mirror." He said, "I don't back up." He said, "We're going forward, son."
And that's kind of how I've lived my life.  
THE MODERATOR: West Virginia, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2010

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Ben Hansbrough](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17032)

### [Tory Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17106)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

West Virginia  53  
Notre Dame - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: Notre Dame is here. Luke Harangody, Ben Hansbrough, Tory
Jackson, Coach Mike Brey.  
COACH MIKE BREY: Proud of our group. Boy, we made a run at it. And to have a
shot, it was kind of a weird game. We were in a hole. But to dig out and have
a look, it was pretty good. We had the tempo we wanted. We did a better job on
Butler. And that was a combination really when we got Ty Nash on him, that at
least gave us a chance to have a chance to win the game.  
They're really good. Very difficult to defend, and physical and take away
space in the half court with their length.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Tory, do you wonder what's it going to take for you to hit a game-winning
shot?  
TORY JACKSON: Just keep watching Michael Jordan clips, I guess. It just
happens, you know. Things happen. I thought it was a good shot when I let it
go. But you live and learn. One thing we're not going to do is dwell on it. We
just had a heck of a run. We have to make another one coming up.  
  
Q. Tory, it looked like your defender backed up. Were you going to the hole
and he backed off?  
TORY JACKSON: Yeah. When he dropped off, that's what made me want to take that
shot. It was a wide open shot. Just didn't go down.  
  
Q. Ben, you've been kind of struggling with your shot recently. Is that the
game you've been looking for?  
BEN HANSBROUGH: I've just been -- feel like I need to let the game come to me.
I'm not going to try to force anything. Especially with the flow we've been
playing at. Just got done with a six-game winning streak. Try not to worry
about individually. We've been getting those W's. So I haven't even thought
about it, honestly.  
  
Q. Ben, Tory, what do you make of this run you guys had here? It started
beforehand, but what did this do for you guys? What did you take out of it
going to the next one?  
BEN HANSBROUGH: West Virginia is the sixth ranked team in the country. They're
a very good team. I think that just goes to show we can play and we can beat
anybody in the country. We want to take that momentum into the NCAA
Tournament. I mean, we lost to the sixth ranked team in the country by two
points and had a shot to win it. It just shows how far this team has come.  
You look at us at the very beginning of the year and you look at us now we
just got done with a six-game winning streak, and people didn't include us in
the picture and we got tough. We showed we can play and beat anybody in the
country now.  
  
Q. Coach, second night in a row, tough, close game. I think you used your
last time-out with more than a minute to go. Talk about that and that last
play with Tory tonight.  
COACH MIKE BREY: Well, I think we needed our time-outs to set our defense and
get our legs under us. One thing I don't do with this team is overcoach them
because we have a high basketball IQ. And, you know, we kind of flow and make
reads. I think the worst thing would be, even if you had a time-out, was to
let all that length get organized. When they get organized and they would have
got organized, it may have been tougher. The karma around this guy during this
run has been so good, when he took it, I said we're going to live and die with
it.  
  
Q. Coach, middle of the first half their 1-3-1 extends pretty much farther
with that length than other defenses the you'll face. Why was it they were
able to defend the wings and corners as well?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Well, it was a little different. I thought they would play
more of that instead of just let us burn clock versus man. They've watched us
do that. And it is something in their arsenal to kind of make us try and play
a little faster. I don't know if we played faster, but our rhythm was a little
different than playing against man-to-man and burning against man. And it took
us a while to kind of get into a rhythm.  
Now, we missed some great looks that we usually make that I think would have
helped confidence-wise. We had some great looks there. Carleton (Scott) and
Abro (Abromaitis) against that. But it was a different rhythm. We talked about
that today in the shoot-around to be ready for heavy doses of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Thanks.  
THE MODERATOR: Notre Dame, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2010

  

### [Scottie Reynolds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16946)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Marquette  80  
Villanova - 76

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Jay Wright, Corey Stokes, Scottie Reynolds.  
  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Well, great game. We gave all the credit to Marquette. They
just continued to answer every play, every situation, every little adjustment
we made, they had an answer for. They just did a great, great job. I have to
give them credit.  
We didn't play that poorly. Obviously, you know, a couple of times we lost,
Johnson-Odom, we lost Hayward. But it's easy to say that when you watch the
game. They do such a great job of making the extra passes, driving the ball,
not taking the initial shot, making the extra passes. They get you scrambling.
If you're not great at playing every possession for 35 seconds defensively,
they're going to get you. I think that was the difference. We're good at it.
We're not great at it yet.  
  
Q. Coach, you know one thing about this tournament, 1-2 seeds got bumped
off. It shows the competitiveness. More importantly, seeing each other as much
as you have, talk about how that plays into it, maybe what happened today.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I think that happens every year in the Tournament. I think
that's what is great about tournaments. You don't have to worry about when
they say you have to prepare one day after -- it's not a big deal. We've all
played each other. We know each other. I think that's what makes the games
great. It's been great games throughout this tournament. Our familiarity with
each other is -- it makes it tough beating any team.  
  
Q. Teams often will look when they are picking their brackets at teams that
are hot and not hot based on the end of their conference and their conference
play. Do you think that's folly?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: If I was picking a team, I would look deeper into that. I
would look at games they played. I would look at, you know, how they played.
You know, we just lost two games in a row now. I don't think we played that
poorly. I think we played two very good teams. I would like us to be better at
this point in the season. But we are where we are. I'm not disappointed. I'm
just trying to be realistic about we are where we are. We have to keep getting
better. I know we can get better. I still feel good about our team. I really
do.  
  
Q. Given the results of today, not just you guys and previous tournaments,
what are your thoughts about the double bye, advantage or disadvantage?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I think it depends on where your team is. Last year for
instance for us it was great; we needed the rest last year. This year I
thought it was good, too, because we actually needed the practice. I mean, we
got better since our West Virginia game. We really did. We didn't get good
enough to win this game, but we did get better. I still really like it.  
And the other part of it is if we would have won, you only have two more games
to win a championship. So we all know the NCAA Tournament is important. Your
top teams aren't beat down. That's the other part of it that I think -- I
think we would trade that. We would all trade that. Maybe sometimes not being
ready -- but that's not fair. We're all ready. We've been playing so many
games. There's still a great advantage to only playing three games in a
tournament and having a chance to win it.  
  
Q. Scottie, this is your last BIG EAST game. How tough is it for you for
your career to end like this?  
SCOTTIE REYNOLDS: It's tough, but, you know, that's basketball, you know. You
have to go on to the next thing. We're just looking forward to the NCAA
Tournament. You know, trying to learn from our mistakes and try to make them
into positives. Marquette did a great job today. There's no shame in losing
when, you know, when you're going up against a team like Marquette.  
  
Q. Scottie, Jay was talking about the double bye. Was it enough time for you
to sort of rest and get recuperated? Or do you think it was too long to sit
around?  
SCOTTIE REYNOLDS: I think it was plenty of time. I think it was good for us
just to get back on the court and go over things that we didn't do so well in
the West Virginia game and get prepared for Marquette and take our time with
preparing for Marquette. Like Coach said, we didn't get good enough to win
this game but we got a lot better since the West Virginia game.  
  
Q. Scottie, you've been in a number of these games in these tournaments, in
the BIG EAST Tournament. How much does it wear you down and how much does it
pump you up for the next level?  
SCOTTIE REYNOLDS: I think the BIG EAST season, it does wear you down because
you see so many teams that are at the top and so many competitive teams just
going at it night in and night out. You just got to prepare yourself mentally
and physically and know that each team that you face is going to be a tough
one, just like this one. We didn't expect anything different. You know, we try
to have that mindset every time we step on the floor, that every game is going
to come down to the last two minutes of a game.  
  
Q. Jay, I guess Jay, you got probably a week now until your next game. How
hard or easy is it going to be to get you guys to put everything behind you?  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: I think one thing about this group, they've done a great job
of all year, is just gotten on to the next game and taken pride in getting
better in practice. We need to get better. I think we can. We'll take a day or
so off here. But we'll have some good practices and we'll improve between now
and the time we play our first Tournament game.  
THE MODERATOR: Villanova, thank you.  
COACH JAY WRIGHT: Thanks, guys.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

## March 11, 2010

  

### [Lazar Hayward](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18122)

### [Darius Johnson-Odom](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20620)

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Marquette  80  
Villanova - 76

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Darius Johnson-Odom and Lazar Hayward and Coach Buzz
Williams.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I guess I missed this part yesterday. I apologize for
being late. I didn't realize I had to walk this far to get here.  
I think Villanova is arguably one of the best teams we've played since I've
been at Marquette. So hard to guard. Every one of the guys they bought on the
floor can pass, dribble and shoot. They keep you in constant rotation because
of their ability to penetrate, and I thought they were outstanding. Very well
prepared. And we struggled to guard them. It's very hard to win games when
your opponent shoots 54% and outrebounds you by five.  
But our guys hung in there. We were a little out of sorts over the last
minute, because we were concerned that the scoreboard malfunctioned. We ended
up winning by four. It's been a long time since we've done that. And so we're
thankful that it ended the way it did.  
  
Q. Buzz, can you talk about the play of Darius and Jimmy today in responding
after the days they had yesterday?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I've said this all along about our team, I said that
before the BIG EAST season started, we'll be better than fine. I just don't
know when that time will be. And I've said all along about D.J., I saw D.J.
play for about seven minutes when I recruited him. That was it. That was all I
needed to see. I think he's really hard to guard, and I think he does a great
job of forcing help.  
And I think what's happened with Jimmy is he's a mismatch nightmare in a lot
of ways because his intelligence level allows him to guard a variety of
people. His length allows him to guard a variety of people. And for those same
reasons, he does a good job of exploiting mismatches offensively. And when he
rebounds the ball, when he gets eight rebounds we're probably in good shape.
And that was what was so hard for us yesterday. We need him to play. I didn't
ever take him out of the game, huh? Yeah, both of them. Outstanding.  
But at the same time, I thought Cuby (Cubillan) is playing with an
unbelievable lion's heart.  
  
Q. Coach Williams, you shot 35% in the first half, still the score was tied
at 30. How big was that going into the second half?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I told our guys that at halftime. I thought there was a
segment there of maybe six or seven minutes where offensively we were as good
as we've been. I thought our pace was great. I thought we made the extra pass.
I thought we created for others. In that span of time is when we scored most
of our baskets. Lazar gets in foul trouble, Mo (Acker) gets in foul trouble.
The problem is those are our two bookends on both ends of the floor, and our
team is out of sorts. We turned it over, even in the second half, I think we
were up seven. We're turning it over against their three-quarter-court
pressure. And it's because our team relies on the assistance of those two
guys. And I told our guys I said, I thought we played to the scouting report
about 97% the way we needed to. And if we keep fighting and turning it into a
slugfest, we'll have a chance in the second half. Because I didn't think we
shot the ball well. Normally we shoot it better. What did we shoot in the
second? We shot 65%.  
  
Q. Buzz, we asked you a lot about the game last year against Villanova. Does
this exorcise those demons a little bit?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Maybe if I had been doing this a long time I would have a
different answer. I think Jay Wright will be in the Hall of Fame long before
his career is over. And I think if you're on that trajectory in your career,
that tells that you you're one of the elite in your profession. I read every
word he ever says. Every single day of the year. Because I think he's a great
example of what coaches should be like. I think he handles his players the
right way. I think he handles and respects the game the right way.  
I want to get better. I want to learn. And in the last calendar year we've
played him three times and all three times total it's been a total of five
points. And since I've been at Marquette, we've played him six times. So in
the last 15-and-a-half months we've played him six times. That's a lot of
experience of getting your tail whipped.  
So I don't look at it as exorcising any demons. I think we've been in every
single game we've played except for when we played at their place last year.
South Florida beat us at the buzzer. We go up there and shot 78% I think in
the second half. I'm just glad I get to hang around these guys one more day in
New York. It's not me against Jay Wright. It's these kids.  
  
Q. Is it easier or harder when you get into a situation like this where it's
a knockout situation that you've played them already twice this season?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Well, I think that in that stretch of games where we went
2-5, and then we won five in a row and then Pitt beat us at home, I think from
that point forward -- and I mean this in the right way, I think every single
game has been a miniature NCAA Tournament game for us. Our guys are smart.
They are a lot smarter than I am. They knew if we got beat potentially our
season was over. Maybe not at that point in time, but relative to playing in
the postseason. And so there's been an underlying whatever the word would be
that our guys understood, we better hook up and play every possession like
it's our last.  
So I don't think that they process it any different. I think our guys are
about as calm as -- our guys are more calm than our fans in these games,
because that's all we've been doing.  
  
Q. Question for Darius: Going from yesterday and held in check a little bit,
what was the difference from you yesterday and today when you completely took
over in certain points of the game?  
DARIUS JOHNSON-ODOM: I think today I was attacking more, trying to create not
just for myself but for my teammates. Yesterday I thought I was a little
passive on both ends of the court. And I think when I come out and play like
that, I help my team in so many different areas.  
  
Q. Were you timid? Was it a little bit a product of being in the Madison
Square Garden in the bright lights for the first time?  
DARIUS JOHNSON-ODOM: I think so.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: He doesn't even know where New York is.  
  
Q. Lazar, you dominated inside and then you were able to have that big
three. Talk about how big that shot was and how it propelled the team to
victory.  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I don't know if I would say I was dominating. I think I did all
right. Those guys over at Villanova are really good players and they are tough
and they play hard every single possession. But you know, when I had that
three, I had a little space, and I seen he had his hands down. I just shot it
and it was a rhythm shot. So, you know, Coach never gets mad if we shoot
rhythm threes. It went in and it definitely was a big momentum swing for us.  
  
Q. Lazar, just to follow-up on the talk about calmness, how do you explain
it? How do you stay so calm in the frenzy at the end of these games?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: To be honest, I really don't know. I know in every single
practice, Coach really gears it up and it's wild. It's really like a football
practice the way we practice every single day. And I think that's why when we
get in those games and we get into the guts of a game, we're all calm because
we do that every single day. And when those things happen, we're able to say
ok, we've been here before. We know what we're supposed to do.  
  
Q. Can you expand, how is it like a football practice?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I don't know. He's a very emotional coach. You see he's always
revved up. And he's running around. He's saying words I can't say here. We
know that's the only chance we have to win is to play extremely frantic and
just play hard every single possession. Because, you know, that's the only way
we know how to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
Q. Coach, what will you need to do to prepare for tomorrow's game as far as
resting --  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Who do we play?  
  
Q. I guess Georgetown.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: You asked me the question. You didn't even know who we
were playing?  
  
Q. More so for the physical factor.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: We're fired up. These guys played AAU. They played nine
or ten games a day at AAU. NCAA had to restrict what time they could start
games and end games in July. That's not -- I don't mean this egotistically, I
go back to what Lazar said. I grind these guys up every single day. We've had
79 practices. I try to coach their guts out over single possession. We're
thankful that the game's at seven. We'll be a little anxious tomorrow. We get
to sleep in and breakfast will be late. And the hotel we're staying at it will
be messed up. And so we'll probably go somewhere else and eat so I don't have
a meltdown. And then we'll come over here and shoot balls and -- the game is
at seven? That's a six o'clock game in Milwaukee. Our guys will be excited.
We'll be fine. We'll be fine.  
  
Q. Lazar, when it's getting late in the game, we talk about the staying calm
and all that, does it help you guys to have seen them twice before this year
and have a pretty good idea of what they're going to do?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I would say so. Every team in this league is very, very tough.
We have the opportunity to play each team. So, you know, we kind of know the
tendencies of a team. Our coaches do a great job of scouting teams. But, you
know, when we have a coach like Buzz and, you know, we can kind of look over
there and look into his eyes, we can see that we're all right. And just
carries on from him all the way to us. The guys, they'll look over to me to
make sure that things are ok. They'll look into my eyes and they see I have
energy and I have some fight in me. I say, ok, we can do it.  
But the credit all goes to our coaches. They do a great job of preparing us
for each game. And, you know, we take it all in as much as we can and we help
each over, and it carries on to the court.  
THE MODERATOR: Marquette, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2010

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Jermaine Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20636)

### [Brad Wanamaker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20637)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Notre Dame  50  
Pittsburgh - 45

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Jamie Dixon. We also have Jermaine Dixon and Brad
Wanamaker.  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: All right. You know, obviously we're disappointed in the
loss. It's a close game that came down to the last possessions. And we just
didn't get it done. They seemed to make shots at the end of the clock and they
executed well. And we need to do a better job.  
To their credit, they're playing well. We're playing well. And that's why you
saw a game that came down to the final possessions. You know, we'll get better
for it I think. I think we have a couple of days to prepare. We'll get ready
and find out who we play Sunday. That's why I told the guys afterwards this is
disappointing. But as we know, we need to be ready for Sunday. And that's the
most important thing at this point right now.  
So congratulations to them. I was happy with how we played. We played hard. We
really committed this week. We really got after it and I thought we got better
because of it. But the end of the day, we just got to shoot better. We've got
to play better. And we had plenty of opportunities to take the lead. And we
just couldn't get over that hump. So I'm very proud of how our guys played. I
thought we really worked hard. We really focused and came out and did some
very good things. But just came up short.  
  
Q. Coach Dixon, talk about how gratifying this season has been surpassing
everyone's expectations.  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: It's not gratifying right now. For us it's disappointing.
Every loss for us in our program has always been a disappointment. Right now
we don't feel good. I'll speak for myself. I don't feel good. But I'm very
happy with our effort and what we did. These kids have given everything they
can. And they've been called young, inexperienced all year, but they haven't
played like it. I think this will be a good learning lesson for us today. I
think this is something we can get better for.  
  
Q. Jermaine, they were able to switch off of you guys defensively. Talk
about how they did that. Were they utilizing screens or how were they doing
that?  
JERMAINE DIXON: Well, like you said, they were switching. We kind of picked it
up late. And, you know -- I don't know what to say about that. They were
switching and they did a good job at it. Still, I think we got some good
looks. We just missed a couple of shots we usually knock down.  
  
Q. Coach, and this is probably really for all three of you: How frustrating
is it for you playing against that style of play from Notre Dame?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I mean, I don't call it frustrating. You have to be
prepared and understand what they're doing. You know it's going to be low
scoring. You know it's going to be a low-possession game. You know it's going
to be close game. It was those few possessions. There's not going to be any
real separation. It kind of went as you might expect. You know, we're in a
position to win the game. So I don't say we were frustrated at all.  
  
Q. Guys, could you respond to that? Is it difficult adapting to that style
of play?  
BRAD WANAMAKER: I wouldn't say it's difficult. It's something we have to
adjust to. I think we did a good job. Like Jermaine said, we missed some lay-
ups we should have made.  
JERMAINE DIXON: I feel the same way. I think we did a pretty good job at
attacking them and getting -- driving kickouts or drive to the lane, and
feeding our big men. Even going up to try to finish. We just didn't make shots
that we usually make.  
  
Q. Coach, two years off the double bye, what effect do you think that has on
your squad when you get out there?  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I mean, we have to get ready. The league is so good. The
teams are so good. I think usually when you get a double bye you think in most
situations you're going to get a team that's a big difference in those
situations. In this league, that's not the case. You're playing a team --
we're playing Notre Dame. Everybody is talking about how well they're playing.
It's just who you get and where they finish. It's such a long year, guys are
going to be playing better in January than other teams. And then at the end,
the team -- so a double bye had nothing to do with it. It's just a team that's
playing well against another team that's playing very well. Probably the teams
with the best records down the stretch are playing together in the
quarterfinal game. And that's really what you had.  
So I think we won eight of our last nine. They won their last four. Those two
teams playing in the quarterfinals. It speaks to our league.  
THE MODERATOR: Pitt, thank you.

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Lance Stephenson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20571)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

West Virginia  54  
Cincinnati - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: Deonta Vaughn, Yancy Gates, Lance Stephenson, Coach Mick
Cronin.  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Well, I told my guys I'm extremely proud of their effort.
Tremendous tournament for them. They deserved a better ending than to get beat
on two shots, one at the end of the first half, a bank shot at the end of the
second half. The second last basket was a loose ball we dove for that squirted
out and rolled in for a lay-up. Guys could not have played better tonight on
the defensive end and hung in there and fought hard.  
Just right now I feel really bad for my players. I'm really proud but on a
personal level I feel really bad. They deserved a much better ending. Win,
lose or draw, just a tough way, tough way to obviously lose the game when a
guy banks in a shot.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Lance, can you take us through your last shot and defense on the last
shot of the game?  
LANCE STEPHENSON: Last shot we just was passing the ball around because they
were playing a 1-3-1. We were trying to get the open shot. I was the open
person. I couldn't let my team down. So I had to hit the shot. And the last
play of the game, I don't know. I tried my hardest to stop him. But he made an
incredible move and an incredible shot.  
  
Q. He said you were right up on him.  
LANCE STEPHENSON: I was all over him. Nothing I could do. I couldn't do
nothing. I couldn't do nothing different. I actually fouled him.  
  
Q. When it went up, what did you think? When his shot went up, did you think
it was good?  
LANCE STEPHENSON: He called it. He said "bank." I said "what?" I turned around
and I seen it go in. Oh man.  
  
Q. I don't think he called it until he saw it was going to bank. That's what
he said. He said when he saw it was going to bank, he thought that was good.
He said you stopped him from penetrating. He was supposed to take a couple
more dribbles in. You must have done your job.  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Yancy doubled him. We didn't guard Ebanks. We knew they
were going to him. We put two guys on him. He dribbled away from the double-
team and he got lucky. I love Da'Sean. He's maybe one of the nicest kids. His
high school coach, one of my closest friends Nick Marinello. A lot of people
didn't recruit him. When you bank one in from the top, sometimes at the park
that don't even count. They make you call it.  
  
Q. Lance, is this your toughest loss at The Garden?  
LANCE STEPHENSON: Yeah. I never lost at The Garden. Oh, yeah St. John's I
lost. Not like this. This was the toughest loss. I was mad we lost like this.  
  
Q. You had two scoring droughts to start the first half and the second half.
You didn't seem to be getting a lot of open looks.  
COACH MICK CRONIN: They're a great defensive team because of their length and
the way they denied everybody, they don't let you run an offense. They held
Villanova to 57 on the road in the last game in the regular season. To have no
prep time for their denial defense was a great concern of mine. So I was just
proud of the way the guys hung in there. Look up and we're only down 18-9, as
bad as we were playing.  
Once our guys adjusted to the way they were playing defensively, especially in
the second half. We only had three turnovers in the second half until the last
play. That's why we had ten offensive rebounds in the second half. Because we
get shots off, we can rebound.  
  
Q. What happened with Dion? I guess it went off his leg?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: He just got in a hurry. We would have liked him to catch
it. They didn't have a guy who took it out. If he would have passed it to Tay
(Vaughn), Tay was going to race up the floor and guard it. He turned and
dribbled it too fast. Like Yancy said, he turned before he even dribbled it.
He was out of control before he even put it on the floor. I feel bad for him.
He's devastated right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Cincinnati, thank you.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Georgetown - 91  
Syracuse - 84

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Greg Monroe, Jason Clark, Coach Thompson and Chris
Wright.  
  
Q. Coach, you've lost to this team twice over this year. What in this game
did you have in mind that you know that you were confident to take over and
win this game today?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I don't know that there's any one particular thing,
you know, against them. They had runs against us in the previous two games. I
think we did a very good job today, with the exception of the last minute or
two, of not turning the ball over. Normally we turn the ball over against
them. They do a great job of creating your turnovers into easy baskets. And I
thought our guys did a pretty good job, very good job, actually, of just
trying to hunt and peck and make the right decisions against their zone.  
There are no holes in it. You get no easy baskets. We just wanted basically to
get the ball into the middle. Get the ball either to Greg or off penetration
and then make decisions from there.  
  
Q. Coach, could you speak specifically about the defensive job Syracuse did
against Greg in limiting his shots, and then Greg's ability to be effective in
other regards rebounding, assists?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: They played a zone. And that's all that they do. And
they're great at it. They're not just good at it, they're great at it. The
last time we played them, Greg was extremely effective scoring once he got the
ball -- our big comeback, we fell short at home but we basically threw it into
him and he was able to score just about every time. It was clear that one of
the judgments they made was they didn't want him to score. He was still able
to catch it. Then they crowded him more, they put more bodies at him, they
sent guys at him, and so it was hard for him to get shots.  
We're fine because he did a good job of finding his teammates for open shots,
open lay-ups, open cuts. So I think that's what they did. They didn't want him
to get shots like he did the last game. And everyone knows Greg is an
unselfish player. Had a terrific game without getting a lot of shots. I'm not
sure how many points he ended up with. 15, 10 and 7. That's pretty damn good.  
  
Q. Greg, talk about the defensive effort. It was at a high level for you.
Talk about especially with certain people being not able to move well.  
GREG MONROE: Talking about our defense?  
  
Q. Your individual defense.  
GREG MONROE: It was trying to take away both their big men's strong hands.
That was one thing we as a team thought we could do coming into the game. Just
more or less about the scouting report; it wasn't anything special I was
doing.  
I just went with the information my coaches gave me and it was effective.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that 1-3-1 offense where you were getting the ball
down to the baseline. It was very effective.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Is that what it was?  
JASON CLARK: No.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: We just wanted to -- as I said the last answer and
the last question, they do a good job of knowing what you're going to do and
taking it away and giving you -- even though the zone looks the same, they
make adjustments that make it difficult to run anything consistently once they
see you're having some success with something, they take the next thing away.
I think our guys did a good job of being patient and trying to figure out, ok,
can we get it to the short corner? Can we get it to the middle of the zone? Do
we need to get it -- you have to get penetration against that zone. You can't
just swing it around the perimeter. Our guys did a good job of varying between
off the pass and off the dribble.  
  
Q. Chris, Coach said one of the keys is penetrating the zone. Can you talk
about where you were able to find those gaps today?  
JASON CLARK: Well, myself and Jason we just wanted to try to be aggressive on
the zone and try to get to the -- force the issue and try to get to the middle
of the paint, and we'd get wide open shots. As you see when we got the ball in
the middle, Jason hit a couple of threes and Austin hit a couple of lay-ups
and Greg was very effective in the high post. It was just a matter of us
trying to get the ball to the middle and trying to create off that.  
  
Q. Chris, to beat the No. 1 seed, No. 2 team in the country, a team that's
beaten you twice this year, what does it do for this team's confidence heading
into next week and this week?  
JASON CLARK: Next week seems like a long way away. We have to worry about
whoever we play tomorrow, whatever draw we get.  
It's definitely a confidence boost. I don't think this team lacks confidence.
I just think we're ready to play. And fatigue is not going to be an issue.
We're just going to be ready to play whoever we play tomorrow.  
  
Q. How did your offense expand or whatever when Arinze Onuaku went out with
about five minutes left? Were you able to do anything extra?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: No, I don't think we changed anything. They're just
as effective when Arinze is in there or not in there. I don't think we needed
to tweak or adjust anything. At the other end you had to change when they did
go with Jackson. They do different stuff at the offensive end when they go
smaller. So I think that was the biggest thing where we had to pay attention
and be aware of that, when they had one big in. They do totally different
things when they have one of those guys in as opposed to both of them.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Austin Freeman's game. He had four big foul shots at
the end. How is he doing with his medical condition and playing?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Last week -- I'm forgetting the time frame. The last
ten days or so they've been trying for Austin and his family. I said this
yesterday. Physically he's at a point where as long as we're monitoring and
he's monitoring his levels, he's fine. And I think we're fortunate because we
have specialists with us sitting right on the bench behind the bench at every
practice, every game. So you may have noticed even with the time-outs, they
are always monitoring him. As long as he keeps and we keep his levels fine, he
will be able to perform. So we're glad to have him back.  
We're glad to know what the issue is. And now it's a big adjustment. I said
this yesterday, a lot of people talk about what Austin and his family are
going through almost like it's a sprained ankle or something. "When is he
going to be back?" Or "when is he going to play? How is he going to play?"
This is something that's changed his life and will change his life. It's much
bigger and much more important than how is Austin doing and how does he feel
out on the court.  
  
Q. Are you surprised at the level he's playing at considering that?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: No.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of like with Austin being back, your team seems to have a new
pep in their step even though he might not be giving you the same things he
did before the diabetes. But are they feeding off of his return?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: To a certain extent. I guess we can say yes to that.
In many regards I don't think that anyone ever felt that Austin was gone. And
so I just think in general our team's health is at a much better place now
than it was two weeks ago. And so that's it.  
  
Q. Coach, despite the outcome today, do you expect Syracuse to be a
dangerous team in the tournament?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: A dangerous team? That's an understatement. That team
is still one of the best, if not the best, team in the country in spite
today's outcome.  
Do I expect them to be a dangerous team in the tournament? Absolutely.  
  
Q. For Jason: There had been games this season where you guys have not come
out as aggressively as with so much intensity. But today you know you guys
seemed to scrap and fight the whole game. Was there any different conversation
leading into this? Can you account for the mind-set at noon, the tempo you
guys brought to the court?  
JASON CLARK: I don't think there was anything different. We knew the games
that we didn't come out and play our best, we knew what happened. They weren't
such good turnouts. So we knew that we had to come out yesterday and today,
come out from the jump and be ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Georgetown, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2010

  

### [Da'Sean Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17188)

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

West Virginia  54  
Cincinnati - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: Kevin Jones, Da'Sean Butler and Coach Bob Huggins. Let's start
questions for the players.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, the plan at the end of the game was to take a 20-footer with a
hand in your face?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: No, honestly I was supposed to just catch the ball and get a
couple of dribbles inside the three-point line. When I got the ball, he kind
of pressed up on me. So I kind of lost my balance, and by the time I squared
up, I only had time to take one dribble instead of two or three. And when I
took the one dribble, I put it up. I felt good. I saw it hit the glass, I said
oh, it's fine. It fell right there. I said all right, it went in. Thank God.  
  
Q. You say when you saw it hit the glass --  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: When I saw it hit the glass, I felt more confident. I always
feel confident with my shots.  
When I saw it hit the glass where it did, it fell right there and it worked
out for me and the team.  
  
Q. You have had a lot of buzzer beaters this year it seems like. Where does
this one rank obviously being in the BIG EAST Tournament?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: This is number one. This is really good. Especially being
here, historic gym. A lot of great players play here. For me to get an
opportunity to come here and for my team to pick up the win and for me to
showcase what I can do and what my teammates can do, especially at the last
second, that was cool. I enjoyed it.  
  
Q. What were the problems with your guys' offense from the time when you
were up 18-4 to the time you tied the game? What went wrong there?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: We just was standing still a lot. We went zone. And when they
went man, we just didn't pass the ball. We got the ball early. Instead of
passing the ball and doing the things that got us the lead, we kind of strayed
away from that and were making two passes and taking quick shots.  
And they were going down and scoring. So we kind of strayed away from the
things we did to get that lead.  
  
Q. During the day the other top seeds had fallen. Did you guys look at that
and take that as maybe a little warning to start out strong?  
KEVIN JONES: Oh, yeah. We definitely saw that. We didn't want to end up like
them. That's why we came out, played hard, played the way we did. And we kind
of slacked off a little bit towards the end of the half. And I think that's
what almost got them back into the game. But Coach gave us one of those
spirited halftime speeches like he always does. We just got back out to doing
what we do, that's playing tough basketball.  
  
Q. Kevin, you had a tough time in the Tournament here last year. Today
obviously really turned that around. What was the difference between last year
and this year?  
KEVIN JONES: I mean, I couldn't worry about what happened last year. Today get
that out of my head and just worry about this year. And I know my team really
needed me to step up and play well. So I just tried to do that for them. I'm
glad I did. I'm glad we got the win.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, Da'Sean before the game winner, you had the push pass
right before the shot clock. Both of you guys standing and not quitting.  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Yeah, Coach Huggins was telling me to make sure I get the
ball, last-second kind of thing. And got it handed to me and Devin and set a
screen. I tried to split the screen. I lost the ball and fell on top of it. I
picked the ball up and Kevin's man happened to run towards me. I kind of
leaned over to the left and passed it to him. Thank God he caught it. It would
have probably went right out of bounds. And he scored.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, what was going through your mind at the end of the game when
Cincinnati hit the three to tie the game?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: It sucks. But, you know, you have to come back and just play.
A lot of teams against us obviously during the year, people just shoot
unbelievable percentages against us when we play them. I don't know why but
they just do. For some reason when he let it go, I had a feeling it was going
in. It went in. We have to go and play. We had enough time to make another
play at the other end. We had an opportunity towards the end of the game to
make shots and we just pulled through.  
Players make plays. He's a great player. Of course, you can't just bury
yourself and sulk and things like that. You have to keep playing through it.  
  
Q. Bob, you had three upsets today. You guys went down to the final seconds.
Is that attributable to the double bye? Did that have anything to do with
it?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I'm not a fan of the double bye. But I don't know that that
had that much to do with it. We played pretty well early. I think it was 19-3
or something like that. And we had four transition opportunities and didn't
score on any of them. That kills you. I thought we had a chance to kind of
break their back. And we kind of let them up. Then in transition we didn't
find Deonta. Any time we don't find him, he makes shots. And we kind of got
him going a little bit. Then we shot the ball so miserably the rest of the
way.  
  
Q. Coach, how have you seen Kevin improve this year and what he is like to
coach?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I used to say KJ does all the right things. He's never
late. He shows great enthusiasm. The other day he slept in and missed the
start of practice. I'm not saying that about him anymore.  
No, he's a great kid. He came in I think at 215 pounds. He started the year
somewhere between 245 and 250. It's made all the difference in his play. He's
undersized in there, and we understand that. But he does it great. He works at
it. You don't ever have to worry about Kevin giving you effort.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, the turnover with Dixon, were you in that one as well?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: Yeah, that was me. But he kind of, he was in a spot, ended up
catching the ball. I didn't want to foul him.  
So I just let him go so he can catch it. I was thinking he was going to keep
going. He kind of hesitated so I got in front of him. And he went to do
something with the ball. I don't know what he was trying to do. I tapped it
and I tapped it right back into his hands and it went out of bounds. I'm
grateful Burr saw that one. I thought it was going to go back to them.  
  
Q. Bob, I assume you've seen what Notre Dame has been doing the last few
games.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: No, what's been going on?  
  
Q. Their new style, can you comment on it.  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I think Mike has done a heck of a job. When you lose a guy
like Luke, who has been one of the best players in the history of this great
league, that's been full of great players, and all you do is turn around and
get your guys rallied and get them going again, I think Mike has done an
unbelievable job. And they're not very deep. So they shorten the game. It's
smart. He's got a bunch of guys that can make shots.  
And I think Tory Jackson has been as good a player as there is in the league
the last whatever it's been. Five or six games. He creates so much for other
people.  
  
Q. Da'Sean, can you talk about the importance of being able to win close
games this time of the year?  
DA'SEAN BUTLER: It just prepares us for when we get to play -- not to say this
team isn't a really good team. We get in the Tournament and we're used to
playing these kind of games. It's not a surprise for us to be up one or down
one or whatever the case may be. And either finishing the game or willing our
way back from whatever the case is. Something we've been doing all year. So
for us to go to the Tournament and play in a hectic environment or whatever
environment we're in, down or up, you know, we're used to it. We play with all
kinds of leagues. We've been down a ton of points.  
  
Q. Bob, I just want to you comment on the style of the game. Pretty even
rebounding, a lot of defense. I guess that's what you expected coming here the
way these two teams play?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: I thought we would make more shots than we did, honestly.
But yeah, they do a great job. They change defenses and they really packed it
in the lane and didn't give us anything easy. We struggled to make shots. Then
when you struggle to make shots on the perimeter, and they pack it back in,
it's hard to score. I think we were 3 for 19 or something like that before he
made his last shot. Of course I think he missed about 12 of those. He's not
even paying attention.  
  
Q. Kevin, how much more comfortable do you feel going into this March as
opposed to last March? What do you think has been the difference for you this
year?  
KEVIN JONES: I mean, I was a freshman last year. Didn't really know what was
going on. I was kind of nervous playing out here. But now that I'm a
sophomore, I have that experience. I feel more comfortable. Like Coach was
talking about, I gained a lot of weight this past summer and I've been working
hard on my game. I think that's the most important part to my success right
now.  
  
Q. Coach, it seemed like the freshman Stephenson was trying to impose his
will on the game in the last five minutes. Were you guys doing anything
strategy to try to stop that?  
COACH BOB HUGGINS: Whatever it was, it wasn't very good, was it? No, we've
kind of relied on Devin to guard most people. And, you know, he made a big
shot. He hasn't made threes all year. And he hasn't been really a great free-
throw shooter all year. But I think that's the mark of a guy who is going to
be, if he's not already, a great player because he makes plays when he has to
make plays. We went 1-3-1 really to stop their penetration and didn't do a
very good job of that. We tried to put John back there because before they
tried to throw the ball over the top of us.  
I don't know what else we could have done. I don't know, we could have maybe
triangle and two with the way the game is going, that's hard to do. We ended
up with those bigs inside. We're just so small. It's hard for us whenever we
play somebody that has the size that they have.  
THE MODERATOR: West Virginia, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Notre Dame  50  
Pittsburgh - 45

  
THE MODERATOR: Luke Harangody, Tory Jackson, Tyrone Nash, and here's Coach
Mike Brey.  
COACH MIKE BREY: I thought we really defended the last seven minutes to win
the game, because they defended us. We couldn't get much offensively, so it
was going to be us defensively to win. And I thought we were fabulous on that
end of the floor.  
You know, for Luke to bounce back after traveling when we go to him in a big
possession and come back and make the two free throws, just kind of tells you
the kind of guy he is.  
But, again, we got the tempo we wanted, 50-45. That's what we want.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Mike, I know it's similar to the five games you won before. What did you
learn about your team tonight in this type of atmosphere bouncing back after
last night?  
COACH MIKE BREY: I think it started in Milwaukee, because that's where our
poise was really tested and our mental toughness. We were down twice there,
you know, and then last night against Seton Hall. I think it really developed
in Milwaukee in a tough atmosphere to fight out of a hole and believe you
could get it done.  
  
Q. Ty, those last couple of defensive sequences when you have two jump ball
in there, can you walk us through the mentality you guys had going into that
possession, the two stops?  
TYRONE NASH: Just get a stop. If we get two stops we win the game. That's what
we're usually concentrating on. We focused in, we got in the huddle said,
"Let's get the stop and get this win."  
Q. Midway through the season after a couple of close losses, the real key is
just that one defensive stop you need. Why have you been able to get those
defensive stops in the last six games?  
COACH MIKE BREY: We probably have more energy to play because we don't have to
guard as many possessions throughout the game. And we're confident because
we're getting stops in a shorter number of possessions, you know. I think
there's a commitment, too, maybe a renewed commitment. Our interior defense
and ball-screen defense has been the most consistent since I've been here. I
guess when your life is on the line, you know, you're really good at it.  
  
Q. Tory, do you like the new style of play for Notre Dame? And if so, what
about it?  
TORY JACKSON: Yeah, I love it. I love it. It calms us down. It calms us down.
It slows the game down. It gives guys great shots, open shots. A lot of teams
don't want to guard for the whole 30, 35 seconds. So it kind of wears them
down. And if you are knocking shot after shot down like that, some teams will
lay down.  
  
Q. Do you find that when the opposing team finally does get the ball, that
maybe they shoot too quick?  
TORY JACKSON: Yeah. Yeah. Sometimes they come down and rush it, 10, 15
seconds. Then they have to get back and guard again. If they miss, it makes it
more aggravating and more frustrating for them.  
  
Q. Luke, I have a question for you: In the beginning of the year you talked
about the NCAA Tournament was the major goal. This one solidifies that. Talk
about closing your career with that possibility.  
LUKE HARANGODY: This run we made at the end of the season, it was pretty
special. These guys have played great without me. Now to make a run in the BIG
EAST Tournament is great as well. We're just looking forward to playing as
well tomorrow and having the momentum we had tonight.  
  
Q. How is your knee holding up?  
LUKE HARANGODY: It's holding up good. I was curious to see how two games in a
row would go with my conditioning. I'm still not there yet. But I think every
day it's getting a little better.  
  
Q. Coach Brey, talk about the parity of this conference. The lower seeds
have won all the games.  
COACH MIKE BREY: So much for the double byes, huh? I do think there's some
advantage to being able to play a little bit. I thought Seton Hall had an
advantage. They were in a rhythm last night. It took us a while to get going.
We certainly were in a rhythm early and it helped us. But I think it's
symbolic.  
How about our league, we had Georgetown, Syracuse was a one versus eight in
our league today. I looked at the numbers. It just blew my mind.  
The other thing about, you know, you mentioned Luke, it made me think about
the seniors. With the win tonight they become the all-time winningest class in
the history of our program. Couldn't think of more deserving guys like those
two and the two other guys (Tim Andree and Jonathan Peoples) in the locker
room.  
  
Q. Talk about your thought process where you had to travel and then you have
to come back and hit those two free throws at the end of the game. A situation
you've been in before this season.  
LUKE HARANGODY: Obviously when I get that turnover I'm very upset. The team
puts the ball in my hands in the game. I need to produce in that moment. It
was just one of those things, you know, where it happens. And you have to go
on to the next play. I didn't put my head down. I said, I'm going to make this
up to my team. We got the defensive stop, I got the rebound and said we have
to knock these down and make up for it, and I did.  
  
Q. Mike, as far as the new style of play goes, I mean, you had gone with the
other style for some time. Do you enjoy coaching this style better?  
COACH MIKE BREY: When you're winning, I love it. Really. Absolutely. I do
enjoy it. I have evolved into it. I think I enjoy it because we have such high
basketball IQ guys and we play it well. The guys we play can all pass and
catch. So it's really beautiful to watch them figure it out at the end of a
clock.  
But certainly, as I've mentioned last night, you do what you need to do to win
in this league. This league is about surviving. You know, when we added those
teams, you just are trying to survive. It's an adjustment we felt we had to
make. Next year I don't know, step back and watch practice for a week before
we make any decisions.  
THE MODERATOR: Notre Dame, thank you.

## March 11, 2010

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Scoop Jardine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20613)

### [Andy Rautins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19502)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Georgetown - 91  
Syracuse - 84

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Jim Boeheim, Scoop Jardine and Andy Rautins.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Yeah, I thought that Georgetown really played well tonight.
The first game we controlled the game. The second game we controlled about 30
minutes. And then they started to get the ball into Monroe and they did that
tonight from the beginning we had difficulty with it. We just couldn't get
enough stops. And I think we made some bad turnovers throughout the course of
the game. But I told the players I think Georgetown is capable of beating
anybody any night. They've proven that this year.  
I thought they played extremely well. I thought we played well on offense. We
just didn't get any stops defensively when we needed to. I thought we battled
as hard as we could and it just wasn't our day.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Jim, what do you know at this point on Arinze?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: He has a strain. We don't know for sure if it's any more
than that. We'll find out Monday. We'll try to find out tomorrow when we get
home and get an MRI tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jim, how does him being out of the lineup really change your team?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: Well, he's a key part of our team. I mean, he's had a great
year. And he's a tremendous player. We hope that he'll be fine. We don't know.  
  
Q. The turnovers, especially in the first half, was it sometimes from
overpassing?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: No. Post people did not have good games. We had ten
turnovers in the post. We haven't done that really all year. That was part of
it, but it was more I think on the defensive end. We didn't get some stops
that we needed to.  
But again, Georgetown attacks zones very well. Teams in our league at this
stage of the year know how to attack us. We're looking forward to get out and
play somebody that hasn't seen us.  
  
Q. Jim, when Georgetown is trying to attack that zone, how important is
Monroe and what he's able to do in the middle?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: He's the best inside passer in college basketball easily.
And he can score in there. I thought overall we didn't do a bad job with him.
I think Chris Wright had a big night. He really had a great game. I thought
when he plays like that, that's when they beat people.  
  
Q. For Andy and Scoop, Wes (Johnson) really had another great game.
Something we haven't really seen from him since he got hurt. How much easier
is it playing with a guy who is able to let you guys take some of that
pressure off?  
SCOOP JARDINE: It's an honor to play with a guy like Wes, and his capabilities
that he brings to our team. But I think Wes was playing good for us all year
even when he was hurt. So tonight he just showed what he can do offensively.
He's been playing good defensively and offensively all year.  
  
Q. Is it easier though to play when you guys don't have to take as many
shots and you've got a guy who can go out and put up 25?  
SCOOP JARDINE: Yeah, it's a lot easier. I think I have to do a better job of
getting him the ball more when he's hot like that.  
  
Q. Andy, can you talk about what you saw against you defensively between the
first and second half?  
ANDY RAUTINS: I mean they penetrated the gaps in the second half. They did a
good job of finding Monroe. Like Coach said, he's one of the best inside
passers in college basketball. So he's dangerous whenever he gets a lot of
post touches. I don't think we did a good job of keeping them out. They did a
good job of spreading us out in the second half, too.  
Like I said, Georgetown is a great team. Just going to have to pick our heads
up and move forward from here.  
  
Q. For each of the players, and your opinions may be different, but do you
prefer having games closer together in terms of number of days apart?  
ANDY RAUTINS: I mean I don't think it matters to us. I think we're a focused
team. We just want to focus on the next game. That's what our motto has been
all season. Regardless of if we have games back to back or a week apart. If
not, we have great practices in between. Our team is excellent at focusing and
going hard in practice. And we're also good at playing back-to-back games. I
don't think we have any preference. We just come to play.  
SCOOP JARDINE: Same thing.  
  
Q. For all three, please: Does this outcome do anything to diminish your
optimism into the Tournament?  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: No, not at all.  
SCOOP JARDINE: No.

## March 10, 2010

  

### [John Thompson III](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13688)

### [Chris Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19364)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Georgetown - 69  
SFU - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Jason Clark, we have Greg Monroe, we have Chris Wright
and Coach Thompson. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Coach, you have had your ups and downs this season. Where do you think
you are at this point?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I think we're at a good place right now. Our team is
healthy right now. I think that the guys are extremely focused right now. And
so mentally and physically and emotionally I like where we are right now.  
  
Q. What do you think is the difference between and playing at your place and
(inaudible).  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I'm not sure about that, comparing and contrasting
the two games. I think what we did today, they made a run. They have very good
players and are well coached. We aren't going to run and hide from them. I
think we did a very good job of executing the offensive end and getting shots
and making key shots. Jason and Chris made big shots when we needed shots. And
then our defense got better as the second half went on. It took us a while, it
took us longer than it normally does to figure out the rhythm of their offense
and what we needed to do. But I think our guys eventually figured it out. Our
defense got better.  
But they put you in such difficult situations. You go into it and someone was
asking me about stopping the points in the paint. That's what they do. That's
what they try to do. They have very good players. They set those screens, and
(Dominique) Jones and Chris Howard I think is one of the more under-heralded
players in our league just for how he runs that team, make sure they get the
shots they should get.  
  
Q. Coach, can you speak to the importance of Jason Clark's contributions
today, especially his three-point shooting.  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Everyone's contribution is key. And Jason made some
shots today; that's not abnormal. He's a very good shooter. I think our guys
did a good job of finding him the ball and took the right shots. But I think
our guys did a good job of helping each other do that.  
  
Q. Coach, was there an aspect of your team's play that you were particularly
pleased with more so than others? Anything stand out?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I just think our focus, I thought, especially in the
second half, especially -- you know, they made a run. They made a run. It
feels like -- I don't know what the numbers were, but it feels like the first
ten possessions of the second half we got fouls called against us. And it's
easy to get frustrated at that point. But I thought our guys did a good job of
weathering the storm and understanding that it's tournament basketball, may be
called differently. We didn't get frustrated when they made a run.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Chris's performance today? Was he any more aggressive
on the offense?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I don't think so. Maybe he was. But I thought he made
the right reads, most importantly. All of our guys can be aggressive. He made
some big baskets, particularly in the first half when we needed baskets. And
the second half, also. His aggressiveness is fine. It's just I think our guys
made the right decisions most of the time.  
  
Q. This is for John and Chris: It seems when you guys play well
(inaudible).  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I think he's one of our key guys. I think that -- by
definition I think most people equate scoring points with playing well. And
that I guess we won when Chris has scored points. I means so much more to this
team because he has the responsibility or burden, however you want to look at
it, of running the team, of running the game. Of managing the game. He is a
scorer. Just so the understanding of when he shot today or he has to get Jason
or Austin the shot, it's a responsibility he has and he has done very well
this year.  
CHRIS WRIGHT: We won when I haven't scored and we won when I have scored. It's
a matter of understanding the flow of the game. Sometimes they are on the side
or (inaudible).  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: Henry gave us good minutes. Jerrelle gave us good
minutes. Hollis and Vee, also. Everyone has likes to talk about our minutes.
I've said many times, these guys along with Freeman, we had a discussion the
first day of school, and they knew they were going to have to play defense to
produce. Physically they are ready for that. That being said, we are and I am
and the team is much more comfortable at this point as we should be than we
were earlier in the year. Henry came in and gave us great minutes. Jerrelle
came in and gave us great minutes. We were proud of it. That's where the team
is.  
They know what they're supposed to do. They know their responsibility. They
came in and stepped up and played well when they were supposed to. It was
good.  
  
Q. Coach, I wasn't here at the very first question, so I'm sorry if it was
asked, could you speak a little bit looking forward to the challenge of a
third meeting against Syracuse and what your team is going to have to do
differently or better for a different outcome?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I said this to the TV walking off the court, they
asked me the same question out there. We have to make shots and guard our
guys. You know, let's not make it -- they are a good team. They can hurt you
in many different ways. They have a terrific defense. And so we just have to
come out and execute at both ends of the floor. They put a lot of pressure on
you, not literally pressing pressure, but they put pressure on because they
don't allow to you get good shots and they find a way for them to get a good
shot. And so you cannot be careless against them because they make you pay.
You can't have an excessive amount of turnovers against them because they make
you pay. It's a group effort guarding them because they're so talented.
They've done a very good job this year of what I thought we did a decent job
of this game. Getting the shot to the person who should take the shot when
that person should take the shot. So we have to be better both ends of the
court.  
  
Q. Just can you talk about your approach on guarding Jones today? He had
such a big game against you the last time. Did you guys change some things
today?  
COACH JOHN THOMPSON III: I just yelled at these guys and said, "guard them."  
No, there's not much that you can shift or change against him. He's very good
in not forcing anything. For someone who scores as much as he did this year,
he doesn't force. Very few possessions you can look at and say Dominique Jones
that was a bad shot. That was a forced shot. That's a function, as I said
earlier, Chris Howard does a very good job of getting the ball.  
They do a good job of setting screens and putting him in positions where he
has the edge and has the advantage on you. I think we just went into it with
more focus as a group effort mentality. If you look at the stat sheet, he gets
his points. He gets to the line so much. And so we wanted him to make tough,
difficult shots, which he did. Which he has been doing all year.  
And I think the key was to try to take away -- the first time that we played
them, he got his, as he has all year. Their ancillary people, a guy averaging
4 points, he got 8 points. A guy who averages 2 points got 5 points that game.
We wanted to see if we could do a good job -- Dominique is going to get his.
You can't stop him. But if you ca somehow limit the numbers other people got.
That's what we wanted to focus on in this afternoon's game. Today's game.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Georgetown, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2010

  

### [Rick Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13748)

### [Edgar Sosa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20611)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Cincinnati  69  
Louisville - 66

  
COACH RICK PITINO: Well, Cincinnati deserves a lot of credit because we got
them to take lot of difficult shots, but they kept getting put-backs and they
won the game on offensive rebounding and they just really took us to the wood
shed on the backboard. It's been a little bit of a weakness for us all year
and it showed against that basketball team. That was our number one focus was
to get on the backboard.  
Give them credit. We didn't get the job done.  
  
Q. Rick, despite that you had nine- or ten-point lead, what changed then?  
COACH RICK PITINO: I thought we forced things the first two minutes of the
second half. Went one-on-three, one-on-four. They ran a couple of guys out.
They ran Gates out. When you take bad shots, that's the easiest way to get a
run out. I thought we lost the game in the first five minutes of the second
half.  
  
Q. Coach, coming to this game what was the mentality? Did you feel like it
was a game you had to win?  
COACH RICK PITINO: We know we're in the Tournament. We won 11 BIG EAST games
and we beat the No. 1 ranked team in the country. That has nothing to do with
not rebounding the basketball.  
We were playing for a good seed. Now we're not going to get one. So you can't
expect to win giving up 28 offensive rebounds.  
  
Q. Coach, this overall effort does it have to be addressed when you get into
the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH RICK PITINO: The effort was good. We're just physically not a strong
team. They're a physically strong team. The effort was good. The guys tried
hard. They were just more physical and bigger inside. We weren't big and
physical enough.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the last possession? Vaughn says he was fouling you
all the way up the court. The game plan was to foul you midcourt.  
EDGAR SOSA: I didn't feel like he was fouling me. Coach drew up a play for me
to come off the screen and find some of the guys in the corner. I did a bad
job. I took too much time off the clock. By the time I got across, there was
two seconds left. I couldn't find anyone.  
  
Q. Coach, how much do you think at all not having Jerry (Smith) affected
maybe the scoring-wise and --  
COACH RICK PITINO: It affected us, but injuries are part of the game. We were
playing very good basketball. Preston had a bad night. And obviously having
Jerry would alleviate that -- Preston is not used to playing that many
minutes. He plays really hard and he's not conditioned to play a lot of
minutes like that. So we didn't get a good night out of him. But that's part
of the game.  
Injuries are part of the game. Notre Dame played without Harangody for a long
time and did a good job. Our guys have basically done a good job all season
long. They have had their bumps in the road. The point of emphasis tonight was
rebound the basketball. We rebound, we win. We knew that. We didn't, we lost.
We go home early. Waste a lot of boosters' money. Thanks.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S

## March 10, 2010

  

### [Paris Horne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19413)

### [D.J. Kennedy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19412)

### [Norm Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16973)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Marquette  57  
St. John's - 55

  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: I thought it was a really good really good BIG EAST
basketball game. Obviously we played two really good games against Marquette.
Give them a lot of credit. They had to make some really big shots and tough
shots at the end. I thought my guys played unbelievably hard and focused. We
didn't shoot the ball well in the first half. But really came back in the
second half and played together and did some really good things.  
  
Q. Do you feel like it was tough in the first half as the way they packed it
in and made it from the perimeter? What were the changes at halftime?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: We just talked about they made the extra pass, make one
more pass. They do a great job of rotating in the first half and let the ball
stick in our hands a little bit. Those things I thought our guys did a great
job making the extra pass in the second half and finishing plays. We had some
plays, too, in the first half and shots we hadn't been making and we didn't
make it. The good thing is we stuck with our defense and kept playing.  
  
Q. Can you describe that final possession? Of the game? What was going
through your mind at that point?  
D.J. KENNEDY: I mean, I felt like I mean I don't have -- I do not feel like it
was enough time for me to get a good shot. When it left my hands, it was
short. The possession before that I felt like when I had the opportunity to
make a play for the team, I just -- plays I usually make I just wasn't able to
get an opportunity to make a play for my team.  
It was great defense by Hayward. I felt like I had an opportunity to make
another play and I just didn't come through.  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
D.J. KENNEDY: I felt like they did a great job of sagging in. It was great
help defense. It prevented the drive. It was down two, I really just wanted to
get in the lane. But I wasn't able to get in the lane. They did a great job of
reaching in and able to get a jump ball. So it was a great job. Great job as
far as them as a team.  
  
Q. When Brownlee got the two dunks in a row and it was 46-42 and you made
that comeback, did you feel like you had control of the game at that point?  
PARIS HORNE: No. It's a game of runs. We knew they were going to make their
run. We just were about trying to get stops. That's all.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you tell the guys during halftime?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: Just that we went into the halftime saying we shot the
ball really poorly. We could be down by a lot more. I thought we finished the
half good on a defensive note and get some stops. I said we're fine, we have
to come out in the second half and focus defensively and then move the ball
and make the extra pass and get in the lane, and thought we did a better job
of that in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else, please? Coach, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2010

  

### [Stan Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13792)

### [Chris Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20590)

### [Dominique Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19392)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Georgetown - 69  
SFU - 49

  
COACH STAN HEATH: Congratulations to Georgetown. I don't think we played as
well as we could have today. We really struggled to find a shot. That happened
yesterday. I thought today it really caught up to us. We couldn't hit a
perimeter jumpshot. Sometimes when that happens, you're not able to make shots
and it affects your defense. And they were getting some of those back-door
cuts they're so good at against us as well.  
A very difficult team to play against, I think, with one day of preparation,
one walk-through. Plus they play such a unique style. So I think they're going
to have success in these kinds of formats.  
But I'm real proud of our team. We never gave up. We kept fighting. We
struggled making shots, but we tried to do anything we could to give ourselves
a chance. We just couldn't get it done today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. The outside shooting, do you know what the problem is? Did you get to a
point where you stopped taking threes?  
COACH STAN HEATH: I think there was. I saw several times I thought we had 15,
17-footers and even threes we should have taken. We passed those things up to
try to get a little bit closer. When we get in there this time, you look at
Greg and Monroe and Vaughn and some of those long, big guys, it affects your
shot. Look at a guy like (Mike) Mercer. Knocks down those shots at a pretty
high rate. Today he had a real difficult time finishing around the basket.  
  
Q. The shots weren't falling, at the 16:00 mark, you were down by six or
seven, what did they do to pull away?  
COACH STAN HEATH: I thought we were in great shape. Greg Monroe picked up his
third or fourth foul. He was going to the bench and they were going to bring
in some other guys. I really felt that was a pivotal time we could make a run.
And really put the pressure on them. And I don't think there was anything
necessarily they did. We just could not make a shot. Where they made a couple
of threes, I thought Clark picked things up for them. I thought Wright really
picked up as well when Monroe left the game. And we weren't able to stop them
or keep pace offensively against them.  
  
Q. Coach, your team came out so impressively in the second half. Two
immediate blocks and I think there were three dunks. Was there an essential
message you gave them at halftime? What happened behind closed doors, and your
feeling when you cut it to six a couple of times?  
COACH STAN HEATH: I really didn't think we were the aggressive team in the
first half at all. I didn't think we took the fight to Georgetown. We just
talked at halftime and really kind of looked ourselves in the mirror and
realized if we're going to give ourselves a chance, we had to come out more
aggressive. And I thought Toarlyn Fitzpatrick, the freshmen made great plays
in the first half. I thought those momentum plays helped us. We got great
penetration from our guards who were looking inside. Our big guys started to
finish. I can't count to you how many lay-ups and free-throws that were
missed. In a game like this against a team like Georgetown, you have to
complete those plays. We weren't able to do it consistently. But for that
small amount of time you just mentioned, we did.  
  
Q. Chris, I know you guys obviously wanted to stay here longer. Just what's
does this do to your postseason outlook?  
CHRIS HOWARD: We have to wait to Sunday. I don't know. We really don't know
what's going to happen. We know we're going to have more games to play.
Regardless of what happens. I'm proud of my teammates, coaches. This year has
been good to me, to finish as a senior. Just to stay positive and remember
there's more basketball to be played.  
  
Q. When you guys made that run of four straight a month ago, you set the bar
pretty high in terms of talking about NCAA. Is it hard to appreciate just
going to the postseason now?  
DOMINIQUE JONES: Yeah, because I feel like we're determined what we were going
to do. I think we gave up some games we should have won. And I think that
makes a difference right here. Me setting the bar that high, you know that's
the way it should be set at. If you want to be big-time players and have a
big-time program, that's the way it should be set at. We just got to keep our
heads high, you know and just go out and play with pride wherever we play at.  
  
Q. From a player's perspective, when a team goes cold from the outside like
that, how frustrating is that?  
CHRIS HOWARD: It's really frustrating. A lot of shots were there for me, Mike.
Sometimes you shy away from taking shots like that. They put a lot of pressure
on Dominique to try to create for us by himself. So guys coming back next
year, they'll learn from this. It's a learning experience. Get in the gym.
Understand the shots are going to be here. Playing with a guy like Dominique
all the attention is on him.  
It helped in a way for the guys to learn, the guys who are returning.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you compare how Georgetown defended you the previous time
you played them and then tonight, this afternoon? What was different? What was
tougher?  
CHRIS HOWARD: I don't think it was different. I don't think it was tougher. I
just feel like we had open shots and we missed them. I missed them. Everybody
else taking open shots missed them. You can't beat a Top 25 team and a BIG
EAST team without hitting shots. We know that. You know, they just weren't
falling. It's hard to beat teams like that when you're not hitting shots from
the outside.  
THE MODERATOR: USF, thank you.

### [Eugene Harvey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20606)

### [Herb Pope](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20581)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Notre Dame  68  
Seton Hall - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Bobby Gonzalez, Jeremy Hazell, Eugene Harvey and Herb
Pope.  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Start with an opening statement. Just first and
foremost, we give Notre Dame credit. Mike Brey is a class guy that had a good
job with his team. And again not an excuse. Certainly, but I thought this was
the most tired I've seen our team the entire year. We just didn't have our
legs. It shows how important the bye is and how important the regular season
is.  
It's the second year in a row now that we've played South Florida last year
and beat them, then played Syracuse in the second round. We hung with them for
about 32 minutes and then we kind of died. And I thought well, we only had six
players. Maybe next year -- I thought this year would be different. But what
really hurt us, too, was this was our fourth game in six days. We played at
Rutgers, then at Providence, then Providence again and then tonight. When you
see things like 2 for 16 from three, we struggled to get into the 50s. I'm not
knocking Notre Dame's defense. It's different than Providence's defense. But
for us to score 106 last night and come back tonight and barely struggle to
get 56, you know, it took Jamel Jackson banking in a three-pointer and Jordan
Theodore to laying in at the buzzer to 56 points.  
We just plain and simple couldn't make a shot, had no legs and we were beat
up. Notre Dame was fresh. They took advantage of that. Jeremy's back cramped
up a little bit. We had a lot of guys banged up. Keon's knee. Herb got in
early foul trouble. We had nobody score more than 15 points. Too many guys not
play well on the same day. Jordan Theodore was basically 0 for 9. He had 18 at
Rutgers, 19 at Providence, 21 last night. And he had -- he was 1 for 9. But
the shot he made was the lay-up at the buzzer when they moved out of the way.  
So we just had too many guys not play well. And you're not going to beat a
team like Notre Dame in a situation like that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. When Mike was in the here, he told everybody to take a deep breath, keep
Seton Hall on the board for the NCAA Tournament. What's your reaction to
that?  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Well, I couldn't agree with him more. I know that -- for
some reason, there's all these gurus and experts that listen to what everybody
else says. And they say well, if Notre Dame wins, they're in. If Seton Hall
wins, they're in. But if Notre Dame doesn't win, then they're still in anyway.
If Seton Hall wins, they're out. Coming into this game tonight, our RPI was
higher than Notre Dame. Our strength of schedule was higher than Notre Dame.
We both have three wins against the top 50. And we beat them head to head. So
I'm not quite sure where they got that from on the resume and who they thought
had a better profile. We had no bad losses. And people thought they had three
bad losses. Now they had 21 wins; we had 19 wins. But we played a tougher
schedule. So this is not about us and Notre Dame. This is about the BIG EAST.
So should we get nine teams in? Ten teams? Should we get more than eight? If
teams go out and win their conferences and all of a sudden there's a bunch of
at-large bids out there, we had no bad losses in 31 games. There's no doubt we
can beat somebody if we go to the NCAA Tournament. No doubt. And especially
with some rest.  
So, you know, I think we should be on the board. I think all this talk about
the bubble has burst and now we're out and we're done and we lost and that's
it and it's over, I don't think people know what they're talking about. I
don't think they have a clue. I think they listen to what everybody else says
and they repeat what they hear.  
  
Q. When you talked to your players before a game like this, do you tell them
to block it all out? Or could you put it all on yourself and involve the
discussion around?  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Well, we basically said the more you win, the more you
have -- the more you keep your destiny in your own hands. So certainly we
talked about how big the game was. But we didn't make it life and death, like
if we lose the season is over, because it's not over. We're going to play in
some postseason. The question is which one, which tournament? Hopefully we
still have a shot to be in the Big Dance. If you watched us this year, there's
plenty of people that saw us that think we're an NCAA team.  
  
Q. Bobby, no matter what tournament you're in, postseason tournament, you
now have time for your walking wounded pretty much to heal, obviously.  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Definitely. These guys need some time. Jeremy with his
back, Keon with his knee, Herb, everybody. We need a couple of days to
regroup. It was grueling down the stretch for us. Sometimes you go through a
little injury thing. We kind of avoided it the whole year. And it kind of --
nothing major, but everything sort of came at the end. Little nicks and knacks
all came at the end.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can sort of speak to, you had Herb out after he had his
second foul. Then you brought him back in I think with under 5:00 left and he
picks up the third. Why bring him back in at that point?  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Well, basically the game was getting away from us. We
had to. I felt if I hadn't put him in, we might be down 15 at the half and we
may not be in the game. We couldn't get a rebound. They had nine rebounds.
When I put Herb back in, it was basically to try to save us from going under
water. I told him not to get a third. He plays so hard. He's so aggressive. He
maybe got an incidental foul that maybe didn't have to be called.  
  
Q. You guys like to play up tempo as everybody knows. How frustrating is it
when a team slows it to crawl?  
EUGENE HARVEY: It's pretty frustrating. But then again, like we're a team and
we have to play the game like that like we did in Pitt. We played together and
we got the win. So that made it difficult on me because Bobby, he's a run-and-
gun coach. That's our style of play. But Notre Dame they came out and they
defended, they locked it down, they made the tough plays and they got the win.  
  
Q. Herb, when you picked up that third foul with how well Harangody was
playing, did you feel it sort of hampered your ability to play defense on him
in the second half?  
HERB POPE: No. Coach kind of told me not to go out there and get a foul. I
kind of thought the ball was a loose ball. I wasn't sure that he secured it.
That was just a bad judgment call. I have to learn and grow from it as a young
player.  
And Harangody obviously was killing us from early on in the game. I was just
trying to slow him down as much as I could when I came back in without getting
a fourth foul.  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Let me say something about Herb Pope: I'm really proud
of this guy. This guy was just magnificent down the stretch. 14 points, 9
rebounds. With the foul trouble, he only played 29 minutes. One of the
difficult things coming into this game, Luke Harangody played five minutes
against Marquette, you don't know how healthy he is. They've won four in a
row. Everybody is saying they're not going to switch it up too much. Because
they don't want to mess up their chemistry because they're playing really
good. We beat them the first time with him. Now we're going to play the second
time without him. We don't know where he is at health-wise. We know he had
four days off. He comes in and 15 points and 9 rebounds in the first half. It
was a difficult thing to prepare for.  
So again I thought Herb and Jeff and these guys adjusted on the fly very, very
well. I thought for to us win tonight, we needed to be clicking on all
cylinders. We needed Jeremy Hazell and all our guns to be rolling.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Seton Hall, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Lazar Hayward](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18122)

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Marquette  57  
St. John's - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for the players, please?  
  
Q. What's the difference between the first half and the second half for you
guys?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I think just in the second half we got a little too stagnant
and a little too passive. We weren't really aggressive like we were in the
first half. And we definitely have to do a better job of attacking when we
have leads instead of being passive.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you guys for the first time in a while you guys got a
little bit down during that stretch. Do you agree with that?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I don't think so. I think we handled it a pretty good. We have
to stop digging those holes for ourselves and we have to go and play defense
the entire game like we did in the first half.  
  
Q. Lazar, you guys probably played as many close games as anybody in the
country. You've been in a bunch of close ones. Do you think all that
experience of close games will help you guys?  
LAZAR HAYWARD: I hope so. We're starting to learn how to play in close games.
We definitely understand that the value of our possessions are very, very
vital for us. And hopefully that will transpire into the NCAA Tournament. .  
  
Q. Can you talk about your shot?  
DAVID CUBILLAN: I ran the play, it was supposed to be Lazar, but they cheated
the play and I was wide open. And I just shot it. Made it.  
  
Q. You have three seniors on a stage like this, BIG EAST Tournament. Talk
about their play.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I just assume they answer all the questions, they're
going to say the exact same things I would say and probably say it with better
words than I would use. Regardless of locale and no disrespect to the BIG
EAST, I'd played with these guys in the street anywhere in the country, and I
hope it will last as long as it can last. Whether it's a one-possession game
or a ten-possession game, I absolutely love who these guys are as human
beings. I think we'll get good players at Marquette. I don't mean that in any
egotistical way. I think we'll get good players but I don't know that we'll
get as good a person as each of these young men are, coupled with who they are
as players.  
I was just telling Buycks in the locker room. I think Buycks is a really good
player. The problem I have is I trust Cuby like I trust my wife. I want him
out on the court. Not so he can make a big three, but I know if he can make a
big three, he will make a big three.  
I thought Mo was unbelievable. Maybe as good as he's been in a long time for
consecutive minutes in the first half. And again, like always, comes down to
the very end. Lazar makes a great play on one end, makes an unbelievable
rebound on the other end. Our team expects that of him. The whole thing is our
team expects the same from each person because we all know what each person
can do. And how I coach and how these guys lead were transparent in that.
There's no secrets. I'm telling you the same thing I would tell those guys.
They're telling you the same thing they would tell me. And I think that's what
makes it so special. That's what makes it so unique.  
  
Q. Coach talk about how big it was to get through that first half with
(inaudible) --  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: It was terrible. It was awful. It didn't contribute
anything to the win today. I think that DJO is a guy on our team that can go
get a basket. I think he's probably grown more as a player than anybody else
on our team. But Mo, everybody knows what Mo is going to do. When he turns it
over, everybody is shocked. You know, he played 18 BIG EAST games and he had
17 turnovers. And he and Malik Boothe and No. 31 (Malik) Stith, those are the
three littlest guys in the league. Mo turned it over less than one time a
game. When he turns it over, everybody is shocked. Cuby is going to play his
guts out every possession. Everybody knows what Lazar is going to do. When he
makes these, he looks better than he really is.  
Our team has begun to rely on Jimmy (Butler). It's not just on offense; it's
on defense. I think Jimmy is our smartest player. He comprehends things really
well. And he does a great job of communicating what every player on our team
-- what's up-coming. And we missed that communication just as much as we miss
his presence on the floor. And I didn't think we were any good at all in the
second half. I don't know how many offensive rebounds they had in the second
half, but if it was based only on the second half, they deserved to win the
game. Just so happened at the end we were able to make two big plays on both
ends. We're not very good without Jimmy. With that being said, I don't think
if you remove any player from our depth chart we're any good.  
  
Q. What is it about this team St. Johns that makes them tough?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I told Coach Roberts this before the game. I told him
this after the game. I was on some big radio show here in town yesterday. I
said it after we played at Carnesecca Arena. Coach Roberts doesn't get the
credit he's deserving of for how hard his team plays. And not that I'm old,
but I always trust our players to tell me the truth about other players. And
if you were to ask our players who is the hardest playing team in the league,
they would tell you St. John's. I don't think teams play hard just for one
another. I think they play hard for one another and for their coach. I think
that's what St. John's does. I think that that's what they did yesterday. And
I thought they were the hardest playing team today.  
  
Q. Coach, I saw after today that 12 of your 19 games now have been decided
by three points or less in the league. Is there a moment this year after all
those tough losses that you look back now and say that's where we broke
through and our confidence really went to another level?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: That's a really good question. That's the best question
I've been asked in about six weeks. We won 10 out of our last 12 games. That
would mean that 9 of those 12 games that you mentioned -- tell me the stat
again?  
  
Q. Of your 19 games including today, 12 of the 19 have been decided by three
points or less.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Our players sit on the back of the plane when we fly and
I sit in the front of the plane, it's about the only time I get to sleep. So
when we land I turn on my phone and I text Lazar after the Syracuse loss. They
whipped us at their place. They beat us by five. I texted him and told him to
stay at the back of the plane, keep the guys at the back of the plane. I told
those guys, then I said, "We're counted for dead. Nobody believes in you. So
the only people that are on this plane are the ones that care. And that
genuinely believe that we have a chance." We were 2-5. We won five in a row.
Pitt beat us at home. And then I think from that point cumulative all of that
we won 10 out of our last 12 games. I don't think that our margin has ever
changed. Even when we were getting beat, if you were to talk to any of the
Marquette people, it was because I couldn't coach. I couldn't manage the end-
of-the-game situations. We didn't practice free-throws. How bad of a coach can
you be to not practice free-throws? And we were 2-5. Then since that time,
like you said, we've been in one- or two-possession games. And now supposedly
sometimes some people think I can't coach because we were in at end of the
game. Our players are taking hypnosis so that they can make free throws. And
everything has changed.  
The whole deal is this though, our margin has never changed. We had a lot of
change within our team in the first semester, but our margin of error has
never changed. And that margin is zero. That's why Lazar said what he said.
Every possession is critical for us. I don't know if there was a defining
moment. I think that there's several moments. But no moment is any more bigger
than another moment. I think there are games that we lost, the lessons that we
learned are just as important of the games that we won by one or two
possessions as well.  
  
Q. During that 2-5 stretch you lost to Villanova by two points twice. How
much different a team are you that they'll see tomorrow?  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I just think that we played 12 out of our 19 games
including those two -- what was the number?  
  
Q. Three points or less.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: Three points or less. I think Villanova is a Final Four
team that returns I believe eight of their last players from last year. They
had a top five recruiting class. They have a Final Four head coach early in
his career. He'll be a Hall of Fame coach long before he ever comes close to
retiring. They have three NBA players on their team for sure. We'll have our
hands full. They haven't played since Saturday. And you just saw how hard we
had to play just to escape. So we'll have to do the best job we can over the
next 22 hours to get ready to play.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that sequence where it looked like Dwight went to the
line, two officials waved off the three.  
COACH BUZZ WILLIAMS: I want to handle it the right way. I'm really
disappointed. Brokers in the back will get mad. I'm disappointed. I'm
disappointed. My wife will get mad at me if I said anything because it would
hurt my kid's college fund. I'm mad. I'm really upset. Really upset. Because
it's not justifiably fair. And I'm glad that it happened on this stage and
hope that is it will stop.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Cincinnati  69  
Louisville - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Mick Cronin, Lance Stephenson, Yancy Gates, Darnell
Wilks.  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Well, obviously, a big win for our team. We a rough game
with Louisville earlier in the year where we lost a close one, blew a lead and
really didn't attack the basket. We attacked the basket tonight. Guys did a
great job in the second half. We ended up with 40 points in the paint. We get
the ball in the paint, we get it on the rim, we can rebound the ball.  
So the last two nights we have had 69 shot attempts and 72 tonight. We can
rebound the ball when we get shots off. When we get the ball inside the paint.
Guys did a tremendous job. Their effort was unbelievable from each guy that
went in there, just really proud of my guys. How hard they played in the
second half. Tremendous defensive effort by our guys in the second half. That
was the key from making it hard on Samardo Samuels to trying to bottle
everybody up. And Edgar Sosa had an unbelievable night for him. And he's got
to be proud of himself in a tough loss. But great win for our team, obviously
we'll try to stay here as long as we can.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Mick, did you pretty much know what was coming on that last possession?
Sosa likes to make those kinds of shots.  
COACH MICK CRONIN: If you can believe it, we called time-out to foul him at
half court. Deonta claims he was fouling him the whole time. I was scared he
was going to finally foul him when the shot attempt went up. I was going to be
the laughingstock nationally. So we were all kidding about it in the locker
room. We were all wondering what he was doing.  
I put my senior up there figuring I'll trust him. He's a senior. He'll foul
him at half court. He says he was fouling him. The game plan was to foul him.
He couldn't get that shot off. I've seen him make those kinds of shots. He
made those shots all night tonight and kept them in the game.  
  
Q. What was the message during halftime that you conveyed to the players?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: We made a couple of adjustments. It's March. I've been
known to get upset from time to time, but we're past that. We're not going to
win if we give up 82; they had 41 at halftime. These guys know that. We're not
going to win if we give up 82. We have to find a way to play better defense
and Darnell and Ibrahima Thomas pointed out some things in the pick-and-roll
defense that we changed. And we were able to stop them from getting drives
down the lane and contain the basketball. Obviously Samardo getting his third
foul. When he came out, we made a run. I think that was a factor. We made some
halftime adjustments with our pick-and-roll defense and some things we were
doing. That was the key.  
It was a tale of two halves. They shoot 50% in the first half and 36% in the
second half.  
  
Q. Coach, tonight obviously beating Coach Pitino, a guy you're very familiar
with and coached with, tomorrow night's Coach Huggins, another guy. Does that
factor hold any special meaning for you?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Not really. The only other good thing is one of us gets to
move on. If it wasn't for those guys I wouldn't be here today.  
I have a great deal of love and affection for both of them. I need to win
more. I'm younger. Hopefully they take that into account. They are both in the
NCAA Tournament. We need to keep winning. Hopefully Coach Huggins will feel my
pain and help me out.  
  
Q. You mentioned the pick-and-rolls on offense. What about defensive changes
in the second half? What did you do to kind of slow them down, if at all?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: In our offense we were getting lost a little bit with their
screening that we were late on our pick-and-roll defense. We did more
switching on the perimeter. And Yancy was more aggressive with his pick-and-
roll defense when they set the pick-and-roll with Samuels.  
Then we tried to front him all night. Our goal was to try to front him and
limit his touches as much as possible. But late Yancy had a couple of really
good stands against him where he made him score over him. We walled him off
and made Samardo take a tough shot and held his ground, and didn't let him
back him down. Those were two big, big plays where he was able to get a couple
of stops against him one-on-one. If you can guard him one-on-one, everything
they do is predicated off of help. We guarded the ball better in the second
half.  
  
Q. Mick, do you think this gets you back in the NCAA Tournament picture?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: I'm sure that the bubble talk will begin again. We've been
through all that so much. Our guys really -- it's funny, they'll tell you,
they're not even interested in that. They want to win the BIG EAST Tournament,
the BIG EAST Championship. That's what they're here for. We understand, we say
this: No matter what happened in Maui, we had tough losses, if you play in
this conference and you win in this conference, you're going to be in the NCAA
Tournament. Your fate is decided in BIG EAST play. So we just stay focused on
this tournament. That's all we're worried about.  
Guys are really excited to be here. Their attitudes have been great. Their
effort has been tremendous. They are making great adjustments amongst
themselves out there on the court and sharing the ball. They just want to win
this. There really hasn't been any talk of that. Somebody mentioned it and
they said they can care less. They want the BIG EAST ring. They have to get
some rest. We have a lot of guys play if we're going to do that.  
  
Q. You guys have had sort of an up-and-down season. To come here and get two
wins and get the ball rolling, can you talk about what it means for you
personally and for the program right now?  
LANCE STEPHENSON: I think it's getting everybody confident, making us play
harder. We have to get in the gym and try to win the next game. We have make
the Tournament, we have to play hard. That's what we're going to do.  
  
Q. Darnell, the contribution you made the last couple of nights, you haven't
gotten to play much until recently. What have you been able to do the last
couple of nights?  
DARNELL WILKS: I just think I want to come in and do the best with the
opportunity I'm given. So every time I come in I just try to play hard. Do
whatever he tells me to do. And, you know, if the ball falls my way and I can
score, that's good. Mostly try to play hard on defense and rebound.  
  
Q. Coach, just the offensive rebounding 28, obviously West Virginia is a
team that thrives on offensive rebounding. Can you talk what that matchup is
going to be like, the offensive glass tomorrow?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: It's a game I used to struggle with back in the old days
when we played 21 with no fouls. Just throw it at the rim and go get it. Feel
bad for the three guys that draw that assignment tomorrow night. Might be like
the old days. Just get shots off. They hurt us on the glass in the second
half. There was an even game. We were up six. Even rebounding at halftime. We
were up six. They outrebounded us by ten in the second half. Our guys
understand that. The key for us is getting reboundable shots. If we stand
around and take threes, we're easily blocked out. If we can get the ball
moving and get people moving and get bodies running at the rim, we're as
athletic as anybody.  
Darnell and Jaquon Parker in particular were unbelievable on the offensive
glass tonight. Their effort and focus to get there. When you're attacking the
basket instead of standing there shooting jumpshots, but at the end of the
day, it's going to be the same thing. If we get outrebounded, we'll lose
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. When you see the two teams, your team and West Virginia, do you see like
the same team?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: No, because they're so much longer than us on the perimeter
the way they start it. Other than "Truck" Bryant they are 6'7," and up. It
poses matchup problems with smaller guards. Jaquon Parker can play bigger
people. Lance can play bigger people. When we come in with Cashmere Wright, we
get smaller. Certain lineups that Larry Davis, those guys are a struggle to
match up with either (Da'Sean) Butler and (Devin) Ebanks. That's a concern. We
definitely have some matchups that are definitely, from a size standpoint, a
concern for us.  
  
Q. Seeing when you guys started to make a move in the second half, the
energy of the whole team picked up. What was it for you guys at that point?
Did you feel them changing at that point?  
YANCY GATES: Oh, yeah. We felt the momentum changing. Once we started to make
our run, we got some big baskets and some key stops. We have Samardo pick up
his third foul which was a big factor because he had to go out and sit for a
while. Energy picked up as group, not just the five on the floor. It was the
rest on the bench and the coaching staff. The energy just picked up in the
huddle and on the court. I think that helped us a lot down the stretch of the
game.  
  
Q. Sorry if this was already asked: Coach, it seems like these last two
games you guys are playing real well, playing your type of basketball. What do
you attribute that to? Do you think it's because your backs are against the
wall because of the late games?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: I think the guys would say late games. They would like to
stay up here in New York and hang out all week. They're having a great time.
The misnomer about us is that we haven't played well. We just lost a lot of
close games. We have had some bad breaks that are our own fault. We missed
some free-throws and had some tough things happen to us. That's BIG EAST
basketball. We've been on the wrong side of too many close losses.  
Where I'm most proud of the guys, they're able to put all that behind them and
come up with the fresh attitude they've come up with. That's the thing I'm
most appreciative of. It's hard for young guys. This day and age it's easy to
buy into negativity and let others bring them down. These guys have -- they've
stayed with us. They've stayed with each other. You can see by the energy and
the way they treat each other and how hard they're playing out there, that
they've been able to fight through it. That's tough because we have a lot of
young players on this team. They've hung in there and they've drawn the
strength from each other coming up here.  
Anybody that saw us play knows that we're better than an 11th seed. That's
life in BIG EAST basketball. It's the best conference in the history of
college basketball. As long as we stay in the 16 teams, it's never going to
change. It's not going to change next year, the year after. It's only going to
get worse because everybody is going to recruit better because it's so hard to
win in this league. It's only going to get harder. I'm just really proud of my
guys and their effort and attitude.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2010

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [Luke Harangody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16984)

### [Tory Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17106)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Notre Dame  68  
Seton Hall - 54

  
COACH MIKE BREY: I talked to our guys about given how they played last night
with 55 points at half and 109, and given how they beat us in Newark when they
scored 55 in a half, that if we could impose our style of play, you know, we
can beat them. We're going to have to do that. We certainly did that. Field
goal percentage, defense was great, you know. We limited them of their
possessions. It was our tempo.  
Luke coming off the bench -- the most important three days of practice for us
was Sunday, Monday and Tuesday because we could get Luke back in even a better
rhythm, since he's been away. Played 11 minutes in Milwaukee. And I think
you're seeing how we're changing as a team here, even in March. He gave us a
great lift. I thought our guards defensively were great. And it was just a
heck of a team win.  
I'm very proud of our guys that we advanced.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please?  
  
Q. He can still play little bit? He can still help your team?  
COACH MIKE BREY: The microwave was ready to go tonight. He was ready to go. It
was not anything anybody in this room hasn't seen. We're going to need that as
he was coming back. We didn't really need it as much in Milwaukee. And maybe
he wasn't quite ready to do all that in Milwaukee. After just a practice and a
half. But we had three good practices. And I think he is back in his rhythm at
a very key time.  
  
Q. Mike, the job you guys have been able to do the other night in Milwaukee
and then again tonight, the attention to detail that you've had from the
three-point line, guarding the three-point line.  
COACH MIKE BREY: We've been really good. I thought we were great on Hazell.
Abromaitis. John Peoples gave us a couple of good minutes. He defended Hazell
and gave us another ball handler against a team that was really chasing us
down and coming after us. There was a really good team awareness of the three-
point line especially Hazell.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how you feel and how you're coming along and how you
felt out there tonight?  
LUKE HARANGODY: As Coach said, the last couple of days of practice have been
great for me just to get back in the flow. Kind of get my conditioning back up
to where it has been. And just get on the court tonight. Hit a couple of early
buckets. It was great for my confidence. Going into this game, especially the
Marquette game, my confidence wasn't at the level. I feel right now that I
started to get a little bit of swagger I had before the injury, a little more
of the confidence. I feel great with the guys out there.  
  
Q. Mike, simple question: What is different about your team now than maybe
two or three weeks ago?  
COACH MIKE BREY: I think the offensive tempo. That's the biggest change we've
made. We've really been extremely patient, as you can see. And that's
benefited us. Especially when we can get the lead. It puts a lot of pressure
on people. You know, you can say you want to play that way. But you're going
to make 18 passes a possession, you have to have guys that can pass and catch.
We're blessed our big guys are real good basketball IQ. You don't have to
guard as many three-point attempts if they don't get the ball back that much.
It's really helped us. It's made us more efficient offensively. And right now
it's something we believe in because we've been riding it pretty good.  
  
Q. Tory, they jumped on you early with the full-court pressure. Was there
any adjustment other than being stronger with the ball? Did you talk that
over?  
TORY JACKSON: We didn't want them to make us guard fast. We have to play our
tempo. Even though they were running and jumping and slapping and whatever, we
still had to be calm and just hit the open guy. After they made that little
run, the guys -- we thought the game was a little better. We slowed down, hit
the open guy. And the guys hit the easy buckets.  
  
Q. Tory, can you talk about how well you guys played the first time you
played them and how that came from the start of this run?  
TORY JACKSON: Tell you the truth, I don't want to look back at that time. Pitt
is a different team. They are coming in playing really hot themselves. So we
have to go back and look at film and see how we played defensively. And just
continue to be the team we've been the last couple of weeks.  
  
Q. Luke, you don't normally have to go back-to-back nights. How are you
going to be tomorrow?  
LUKE HARANGODY: I played 24 tonight. I feel pretty good. I think Coach is
smart about how many minutes he got me tonight. My body feels great right now.
I think he got me in and out of there at times that I needed to get out of
there. I think every day it's just going to get better. I'm just going to ride
the momentum off today and into tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you address the NCAA Tournament picture. Did you feel you were in
before this game? Did you feel you needed to win this?  
COACH MIKE BREY: How about this being promoted as a play-in game? Come on. For
us, come on. You know what, right now nobody is going to talk about Seton
Hall. Just give it a few days. Keep Seton Hall on the board. Just keep Seton
Hall on the board. Right I know everybody knee jerks. Give it two days and
come back and look at the big picture.  
It would have been very hard to keep us out before tonight with what we have.
We have three top 12, ten top 100. And you know there is some feel for the
game here where you have to get away from numbers and computers. We're playing
well. We're one of the best stories in college basketball right now, with him
coming back. So I do think there's a human element in that room. My only thing
would be take a deep breath before you do anything with Seton Hall, the way
this thing is going to play out nationally.  
  
Q. Mike, I'm just wondering along those lines, how on any level have you
ever had to try to reinvent the team like you did this year? And second part,
did you reach out to any one in the fraternity and say in this space?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Never have. Never this drastic a change as far as changing
the tempo. We prided ourselves on being one of the leading scoring teams. A
real fun team to watch when we're running and firing, 25 assists. Those days
are over. And we felt we started to talk about it. Going into the Louisville
game and we thought Luke was going to be back. It was something that we had to
do to try to survive. Our backs were against the wall. And we were going to do
it with Luke at Louisville because we expected he could play. Now, he talked
us into it. He wasn't ready to play. He tricked our trainer. He tricked me. He
needed two weeks. But, we obviously have played that way, he's watched it, and
he and I spent a lot of time talking about him coming back into it. I really
didn't reach out to anybody else. It was kind of our staff talking about you
know how we need to play.  
  
Q. Mike, Tory made a play in the first half where he dove for a ball out of
bounds and kicked it off to Luke. Can you talk about that epitomizing this
philosophy change?  
COACH MIKE BREY: It's only fitting that our two seniors tonight they tied,
this class tied the all-time wins in Notre Dame over a four-year period. They
got a chance to break it. You can ask Bernie, is it Tracy Jackson and that
group that had 92 wins. I see him dive and he finishes for a three-point play.
That's kind of who these two guys have been. They've been big-time winners.
And obviously when they showed up in our program, things really changed.  
  
Q. Mike, when Bobby puts Herb back in with two fouls under the 5:00 mark and
he picks up that third, was that sort of where this game changed? It sort of
limited him to what he was able to do.  
COACH MIKE BREY: I think that hurt them. We were able to go inside. He could
only play so much post defense. I thought Luke and (Tyrone) Nash were really
good in the post. And they were limited as far as how physical they could be
because of foul trouble.  
  
Q. Mike, can you just talk about how the other guys grew in confidence when
Luke was out.  
COACH MIKE BREY: Yeah, I think it was great for Carleton Scott. Carleton Scott
has been coming. Then all of a sudden you get to start when Luke Harangody is
down. That's a powerful thing. And he gets more extended minutes.  
I think it was a big step for him tonight, because he gets in foul trouble,
and you're wondering ok, where is his head at tonight? He came back in the
second half and gave us a great half and really rebounded. John Peoples gave
us great minutes tonight, guarding Hazell. Nash and Scott probably have been
the biggest beneficiaries while Luke was out, they got very confident.  
  
Q. Tory, when Coach came to you and suggested this kind of change in game
plan, how hard was it for you guys? You've been playing the same way for four
years and all of a sudden it's time-out, go out and change everything.  
TORY JACKSON: I thought he was crazy at first. No, I thought it was -- I kind
of thought it was a good idea because it really helped me out as a player.
Just slowing down, making the easy plays during the game. If I'm at a scorer's
pace, a place where I can control the game. I think we played better as a team
and it definitely helped me out as a player. So I love the decision he made
with that.  
  
Q. Luke, the NCAA Tournament was maybe not a reality for you guys just a
little while ago. I know it was a big deal for you guys to end your careers
with another appearance. Now that that seems pretty likely, how gratifying is
it to kind of rally to that?  
LUKE HARANGODY: It's been great to be part of this run right now. And have a
chance to put ourselves in that position. As of right now, I think we're
excited we're in that kind of talk. But I think we're more excited to play a
great Pitt team tomorrow night. And, you know, as Coach has talked to us the
past week, Notre Dame really hasn't done a lot of damage in the BIG EAST
Tournament lately. Me and Tory are seniors now, want to go out that way.  
  
Q. Mike, with Luke now as your sixth man, does that change your philosophy
on bench scoring being the most overrated stat?  
COACH MIKE BREY: Great point. You're right. The bench scoring stat I hang my
hat on now more. I'm more into that. But certainly gives us a lift. And we're
not going to change how we play.  
Yeah, I've changed my attitude on that.  
THE MODERATOR: Notre Dame, thank you.  
COACH MIKE BREY: Thanks.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2010

  

### [Will Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19359)

### [Tracy Webster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20566)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

USF - 58  
DePaul - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Webster will make an opening statement.  
COACH TRACY WEBSTER: Well, the season is over now, but that's all I got. I
mean, it was a tough game. We have to give South Florida credit. They did a
really good job of attacking the basket, scoring inside the paint. But they
got a lead on us early. The guys really tried to battle and fight back. You
know, everyone, those guys, our motto is "Never give up. Never quit." These
guys did a great job of not giving up.  
  
Q. (Inaudible) Talk about your defense against USF.  
COACH TRACY WEBSTER: It was very tough. Very tough. We allowed open points in
the paint. We tried to go zone. They scored a lot in the paint not having
breakdowns when defending the basketball. They did a good job. We have to give
those guys credit. They did a really good job of getting into the paint. It's
tough. Especially when nobody is shooting from the outside. We need to
continue to learn from it.  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
WILL WALKER: We let Coach Web -- he believed in us. We believed in him. We
tried to play in transition, just pick up the pace. We were a little more
lackadaisical, so we tried to pick up the tempo. That's what we did. We
followed the game plan. It was a good game plan. Sometimes it worked and
sometimes it didn't. That's how it always goes.  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH TRACY WEBSTER: I think so. I think you always learn from every game. I
think our guys want to continue to get better. They will continue to get
better.  
You know, I do think they'll continue to learn and make everyone around them
learn. There will be some carry-over. And the guys will do a really good job
of improving their game.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions? DePaul, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2010

  

### [Fred Hill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19388)

### [Hamady Ndiaye](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19389)

### [Mike Rosario](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20584)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Cincinnati - 69  
Rutgers - 68

  
Q. Can you discuss the last 20 seconds of the game, how you got back in it
and the final sequence.  
COACH FRED HILL: I thought our guys were phenomenal in the last two minutes of
the game. We talk about execution, no time-outs left. They did everything they
were supposed to do offensively and defensively. And that's what got us into
the game and gave us a chance to win the game. I couldn't be more proud of the
way they did that down the end. This has been a team all year long with an
unbelievable amount of heart. Made plays, and we knew this would be one of
those games that would go right down to the wire and thought the difference
would be on the glass. And that's where the game was won and lost.  
To do what they did and execute in the last two-and-a-half minutes, I'm
extremely proud of the way they played. They put themselves in a position to
win the game. And really deserved a shot to come away with a great win here in
The Garden. I wish we could have gotten it into overtime and give them five
more minutes. They were playing really well.  
  
Q. I know that it's kind of secondary, your career has come to an end. You
did tie the block record tonight. What does that mean to you? You broke it.  
COACH FRED HILL: Career leader in shots blocked and single-season record in
shots blocked.  
HAMADY NDIAYE: I'm really happy, you know. I always wanted to leave a mark at
Rutgers and everything. This was one of the ways besides everything good I did
on the court. With all the guys as the captain and leader and everything. But
it's one of the things I probably could come back later on and read somewhere
about it. Things like that.  
So I'm happy. It's one of the good things that happened today.  
  
Q. When you hit that circus shot at the end, did you think that was going to
be enough to send you into overtime?  
MIKE ROSARIO: I just did what Coach told me to do. I executed the play. Coach
told me to get the ball, if he makes the next free throw and we'll be down by
three. He wants me to either shoot the three or get it up in the air and try
to get him to jump into me, so I can make the shot or get fouled and shoot
three free throws. I thought I did a great job executing the play and it was a
great shot.  
  
Q. Can you describe the last defensive sequence, Stephenson had the ball.  
HAMADY NDIAYE: I definitely just saw the ball -- I definitely thought I was
going to get the block and everything. I can't see any other things that
happened. I just went up and everything. So I don't exactly know what exactly
happened. We have to see the film and actually know. I just know I went for
the block.  
  
Q. Coach, is it kind of this game do you think it's kind of symbolic the way
you guys played so well so close from getting a big win, how the season has
gone, maybe last season losing so many close games?  
COACH FRED HILL: This season I'm really proud of the guys. We have a new
group. And H has been our leader and our captain. We really wanted to win for
him going out here. Thought we had some great opportunities. But you know,
Mike is a sophomore. He had a great freshman year. He was kind of a marked man
this year. I thought his game really developed. He saw things tonight. His
mid-range game is coming along. He's getting to the rim. He's getting to the
free-throw line. He's doing some really good things. James Beatty, junior
college point guard. I think he has great basketball ahead of him next year.
You have to get used to what the BIG EAST is all about, especially at the
point. Dane Miller was phenomenal and consistent. Eight assists. He couldn't
get a couple of shots to go down, his free throws. But he has a bright, bright
future.  
These guys have a great heart. They have great chemistry. They work extremely
hard. I told them in the locker room how proud I was of them going through a
tough stretch. They never took a day off. They kept coming every day and
working extremely hard. They really like each other, and I think it showed.
And, you know, once in a while, you come up a little bit short. Tonight was
one of those instances. I really thought they did an unbelievable job. Maybe
deserved with the way they executed to win the game and get the right bounce
down the stretch, and that's the game of basketball.  
So I'm very proud of them and they did a terrific job. They're a great group.
And we'll take a week off, because it's spring break coming up. And they're
ready. They're ready to go back to work for next year already. So we just
talked about that, and we have some guys that are very hungry that want to be
very successful.  
  
Q. Do you find it fitting that that final trip down the court Lance and Dane
head to head, two guys, Rookie of the Year? Does that sort of strike you as
odd at all?  
COACH FRED HILL: No. It would have been very fitting if there wasn't a foul
called. We went into overtime. Yeah, I guess there's a little irony that Lance
and Dane were the two unanimous selections to the All Rookie Team. Two great
players. Lance Stephenson is a great player. He has lot of talent. I really
thought that he probably had his best four games when we watched on film, the
last four at the end of the year. Like most freshmen, there was a little bit
up and down throughout the course of the year.  
What I thought Dane did for us, I thought he was extremely consistent through
the whole BIG EAST season. In fact maybe even kept getting better and better
and better and better as the whole year went on. A little ironic that two
great freshmen in a big game in a BIG EAST Tournament in the Garden. Lance had
the ball in his hands at the end, Dane was the guy defending him. So, you
know, they did a great job. And give them credit. He got to the free-throw
line. Got a foul. And he made a big free throw.  
  
Q. Going back to the blocked shots, the one that tied the all-time record
against Thomas, does that make that a little better for you?  
COACH FRED HILL: Tell the truth.  
HAMADY NDIAYE: It does. It does. It's actually funny because right before the
game I think somebody told me that he said that I never blocked his shot and
everything. So it was funny. On the court actually I told him, "Now I got one
against you and everything." But it's all love. That's my little brother and
everything. He knows. He knows that I was going to go for it anyways.  
THE MODERATOR: Rutgers, thank you.

## March 9, 2010

  

### [Stan Heath](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13792)

### [Dominique Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19392)

### [Mike Mercer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20565)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

USF - 58  
DePaul - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Stan Heath, Mike Mercer on the end and Dominique
Jones in the middle. Coach, do you have an opening statement.  
COACH STAN HEATH: Good win for our program. Our first BIG EAST (Tournament)
win. So I'm really happy we were able to do that. I loved the way we started
the game off. I thought we played defense at really high level and took away
some really good players, Koshwal, with the double teams.  
I thought that helped us get a nice lead. We were hoping we can stretch that
out and maybe rest some guys towards the end. But DePaul, give them a lot of
credit, they don't quit. They have a lot of fight in them. They kept coming at
us. We had to just kind of weather the storm a little bit and hold on and get
the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. You didn't need it, does that concern you at all that you missed as many
shots (inaudible).  
COACH STAN HEATH: We won. So in this particular game, no. But I do feel we're
going to be able to knock down some shots tomorrow. We will. We will be able
to knock them down. It's not the strength of our team. We have some guys that
can knock down some shots. We'll sort them out. Probably the advantage of
getting that game underneath your belt. And I think our guys will be --
they'll be a little bit more relaxed, a little more confident. And some of
those shots will fall that didn't fall today.  
  
Q. Defensively, Koshwal had such a big game last time. 24 and 11. Is there
something you did differently?  
COACH STAN HEATH: We dealt post to post. We probably should have done that the
first time around. Give him his due, he's a hard guy to stop. We need to give
him some extra attention. I thought that was a big factor in the first half of
helping us to get off to a nice lead and get some deflections and get some
nice steals.  
  
Q. (Inaudible) with the arena not really that full and the energy kind of
lacking?  
COACH STAN HEATH: I thought we brought a lot of energy the first 20 minutes.
Maybe hit a little fatigue in the second half. I don't know. But I do think
the advantage for us is we have time to maybe get back to the hotel, relax a
little bit, prepare for our next opponent.  
So I like that. We'll get a good night's rest as well.  
  
Q. So only hitting one shot out of the paint the whole game, do you look at
that as a positive? Do you think it might be a little different against (Greg)
Monroe tomorrow?  
COACH STAN HEATH: It will be totally different. We'll have to knock down some
shots. We'll be able to do that. It didn't happen today. If we would have
lost, it would be a big deal. Since we won, it's not a big deal.  
  
Q. Dominique, you guys came out it obviously looked like a team on a mission
there. What was the mind-set at the start of the game?  
DOMINIQUE JONES: I mean, everybody wanted to get our first win at Madison
Square (Garden) and start the BIG EAST Tournament. So we came out with a lot
of energy. We know that and Mac Koshwal and (Will) Walker, both are good
players. We know we had to buckle down on them and double team and stay
disciplined on defense.  
  
Q. Can you talk about tomorrow and the challenges of playing Georgetown,
trying to beat them again.  
COACH STAN HEATH: They're really good. Now that -- thankfully, (Austin)
Freeman seems like he's back being able to play at the high level he's capable
of playing at. They had a terrific season. They have a few of the best players
I think in the league. Their starting five can compete with anybody. They've
beaten the top teams in the country. And we were very fortunate. We played
well at Georgetown. Especially in the second half. Dominique had a phenomenal
game. I'm sure they'll make some adjustments against him.  
But they'll be ready. We'll be ready as well. We've got to do a good job of
taking away their back-door cuts and as well as Monroe. Monroe is a hard guy
to deal with. Fortunately I think this time around we do have more bodies
available to play with them inside. So hopefully that will help us, too.  
  
Q. Dominique and Mike, last time you guys played Georgetown that got you on
the map. Have you regained some of that confidence you had in that last
game?  
MIKE MERCER: Yeah, definitely. I feel like we've gained confidence since then.
That was a time we had our chemistry flowing and we were hitting on all
cylinders. We played a really good game. Georgetown was a tough environment.
They're going to be pumped for us tomorrow. We're going to be pumped, also.
We're going to be ready to play.  
  
Q. Mike, having Gus (Gilchrist) as part of the lineup, you didn't have him
for the first time.  
MIKE MERCER: That's big. Gus demands a lot of attention on the offensive end.
I'm a slasher, I like to cut in the lane. Every time my man looks to Gus to
score, I can get in there and get my shots off. The same with Dominique Jones.
They both demand so much attention. It makes it easier for players like me and
Chris Howard to score.  
  
Q. I think only three teams in the last 20-something years have gotten 20
victories in the BIG EAST and got an NCAA tournament bid. Do you think you
guys have done enough?  
COACH STAN HEATH: We need to win. We definitely need to win. We need to keep
winning. My senior was in the locker room, Chris Howard, he said, "Make sure
you bring five suits." So I did. We've got to win. We can't leave things to
chance. We have had some other opportunities we've kind of let slip through
our fingers, and we just can't leave anything to chance. And so the best thing
you can do is win and control your own destiny.  
  
Q. When you have a team on the bubble like that, what's the key of keeping
them loose and focused and not getting stressed out about it?  
COACH STAN HEATH: Well, we've never been here before. So in a lot of ways I
think we've accomplished things we've never accomplished before. So I don't
think there's a lot of pressure on us. It's just doing some things that we
really want to do. We all want to go to the NCAA Tournament. We think we've
done all the other things that are available for us. So we just need to go out
and play and play at a high level.  
Obviously our focus has to be on who we're playing, because if you're thinking
about other things and you're worried and you're stressed, you're going to get
beat.  
  
Q. First Georgetown game, what did you guys do in that second half that
allowed you to do what you guys did up there?  
DOMINIQUE JONES: I mean, I think the team feeds off what I do positively and
negatively. And I think that I turned it up and then when I turned it up,
everybody else turned it up. I think that passed the message to us that we've
got to play with high energy out there. We have to get steals, deflections. We
have to get out in transition. You know, and that's something we're going to
try to do tomorrow for sure.  
  
Q. Stan, (Alex) Rivas didn't play. Is he all right?  
COACH STAN HEATH: Rivas is fine. Stuck with that rotation. No particular
reason. He's fine. Hopefully he'll be able to get out there and help us
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Dominique takes five shots in the second half, what does it say for your
team where he gets in a situation where he gets everyone else involved and
doesn't have to go out and take 10 or 12 shots?  
COACH STAN HEATH: He's grown so much over the years. He has always been a
great scorer from the day he set foot on campus. I think sometime last year
especially, going into the season, his mindset has been on winning. Whether
he's the second leading scorer or he gets 10 assists, I think he's going to be
happy if he wins. He's not going to be happy if he loses. Very similar to me.
He's miserable when he loses.  
So, you know, they did some things, they went to a little bit more zone. They
put more guys that had eyes on him when he had the ball. And he started making
some nice plays. Made some nice feeds around the basket to our bigs. They were
able to score a little bit. That's great when you have a great player like him
who is willing to sacrifice scoring in order to win. That's what every coach
wants.  
  
Q. Toarlyn (Fitzpatrick) was real active and he had that nasty fall. Do you
get a sense he's going to be okay?  
COACH STAN HEATH: Yes. Our trainers are going to do a good job. I thought he
did a great job defensively. I was proud of Toarlyn. We need him to be
healthy. He's a very good defensive player, a good matchup for those tweener
players.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Jeremy Hazell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19394)

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Seton Hall - 109  
Providence - 106

  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Start with an opening statement. You know, it was kind
of like two different games. You know, obviously we got out and played great.
We were up 29 or 30 or whatever it was. Believe it or not, and I know this is
kind of a funny statement, you would rather be up 29 than down 29, but
sometimes when you get up like that, it's not easy to stay ahead in a game
that long. There's a different strategy. You try to use the clock. I maybe
subbed a little bit too early. I'm not sure.  
Thinking about playing Notre Dame tomorrow night. Maybe Herb Pope and Jeremy
resting them a little bit. I got to taking some guys out. Obviously we had to
manage foul trouble. One thing about Providence one thing they can do is they
can score, so they have nothing to lose. Down 25, jacking threes, running
around and they can score the ball. All of a sudden it goes to 20. And then
with the three-point line and the 35-second shot clock, you know, the game is
never safe today. The game is never over until that clock runs down.  
So, you know, I had to put some people back in. I'm a little disappointed that
we subbed, and I'm not knocking our second-team guys. But I felt like we have
enough depth, we have enough players we should be able to not coast but keep a
cushion and get through the game comfortably. But we weren't able to do that.
Obviously I'm not taking any credit away from Providence. They came back and
had a furious rally.  
I'm proud of the three guys to my left. Jordan Theodore was sensational. Herb
Pope was spectacular. And Jeremy Hazell had a very good game. I took him out.
He maybe didn't get in a rhythm as much as the other two. Right now we're
playing our best basketball. And again we're just happy to survive and advance
and we're playing on Wednesday night. We have 19 wins. We're thrilled, we're
excited, we're here. And it's just a great feeling.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. 30 minutes in the game did you ever think it would be a special game and
did you ever think it would come down to something like that?  
JEREMY HAZELL: No, not really. We came out first half, we jumped them. We came
out, we spoke about -- we played them three days ago. It's going to be hard
playing a team twice because we know each other. We said it was going to be a
war. So Coach told us we're going to have to come out and jump them from the
beginning. That's what we did.  
Second half we came out first five minutes and we put it on them. But then
last ten minutes they got it rolling. A couple of our guys was in foul
trouble. Me, Herb. And our second team they stepped up, but Providence is a
great team. Jamine Peterson, 38 points, 15 rebounds. That's a tremendous game.
We didn't think he was going to do that. The first game he played us, he
probably had like 6 and 4. He came out and had a breakout game.  
You never know what's going to happen playing in this league. So we just happy
we got the win and we are moving on to Wednesday.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you explain what that last defensive possession was like,
what was going through your mind?  
JORDAN THEODORE: My whole mindset was to block him out and hope the shot
doesn't go in. Jeff (Robinson) missed the free throw, so Coach wanted to us
get a foul. We didn't have an opportunity to. So just that last play, it was
nerve-racking but I'm happy he missed it.  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Our rule on that basically is obviously I thought Jeff
would make at least one out of two. We would go up now, and you don't have to
worry. But I told our guys, you know, I was going call time-out; I didn't. I
told them that if we can get to the guy early enough to foul him, give a foul,
but you don't want -- once he's heading for that three-point line, you don't
want to foul because now he whips it in. It could be a four-point play or you
foul him and he gets three free-throws. And they got it up so quick because
Jeff missed, they grabbed it and they outletted it that we really didn't get a
chance to foul. That would be our strategy.  
Luckily (Duke) Mondy missed, as Jordan said, and the ball came off. We missed
14 free throws. So, you know, on top of having a 25, 30-point lead, we didn't
make our free-throws. And that's -- we caused some of the closeness in the
game because we didn't close the door. We have to make our free-throws. They
know that. We know that.  
  
Q. What was your strategy in attacking Providence's zone? You were able to
handle it pretty well the first 25 minutes.  
JORDAN THEODORE: The whole zone thing was we played them three days ago. We
know the zone pretty well coming into this game. We attacked it just by
setting screens and moving the ball, you know. I was knocking down some shots.
Herb was knocking down some shots. So everything it just took its course.
Everything was easy.  
  
Q. Jordan, do you guys still hope to make the NCAA Tournament, if you win
the game tomorrow night?  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: I'll take that question. Our kids are not going to
discuss that. They are just going to focus on Notre Dame. We play Notre Dame
tomorrow night.  
Let me just say this: We have 19 wins, we have no bad losses. We beat Notre
Dame at our place. A lot of people are saying they're in. We know it's a big
game. If we win, now, all of a sudden we swept Notre Dame, we have 20 wins.
We'll leave it up to the people to make the decision. We want to keep playing.
Right now our guys are just focused on playing Notre Dame tomorrow night.
We're very excited to get to the next round and have the opportunity to play
them. And that's all we care about.  
  
Q. Going up to the shadows in the Garden, is it a pleasure to come back?  
JEREMY HAZELL: It feels great, me being from Harlem, a New York kid. Playing
here your high school tournaments, playoffs. It feels great. This is the best
arena to play in.  
I'm happy for Herb. He got his first chance to play here. He's from Aliquippa.
The environment was great. Everybody treated us great. It's just a blessing to
play here. I'm happy we got here, we got the win. So I'm just happy for my
teammates right now.  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
JEREMY HAZELL: Local star playing right now. Dwight Hardy from St. John's. He
didn't play today. "Greedy" Peterson. He was from Brooklyn.  
Eugene Harvey, Jordan (Theodore), Jemel Jackson from Lincoln. He played here.
It's a lot of guys. We keep on going. But I'm just happy that we are here. We
got the win.  
  
Q. For Bobby and Herb, talking about Notre Dame is off limits. I would like
to ask --  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Just the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. How does it make it different?  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Unless you're from the Selection Committee.  
  
Q. The fact that it seems Bobby and Herb the last time you played, Notre
Dame kind of switched, changed gears a little bit. They're not really as up
tempo as you guys are. Certainly as up tempo as Providence. How is that going
to affect you guys tomorrow night? A slightly different team than you saw four
weeks ago.  
HERB POPE: I think all this year we played some teams that had totally
different personnel, such as Temple and other teams that run and gun. I think
we learned how to win different games. I don't think that's going to affect
us.  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: I'm not interested. I'm immune to those things. I'm just
focused on once again being in the Tournament, having a chance to go to the
NCAA.  
To finish up the Notre Dame thing, Luke Harangody actually got hurt in our
game with I think it was five minutes to go in the game, or seven minutes to
go in the game. And you know it was a great game. We were fortunate to win it.
I think we won by three. Tory Jackson went nuts.  
You have to give Mike Brey a lot of credit. They're hot, they've won four in a
row. They're one of the hottest teams in the league. What they did without him
is remarkable. They shoot the ball very, very well. They're a terrific team.
So it's going to be a hard game. These guys know we have to play 40 minutes.
We have to play much more consistent basketball. We're not going to be up 29
points tomorrow night. That's probably pretty certain.  
  
Q. Coach, do you try to use your bench early to try to stretch things out,
as far as preparing for tomorrow?  
COACH BOBBY GONZALEZ: Well, I mean I think it was -- like I said, it was like
two games. You know what, that might be good for us in a way. Sometimes if you
are playing in a total blowout, then you just waltz into the next round and
maybe you think hey, this was easy. Maybe by all of a sudden you know the
crowd is going nuts, you know we have to -- it's crazy at the end. You have to
play to win. Maybe that's good for us. Because I'm sure the Notre Dame game
tomorrow night is going to be a possession game -- hopefully we're not the
ones getting blown out and it's a tight game.  
THE MODERATOR: Seton Hall, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2010

  

### [Keno Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18291)

### [Bilal Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20582)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Seton Hall - 109  
Providence - 106

  
COACH KENO DAVIS: I think during the last month of the season, it's been a
difficult stretch for us where every game we've played has either been against
a top-ten team in the country or against a bubble team for the NCAA
Tournament. And so I think that in part with the success of our younger
players, I think Bilal Dixon who is up here with me right now, but Jamine
Peterson who sets a school record for points in a BIG EAST Tournament game.
For Vincent Council who is getting an IV but is on the All-Freshman Team.  
I really enjoyed being able to coach this group and see them improve. Even if
we haven't seen it on the scoreboard, we've been very competitive this year. I
think that you have to learn how to win, you have to learn how to get better.
But I think we've got a good nucleus of players and I think we're going to be
a team that a lot of people are going to watch next year.  
  
Q. Talk about adjustments in the last ten minutes.  
COACH KENO DAVIS: Adjustments over the last ten minutes, quite honestly, we're
down -- I look up at the scoreboard and we're down 30. What adjustments really
can you make at that point? We were just trying to motivate our guys to not
end the season like this. We had played so hard the last month. Come on, just
play hard. Just take it to the basket. Don't rely on the jumpshot. Everything
has to be hard. Defense, rebounding, going to the basket. Let's get some
buckets. And so we weren't talking about that the game is over, let's play it
out. Let's see what we can do if we can get some stops. And we did.  
So when we cut the lead to a manageable number, which was like 12 or 14, then
I felt, ok, now let's use some of our pressure, some of our three-quarter
court pressure. Then we got a couple of turnovers over and we used our full-
court pressure and your team starts believing and you have all the momentum.
You know, I think the way we've been able to score, we know we're always in
games. If we can shore up some of the things on the defensive end, we can be a
very competitive team.  
  
Q. What has to happen between today and first game next year to allow your
offense to win these games and your defense to give up so many points?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: Well, I think for us from this point to next year, we have
to add some players, we have to improve our talent level, because we've got
some nice talent, but we don't have guys that are first, second or third team.
Although I think you could make a big case for Jamine Peterson. You know we've
seen him put up numbers all year and maybe without us winning as much, he
didn't get as much recognition.  
So adding talent but also we need some improvement from our younger players.
When you look at BIG EAST and you look at freshmen or sophomores in the BIG
EAST that are putting up statistics, there's just hardly are any. And so I
think with our young guys, they have a chance to make big jumps. They have to
be able on the defensive end to learn. And I think you see that most on our
offensive rebounding. How are we such a good offensive rebounding team in the
BIG EAST with being as young with Bilal Dixon, with Jamine Peterson as
freshmen and sophomores? How are we the number one offensive rebounding team
in the BIG EAST? Because it's about effort. It's about just go get the ball.  
Now, we're not as good on the defensive end. We're not as good on the
defensive rebounding end. And because those things you have to learn. You have
to learn positioning, you have to learn your reverse pivot on the rebound, you
have to learn your weak-side help. Those things take time. And usually
freshmen and sophomores in the BIG EAST they learn from practice. They learn
from watching the veterans do it. And they wait their time until they're a
junior or senior. The great thing for our young men is right now we're at the
program they've been able to jump right in and get first-hand experience. And
I think if anything motivates players going in to an off-season, it's getting
a little bit of taste of success. A little bit of taste of the BIG EAST
Tournament of Madison Square Garden, about going up against the nation's best
and seeing what they can do to become one of the nation's best.  
  
Q. Coach, on that last possession, did Mondy think he had less time than he
had and rushed it?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: Well, there's about three minutes left. I was wishing I had
a time-out left. But we kind of felt like we had to use those to try to get
back in the game. But I mean, I told them as much as I could down at the other
end. If he had missed both free-throws, I wanted the three. That I just felt
with six, seven seconds left to get the two with six or seven seconds left
wouldn't be enough. You would score with a couple of seconds left. They would
foul and the game is over. And so to be able to get such a good look, whether
he rushed it or not, I don't know. But I mean to get an open three-point look,
when you're down three with six, seven seconds to go, you can't ask for much
more.  
  
Q. You said before down 29, you couldn't make the adjustments at that point.
Could you have imagined that you would have had a shot to tie the game as the
buzzer went off? Was that even conceivable at that point?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: It is. It is. I think it's a long shot. But I think as a
coach when you're in the huddles, you don't want to say the game is over.
Let's play it out. Let's try to do this or that and work for next time. Here's
what we have to do. We need stops, we need a run-out. We can't run offense. We
don't have time to run offense. We need to take it to the basket. And
everything we have to do is aggressive. Then our pressure. We get a few
buckets. You know how quickly you can get 10 or 12 points and get it to a
manageable number.  
And so I knew there was that possibility. I wouldn't have bet on it, but these
guys, I told them at halftime there would be nothing better for us to end our
season or to make it go another year. Everything we've been through with the
top teams, with tough shots that have gone in against us, than to come back
when there's no pressure on us. Just play as hard as we can. And I think we
did that.  
  
Q. Have you ever been in a game like that or even remotely close? Not
necessarily the score, but the deficit-wise on either end?  
COACH KENO DAVIS: You know, I have. But maybe not with the amount of time
left. I don't know with that 30-point lead how much time there was left. It
couldn't have been much.  
  
Q. 13 minutes.  
COACH KENO DAVIS: 13 minutes with 30 points. No, I don't. I've seen it on TV,
though. I can remember a couple of games that you think of as your biggest
comebacks. And usually those are teams on home courts where they are able to
get it going. But I think that it says a lot about our team going forward and
why a lot of the Providence fans have been so optimistic about our future,
even though we've lost a string of games.  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for Bilal?  
  
Q. What was it like the last couple of minutes on the floor? Two and a half
to go, you cut the deficit to 10. What was it like the last couple of
minutes?  
BILAL DIXON: It was kind of weird because we came back and we showed that we
have lot of effort. We showed we had a lot of heart. We cut it down, there was
two minutes left. We knew we had to play hard and foul. Coach told us to foul
certain people because we know they can't shoot free throws. We cut the lead
to three and seven seconds left. We didn't expect Eugene Harvey to miss the
free throw. So he missed, I grabbed the rebound and I threw the ball to Duke
Mondy. He took a shot. He's a freshman. A lot of pressure on him. It was a
good shot. It came up short and fell off.  
  
Q. You say "we came back," were you surprised you guys were able to come
back?   
BILAL DIXON: No, I wasn't surprised. I always knew we could play. I always
knew we had to play with effort. I just knew -- I didn't know we were going to
show it. It took us a long time to show -- to start playing hard. But when we
did, look what happened. We cut a 30-point lead to three. We had to keep
playing like that.  
  
Q. You faced a lot of adversity this year, especially the last month. Also
tonight being down so much. What have you learned about how to face adversity
and how do you take that into your workouts next year?  
BILAL DIXON: I'm going to use it to motivate me. There was a lot of adversity
this year, about people were saying how we're not a good team, how we don't
really have good defense. So this year my goal is work hard, use that
negativity and make it positive and push us so next year we can overcome our
past and become a better team.  
THE MODERATOR: Providence, thank you.  
COACH KENO DAVIS: Good answer.  
BILAL DIXON: I learn from the best.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2010

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Yancy Gates](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19360)

### [Jaquon Parker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20583)

### [Lance Stephenson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20571)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

Cincinnati - 69  
Rutgers - 68

  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Obviously, we have a great win for our team. One point
blowout. That's all you need at tournament time. We started that back in Maui
when we went there in November. We got a one-point blowout tonight. And we're
proud of it.  
Thought Rutgers played well. I want to congratulate Fred and their team. They
finished up 5-5. I thought they came in and made shots tonight and made it
tough on us. They knocked in a lot of open shots. They didn't get a lot of
layups on us. They made shots and made it difficult on us. Stretched our
defense. But we did a great job offensively taking care of the basketball. If
we get shots off, we're going to rebound. We got 69 shots off. That's why we
had 23 offensive rebounds.  
But we needed to get this win. So we get a chance to play Louisville again
tomorrow night, a team that we lost a tough game against in Freedom Hall
earlier in the season. But I'm proud of our guys. We got 37 points and 31
rebounds from Cashmere and Jaquon, Lance and Ibrahima Thomas. Four guys who
did not play for us last year. It's their first game in a BIG EAST Tournament.
I'm proud of those guys and their effort tonight. But it was tough out there.
Yancy didn't get a lot of calls but he kept battling. I thought his defense in
the second half was tremendous. Despite the fact that I think he was
definitely getting frustrated with what was going on under the basket. But he
hung in there. It was a team win for us. You have to give Rutgers credit. They
wouldn't go away at the end.  
  
Q. It looked like a couple of times Lance took over and got a couple of
three-point plays and didn't make the free throw at the end. Can you talk
about that (inaudible) -- no turnovers.  
COACH MICK CRONIN: That's the biggest part. For our whole team. Only eight
turnovers. Can't rebound a turnover. We're pretty good if we can get it on the
rim. He was able to get the ball to the basket in the second half. We had had
a big steal in the press coming out of the time-out. And when we get defensive
stops, we can get in transition. Obviously a lot of our guys are at their
best, lance in particular. He gets a chance to get the ball to the basket.  
But they did a good job in the first half. I'm sure he would be the first to
tell you. He was trying to get it at the rim in the first half. Rutgers did a
great job of battling him up. The game loosened up in the second half for a
stretch there and he was able to get the ball to the rim. He's as good as
anybody when he gets a chance to get in the lane and get fouled and get and-
ones. He's as good as anyone in finishing them.  
  
Q. This is not the first time you've played at The Garden. Was it any
different because it was the BIG EAST Tournament? Some jitters there?  
LANCE STEPHENSON: It was, that was difference. This is the best conference in
college basketball. I wanted to get everybody ready in the gym and work hard
and get prepared for this game so we can win.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the play you made at the end to get fouled?  
LANCE STEPHENSON: I learned from the beginning of the season against Xavier
not to settle for the jumpshot. So I went to the hole like I did at UConn, and
tried to get the basket or a foul.  
  
Q. Lance, can you talk about what's going through your mind before you took
the first foul shot? You walked away from the line and thought about it a
little bit. Obviously the last time you were here at St. John's it was a rough
ending. Does this sort of make up for that?  
LANCE STEPHENSON: I don't think it makes up for it. I just wanted to play hard
and win the game. That's all I wanted to do is win the game. I knew I was
going to make the first free throw. I had confidence in myself. So I just
wanted to make the first one, so I could miss the second one and make it a
tough shot for them.  
  
Q. Lance, -- obviously you played here a number of times. Growing up in New
York, is this what you dream of being able to hit, I guess it's different,
this free throw. Being able to hit a big shot in a big game in Madison Square
Garden in the big stage?  
LANCE STEPHENSON: Big time. That's why I came to Cincinnati to change the
program around, play hard and just win games.  
  
Q. A big three-point shot at end. 5 points in a row. Did you know you were
going to start tonight?  
JAQUON PARKER: Actually, I didn't know I was starting. It was like, "You're
starting." I had my mind ready the whole time. Just came by and tried to play
good.  
  
Q. Can you talk about playing this 9 o'clock game or 9:30 game, what it's
like having all day long to think about it.  
COACH MICK CRONIN: We'll take it. Our guys had no interest in the noon game.
We had a great win earlier in the season against Vanderbilt because I told the
guys the night before the game, "If you lose the first game in Maui, we were
going to have to play the second game at 8:30 in the morning." Vandy had no
chance at that point.  
It's no problem for us. Sleep in and gives us time to prepare. Especially now
with tomorrow night. We'll play at midnight if we keep winning.  
  
Q. You guys have lost some tough games like this a lot this year. How does
it feel to finally win one in this situation?  
YANCY GATES: It feels real good. Like a monkey off your back. We talk about as
a team how we have to quit losing these games. The close ones that come down
the stretch and get one in the BIG EAST Tournament for our first win.  
  
Q. Coach, can you address how you go forward (inaudible).  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Not a whole lot, because with Dion sprained his ankle
yesterday. He got kicked. Yancy is a pretty big guy. He kicked him on
accident. Hopefully Dion will get loose. He was going to try to play tonight.
Because he didn't practice I didn't want to put him in a bad situation. We
have to make up for the rebounding and the defense. Offensively, I don't think
there's -- we may be better. Especially when Jaquon plays the way he did
tonight. The thing about Jaquon, you can play Deonta on the other team's point
and Jaquon can guard anybody. In high school he guarded 6'7" All Americans and
shut them down to win a state championship. I have a lot of confidence in
Jaquon. And the things he brings to the table. A lot of the similar things
that we would miss with Rashad.  
  
Q. What did Rutgers do in the first half that kind of let them stick with
you?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: They made shots. 6 for 11 from three. They made shots. And,
you know, we let Mike Rosario get too many open looks. James Beatty hit a
couple in the first half as well. We knew Rosario and Mitchell were capable.
But I thought we could have had a chance to have 40 or more at halftime.  
But they made shots. We didn't finish around the rim. Yancy and I talked about
the BIG EAST Tournament. They let you play. You're going to have to deal with
it. So I'm glad we were able to get a win, and adjust to the way the game is
going to be officiated around the rim. So you have to make sure you get the
ball in the basket. You can't look to draw fouls. Unless you get hit on the
arm, you're not going to get one. Forcing him to get the one and he can adjust
forward.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little about tomorrow night against Louisville, the first
game seemed like they were jumping on them early.  
COACH MICK CRONIN: It's been a while. A lot of stuff has happened since then.
We have had so much heartbreak this year that you know, you try to think back
to that. I stayed focus on Rutgers. One thing about Louisville, they have
great resiliency. Coach Pitino does a great job with his teams of -- they
continue to play. Rough loss at St. John's, turn around and win at Syracuse.
Rough loss at Marquette, turn around and beat Syracuse again. They're going to
play the whole 40 minutes. And that's going to be our challenge tomorrow.
Making sure we're able to play the whole 40 minutes.  
Obviously we're pretty familiar with their style of play. So there won't be a
whole lot of secrets when my team plays Coach P's team between us. Not a whole
lot of secrets. You have to execute and rebound and take care of the
basketball. Last time we played them we only shot four free throws. Most of
that was our fault. We didn't get the ball at the basket a whole lot. You get
frustrated as a coach. Then you review the film, and you are to blame because
you didn't get the ball to the basket a lot. They did a good job adjusting
defensively. They do a lot of things with their zone changing up. We're going
to have make sure we handle the things they throw at us.  
  
Q. You guys have won a game, take the burden off?  
YANCY GATES: Oh, yeah, you come into the game so focused on trying to get that
first win. You probably come out a little more hyper or anxious until you get
the win. When you finally do get the win, you kind of relax more and just get
ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Cincinnati, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2010

  

### [Jim Calhoun](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13682)

### [Gavin Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20568)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

St. John's - 73  
Connecticut - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Jim Calhoun. We also have Gavin Edwards and Kemba Walker.  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: Most importantly, give congratulations to St. John's. They
come out here with purpose, physicality and quite frankly handed us our butts.
They knocked us off all screens. They completely outplayed us. They were much
hungrier than we were. We turned the ball over 20 times. We've been shooting
80% the past five games from the foul line; today 6 for 18. Quite frankly just
got handled by a St. John's team who played very hungry. And played once,
again as I said, with purpose. I was not at the game in Connecticut, but
certainly they've improved greatly with all duties, except for (Anthony)
Mason, who is a good player, but wasn't a great factor.  
They certainly have a bright future ahead of them. Juniors and seniors they'll
be one of the better teams I think in the BIG EAST. Certainly top five or six
next year. Today the team I saw today from St. John's was terrific. The team I
saw from Connecticut today was not very good at all.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Jim, how do you explain Jerome's play these last three games or so?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: He hasn't played well. He's played very poorly. If I could
explain it, I would try to do something about it. He's played very poorly.  
  
Q. Coach, especially the second half, you were sitting down a lot, pretty
calm. Do you feel like after a while the players come back and --  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: No, I try to be a different kind of coach different games
with this team. When this team has been here -- last time we were here we got
beat on a Wall lay-up with 40-something seconds to go against Kentucky. I
thought the season was going to turn out the way it ended today.  
To answer the question, no, I never felt helpless. Just some of it was an
aberration, I guess, maybe of St. John's. Some of it was maybe just
disappointment with the way we performed and were handled physically, so easy.
They hit set screens and they were wide open. They are not known as a three-
point shooting team; they go 7 for 13 today.  
My theory on that always is when you can do what you want, your confidence
increases and you make shots, and I've seen a lot of teams do that. We've had
teams that have done that themselves. Clearly it was not the kind of
performance that we would like to have had. I know if I was yelling and
screaming and sitting -- they had eight dunks that they had in the lane. I'm
not sure how many of those would have been blocked if I would have been
jumping and yelling.  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for the players?  
  
Q. Gavin, can you put a finger on why at different points of the season the
team seemed to show such progress followed by setback?  
GAVIN EDWARDS: I don't think there's any way we can explain it. If we could
have explained it, we would have fixed it. We wouldn't have had so many ups
and downs this season. So I mean, just sporadic. We don't really play the way
we should all the time, and it really shows.  
  
Q. Coach, I have a question for you: Your son was quoted earlier today
saying in response to a story on SNY that he expects you to coach several
years. What are your thoughts?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: I'm really worried about how we played today. I have had no
thoughts about anything except hopefully getting to the game against Marquette
tomorrow. And then I always at the end of every season I feel healthy, thank
God, I feel like -- not today, I guess. But I feel like I'm capable of
coaching. Never entered my mind. I was made aware of the story. And it had
nothing to do with anything and was not based upon any substantive fact.  
As a matter of fact, the two comments, I talked to two people, one I haven't
talked to in a year and the other I haven't talked about that situation and my
future in maybe eight months. Between the two of them, that's an average of
ten months I have not talked to either of those people about my own personal
situation.  
Like everything else, I'm in the business of trying to recruit players to
UConn. I love the school. And I still love coaching. But right now it is
erroneous. It couldn't be farther -- when I saw or heard a couple of the facts
about me talking to certain people, who I have not had a word with, it was
unfortunate, I haven't had a word with one for one year and the other for
eight months about the situation. And yes, there is a contract offer out
there. I haven't seen the final copy. But it's out there, yes.  
  
Q. The next couple of days what is going to happen (inaudible).  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: We won't practice for a couple of days at least. Then I
don't know if we will practice or not. I think it's a good time to reflect
where we are today and how we ended up today. This is certainly not typical.
We've been beaten before and ended seasons on some sour notes and some great
notes. But I think it's a good time to maybe sit back. I've always had great
respect. The only thing we can hope for is an NIT berth, obviously. I have
great respect for that. I never thought about turning it down.  
I think it's a good time to sit down with myself and my staff and think about
what we want to do going forward. Particularly after today. I think maybe it's
a good time to sit down, you know, and -- it's a good time to sit down and
think about closing the curtain for this year or continuing on, if we have
that opportunity. But there are sometimes maybe for everybody -- I've always
said continue. Kemba is one of my favorite players. Gavin is one of my
favorite players. Both of them two of my favorite people. I really like this
group. It's been the strangest year of basketball how we've performed various
times. How could you think that two weeks ago we were in the midst of beating
Villanova at Villanova, coming back and beating Rutgers by 18, and then going
and beating West Virginia and then losing four straight. We haven't looked
very great at times during those four straight losses by the way.  
As brilliant as we looked to win those three games in a row. We looked as bad
losing those games. Not to Louisville. Louisville was a two-point game. A
couple of these games we have not looked great at all.  
  
Q. Coach, if you get invited to the NIT, will you definitely go?  
COACH JIM CALHOUN: I'm going to sit down, and the best thing for me to do and
my staff to do is to kind of contemplate. I guess I have to talk to the
athletic director and I'll talk to him. Obviously he makes the final judgment.
He runs the athletic department. So obviously I have to confer with him.  
But I have great respect for the NIT. Always have. We were fortunate enough in
'88 to get our program going with a great NIT win. It's always a good time to
make sure you look at your team, see what they have. Eight games by four
points under, we lost all of them. And took an awful lot out of the team. I
want to make sure if there's a step back on the court to play basketball game
that they would be able to bring emotion, energy and all the things you should
bring to competition.  
And so once again, I'm not vacillating. I'm saying quite frankly -- it would
be awful for me personally if I made that decision because I have great
respect to keep playing. I always think you should keep playing. Right around
the corner something good is going to happen. It's a coach's dream. No way I
felt we would lose today. I know in a couple of days if we laced them up
again, there's no way I would ever think we would lose again. It's what keeps
us going at times.  
THE MODERATOR: UConn, thank you.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2010

  

### [Malik Boothe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19362)

### [Sean Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19363)

### [Paris Horne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19413)

### [Norm Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16973)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

St. John's - 73  
Connecticut - 51

  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: I thought it was a really hard, physical game. I thought
our guys did a great job of, you know, battling on the glass and being
physical, and then we made plays. Our guys made plays all day. We got it from
different guys. That's pretty much how our team has been all year. I thought
(Justin) Brownlee gave us a great lift. Sean Evans was awesome today. He did a
great job on the glass and finishing plays and even though D.J. didn't have it
going, he made some huge plays at the end. Paris, too, made huge, huge plays.
Malik (Boothe) was as tough as anybody on the floor. He leads us in that area.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please?  
  
Q. Malik, there's been a lot of frustrating stuff in the season. Does
winning a game like this help remove some of the frustrations you felt this
year?  
MALIK BOOTHE: I don't know if it removes the frustration. I know it was a good
win today. We also can't celebrate on this win. Last year we were in the same
position going against the same team in the next round, and they pretty much
had their way with us. We have to have the same focus tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sean, was there a sense of urgency about this game? Was there a feeling,
we better win this game and go all out?  
SEAN EVANS: I don't think as far as that goes, that's why we played hard.
Coach always tells us, Don't worry about things like that. We can only do what
we can control. We can control the outcome of the game. We executed, played
hard and came out to win.  
That's what we came in the game to do and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Sean or Paris, there was a lot of like building some pride and playing
for it after the ballgame, do you think there's been some carry-over into this
one, the idea of playing with pride?  
PARIS HORNE: Definitely we knew the ballgame was tough. We stuck with it and
it felt good to win. And we knew we had to carry that game over into this
game. And we just keep our confidence and keep playing together.  
SEAN EVANS: I think we took a lot out of the ballgame. Showed a lot of
toughness and togetherness to be down that many points and come back winning a
tough game. Shows a lot about our team and our character and our leaders. I
think that carried over. Like Paris said, we came out and executed and we
built off that momentum.  
  
Q. Do you feel like the second-effort plays helped in the game today, the
offensive rebounds and forcing turnovers?  
MALIK BOOTHE: I think the second-effort plays, second- and third-effort plays,
those sometimes come down to winning a game. And I think we did that more than
they did tonight. And we got the win.  
  
Q. Did you expect the physicality?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: I don't think anybody can expect that. UConn's teams are
great and physical. I thought our guys did a great job of getting after them.
And they got after us. I think Malik was exactly right; we always talk about
first, second and third-effort plays. And you know, they came out in the
second half and kind of punched us. And then we fought back.  
And I thought a huge energy play was we had a breakaway dunk. D.J. lost
control of the ball and Paris jumps headfirst to get the ball and call time-
out. Those are the plays you have to make to win championships.  
  
Q. Was there any point in the second half where you feel like there was a
play that really took it out of Connecticut? Maybe took the wind out of their
sails or any of their players?  
SEAN EVANS: Like Coach said, when Paris dove for the ball, that set the tone.
We're going to play hard to the last minute. Paris could have gave up on that
play, instead he dove on the ball and put his body on the line. That set a
tone. I think that told UConn we're here to play.  
  
Q. How meaningful is it for you to have a game like this, on a stage like
this today?  
SEAN EVANS: It was good because I've been struggling the past couple of games.
I've been in a slump. My coach keeps telling me, they need me in order to win
games and go far this year. I think this is big for myself, personally,
because I haven't been playing good. I think this is big and I'm going to
build off this and continue to play well.  
  
Q. You mentioned the toughness you showed in the fall. A game like this, how
much of it comes down to mental toughness to close one out?  
SEAN EVANS: It's a lot about mental toughness. We played -- we can play in the
first half with any team in the country. We play good the first half. We don't
usually keep that momentum in the second half. It was big for us to come out
in the second half, keep fighting, keep punching and coming out with the win.
I think we did a good job today.  
  
Q. Congratulations. What's the biggest difference in the way they played
today and the way they've been playing all season?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: I think my guys -- I don't think there's any team that
plays harder than my team. My guys play hard every day. But I also think what
they're doing right now is they're playing not only hard but they're playing
with their hearts. And they want to show improvement, which they have. Maybe
it hasn't shown in the wins and losses. Our team has totally improved. And our
program has really grown and it has a lot to do with these guys.  
I talk about this all the time with our guys. We're trying to teach them how
to win. Like Marquette is a very good team. They had (Jerel) McNeal and those
guys from last year that taught (Maurice) Acker and (Lazar) Hayward and those
guys how to win. These guys we've had to teach them how to do it, because when
we first got here there was nobody here to show them.  
And they're doing that and they're growing from it. That's what you're seeing,
I think.  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: It's all on the line. We had to play through it. Play
through it. Normally I sit them there for a while, and I said "forget it." You
just have to play through this. I thought Omari Lawrence and Malik Stith and
the guys off the bench did a great job. When they were in the game, they gave
us no pauses each time.  
  
Q. Coach, you took away pretty much their drive to the basket. That's the
thing that kind of made them successful this year. You took that away. Was
that the target?  
COACH NORM ROBERTS: Yeah, you have to try to keep Kemba Walker out of the lane
and (Jerome) Dyson. They're two of the best in the country in getting in the
lane and finishing plays. I thought our big guys and our guards did a great
job in guarding the ball screens and keeping them out of the lane for the most
part.  
  
Q. You have had some good wins here on this floor, but this was arguably the
best game you guys have played here. Is it rewarding to finally have a game
like this on this floor?  
MALIK BOOTHE: I think this game is sort similar of to the Louisville game we
had earlier. I think it is a good win. Like I said earlier, we can't
celebrate. We have to come back and play the same way tomorrow. If not the
same way, harder.  
THE MODERATOR: St. John's, thank you.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  
COMMISSIONER JOHN MARINATTO: Let me get right to presenting the major awards
and read the citations for those who have earned them. Beginning with the 2010
BIG EAST Conference Scholar of the Year Award. An academic All-American
selection and one of the nation's most prolific three-point shooters. He
enters the BIG EAST Conference Championship as the nation's fourth-leading
three-point shooter. He has connected on 44.9% of his team's three-point
attempts and is the second leading scorer on the team averaging 17.2 points
per game. A finance major who holds a 3.72 grade point average, he is one of
five players nationally who was named to the ESPN Magazine Academic All
America First Team.  
Tim will graduate in May after completing a rigorous four-year undergraduate
business program in just three years. He has been accepted to Notre Dame's
accelerated MBA program, which allows candidates with undergraduate business
degrees the opportunity to complete an 11-month program that traditionally
takes two years. He'll be one of the youngest students to ever enroll in that
program, and is one of just a handful of students to join the program
immediately after his undergraduate studies. A junior from Unionville,
Connecticut, it's my distinct pleasure to present the 2010 BIG EAST Conference
Men's Basketball Student-Athlete of the Year Award, which is accompanied by a
$2,000 postgraduate scholarship to Tim Abromatis of Notre Dame.  
TIM ABROMATIS: I would just like to thank the BIG EAST for awarding me this
honor. You know, it's a really great honor for me. It's something I've worked
hard for. And you know, I credit my parents with giving me the work ethic that
I have today; my parents and my brother who were able to make it today. I also
would like to thank Coach (Mike) Brey and the coaching staff and everyone who
has helped me with the basketball side to get me in position to get this
award, as well as the people on that academic side, Pat Holmes and everybody
at Notre Dame and whoever has helped me to get here. This is a great honor for
me. Thank you very much.  
COMMISSIONER JOHN MARINATTO: Congratulations, Tim. A credit to the Notre Dame
basketball program and the university as well as the BIG EAST.  
Our second award tonight is the BIG EAST Conference Rookie of the Year Award.
A native of Brooklyn, New York, he led all freshmen in the league with a 12.0
scoring average. He was very productive late in the regular season by
averaging 16.8 points and 8.3 rebounds in his team's last four games. He
scored a collegiate high 23 points in Cincinnati's regular-season finale at
Georgetown, and is the first ever student-athlete at Cincinnati to win an
individual award. It's my distinct pleasure to present the 2010 BIG EAST
Conference Rookie of the Year Award to guard Lance Stephenson from the
University of Cincinnati.  
LANCE STEPHENSON: First off, I would like to thank the BIG EAST for giving me
this award. I want to thank my family, my teammates, my coach. Without them I
don't think I would be the player that I am now. I'm just happy I got this
award. That's about it.  
COMMISSIONER JOHN MARINATTO: Before I introduce or read the citation for the
BIG EAST Conference 2010 Coach of the Year award, I would like to introduce
John McDonough from Oppenheimer Funds. The president and director of retail
sales of Oppenheimer Fund Distributors. John, a few words before I read the
citation.  
JOHN McDONOUGH: Thank you very much, John. Good evening, everyone. An honor to
be here with Commissioner Marinatto this evening recognizing the 2010
recipient of the Oppenheimer Funds BIG EAST Coach of the Year Award. When they
first partnered together in 2005 we became the conference's official mutual
funds. Since then our relationship with the BIG EAST has evolved to include
our title sponsorship of the Oppenheimer Funds BIG EAST Coach of the Year
Award for men's basketball.  
Oppenheimer Funds' collaboration with the BIG EAST is particularly meaningful
to our company and to me, because it affords us the opportunity to partner
with an organization that, like Oppenheimer Funds, is committed to achievement
and fostering talent and excellence.  
Also, similar to the BIG EAST, Oppenheimer Funds recognizes and applauds the
critical role that great coaches play helping others achieve goals whether
those goals are financial or athletic.  
So in closing, I would like to thank the BIG EAST Conference and Commissioner
Marianatto for inviting me to participate in tonight's events. I would like to
congratulate all of tonight's reward recipients and finally I want to wish all
the coaches and players the best of luck in the tournament.  
COMMISSIONER JOHN MARINATTO: Now I would like to read the citation for the BIG
EAST Conference Oppenheimer Funds Coach of the Year award.  
He directed Syracuse to an outright BIG EAST Conference regular season crown
after being selected sixth in the pre-season coaches' poll. He is a member of
the Naismith Basketball Memorial Hall of Fame and in his 34th season as head
coach of the Syracuse Orange. The dean of BIG EAST Conference Coaches, Jim
owns a career record of 827-291. This is the third time that he has been
chosen by his peers as the BIG EAST Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the
Year. It's my distinct pleasure to present to you the 2010 Oppenheimer Funds
BIG EAST Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year, Jim Boeheim from
Syracuse University.  
COACH JIM BOEHEIM: I would like to thank Oppenheimer. Thanks, John. This is
the result of you know, we were picked sixth because nobody believed me when I
told them Wesley Johnson was pretty good. If you had believed me, then I
wouldn't be up here. Teach you a lesson.  
Our players and staff have worked so hard this year. You know, what these kids
have done this year has surprised me as much as anybody. They've just been
tremendous the way they've played together and looked out for each other has
been you know their best regular season we've ever had at Syracuse. And we've
had a few pretty good ones. But this team has been spectacular. It's been fun
coaching them. And I look forward to the tournament here and the rest of the
year. Again, thank you. Appreciate it.  
COMMISSIONER JOHN MARINATTO: Finally, the last award of the evening is the BIG
EAST Conference Player of the Year Award. A 6'7" junior who sat out last
season after transferring to Syracuse. He averaged 15.7 points per game and
8.5 rebounds per game this year. Both team highs. He is second on the club in
blocks and steals and shot 48.7% from the floor, 38.1% from three-point range
and 78.6% from the foul line. He is the first transfer from a four-year school
to earn the BIG EAST Conference Player of the Year Award and the first from
Syracuse to win since Hakim Warrick. A native of Corsicana, Texas, it's my
distinct pleasure to introduce to you Wes Johnson, the 2010 BIG EAST
Conference Player of the Year.  
WESLEY JOHNSON: Excuse the way I'm dressed. We were kind of delayed. It's an
honor to receive this award with all the great players in this conference. I
want to thank Coach Boeheim for giving me the opportunity to play at Syracuse.
I want to thank the coaching staff especially Coach (Rob) Murphy for working
with me day in and day out to enhance my skill level.  
It wouldn't be possible without my teammates. We have a team full of MVPs not
just me. So a piece of this trophy goes out to all of them. I want to thank
all of our coaching community for voting for me. Thank you. I appreciate it.  
COMMISSIONER JOHN MARINATTO: Thanks, everyone. Our winners are going to be
available over here for a few minutes if you want to try to grab a word with
them. Thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: The first coach up this morning is Illinois head coach Bruce
Weber.  
Coach, if you would like to go ahead with an opening statement, then we'll go
to questions.  
COACH WEBER: There's no doubt we're excited about our team. We have, as he
mentioned, quite a few veterans: seven different players that started last
year, four seniors.  
Kind of unusual in this time and this age of college basketball to have that
many seniors and quality seniors led by Demetri McCamey, our point guard. And
we also have a group of talented freshmen, including McDonald's All-American
player Jereme Richmond from Waukegan, Illinois, and our Mr. Basketball in our
state.  
So a good mixture of old and young. Also I think just meeting with the coaches
last night, very excited about the Big Ten as a whole.  
Numerous teams in the top 25. Just I think great depth as a league. And,
again, besides our seniors, you've got a lot of seniors throughout the
conference which should lead to one of the most competitive conference races
in many years.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. What are your thoughts on the July evaluation period? There's been some
talk about maybe eliminating that or adjusting that. What are your thoughts on
what you would like to see done there?  
COACH WEBER: Well, I think obviously there's some flaws with the way it is.
I'm not sure right now which way to go that we had some discussion as coaches
last night.  
The shortened period, change it, tweak it, there's some different options. But
I know it will be a hot topic over the next year and to see what happens with
it.  
There's good and bad of it. The good, obviously you get to see a lot of kids
at one time. The bad, I think sometimes the kids too much basketball, too much
travel, you know, it's hard on the coaches, hard on the players in a tough
period.  
So it will be interesting. I've been doing it for 30 some years. And I've been
out every summer. If it would change, it would sure be a big change for
coaches, I know that.  
  
Q. You were talking about your seniors a second ago. I wonder, can you talk
a little bit about the recruiting class you were able to put together. Seems
like there were a lot of freshmen in this recruiting class across the
conference that had a big impact this year. Could you talk a little bit about
that too?  
COACH WEBER: We have three freshmen and a redshirt freshman, and I mentioned
Jereme Richmond had a great year at Waukegan High School, led them to two
different Final Fours in our state, Mr. Basketball, U.S.A. Basketball,
McDonald's, the whole gamut throughout his career. Wanted to commit to us as
an eighth grader. We didn't take the commitment until he was a ninth grader.
We've had a close association with him. But he gives us a lot of versatility.
Can go inside, can go outside.  
Our next young man is one of our former player's brother, Luther Head's
brother Crandall Head. Very, very athletic. Almost a clone of Luther. It's
just amazing the body movements, the athleticism, the way he plays. He
suffered an ACL a year ago, sat out the whole season. So he's kind of
recovering from that. But I think he's a little further along than we thought.
Gives us great energy.  
Then Meyers Leonard, I think, may be the surprise kid out of Robinson,
Illinois. Seven foot. Two and a half, three years ago he was 6'5". And just
continued to grow. He's got great athleticism. Just trying to figure out how
to play and how to be a seven-footer. I think that's the biggest thing. But a
big upside for us.  
When you mix that with our seniors and a good talented group of sophomores, I
think they get forgotten. D.J. Richardson was Freshman of the Year, Brandon
Paul played major minutes, Tyler Griffey. And then I mentioned the other
sophomore that's a redshirt, who redshirted last year, Joseph Bertrand.  
We have good athletes, good mixture of players.  
  
Q. So you were talking about all of the freshmen and have a lot of seniors,
too. How are they all meshing together, especially there's no juniors, there's
no kind of in-between ages?  
COACH WEBER: One thing we talked about since the beginning was make sure the
seniors took control of the team in a positive way, but made sure this is what
we do here, this is how we do it, make sure the younger guys understand that,
from when they arrived last summer, whether it was weight training or going to
class to taking care of business off the court.  
So I think they've done a great job with that. We've really emphasized to all
of them to be good teammates. I think we have good talent. There's no doubt.
But are we going to be a good team? And are we going to be good teammates? And
it's whether it's the freshmen or seniors, the seniors have to be good
teammates, the freshmen have to be good teammates and understand that they
have to earn their way into the mix.  
But so far it's been good. I actually -- we have a lot of competition in
practice. We've had little scuffles in practice, I think just going hard,
competing. So that's very positive. And we haven't had that the last couple of
years.  
  
Q. You talked a lot last year about leadership, especially with Demetri
McCamey and how he was kind of taken to that. How do you see him dealing with
that specifically and do you see the senior class being better at the
leadership role than they did a year ago?  
COACH WEBER: I think when you lose somebody -- we lost Chester Frazier and
Trent Meacham, guys that were leaders. You appreciate it. They do it quietly.
And this group of seniors is a talented group, from Tisdale to Davis, to Billy
Cole to McCamey.  
But there's more to it than just having talent. And you have to do the
intangibles, the leadership, the competitiveness, the keeping guys, the
chemistry part. And Demetri has made huge strides with it since he arrived. I
think last year was a learning experience for him, a total different role. And
I think all of them as a group, I'm not sure anyone is real vocal, but as a
group they've done a good job of this is their team leading the young guys,
keeping the -- having a positive attitude as a whole group and a competitive
attitude.  
So it's been good so far. We'll see -- leadership is always tested when things
go bad or you have a tough game or a tough loss. And that will be the key to
our success, how we deal with the ups and downs. And that can be said of any
team.  
  
Q. As long as you've been around you've seen a lot of good big men. Can you
just evaluate what you've seen in JaJuan Johnson's progress during his time at
Purdue?  
COACH WEBER: I think he's a lot like our guys. He's the type of college
athlete that you want that you watch him come in as a skinny young man that
has to develop. He put the time in the weight room. He started getting a
little bit of confidence, more minutes feeling good about himself, and just
has continued to make progress throughout his four years. And in this day and
age, so many guys, you know, if you're not one and done or two and done, can
you be a player?  
And he's a player. There's no doubt. He put his name in last year. I talked to
Matt a lot about it. We had a lot of conversation, whether our guys or his.
And I think it was a good experience for him because he found out what he
needed. And now he had a good summer. U.S.A. Basketball continued to make
steps. So he gives them the length, the athleticism, plus he can shoot the
basketball.  
So it's tough to guard him. You put a real big guy on him, he steps out. You
put some of those smaller, he'll post you up.  
So just a very good player who has developed over the four years.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next up on the podium is Minnesota head coach Tubby Smith.  
We'll start with an opening statement and then go to questions.  
COACH SMITH: It's good to be here today. This time last year my father had
passed away and I didn't make the Big Ten Media Day. But it's been a fun
finish to a very tough season last year.  
And we're renewed, I think, with so many returning players. We're really
excited about this coming season. We believe we have a chance to be very
competitive. And we're looking forward to it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the addition of Trevor Mbakwe and what you think he's
going to add to your team this season?  
COACH SMITH: We think that Trevor, he went through a tough situation having to
sit out last year because of legal problems and being suspended. So he's a kid
that left Marquette after injuring his knee and went to junior college, Miami
Dade Junior College, and had an outstanding year. We recruited him because we
knew he could bring that type of athleticism, a lot of maturity and experience
to our program.  
And certainly he's proven that in the preseason, and on the Canadian trip that
we took back in the first of September. He's really a guy that's going to give
us some depth and some size, some physical presence inside to go along with
Colton Iverson and Ralph Sampson on the front line.  
He's been doing everything we've asked him to do. Playing extremely well in
practice. He's in great physical shape and mentally in good shape, especially
coming off of last year.  
I love that he stuck with us. And because of the adversity he went through
it's made him a stronger person and a better person.  
  
Q. You mentioned taking a trip to Canada. I just wonder what you got out of
that as a team and how you think that might help you this year?  
COACH SMITH: Well, number one, it was a nice, fun trip. We didn't go far going
to Vancouver, Canada, a beautiful place, and to Victoria.  
A learning experience for -- a good learning experience for all of our
players, coaches. I thought getting the ten practices in this summer, I've
never really taken a team on a foreign tour but I can see how beneficial it
can be.  
Guys in that type of scenario and that type of setting, where we're not really
competing for playing time. We're just having fun. We're bonding. So I think
that the sooner you can get started, that's one of the things we've talked
about having access to our players in the summer as coaches.  
I think that helps us nurture them, learn more about them, especially the
incoming players, because this was the first year that the NCAA allowed
players that had gone to summer school, freshmen, to go along.  
So we had five freshmen along with us, along with Trevor Mbakwe, and the seven
returning players. So it was a full team, and I thought guys again learned a
lot about themselves. It was a great experience for them and helped us as a
coaching staff recognize where some of the weaknesses are and some of the
strengths that we have on our team, the things that we have to come back and
work on.  
I think that's helped us, and I think it will help us as we go into start the
season.  
  
Q. You spoke about weaknesses that you saw on the trip in Canada. What were
those weaknesses that you saw?  
COACH SMITH: The weaknesses that we saw, one of the things that we recognized
is that I thought getting better strength-wise, and just when you ask that
question -- because I'm always the optimist. I think everything was better
than it was the year before.  
So if we had a weakness, I thought it was just communicating. Again, the teams
that really communicate together, talk defensively, but it was early on. And
we played against some very tough teams.  
I thought the University of British Columbia, Vancouver University, Victoria,
those teams were -- they were very physical and very mature guys we played
against.  
So I saw that we needed to be a little more -- we had to be more aggressive.
But I liked the way our kids responded. We came away with three wins and we
did respond the right way.  
But I thought that was one of the weaknesses that we needed to work on
communicating better.  
  
Q. Question about kind of the makeup of your team, you lose so many good
veteran players off that team, Westbrook, you have Hoffarber back. Are you
just concerned with the direction and production, where it's going to come
from this year?  
COACH SMITH: Absolutely, you're always concerned about that. But I thought
that was one of our strengths. I've been so impressed with our freshmen and
our incoming players. And having a player like Trevor Mbakwe, you don't really
appreciate him until you see him on the court with your team, playing, knowing
he's out there. And I saw that.  
You're right, when you lose a guy like Damian Johnson, Lawrence Westbrook,
Paul Carter, Devron Bostick, they were all veteran senior players that had
gone through the wars here in the Big Ten.  
But we do have quite a few guys that have tasted success by going to the Big
Ten championship game and really getting pounded by Ohio State.  
But they understand now we want to do better and we want to get better. I
think guys like Blake Hoffarber and Al Nolen, Devoe Joseph, Ralph Sampson,
Colton Iverson, again, Rodney Williams, they know what it takes, and they're
the nucleus of our team that have to carry us.  
I hope I answered your question. I'm not sure if I did or not.  
  
Q. Everybody talks about how good the Big Ten's going to be this year. What
are two or three things you look at and say these are reasons the league's
really good this year?  
COACH SMITH: Well, first thing the reason the Big Ten is so much better, which
it wasn't bad to start with, I don't know -- it's just the best. Let's put it
that way. We've been one of the best since I've been here. This year we're by
far the best conference in the country, because we have so many returning
players.  
Evan Turner being the only player drafted in the top I guess 20 or 30 in the
league, but guys like Kalin Lucas, E'Twaun Moore, JaJuan Johnson. And we
probably lost one of the best players in the country in Robbie Hummel, and
certainly our heart goes out to him. But I think that's the number one reason
that we have so many returning players.  
The other thing is that with Michigan State going all the way to the Final
Four, and having a three-way tie at the top the way we did, I think those
teams that were there, Purdue and Ohio State, felt like, hey, we can be a
Final Four team as well. That's the third thing.  
And I think it gives a team like us, a program like us who had a chance to get
a victory against all those top teams at some point in time last year, gives
us hope that we can be a top team.  
And I think media as well as other basketball people recognize and sports
people recognize that the league is well positioned because of the Big Ten
Network and other things and because recruiting has gone so well in this
league. I think all those things we benefit by bringing in outstanding -- I
know we have -- we've attracted some very good players.  
Those are the reasons why we will be competing for a national championship at
the end of the year, and maybe multiple teams in the Final Four.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wisconsin head Coach Bo Ryan.  
We'll start with an opening statement and then go to questions.  
COACH RYAN: It's certainly nice to be here. Anybody that drove yesterday to
arrive here in Chicago, it was quite an experience. They had to get one of the
bellhops to come out to my car when I arrived and they peeled my fingers off
one at a time from the steering wheel.  
I've never seen or experienced anything like that. There was a truck that went
up on all its wheels on the left side. Thank goodness it wasn't a unicycle
car. But it actually came up and tilted. It was about 100 yards in front of
me.  
So just to arrive here and be here to talk Big Ten basketball, I'm pretty
excited, as you can tell.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Asking a lot of coaches their opinions. July evaluation period, getting a
lot of conversation. What are your thoughts? What would you like to see be
done?  
COACH RYAN: Well, for me, some of the best players that have ended up that
I've coached I saw during the July period, because I've coached at every
different level. So you have to remember that the Big Ten's a part of the NCAA
basketball from one to 350, meaning there's 350 teams. I've experienced some
good luck in seeing kids in July. Maybe not as long as the period is now. But
I think some coaches, they can just snap their fingers and get whoever they
want. So they probably don't want to be out in July.  
I don't think you're ever going to eliminate third-party influences simply by
saying you're not going to have July recruiting. I think whoever had that idea
definitely hasn't been with us.  
Because you're always going to have elements in anything in life, any walk of
life, that's going to be a little bit seedier or not ethical.  
But I think in July, for us, to evaluate talent, we'd like to see them with
their high school teams a lot. We like to see them. Some of the better
players, as I mentioned, I got a chance to see when they weren't with their
high school programs and ended up doing things where -- a Dylan Page at UWM,
we had an assistant watch him play several times say he wasn't good enough. He
ends up -- I see him in an AAU game. We got him committed to UWM and he was
Player of the Year in the Horizon League.  
So there's stories both ways, I'm sure, but I like to stick with the
basketball part of it and what it means to be able to see young men play
rather than always talk about the negatives that might surround five kids.  
So I like July. I don't like it extended. Because towards the end of it, in
Orlando, for example, the basketball became very selfish, sluggish. Teams
weren't executing the same way. It's not because they were in Orlando, it was
a great tournament and all that, but the kids were just a little bit out of
sync. You always by that time have the parents who realize that their kid who
started the July period were going to be lottery picks; that by the time the
end of July came around, they were hoping to be picked up.  
And that gets to be a little frustrating. So I think shortening it is a pretty
good idea.  
  
Q. The question I have is you lose Bohannon, you lose Trevon Hughes, the
college game is so much a guard-oriented type game. Just talk about that
transition, playing without those guys who have helped you win so many games
the last four years.  
COACH RYAN: Well, you make a good point. You sure have to have them, guards.
And the fact that they accomplished what they did averaging 26 wins a year,
those two put in their time wisely. They were very diligent about learning to
play defense on the college level. That's the area right now. Jordan Taylor is
the one proven guard.  
The other guards have potential in some different areas, but for us, everybody
will look at where you have to replace points, you have to replace this. We
have to replace the defensive intensity with which those guards played. And
that's what I'm looking for now. That's not to say the bigs don't have to get
better.  
But I think that's the area of concern. But I think it's a good area in that
it's very competitive, there's some young men showing they're a little bit
better in some ways that maybe we didn't even see.  
We know there's potential, like with the freshmen or with a walk-on like a
Wquinton Smith. There's some things that they do well. Now we have to find out
what the end result of that can be and how long can they sustain it and what's
their learning curve and things like that.  
So we definitely need to pick up our guard play to replace the two young men
that you mentioned.  
  
Q. With that in mind, how has Rob Wilson done and Brust and Gasser and
Wquinton Smith? How have they been so far?  
COACH RYAN: Again, I'm sure a lot of coaches can tell you it depends on what
practice I can refer to or what intersquad game or what scrimmage or what set
of possessions at any given time.  
Josh is better than people realize. He's better than we even anticipated as a
freshman.  
Ben moves away from the ball even better than Jason Bohannon did coming in, as
far as knowing how to get open, how to read things, things like that. I'm not
saying he's a Jason Bohannon. But there's strengths in each one of these guys.  
Rob Wilson. He can attack. He's fearless going to the basket. He's wiry.  
But, again, with all three of those names I just mentioned, and then along
with Wquinton Smith, is the guys that are going to get the other minutes that
were vacated at the guard spot are going to be the better defensive players.  
So right now, when we do our breakdown defensive drills, some days we'll do a
little more possessions, 5 versus 5, other days it's more 3 versus 3 or 4
versus 4 with some defensive positioning drills.  
That's the area where we still see the weaknesses, because we were spoiled by
Jason and Trevon.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up next is Purdue head coach Matt Painter.  
We'll start with an opening statement and then go to questions.  
COACH PAINTER: Well, we are obviously very excited about this season. I think
we have two of the best players in the country in E'Twaun Moore and JaJuan
Johnson, both who have had great careers. Anytime you return experience but
also return experience of having success, that's even more important. A lot of
times guys will be happy that they have three or four seniors but they haven't
necessarily had a great deal of experience having that success, and our guys
have.  
So hopefully those guys will be good leaders like they have been in the past
and continue to grow. And I think both of those guys have made some
improvements this summer, improved their bodies and gotten better.  
But we have a tall task, I think, in our conference just because of the
quality of teams and the quality of coaches. I think we've got a chance to
have a special season this year from a conference standpoint. There's going to
be a lot of people banging heads and going after each other.  
But really excited to get ready and to get going with this year and really
like some of our new guys. But also a little anxious to watch them play in
some exhibition games and some non-conference games so we can figure some
things out and kind of get into a rotation before we get into conference play.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Can you explain how you're going to use your two point guards in Lewis
Jackson and Kelsey Barlow this year and how the roles might vary as time goes
on into conference play?  
COACH PAINTER: I would have bet a lot of money that would be the first
question. But I appreciate you having that be the first question. I think they
give us two different looks. Kelsey's obviously a guy that can play multiple
positions, and we've played him at the point guard. Lewis is a guy that's just
strictly a point guard, kind of the quintessential point guard at 5'7'' using
his quickness.  
Both of them we talk about them being defenders first like we do with all of
our players. And they're able to go and put pressure on the basketball. And so
I feel very comfortable that we can keep 40 minutes of pressure on somebody
else's point guard, 94 feet. And we put a lot of time into it.  
They put absolutely zero time into that in the summer. In the summer, you
shoot 3s and you work on your pull-up and your individual game and then you
come back to practice and then we start guarding the basketball.  
But I think both of those guys are really going to set the table for us
defensively. Kelsey's a guy at 6'5", 6'6", long. He's our second best shot
blocker on the team, outside of JaJuan.  
He gets in the passing lanes. He gets steals. He understands things. He just
makes athletic plays and he's got a chance to be a very good player in our
league.  
Lew is a natural leader. He's a guy that really brings it every single day and
gets after it. And that's what we're going to need. We have a quiet team. And
it's obviously not a good thing once you step on the floor, but Lew's not a
quiet guy and he gets us going and gets us charged up. But both of those guys
are going to be used in that point guard role.  
I can see Barlow slipping away and playing other positions to help us. So that
will be interesting.  
  
Q. I'll ask the Robbie Hummel question. Where were you when you heard the
news and what was sort of the initial response when you found out that he'd be
out for the year again?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, we were practicing and a lot of times sometimes people
make a big deal about the first day of practice.  
And we didn't have Midnight Madness because we're having construction, we're
having -- we're renovating our arena. So we didn't have Midnight Madness so we
were able to practice for two hours the night before. We used our two hours
during the week on Wednesday and Thursday.  
So we practiced for one hour Wednesday, one hour Thursday, two hours Friday.
And Rob practiced that whole time. So a lot of people just think he got
cleared and he practiced ten minutes into his first practice. He did that. He
did individual work.  
And I was recruiting a lot obviously in September. And the early part of
October. But I probably watched him ten times do individual work before that.
And your only real experience, your only real reference point is the guys you
had before who have torn their ACL and come back. I've been around a couple of
guys, David Teague and Carl Landry, when they've come back and been cleared,
they look good but they're not the same guy. You know early on after they're
cleared they're not going to be the same guy to start with.  
You hope in four months, five months, six months, you know, depends on each
guy, that they become that player. Obviously David Teague was All-Conference
and Carl Landry having a successful NBA career. Both guys bounced back. That
was my reference point.  
When I saw Rob, that's the exact same thing I thought about those guys. Is it
the same guy? No, it's not the same guy. Is he kind of in that first stage
after being cleared and starting to do workouts and getting ready and going in
the right direction? Yes.  
I always have dialogue with guys on a daily basis when I watch them play: How
do you feel? Some guys will tell you -- David Teague would always tell you he
was fine when he wasn't. Carl Landry would always say everything was wrong
when it wasn't.  
And so Rob's a very cerebral guy. But this was his first time going through
something like that. And, you know, he's very mature, and he would just tell
you how he felt. And actually with Rob, his tendonitis in the other knee was
something he complained about. They took the tendon out of the other knee to
repair that knee. He was always saying: My other knee is on fire. What about
your torn ACL? No, it's fine, it's fine, it's coming. And a lot of people were
able to watch him.  
When he went out there and obviously he has his brace on, he was just in a
very simple start of the practice progression drill, 3-on-2 into 2-on-1 break,
and the ball just kind of came towards him and he jumped up to kind of half
block a shot. You know when you jump to block a shot, then you know you're not
going to get to it and you kind of hold? Well, that's what he did. And he
landed and there was no physical contact and it buckled.  
When you saw him tear his ACL at Minnesota, everybody in here that saw that,
you saw it get loose. And when you saw it get loose right away you say: Hey,
he tore his ACL. Everybody said that. It's very common.  
On this, he just jumped up, came down, and it buckled. But then right away
from his reaction you knew he tore his ACL, but not from what happened. At
Minnesota, from what happened, you could see that.  
So for us, we have some experience of going through this. It stinks. I compare
it to -- it's like Groundhog's Day for us. But we have been through this with
not having him or not having him at 100 percent. And we've been able to make
some adjustments. We've had some bumps in the road, and I think we've learned
from that.  
So hopefully it's made us stronger. It's better. And it's going to give us
some opportunities for some other guys.  
  
Q. How are freshmen Anthony Johnson and Terone Johnson and Travis Carroll
working in with the new guys really and what kind of roles do you see for them
going forward?  
COACH PAINTER: They've done a good job. They've worked very hard. Travis
Carroll has lost 20 pounds. So him staying up with the game is very, very
important.  
I always say: If you're not in shape to play major college basketball, you're
not improving; you're surviving.  
And you have to be in shape so you can make improvements. He's got himself in
shape. And he's learning on the fly. You're throwing a lot at guys early on.
Anthony Johnson is a guy I compared to David Teague. He can make baskets and
he can rebound his position. He's got some athleticism. He can move laterally.  
So to me that's very important. That means he can defend when you can move
laterally and you have athleticism. So just trying to get him to learn our
system and compete every single day, which he has.  
And then Terone Johnson gives us a guy with a big strong body that can make
plays, break people down, can score the ball, and can defend. And I think he's
got a chance to be very successful at Purdue.  
But I'll get excited when they do something, when the popcorn's turning.
They're freshmen. And right now we're just trying to get their feet wet a
little bit, get some experience, learn our system, and keep -- try to keep
them playing at a high level. But there's obviously going to be some
competition.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Sandi and how he's progressed and what you need from
him?  
COACH PAINTER: Sandi has had a good week of practice. He sprained his ankle
and was out for about a month. He's done a good job. He's done a very good
job. I've been pleasantly surprised in his production in practice.  
He's done a good job rebounding, a good job adapting. We haven't had a horse
like that, the 6'10", 260-pound guys. Sometimes how we flow offensively, he
breaks us down a little bit. So we've got to adjust to him more than anything
and give him some rules to help him feel comfortable in our offense. And then
defensively, as long as he can kind of plug that middle and allow JaJuan to
step out a little bit or replace JaJuan and give him a spell, it gives us that
true post.  
He does not have a high level of experience of playing, though. He's not a guy
that's been playing organized basketball since he was five years old. And that
concerns me. And we just -- we need to get him in there.  
That's what's been so important for him last year, if he wouldn't have broke
his foot, kind of getting in there, getting a little bit of experience and
getting himself ready for this season.  
But I've been pleasantly surprised with him coming off that injury, being that
productive. Not because he's been productive, but just it's hard when you sit
out a month when you haven't played and you're a new guy.  
  
Q. With Robbie out, how will you adjust your style of play?  
COACH PAINTER: We won't change anything, obviously, defensively. We'll do a
lot of the same things defensively. You know, he's a point forward. He's a guy
that you can use as a facilitator.  
He's a skilled guy. He can drive the basketball. He can do a lot of different
things. We'd obviously like to have a replica of Rob Hummel to sub in there.
It doesn't work quite that way.  
So we're trying -- your question there is kind of my question. And I want them
to give me the answer to that, just to say I can talk about each guy that
possibly could plug into that equation and to have options. But I really don't
have that answer.  
The guy that has stepped up in my opinion to this point is Patrick Bade. He's
lost a lot of weight and he's in better shape and he's been very productive.
He's done a very good job of rebounding for us so far in practice. That's
something that he was not consistent with last year in practices.  
And I don't really gauge guys on games when they play five to ten minutes.
It's not fair. But I do gauge them two and a half hours every day. And he's
done a very good job in practice of rebounding the basketball.  
But I think we have to do a better job. We've gotten beat at the end of the
year the past two years in the Sweet 16, and just gotten crushed on the glass
by UConn and then this year by Duke. And we have to do a better job
rebounding.  
So I think those young bigs, if they can run, rebound, defend and play off of
JaJuan, I think we can have some success with that.  
  
Q. Obviously there's a lot of talk about Robbie, but about how about
replacing Kramer? How difficult is that for you?  
COACH PAINTER: That's a very good question. I had somebody ask in our Media
Day who is going to be your Chris Kramer? And I was like the Riddler, asked
them the question: Well, who was the second Chris Kramer last year in college
basketball? Who was that other guy that you would say is like Chris Kramer in
college basketball, period? And they said, Well, nobody really comes to mind.
And I said, Yeah, because there's not very many of them.  
He literally took guys out of their game. And the guys he really struggled
against were pros. And those are the guys that would get him. He struggled
against a guy like an Evan Turner. But the other guys, Chris, he would knock
them out of what they wanted to do and really frustrate them.  
I think that's by committee. I don't think we have a guy. I think Terone
Johnson could be a very good defender down the road. I think Anthony Johnson
could be a good defender down the road.  
They're just freshmen and just kind of learning our defensive system. E'Twaun
Moore has made a lot of strides. Can he carry the load and be a scorer and be
a shut-down guy like a Kenny Lowe or a Cuonzo Martin in the past for Purdue,
those guys have been able to do it? I think he can. I really think he can.  
I know we'll have good pressure on the ball with Lewis and Kelsey. It could
end up being if we can't get to that with other guys, with a guy like John
Hart or Ryne Smith, can't be a defensive presence for us, we can move Kelsey
over because I know he has the athleticism and ability to do it. We've just
kept him at the point so far in his career.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up next is Iowa head coach Fran McCaffery.  
If you would like to start with an opening statement, then we'll go to
questions.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: This is an exciting time for me. A great challenge ahead. And
I think the first thing I need to say is I really like my team.  
I think the core group of young players that we have, in particular, have
responded well to the changes that we're trying to make. I think we have a
great group of young freshmen who will not have the ability to take their
time. They're going to play right away. They're going to have to play like
veterans.  
But the great thing there is they'll be able to play through their mistakes
right away. I think we have a good core group of about nine, maybe ten.
Obviously we have to stay healthy. That took a little bit of a setback
recently with injury to Matt Gatens, but I feel good about his recovery in
short order.  
So as we move forward in a very challenging conference, as you all know, I
like my team. And my responsibility is to make sure we continue to make
progress, play together, and play our style of play.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Could you be a little more specific on Matt, like any kind of timetable?
And who would he fill his spot in the interim while he's not there?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: You know, Matt's having surgery today. You're probably
looking at three weeks before he can play. He's obviously going to want to
play before that. I think that the iffy thing right now is will he play in our
first game, will he play in our first two games. That I can't answer. It's a
possibility, but it may not happen.  
After that he'll be able to play with something on his thumb. And then after
two more weeks, after that, it will be something else. But a little less
intrusive. The fact that it's his left hand is a good thing, obviously, being
a right-handed player.  
So I think he'll be back within three weeks. The person that would fill in for
him would be Roy Devyn Marble. He's a freshman. I think Dev has really come
on, especially in about the last five or six practices.  
The first five or six he was playing like a freshman. And he just does not
have that luxury. Especially now. So I feel good about him. And it will be a
tremendous opportunity for him to play if Matt can't. If Matt can, then he'll
be back in a month.  
  
Q. How so far how have the guards looked, Cully Payne, Cartwright? Have they
worked together, or are they competing against one another for that spot?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: We've done both. Obviously I think for the practice to be the
most competitive they can be, Bryce runs one team, Cully runs the other. We
mix the lineups around them. But at times we play them both together and we
use Branden Stubbs, our walk-on point guard, to run the other team. It gives
them the opportunity to play together. They play well together and they will
play together at times.  
It gives us a different look. Both can drive it. Both can make plays on the
break, and the good thing is they both can make 3s. So I think it's not like
you're playing two non-scoring point guards together to try to get
penetration. Because if they can't shoot, you're not going to be able to drive
it anyway.  
So the fact they're making shots and they're driving the ball and they're
creating a faster pace together, I think you'll see those guys on the floor.  
  
Q. How has the transition been to the more up-tempo attack and how has the
team figured out your fastbreak and what you like to do there?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: You know, they've been great. They want to play that way. I
think most athletes want to play that way. The critical thing there is
understanding how to play that way, because you can run and quick shoot the
ball and turn the ball over and you really haven't improved very much.  
And I think our fans are smart enough to recognize if we're playing faster,
then we better have a plan behind it. We better make good decisions on the
break. And I think the first three or four days of practice, to be honest with
you, was absolute mayhem. We were going so fast, kicking the ball all over the
arena and not making good decisions.  
And that was okay. To get them to understand that we're going to push the
ball, we're going to push it on makes and misses, we've got to get it in
quick. We've got to get our wings running and our posts running. I think that
was step one.  
Step two becomes we're going to probe the defense and sometimes the best play
is no play at all. You've got to pull it out. Then you've got to run some
offense, and then know what we're doing after the fastbreak. So you have
primary break and then we go into our offense. We don't run secondary break.
It's primary break and then we go into our offense.  
And that transition has been something that they've been able to grasp over
the last week or so. At the beginning they were not grasping that at all. So I
expected that. You have some changes. Last year they played slower. They were
much more under control. So there's times when we have to be under control.  
If we're going to win close games, we better know how to play under control
and be able to play at half court. So, yes, we're going to run but we're going
to play intelligent basketball.  
  
Q. How do you stack up at the 4 and 5?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, I think when you look at our post positions, clearly
Jarryd Cole and Andrew Brommer in particular are the first two guys we've got
to get something, especially out of Brommer. I think everybody knows that
Jarryd Cole is a solid player. He put up good numbers. He's got a frame. He's
got experience. He can score. He's got the physical presence defensively in
the low post to go against some of the other great posts in our league. We
need him to play like a senior leader and so far he's done all of that.  
Brommer hasn't played much, but he's 6'9", about 240. He has a great skill
set. He can run. He's got a jump hook. He can hit the trail 3. And he's
somebody that I think will surprise people when you look at our team, you're
not expecting anything from him. I think he averaged a point and a half last
year.  
But he's going to get a chance to play more, and he's going to be able to get
a chance to settle down. He never had that opportunity. If you watched him, if
you watched any tape like I did, watched the games last year, he was kind of
always on edge and he never settled down.  
And he would make some ill-advised mistakes, but you're going to see somebody
now that I'm going to let him play through that and I think our style of play
will help him. And you're going to see somebody who is a legitimate post
player in this league.  
After that, we've got two freshmen, Melsahn Basabe and Zach McCabe. Both are
really talented. I would expect Melsahn to be a starter. He's long, he runs,
he can score, he can block shots. Terrific person. And, again, a great
opportunity for him to learn right from the start what it's like to be a
Division I player right into the Big Ten.  
Zach McCabe has a different game. He's a tremendous 3-point shooter. When you
have a player who is playing the 4 who might be with Matt Gatens, our best
3-point shooter who can put it on the deck but has enough strength and
toughness to do some things inside, now we've got a little bit of versatility.  
We've got a couple of power guys, and we've got an athletic 4 and then we've
got a versatile 4. So we can do some different things on offense.  
  
Q. I'm sure you had an impression of the Big Ten before. What are your
impressions now that you've really studied it in the offseason?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I've always had tremendous respect for this league. But when
you look now at three of the top five teams, arguably, and five of maybe the
top 18 and projecting seven teams maybe to go to the tournament, very few
leagues that you look at, not only this year, but over the years that have
that kind of depth and with that many teams with a legitimate chance to go to
the Final Four.  
So as you sit in my chair, you know, it's a formidable challenge to take a
young team and play those teams, not only at home but on the road. So I think
the critical thing for us is to know and understand how we have to compete.
And when we find ourselves in close games with those teams, doing the right
things that will help us win those close games.  
Because that's what's really going to help develop our team as we move
forward, develop our confidence. We can't be satisfied this year with moral
victories, hey, we played Michigan State tough. At some point we've got to
beat some of these teams and we're going to have to do it with young players.
And that's what we're looking at. And that's what we're going to get ready
for.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now is Ohio State head coach Thad Matta.  
We'll start with an opening statement and then go to questions.  
COACH MATTA: Well, we're at the unknown here 15 practices in, six new guys, as
you said, four returning starters, which is very exciting. The leadership that
those guys have provided to this point, couldn't be happier with.  
The good thing for us is we've still got a couple of weeks before we actually
tip-off. But have been very pleased with our guys' work ethic and the freshmen
stick-to-itiveness to come in every day and work hard at practice.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. I'm curious about Deshaun Thomas, how he looks so far. What do you see
from him and what do you hope to see from him?  
COACH MATTA: I couldn't be happier with Deshaun right now. First and foremost
he's a guy that came in at 14.6 percent body fat and he's down to 8.2, I think
it is.  
He's had a smile on his face every day. I've really talked to him about just
bringing the right mindset in knowing that you've got a lot to learn.  
His work ethic has been great. I think that as he continues, you know, the one
thing Deshaun can do is put the ball in the basket. We've had a couple of
scrimmages. I think he's led us in scoring in all of them.  
The big thing we've got to get him to understand is you gotta stop the other
guy down at the other end from scoring, too. But he's been great. Couldn't be
happier with him.  
  
Q. You spoke about leadership values with your returning starters. What have
they given to the new freshmen given that they've tasted success winning the
Big Ten Conference Championship, they also tasted beat by being bounced over
from the NCAA Tournament last year?  
COACH MATTA: I think you said what have the veteran players given the new
guys? The thing I asked them the most was I'd like to think we do things a
certain way at Ohio State in terms of the culture we have set for our program
and teaching those guys how we do things, from going to class, to being
respectful, to professors, whoever they come in contact with.  
But also a work ethic. And I think that the four veterans have done a
tremendous job of teaching that. It's like I told the freshmen on our first
team meeting. I said: We've got a great tradition going here at Ohio State
right now and you guys haven't contributed one ounce of anything to it and you
have to earn your stripes here; I want you to follow these guys' lead.  
And as I told them, I think we've got four great leaders, but if you don't
want to be led it's not going to work. And to those guys' credit, they've done
a tremendous job of engaging themselves and following the lead of those guys.  
  
Q. You've obviously coached highly ranked big men prospects, Greg Oden, BJ
Mullens, among others. Without necessarily comparing them, how do you feel
Jared Sullinger is coming along at this early stage and sort of what do you
project for him over the course of the season?  
COACH MATTA: I think Jared has been very good to this point. I think the
biggest thing was he's really resurrected his body. He's gotten himself in
very good shape.  
For his size, his hands and his feet are very good. He's got a great touch.
And I've said this: The thing I like about Jared is, number one, he knows how
to play. But he also wins. He's won at every level that he's ever played at.  
So I think our guys have seen a great unselfishness out of him, but by the
same -- at the same time, you know, he can put the ball in the basket from
down on the block, finishing around the basket. He steps out, shoots 3s. He
can show he can handle the ball. And that's been exciting to see. Because I
think for the four new guys, Jared is a guy that you enjoy playing with.  
And I think he's one of those guys that can make guys better around him.  
  
Q. What's your take on the July evaluation period discussions and what would
you like to see happen there?  
COACH MATTA: You know, I don't know if I have a definitive answer. It's kind
of like everybody asks me about the one and done.  
I don't know what's right, what's wrong. I think that if they were to take the
July or cut it back, hopefully they would give us the days throughout the
course of the year.  
I actually haven't -- they had some notes up in my office or not in my office
but in my bag. I just found about 20 minutes ago and I didn't have time to
read through them on it.  
So I don't know exactly what's going to happen. I think that since I've been
in college coaching 17 years or whatever it is, I've always gone out in July.
But I don't know. I understand where they're going. I think that the agents --
and that to me right now is the biggest thing of what's going on.  
And I love what football is doing. They had a blowup and they took the bull by
the horns. And they're getting this thing corrected. And the same thing goes
on in football goes on in basketball.  
  
Q. Just want to ask about Aaron Craft and maybe the status of your point
guard position, just how that's been broken up and what you've seen out of
Aaron so far after a couple of weeks working with him.  
COACH MATTA: Well, Aaron has been a pleasant surprise in how well he's played
to this point. The thing you love about Aaron Craft is he was sitting in with
the coaches two nights ago watching film. I asked him, I said, How did you do
on your chemistry exam? He said, Coach, I think I may have got them all right,
but I'll find out tonight because the professor let us take the test home. And
he said, I'm going to look it up online. He texted me about 11:00 that night
and said, Coach, I wasn't lying, I got them all right.  
That's how he plays basketball. He's got a tremendous understanding. He's got
a toughness about him. He as a freshman appears to have a great feel for where
the ball needs to be when it needs to be there. And he shot the ball a lot
better than we had seen him coming in out of high school.  
So a lot like I said about Jared. He wins. He's accustomed to winning.  
  
Q. Seemed like you guys were very successful last year when you were very
loose. And one of the guys that kept everybody loose was, of course, blogger
extraordinaire Mark Titus. How are you keeping that attitude coming out of the
season, especially with all the competition you're facing?  
COACH MATTA: I think that may be the greatest question I've ever been asked.
Everybody's been asking me how do you replace Evan Turner. I'm not concerned
about replacing Evan; I'm concerned about replacing Mark Titus. No, I think
that Mark is very unique. He's still in Columbus.  
I never read the blog. But I always tell our players to use this opportunity
at Ohio State to help yourself be successful for the rest of your life. And I
really believe this, I think Mark did that.  
But he still -- he was in the gym the other day watching practice. And it's
always good for me to see him, because he makes me laugh like nobody I've ever
met before.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up next on the podium is Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo.  
COACH IZZO: Good to be back. I hope everybody likes this format where we have
mid weeks, seems like we have a great turnout. I'm excited for it. It's a
great year for it. Because I think the Big Ten is going to be maybe as good as
it has been in a lot of years since I've been here, from top to bottom.  
And our team, I think, is very good. I think we have some key players back. I
think we've had an incredible rash of injuries since last spring through the
summer, and that's probably our biggest dilemma right now, is really getting a
feel for our team and trying to get them ready in a short period of time.  
We're healthy now but not to the speed we need to be, and yet I think working
hard to get there.  
So I'm excited for a great year. We have a great non-conference schedule and I
think the conference schedule, like I said, is as good as it's been maybe in
all 20 some years I've been in the Big Ten.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. A lot of talk about the July evaluation period, some suggestions about
changing it, eliminating it, something like that. What are your thoughts and
what would you like to see?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, it's very difficult as president of our
association this year. You know, you deal with a lot of different people.
Being a Division II guy at heart and a lower Division I guy for a little bit
and then be at the top level, I think you can't forget about the different
types of people and programs that are out there.  
And you know I'm not crazy about the length of time of it. I think a lot of
coaches last year felt it was a little long. What I worry most about is the
players. I mean, as coaches, I've done the same thing for 27 years here as far
as being out every day of the summer. It's never changed.  
But I think players are starting to wear down a little bit. I worry that some
of that is injuries later on. But I also worry about the smaller schools who
have maybe more financial issues and trying to get 347 people or teams or
schools, whatever it is, 343, 347, on the same page is maybe a lot more
difficult than the BCS situation that football has.  
So we're exploring things, we're talking about them. We talked about them as a
league last night. And I'm not sure we'll ever find an exact way to do it that
benefits everybody. And so we're continuing to work on, not only in the NABC,
but also each conference is continuing to work on ways to make it better.  
And right now I can see a lot of people wanting to cut it back a little bit
but not eliminate it.  
  
Q. A follow-up to that question. If not for the financial issues that the
smaller schools have, would you want to see it cut back dramatically because
of what you said about the players wearing down?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think there's a combination of things. Players wearing
down. Coaches. You know, we don't get a lot of downtime. And the summer is one
time you get down. And that's an issue.  
I've always been a little bit of a believer that as long as it's the same for
everyone, at the end we're going to get the same players we've got, we just
find different ways.  
Football over the years has used film a lot more. I think you talk to more
coaches during the year. There's ways to get it done. But I'm also a little
different in the last two or three years than I was that whatever's best for
everybody I would definitely vote for and pull for. And I don't think that's a
politician's answer, I just think I have a greater appreciation when you see
the passion of people talking about it on what they think they need.  
So recruiting's the hardest part of our job. I think everybody would agree to
that. When you go all year long and you get a little bit of time and maybe the
nicest time of the year you're gone almost the entire month, I think that
makes it difficult.  
So partly coaches and recharging, but a lot of players. I don't think we're
looking at that angle. Everybody says they'll continue to play. But, boy, if
you had a son right now or a daughter and they're gone, which seems to be like
two months of the summer for all these different camps and I think feel
obligated to be at them, and so consequently the wear-down factor.  
I'd like to see a study on whether it's affecting our kids when they get in
college, on not only the energy level and the passion for the game, that we
wear it out too early like I think sometimes some sports do, hockey and
they're playing when they're four years old.  
That's the questions I have. And we're going to try to get answered at the
meetings we go to and listening to all the coaches around the country and
maybe even some of you.  
I think everybody's looking to do what's best, and that's what we're looking
to do.  
  
Q. How important is your team's depth to the overall success this season?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I think depth and versatility have been the two keys to 90
percent of the teams I've coached that have gone to the Final Fours.  
I think if you have depth, you overcome injuries. Last year's was almost -- we
got lucky. There's no question that when Lucas went down and then Kansas gets
upset. Northern Iowa is very good, but Kansas got upset.  
Sometimes you gotta be a little lucky in that NCAA Tournament to make a run,
too. But our depth did help us, and I think we've got more depth this year,
and I think that's going to be a plus.  
And I think we have more versatility where we can play big, play small. When
you get in the NCAA Tournament, it's like anything in any sport. Some people
match up different with different people.  
And when you have the most flexibility to match up with anybody you can run
into, it reminds me of the year we won it. We played Wisconsin to a 54-49 game
and two days later it was a 90-to-70-some game against Florida.  
And I think that's one of the things that has helped our team. We've had depth
and we've had versatility. And, yet, we make a concerted effort that even if
we don't have the players to add depth, we play them and sometimes lose some
games early, but it benefits us in the end.  
  
Q. How much will a freshman like Keith Appling play a role in what you want
to do in the back court considering Korie Lucious and Kalin Lucas, et
cetera?  
COACH IZZO: That's a good question, because when we recruited Keith we thought
he would definitely be a big part of that role of depth. And then all of a
sudden we lose Chris Allen this summer and he had to step up another notch,
and then with Kalin's injury and then Korie had the meniscus tear about a
month ago, I mean, his role has escalated, I think, and I think he's a tough
enough kid to handle it.  
And Adreian Payne is another one. We did lose Russell Byrd probably for the
year with a stress fracture that did not heal and had to get reoperated on.  
So our depth at the guard position, which has normally been our strength or at
the wing position is lacking a little bit. Keith will be a very important part
to make sure that we have enough at position in the 1, 2, 3, where we rotate
guys pretty frequently.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us now at the podium is Indiana head coach Tom Crean.  
Coach, if you would like to go ahead with an opening statement, and then we'll
open up the floor for questions.  
COACH CREAN: I think first and foremost for us, we're excited to have more
bodies, more quality players in our program all the time. And I think our
bodies are starting to look physically more like Big Ten players, and we've
got to build that mindset now that you have to have to compete in this league
at the highest level.  
I like where our mindset is at this point. I like where our mentality is
going. I think anytime you have a quality team you have quality depth. If you
have quality depth that means you have consistent players.  
And that's what we've got to build right now, from top to bottom. We've got to
build consistency in our approach every day, a consistency in our ability to
make plays and the more consistent we get, that's going to help us do what is
really important early on in the season which is string some successes
together. And I think anytime you have a team that's still relatively young
but that hasn't had success, they have to have some feelings of success.  
And they have to -- we talk every day in our program about earning victory.
And the four components of that are constantly how smart you are, how tough
you are, how physical you are, how fundamentally sound you are.  
If you can get those four components locked in, well, then, you have a chance
to get consistent. You have a chance to get better. But we've had a very good
offseason in the sense of people changing their bodies and mindsets and work
ethics and are working on their work ethics.  
We're not healthy right now in the sense of practice, but we don't have
anything that I look at that's going to keep us right now from being able to
start the season pretty much with our team intact, and that's very important
because injuries played a huge part in our team last year.  
And so Matt Roth is back. Maurice Creek is back, even though we don't practice
with Maurice Creek every day yet. His strength is not where it needs to be
yet. His knee is sound and healthy, but his strength is not where it needs to
be.  
But we're gaining ground. And I like that. I think the league and itself is as
good as it has been in my three years as good as I can remember it in somebody
who has grown up in the Big Ten area and watched it from afar. And riding up
here today with Don Fischer he made a great point, which I think is very
reflective of where this league is: There's probably seven teams in this
league right now that could win it by the end of the year.  
And when you look at that, when you look at the quality of the teams, when you
look at the quality of the coaching, and it's obvious with some of the
programs right now when you look at where Michigan State's at, when you look
at Ohio State, when you look at Purdue, even without Robbie, I think that's an
incredible team, because, number one, for the guy running the program, knows
everything that it takes to win, and they've got a lot of quality players
inside of it.  
I think Bruce's team at Illinois could be knocking on the door of a Final Four
national championship type of program, if he gets his young guys to understand
what his older guys understand, with how hard it is to win in this league. But
they have a tremendous quality. And I don't think that there's nearly enough
conversation nationally about what Minnesota's capable of, what Wisconsin's
capable of or what Northwestern's capable of.  
And when you look at those programs, it's a great league. And one final point
that I'd like to make is when you look at Michigan, and when you look at what
John Beilein has done over his career and you look at his winning percentage
over his career, the man is an incredible coach.  
This goes back to my days in the Big East and it certainly is now. There might
be some preparations that are as hard, but there are none that are harder than
getting ready for a John Beilein-coached team, and I think it's just a matter
of time before that program is back where it needs to be.  
I mean, he walked into a situation -- he didn't walk into a Big Ten champion.
He didn't walk into a team that was going into NCAA tournaments all the time.
He's had to rebuild it. And I think he's a phenomenal coach.  
And it is always very challenging to get ready for his teams. And you could
say that about every team in this league. But when you're talking about
programs that are that good, with the way John coaches, with the way Tubby
Smith coaches and Bo Ryan, and they're not even getting a ton of the attention
around the country, that just goes to show how good this league is.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. I guess I know it's still early, but can you talk about the decision-
making you're seeing in practice, where it is and where it needs to be?  
COACH CREAN: I think it's better. And one thing we're doing is we have
referees and a lot more right now. We don't just have them refereeing
scrimmages 5 on 5, they're refereeing drills and I think anything we can do
right now to tighten our game up in the sense of footwork, in the sense of
getting into the lane and making decisions, in the sense of physicality of
play and playing without fouling, you know, not negating the hustle that we're
trying to get across, I think it's good.  
Now, it will take some time. We've just got to continue to get stronger with
the ball. We've got to continue to make really simple plays, as we always say.
Hit singles, not home runs. That's so crucial for us.  
But we're also trying to have a lot more movement in our offense right now. So
hopefully those things are going to help. But it will be a period of time
before we can see if the decision-making is really getting better.  
  
Q. What have you seen from Jordan in terms of being more confident in his
offensive abilities, not just being a distributor?  
COACH CREAN: Oh, I think that he's really making strides. I was asked a
question the other day, and it's really hard to answer: Who has changed the
most physically? And we can't pinpoint one or two guys. We look at our whole
team, they all look different. Maybe that's because they were that young.  
But Jordan is stronger, and I think the strength has brought more confidence
to his game. We need him to be -- he may not be the verbal vocal leader that
we need just yet, but he's got to be the example leader. And he's got to be in
a situation where he doesn't accept anything from his teammates in the sense
of how they play and the hustle that they play with and the decision-making
they play with that he wouldn't accept from himself. He's got to hold
teammates, when he's on the court, to the standard that he holds for himself.  
But he's shooting the ball extremely well. He's moving well. His pull-up game
is coming. He's continuing to get better in the pick-and-roll. He's got to
continue to be able to deal with full court pressure and trapping and things
of that nature. And defensively I wouldn't call him a standout yet, but he's
certainly not on the other side either.  
He's holding his own defensively and playing with a lot of force and resolve
right now, which is exactly what we need from him over the long haul.  
  
Q. Could you just talk a little bit about Gee's overall game, what type of
progression you've seen from him since he came to Bloomington and what type of
impact you see for him this season?  
COACH CREAN: Well, he's got a want-to that's very uncommon for young players.
Even though he's a little bit older, he's still young to the game because he's
only been playing since the age of 17.  
But without a doubt, if he's not the hardest worker when it comes to outside
of practice time, he's in the top two or three. And that's exactly what you
want. He's setting a standard for himself in the way that he's trying to
improve with the willingness he has to learn. All three of our new guys have
an inner pride that it's very hard for them to accept mistakes.  
Now, you like that. You don't want guys that accept mistakes easy. But at the
same time they have to learn that there's a lot of growth that goes on inside
of their game. He epitomizes that. He's 7'1" with a seven, eight and a half
wingspan, and we're constantly trying to get him to understand just how big
and long he is.  
And he's getting better movement in his feet defensively in the sense of the
coverage. Your team is really determined defensively by how good your 4 and 5
men give help. And you can have a good to great team based on how good they
are with that. And that's one thing that we're really trying to get him to
understand, not just be a shot blocker, but a guy that can rotate, change
shots, move people around, control the paint.  
He's running the floor better. He's getting more comfortable. Anytime there's
a lot of traffic right now around the rim in the sense of making a post move,
he hasn't gotten that down yet. But in the sense of rolls off the screens and
in the sense of isolations and in the sense of slipping to the rim and the
sense of running the floor, he's really making a lot of strides.  
  
Q. Having the success you had at Marquette and coming to Indiana and having
two off-par years, what was the biggest thing you learned from transitioning
from Marquette to Indiana?  
COACH CREAN: Keep getting tough-minded players that have been raised on
winning. I don't think there's any -- I don't think there's anything even
close. You have to have talent. Certainly you've got to have positions. But
you have to get people that are raised on winning.  
I look at our Marquette teams, in the sense of the way we're trying to recruit
now, year-round winners, people that won during the high school season, people
that won during the summertime. If they played a different sport, which I
always love, that they won in that.  
And I think that competitive mindset, it's very, very hard to get it if you
didn't have it coming in. You can make it better and you can add to it,
especially in the mental toughness realm. And you can make them physically
stronger.  
But you have to have people that have been raised on winning, and I don't
think you can ever get away from it no matter what level you're at. If there's
anything I've learned is that that equation works, no matter what, no matter
what level, and probably no matter what sport.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Bill Carmody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16994)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now up is Northwestern head coach Bill Carmody.  
We'll start with an opening statement and then go to questions.  
COACH CARMODY: Like all teams right now, 335 or so Division I teams, we're
excited to get going. As mentioned, we're a veteran team. We're going to try
to build two years ago, 17 wins, and that was good for us. Last year, 20 wins.  
And we were going pretty strong for a while but then we faltered in February.
And now the focus for us is just to recognize that it's a long season and you
have to finish the race.  
But we have some good guys back. Our practices have been very good. And so
just anxious to get going. And I think we have some talented guys. And they
just seem more focused than they have been and hungrier than they have been in
the past, which is a real good thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Can you talk about John Shurna and his involvement in U.S.A. Basketball.
I know he was a member of the Select Team that trained with the eventual gold-
medal-winning championship team and how that's improved his game, what you've
seen from him since then.  
COACH CARMODY: This year being on the Select Team was sort of a continuation
of the summer before when he was chosen for the Under-19 Team which won the
gold medal in New Zealand.  
And for him to make that team was an accomplishment. This is after his
freshman year, because they basically picked 12 guys and eight of them had
already been chosen for the most part. He just had a terrific tryout. They
kept him.  
And he was an important contributor to that team. And so guys had seen him and
it carried over to last year, when he just seemed to make this big jump,
because as a freshman I think he averaged seven and a half points a game and
last year close to 20.  
So he was feeling better and better about himself. And then just playing with
those guys, you know, I guess he was out in Vegas for maybe ten days or so in
July.  
And we talked. We happened to be out there recruiting at the time. So I saw
him. And he just said -- I asked him: How are you doing today? How did it go
today in practice? Well, Odom was guarding me. I said, How'd you do? He said,
Well, he didn't really guard me, so I just shot the ball and a bunch of them
went in, which was good. So he feels good about himself.  
He also said that anytime he put the ball on the ground guys were all over him
attacking him, the speed and the strength.  
He just thinks that -- he's a pretty humble kid and shy kid. But he just needs
to be growing, not just physically. But he sees himself a little differently
because of that experience.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Juice Thompson's presence as a floor leader and his
leadership as one of the returning seniors on the team this year?  
COACH CARMODY: Mike, he's always had that leadership ability. He came in as a
freshman. I just gave him the ball. And early on if something would go wrong
or he would call the play that really wasn't what to call, he'd be looking
over at me all the time, and I just told him: Hey, kid, forget it. Just take
over. You know what you're doing.  
He's always been a leader and a terrific floor general. The thing that's been
great about Mike is he's just improved. He's a guy you've got to guard now.
He's not like one of these old-fashioned point guards that just brings the
ball down the court, starts the offense and is never heard from again.  
He shot over 40 percent in his career from the 3-point range. And I wish he
was a little more vocal at times, because he knows what to do. But he's just
-- he's developed into one of the elite guards in this league, for sure.  
  
Q. What's your take on the discussions about the July evaluation period and
what would you like to see happen there?  
COACH CARMODY: I'm not too sure what the alternative is. And you know we had a
coaches meeting last night down at the studio. And we talked for an hour and a
half. And there were a lot of different ideas about what to do.  
And I think sometimes in the past with recruiting, you know, there have been
some knee-jerk reactions, and then a year later the rules changed. So I think
people -- they recognize that there's a need to do something here. And I think
just more thought has to go into what's the best, not just for our conference,
what's the best thing for college basketball.  
And the NBA's starting to get involved a little bit, and, you know, there's
some discussions going on. But even last night we couldn't really come up with
an alternative that we could all agree upon.  
And there were some good ideas. So I think it's great that we're tossing it
about, because certainly there's some things about it that have to improve.  
  
Q. The relative depth of the Big Ten and especially that top half, what does
the next group need to do in order to compete with the Michigan State and Ohio
State and Purdue top 3?  
COACH CARMODY: I've been saying for five years that it's like one of my
favorite movies, Usual Suspects, that's what you have here. And so some of
these teams have been up there for a long time. And until someone does
anything about it and breaks into that, then those are the teams that are
favored.  
And I just think it's consistency. You have to -- there's some teams that are
on the verge of breaking through, say into the top 5, which basically
guarantees you a place in the tournament.  
But to say what do you have to do, I think it's about getting better players
and more depth, more good players. Because there are no bad coaches in this
conference. You don't really outcoach too many guys. Occasional game here and
there. But it's about the players and that's the way it should be.  
So I think just recruiting and going through a full year, going through a full
year and having your guys play it out.  
  
Q. John Shurna said a little bit the other day about Drew Crawford and his
development. What have you seen in him since last March?  
COACH CARMODY: Drew was I guess Co-Rookie of the Year last year in the league.
And he just looks better. I've had guys in the past when they take their shirt
off I don't enjoy seeing it. But he went to work in the spring, the summer, he
looks good. And we spent a lot of time on his ball handling in the spring
because he's good along the baseline, but now you have to -- we've always
tried to develop our guys.  
And that was one area where, you know, improvement was needed. So he's really
worked hard on that. So I think I can throw him in the back court this year a
little bit. Although with Mike back there, you could play in the back court
and do okay.  
But Drew's really improved, I think. And last year he had some tremendous
games. And he was responsible for some wins in conference. But he was a little
bit like a freshman, a little up and down. So just the consistency that every
night you gotta be on.  
And in the first week and a half of practice he just seems like he's ready to
go.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(MEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28MEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan head coach John Beilein.  
We'll open up with an opening statement, then go to questions.  
COACH BEILEIN: Thank you. Good morning. This is a very young team. This is
probably one of the younger teams I've ever coached, and maybe one of the
younger ones in the country.  
I think we have no seniors. We have two juniors, two sophomores, and six
freshmen. So it's going to be -- there's going to be very challenging moments.
And we're replacing -- trying to replace a lot of points and a lot of rebounds
in two very good players.  
But we've practiced so hard and we're fortunate enough to make a European trip
that we learned a lot about ourselves. Many positive things, and also a lot of
work to do.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the two Indiana you guys have in Douglass and Novak
and what you expect from them this year?  
COACH BEILEIN: Both of them have developed and really worked hard. They're out
here today. Just looking at their bodies right now, they were young 18-year-
old freshmen and now they're still probably pretty young but 20-year-old
juniors.  
And I just really like the leadership they both showed. They've seen the best
of times, an NCAA Tournament win, and then they saw some very disappointing
games last year.  
So we're very optimistic that that's the type of leadership that we're going
to need to continue to build a program and I'm really happy we don't know
where they'll be as far as what their main role will be other than leadership
right now.  
But they'll be out on the court quite a bit this year.  
  
Q. Tom Crean mentioned -- he said that there's nothing harder than preparing
for a John Beilein-coached team. How much will that help you in a year you
don't have the experience?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think what will be helpful to us probably is that I don't see
us having a go-to guy right just yet. You always would like to have that in
your back pocket. At the same time, I think we'll have a go-to team that will
look for the first open shot, the best opportunity to shoot.  
And so hopefully that part of our game will really open up a lot of
opportunities for a lot of people. So it will be -- it's a challenge for us
right now, but this team is one of my higher IQ teams, I think, as far as just
picking up things quickly, whether it's just college basketball or some nuance
that we're trying to instill.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about McLimans, his development since joining the
program and how you think he'll be able to match up in his first year against
some of the premier talent in the front court.  
COACH BEILEIN: He's made great strides. Blake's made great strides. He's
getting the body of a 6'10" center in the Big Ten. Still has not had enough
experience with the lights on for us really to know what to expect, but does
have the ability to -- has a nice little soft hook shot that we need him to be
able to turn to more often. But he's got a really nice outside shot that could
help us spread the floor. So his development is very important to us.  
He is a freshman. Even though he's redshirted, but his development -- if he
continues his development from where he came from last year to this year over
the next season, he'll have a chance to get some good quality minutes for us
in the years ahead.  
  
Q. If you had a timeline coming in to Michigan, how have you had -- for
rebuilding, how have you had to assess that timeline or reassess it and where
would you say you feel you are now?  
COACH BEILEIN: Typically, wherever we've been able to go, before you spent
your time, we spent most of our time right now recruiting sophomores and
juniors. I think in some of the other stops that we've had, you'll basically
be able to go somewhere and there's still seniors available. And you are not
waiting two or three years to get the recruits you began recruiting.  
So I think as you try to turn programs around, it depends a little bit on what
you have, what you inherit, and then where your recruiting classes are. Does
it take some of the best recruits that we -- I shouldn't say best recruits --
some of the recruits, highly rated recruits we have or we'll sign, sometimes
you have to wait two or three years to actually get them.  
And then who knows what's going to happen in their freshman year. So I think
turning the program around is much more difficult than it's been, because of
the early commitments and early recruiting. We have to do it with younger men.  
  
Q. Has there been a guy in practice that surprised you over the first ten
days that you're like: I didn't know he could maybe do that?  
COACH BEILEIN: Every day there seems to be a different guy that we really come
out of practice and say: You know, boy, wasn't he good today.  
Colton Christian the other day had a very good practice in a scrimmage that we
had, but the day before it wasn't nearly -- I wouldn't say there's anyone that
has been consistently -- other than Zack Novak, probably, has been
consistently every day having good practices. That's what I was looking for,
guys that will go three, four, five practices in a row and really be
consistent. Darius Morris has probably been the most consistent that he's been
from last year. But I wouldn't say there's any wow factor out there right now.  
People are establishing it though. There are a couple of young men on our
radar screen that we're seeing some growth.  
  
Q. How have you -- you mentioned you have to adjust without DeShawn Sims and
Manny Harris for points and rebounds. How have you been able to adjust so far,
and was there any chance of you trying to persuade Manny to come back for his
senior year?  
COACH BEILEIN: The way we've been able to adjust is just run whatever action
we want to run, both offensively and defensively, and it's a little bit like
next shot a little bit by committee. Who is open? Just some really good teams
have four or 56 players with double figures.  
So I enjoy -- I enjoy coaching both ways, when you have a guy like Manny or
DeShawn Sims, it's really good to be able to design an offense to get them in
their sweet spots.  
But at the same time, when you don't have that type of experience, that type
of ability, all that talent is really young, it's also fun to coach where it's
just, all right, let's just take good shots as a team and not script -- I say
script so much.  
Manny and I had several discussions. Manny was really passionate about making
-- going right to the NBA. And his passions have come true so far as he's on
the roster, was on the roster last night. I haven't checked the box score,
whether he played last night or not. But if he really felt in his heart that
it was the best thing for him to do, we supported him 100 percent.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2010

  

### [Devoe Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20677)

### [Tubby Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13960)

### [Lawrence Westbrook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18149)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  90  
Minnesota - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask coach Smith to make an opening statement.  
COACH SMITH: First of all, I want to congratulate Ohio State. They proved why
they're one of the best teams not just in this league but in the country.
That's why they have one of the best players in the country in Evan Turner.  
I don't know, we sort of hit the wall in the second half there. I thought we
gained some momentum going into halftime, but that wasn't the case.  
  
Q. Obviously a few minutes before the selection show, what do you think
about what you all have done to make a case for an NCAA Tournament bid at this
point?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: Obviously today's loss was disappointing, but it's not in
our hands. I think that we had a good run here, and we showed everybody that
we're a good team. We've just going to have to hope and pray that we get in.  
DEVOE JOHNSON: Yeah, just like Lawrence said, I think that we came and had a
good showing here at this tournament and beat some quality teams, so I just
hope and pray we get in.  
  
Q. If you guys do get in, what you did here, do you think that -- what does
that do for your confidence, being able to advance and maybe win the first
game?  
DEVOE JOHNSON: Well, I just think we've been playing good basketball with the
exception of today, but our confidence will be high. We'll see who we have to
play and just get ready for them and try to come and play and compete against
them.  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: Same thing, just gave us confidence having a good showing
here. This was kind of like a tournament, NCAA atmosphere, so the young guys
will be used to it, and just gave us confidence that we can play with anybody.  
  
Q. How much was fatigue a factor, especially with the run you had to get to
this game?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: For me personally, I wasn't tired. I mean, I don't think
that -- Devoe runs the mile in like four minutes, so I don't think he was
tired. You can't use being tired as an excuse when you have a game like this.
They got hot in the second half, and that was the game.  
DEVOE JOHNSON: Yeah, I don't think physical fatigue was a problem. I think our
mental fatigue kind of hurt us. I think we started making -- me especially, I
had four turnovers on the night, instead of making some mental mistakes, the
mistakes we didn't make early on in the tournament, and it cost us.  
  
Q. For both guys, Evan Turner, he gets a lot of attention, but when all four
of those backcourt guys are going, how tough is it to face Ohio State?  
DEVOE JOHNSON: Well, yeah, they're four great guards. They kind of all spread
out, all take it to dribble, shoot the three, so they're a great team in that
aspect.  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: You know, they played good tonight. They're just tough to
beat.  
  
Q. What did you learn about your team in the tournament? Guys like Colton
put together a pretty good run of games, Devoe, yourself, you kind of stepped
up, maybe raised your game to another level. Talk about what you learned about
each other and yourselves.  
DEVOE JOHNSON: Well, we always knew we had these kind of talented players, and
it's good to see guys stepping up. And that's what we're going to need from
here on in, young guys, older guys that want to step up to be a real good
team.  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: Same thing, I'm just happy for some of the guys. They got
a lot of confidence. Colton played really well, and he's worked hard every day
at practice, so I'm happy for him and everybody else.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Smith?  
  
Q. There's been some talk about expanding the tournament to 96 teams. I'm
sure today you'd be probably in favor of that, but generally speaking, what is
your view on that proposal?  
COACH SMITH: Well, I've been in favor for a while. I think it's a great -- one
of the greatest sporting events in the world, and certainly here, and I think
I mentioned before, there was 340-some Division I schools, and that's been
expanded -- we keep expanding there, but we haven't expanded the tournament.
Aggregate, make sure you expand and allow some more student-athletes to have a
chance to experience this wonderful atmosphere of March Madness, so I'm in
favor of expansion.  
  
Q. Could you discuss the problems that David Lighty presents to a team?  
COACH SMITH: Well, as you mentioned, with four guards like that that can do so
many things, that are so versatile, take you off the dribble, shoot the jump,
shoot the three, and they complement each other so well. All of them play 39
minutes apiece. Obviously they're well-conditioned, endurance and stamina, and
you can see in their execution -- we were making runs. We made a couple runs
the second half but they were able to keep us at bay or make a shot or make a
play, get a stop. And Lighty is coming back off of having had to sit out a
year, I'm sure he's learned a lot, but I've always been impressed with him,
when you have the line that he's had, it's pretty impressive.  
  
Q. This is a team that basically returned a lot of guys that made the NCAA
Tournament last year. Can you just talk about the group that a lot of those
guys returning, Devoe and Lawrence and guys -- how do you think they've grown
since that NCAA Tournament game, and what they can take into the tournament if
you guys make it?  
COACH SMITH: You know, we've -- looking back at last year is hard, but you
hope a culmination of the year of playing in the Big Ten against the type of
competition we've had to play against and in the last four days, playing the
competition we've had to play, not just the experience from last year's NCAA
Tournament, I think we'd play well in the NCAA Tournament. We're never going
to have to play four games in a row again, so right away I could see the
fatigue on us, either mental, as Devoe said -- physically you think you can go
and you're ready.  
I've coached in -- this is the second that I've coached in, I think, one back
at Kentucky, and it's a challenge. That wall, it'll hit you at a certain point
in time, and you're hoping that other guys will step up and make plays. I know
Blake, he's probably completely dead. His shot I don't think was barely
getting to the rim, stuff like that, because he's having to work so hard.  
A team like Ohio State makes you work too hard at both ends of the court
because they're so long, athletic, strong at the offensive end. They can beat
you in so many ways. They do a good job of switching. So when you have four
guys that can guard anybody on the court, it makes it tough.  
  
Q. Do you think you've done enough to earn an NCAA Tournament bid?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we did go 9-9, and I don't pay a lot of attention to that
to be honest with you. We try to focus on doing what we have. But we've played
a pretty competitive schedule. We've played a -- we got hot at the right time,
these last few games. I think it's a great story line, guys that have had to
overcome some adversity this year. But I think the most important thing is I
do think we're one of the best 65 teams in the country.  
  
Q. You said after yesterday's game that you were primarily concerned with
whether your team would give its best effort today. How close do you think
they came to that?  
COACH SMITH: Well, I think we always give it a great effort. It was just
unfortunately you run into a team that shoots 65 percent, like we did
yesterday in the first half, and that's what can happen to you. So we had a
tremendous effort. You could see that we were sort of hitting the wall. When
guys make those threes from there, when you're playing tough defense, it takes
a lot out of you, and that's why we have to have guys step up. We had some
people step up. I'm happy for Lawrence Westbrook. I'm happy for our seniors,
Damian and Devron because they all played well and they've been a part of
something special getting to this point, and hopefully our underclassmen will
appreciate that and come back and do even more next year.  
  
Q. Devoe made the All-Tournament Team, and he kind of was your best player
here through the week. Just talk about what it's going to take maybe for him
to raise his game to another level and become an all-conference type of
guard.  
COACH SMITH: He's got to get stronger. He's got to get stronger. That's his
biggest weakness right now. But he has great stamina. He's very competitive.
He's got to get comfortable in handling the ball. Sometimes he has a tendency
because of his competitiveness to want to do a little too much. But he's made
that transition to the point guard spot very well.  
I'm happy for him. He deserves to be on the All-Tournament Team. He did a --
he pretty much pulled us out against Michigan State, and he's played against
some great competition here. That's a great accomplishment on his part.  
  
Q. Ohio State, they seemed to go in spurts, and in the second half they
didn't miss a shot in forever. What were you thinking at the time? You've been
a part of great teams. Maybe speak to how that just has a snowball effect,
just keeps going.  
COACH SMITH: Well, you're right, we probably should have changed defense. They
did a good job of changing defense on us late in the game. We were trying to
make a run. They extended their defense and went with a 1-2-2 there, and that
caused us to have to take more time. But again, they can -- they have so many
weapons. We were trying to -- really, I thought we could utilize our bench and
kind of wear them down, but we never could get into a -- they're good in
transition as far as transition defense, as well. We never could get it to the
basket or attack the rim like we wanted to, and it just seemed like they were
much more -- I guess much more -- not better conditioned, but you could say
they were fresh. And you could see that we weren't in that latter part of the
second half. I think that's why they got a lot of open looks, and I think
that's what happened to us from a physical as well as a mental standpoint.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

THE MODERATOR: At Coach Matta's request, we'll go straight to questions for
the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Evan, could you talk about the eight-minute stretch? You guys made 12
straight baskets and it seemed like everybody was hitting. That seemed to be
the key to the game. You went from four points to about 20-something points.  
EVAN TURNER: I think as a unit we got hot, we made our run, and once we got a
couple points ahead, we didn't want to let them back, just kept trying to hit
shots and trying to get defensive stops.  
  
Q. After two tight games, how does it feel to come off a second half like
that and really take care of a team going into the NCAA Tournament now?  
DAVID LIGHTY: I think it was real good for us. Like coach said, when our minds
are right, our game is right, and I think we came out with the right mentality
to go out and get the job done. You know, they kept fighting, but we withheld
and kept fighting, as well, then things started falling for us when we picked
up the defense.  
  
Q. David or Evan or William, could you expand on what you just said about
picking up your defense and how that affected the second half? I think you
out-scored them by -- I'm not sure what it was, but it was a whole lot in the
second half.  
WILLIAM BUFORD: I think we feed off our defense a lot. When we play hard on
defense, our offense always falls for us, so I think that's what happened.  
  
Q. You guys played three games in three days, and now you draw Friday-Sunday
in the tournament. Does that extra day of rest, will that be something that is
welcome?  
EVAN TURNER: Yeah, most definitely. You know, we played a hard 130 minutes
this weekend, and we definitely would like a couple days off a little bit. But
when it it's time to go, it's time to go. We'll get back into it and get
clicking on all cylinders. A day off will be nice.  
  
Q. David, back to that run again in the second half, Evan hit the three-
pointer, but you were like a man possessed. Lay-up, lay-up, lay-up, three-
pointer, three-pointer. Talk about maybe being a little unconscious there for
about eight minutes.  
DAVID LIGHTY: Kind of, pretty much. All year coach would say get the ball from
the rebound and push it. I think we struggled with our transition, so that's
all I really tried to do, and then they had Sampson checking me, so it was
kind of a mismatch. I just tried to get to the basket as much as possible.  
  
Q. Evan, could you comment on the bracket that you guys drew in the NCAA? It
looks -- if you get past the first round game I should say, it looks pretty
loaded with a lot of high-level teams.  
EVAN TURNER: You know, it's a good draw. We're close to home in Milwaukee.
We've just got to go out there and take care of business. Try and handle what
we can control. We can't really worry about the games afterwards. We have to
worry about the first game, which is UC Santa Barbara. They're there for a
reason, and then take it step by step.  
  
Q. Maybe for Evan or William, since it's about David. Sports Illustrated a
week or a couple weeks ago named David the captain of the all-glue team and
that, and I wondered, when you see him, it holds everything together, when
Evan or William, when you see him take off the way he did during that stretch,
how good does that make your team? Is that the big step you take at that
point?  
WILLIAM BUFORD: Yeah, you know, he's been here before. I've never been here
before, so I just feed off of David. What he tells me to do, I do. He's a good
team player and he's a good leader.  
EVAN TURNER: Yeah, definitely. Seeing him go through a good stretch, really
lead us, is a great thing. He holds all the players on the team. We have a lot
of respect and a lot of trust for him. When he's going, he's going, and it's a
better benefit for the team when he's leading and attack.  
  
Q. Evan, for you, as hard as it is to believe, you seem to have elevated
your game this weekend. Can you talk about that? Were you highly motivated or
--  
EVAN TURNER: You know, I just did -- when the time called for it, I just tried
to step up and make plays. Coach Matta really told me, take over when I could,
and stuff like that. Like I said, this is tournament ball; it's all about play
makers. It's not too much about half court offense or anything. You just try
and make plays, and the team who's in attack mode and the team that's trying
to win is going to win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Matta?  
  
Q. I was just wondering about your reaction when you saw your seed, and also
just the look of the bracket at-large. Did you think with what you guys
accomplished this year, Big Ten, regular season and tournament champions that
maybe the road might be a little easier than that half bracket looks?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think when you take 65, it's going to be tough
regardless. You go back a couple years ago, we were a 2 seed and had
Georgetown in the second round as a 10 seed. You know, it's one of those
situations where you look at the 8-9 games, if you're a 1 seed, who do you
want to play in those games. You know, us, you've got to shift your mind to,
okay, we've got Santa Barbara. Where do we go from there? I don't think
there's any easy way, I just hope we're playing our best basketball right now
as we move forward.  
  
Q. As I asked the players, are you happy that you got a Friday-Sunday for
either an extra day of rest or preparation for going into the tournament or
would you rather kind of strike while the iron is hot?  
COACH MATTA: No, we'll take the rest, because I think one thing that probably
nobody knows, our guys have got finals tomorrow morning, and we're in finals
this week. To have the extra day to let them knock that out will be huge for
us, it really will.  
The one thing that I want to do is starting Wednesday and Thursday, we're
going to practice these guys so hard like a game, because it seems like on the
third day we finally show up to play.  
But no, I think the rest will be good. You know how it is; from this stage on,
just the excitement, the atmosphere of college basketball elevates, and
sitting in there Thursday watching games and watching upsets and great wins
and all that stuff, your guys are very tuned into what's going on.  
  
Q. Kind of what I asked Evan, it's hard to believe that he could have been
playing better this weekend than he had been playing, but what do you -- he
hit the big shot the first day; yesterday it was a pretty incredible playing,
and he did the same thing today. I know you've been talking about him all
year, but what do you say at this point?  
COACH MATTA: Well, it's hard, because I think that as you watch him throughout
the course -- and I thought today, he started the game and was really trying
to get a feel for what was going to happen, how the game was going to be
called, what Minnesota was going to try to do to him defensively. You know, at
what point I literally said, hey, take the game over, and that's when he hit
the three off the pull-up. But when you say that to a guy like Evan, he's so
cerebral basketball-wise, he can do it with the pass, you can do it with the
defensive stop. But his play-making ability is really good. And just with his
size, they had smaller guys on him, they tried Johnson on him there for a
while, but it was -- when you look at the body of work over the weekend, I
mean, this has to go down as probably -- I know I've been in this league for
six years. I've never seen anything like it.  
  
Q. Minnesota gets back into it, 42-40, and then your guys go on that big
run. Can you talk about what you saw from your guys, and also the number of
guys that were able to score for you there?  
COACH MATTA: Yeah. Well, the thing that I felt in the game from the jump
street was both teams were pretty exhausted. They had played three games, and
this was their fourth game in four days. This was two hard-fought battles for
us. And at halftime, we -- I never even touched the board. It was more about
mind and heart and knowing that we had 20 minutes of basketball to play, and
we got off to a great start because we made some shots, and we had a couple
defensive miscues there, and they got back in it. And then all of a sudden we
got it back up to 11, Coach Smith took the time-out, and I said, fellows, we
were just here a second ago; where are we going from here? They did a lot of
talking in the time-out, and we were able to keep it going.  
  
Q. One of the questions going into this game was how the match draw up was
going to be at Dave's position, whether they were going to try to go big and
post him up or whether they were going to have to deal with his quickness. He
mentioned when he helped break open the game that he had the mismatch with
Sampson in there. From your -- what did that chess game between you and Tubby
come down to as far as who was going to get the upper hand?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think that the thing that helped us is when they went
with the bigs and we were prepared for it. Dave knew exactly what he had to
do, was using our length on the perimeter to pressure and buy Dave time.  
Truth be told, I go back to the Michigan game. I think the thing that helped
us most in the Michigan game was when they played Sims and Gibson together and
that allowed Dave to guard Sims in the post. I love Dave Lighty guarding a
post player. He's a lot more active and covered more ground with the help. I
looked up one time, he had Sampson who was at the top and Iverson was posting
low and Dave Lighty was touching Iverson low, and he threw at Sampson and he
was there. That was fine with it; we didn't mind that.  
  
Q. You might have answered this already this week, but what are your
thoughts about the possibility of expanding this tournament to 96 teams?  
COACH MATTA: I am all for it. I think that it would be a tremendous thing. I
think everybody is always afraid to change, and nobody remembers when there is
change, and from the standpoint of 16 to 24 to 32, how they built this thing
up, and for me, I've always said this: I think that everybody loses sight of
the college basketball season. And to me, that's the greatest time of playing
-- going through a Big Ten race, nine home games, nine on the road, but
people, they start talking about bubble teams and all this stuff in January,
and it's like, my God, we've got so much basketball still to play. So to
alleviate some of that and keep the focus on the old-fashioned -- when you
look at college basketball this year, attendance was down, and people were all
saying, well, let's get to the tournament. I just think it helps so much more
of the overall feeling of college basketball. So I vote yes.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about David defensively, which has never really
been an issue from the start. But offensively, can you talk about how he's
just -- he's taken himself to a little different level. Evan gets in foul
trouble last night and the next two baskets, boom, boom; same thing earlier in
the season. Do you see him in that glue position?  
COACH MATTA: Absolutely. I think this with David Lighty. Number one, he's worn
so many different hats in his time at Ohio State and throughout the course of
what he's been asked to do for our team. From his freshman year, it was you're
a lock down defender. The job he did on Jeff Green in the semifinal, Final
Four game was incredible, just across the board.  
You know, there's been times where we've asked him to score the ball as we did
in this tournament, and he did that. I told David before the season started, I
said, if you can shoot 40 percent from behind the line this year, we're going
to have a heck of a basketball team, and he did it. And I think we've got a
heck of a basketball team.  
You know, that stretch he had there for about two minutes today, I've never
seen anything like that before in my life. The one time he got knocked down
and it was a four on five to the other end and he comes back and gets a piece
of the ball, and his motor just -- that's what we used to say when we
recruited David; he's got a motor that just won't stop, and he's got a great
mind of how to play, and we love the kid to death. What he's seen in his time,
and I've said this, everybody forgets, he broke his foot last year. We were
7-0 last year and he didn't play another game for us. You know, that was
torture not having him out there on the floor, but I'm glad, because we get
him next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  69  
Purdue - 42

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask coach to make an opening statement. Coach?  
COACH PAINTER: First of all, I want to congratulate Minnesota. With everything
on the line, I thought it was going to be a great college basketball game, and
obviously it wasn't. But hopefully that victory got Minnesota into the NCAA
Tournament, and I think they deserved it, and they kept their head up. They
kept battling all year through adversity, through some suspensions, some guys
not playing for them, and they just kept plugging and I think they've got a
great team and they're going to do a great job in the NCAA  
Tournament.  
Just unfortunate. We have a great group of guys that have worked very hard to
be in this position and now be 27-5, we've had a great season, and being 2-3
in the Big Ten and battling back and being Big Ten champs.  
I'm proud of our guys, but we simply didn't have anything in our tank today,
and obviously Minnesota did and they had some things go their way to start the
game and we didn't, and it snowballed from there. The game of basketball will
humble you, and today we were obviously humbled.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Chris and JaJuan.  
  
Q. JaJuan, they just seemed to have a relentless pursuit for rebounds today,
and you've talked all year about that, how key that is for you guys to
rebound. Early in the game did that create the snowball?  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: Yeah, it definitely makes a difference. Any time your shots
are not falling, they're rebounding really well, and they're having shots fall
for their end, it really doesn't -- it's not good on your end really. So
credit to them. They really played hard. They played with a sense of urgency,
and unfortunately we didn't come out like that.  
  
Q. Chris, obviously without Robbie, some people have questioned what your
seeding will be in the NCAA Tournament, maybe a 2, 3. That coupled with this
loss, can that really affect your seeding or do you guys think you are pretty
solid at a 2 or 3?  
CHRIS KRAMER: Basically none of that is in our hands. The only thing we can do
is -- we've got to win basketball games, and today we didn't have the effort
we needed to. We didn't play as well as we'd like. So everything, the seeding
and where we're going to go is in the selection committee's hands, so we've
got to take that. Whatever they put us, whatever seed we are, we've just got
to take that and learn as much about it, have as much fun as we can, have a
great week of practice and then come out and lay it on the line.  
  
Q. Coach talked about not having much in the tank. The game yesterday was
physical and taxing. Did that have something to do with this?  
CHRIS KRAMER: That game was very physical, but when it all comes down to it,
you have to prepare yourself to play three games in three days. I just think
mentally we weren't ready to play three games in three days, so we've got to
do that.  
Now we've got to move forward from this, keep this in the back of our mind,
remember how this felt, that solid taste in our mouths, and use that as
motivation this next week in practice and try to flip -- everything that
Minnesota did today against us, rebounding teams, just flat out playing
harder, we've got to try to flip that and put it on somebody else.  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: Yeah, like Chris said, a lot of teams going in, we expect that
we're going to play three games, so mentally we should have been ready to come
out and have something in our tank really.  
In the NCAA Tournament, it doesn't get any better. You might have a couple
days off, but if you keep advancing it's going to be like that. It's like that
for every team.  
  
Q. How do you bounce back from this? What do you as one of the two seniors,
what can you do to help this team bounce back from this performance?  
CHRIS KRAMER: I mean, we're 27-5, so we've had a great season. We had some
adversity today. We've just got to come out and just stay together. Everyone
is doubting us. The only people that really believe in our team are the people
in our locker room. We've just got to come together and have a big-time effort
every time we step on the court from here on now because at this point in the
season it's win or go home.  
  
Q. JaJuan, a bucket right before halftime, which cut the lead down to 26.
But shortly into the second half, back-to-back field goals for you, a couple
free throws, a tech was called and a couple more free throws knocked down, and
then you got the crowd into it, got it within 18. Your thoughts at that point
of the ballgame?  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: Pretty much just tried to just keep chipping away at that lead
really was our main focus. That's all we really had to do at that point. When
you dig yourself that deep of a hole, you've just got to take each possession
at a time really and just make progress from there.  
  
Q. Unfortunately at this point, you guys are kind of used to seeing players
go down. That means something. I don't know how much you know about Lewis. Can
you speak to what you guys need to do in case he is out and the mentality
going forward with that?  
CHRIS KRAMER: We played the first half of the season without Lew. Optimistic,
I think Lew is going to be back. Lew is a competitor. But we've just got to
have everybody else step up if Lew is not out there, which at this point we
don't know anything about that. So I mean, everyone else has got to be more
efficient and everyone else has got to play harder but it comes down to
getting stops on the basketball for our team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Painter?  
  
Q. Take us through halftime. Stat-wise I'm not going to give you any stats,
but the number, the worst half Purdue basketball has had since 1950. What in
the world do you tell any of these kids at that point?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, you know, I talked to them about being 2-3 in the Big Ten
when we were in Evanston, and I told them I thought we could still win the Big
Ten. I also told them I was crazy, and they understand that.  
But I did believe we could win the Big Ten. We were 2-3, and I told them at
that time. That's what's great about competitive sports. You get ultimate
challenges, and people already had a question, where do you turn from here,
and you've got to dig deep. You've got to play within yourself.  
I just told them, you've got to -- I tried to get them to believe they could
win the game. It's 26 points. They said, hey, has this ever been done, has
anyone ever come back from 26 points? And the answer is yes. Very rarely, but
it has happened. I think LSU came back from 29 points against Kentucky about
15 years ago. I just tried to get them to believe. If you can do that, why
can't you come back in this game and battle?  
So we did it at a point, and they framed the question -- we had a good fight.
But our fight came from guys that did not start for us. Our fight came from
D.J. Byrd, from Ryne Smith, Barlow had a little bit right there. Why we didn't
play well or why we didn't have it, it's one thing to miss shots, but when you
get out-rebounded by 24 and you have as many misses as we had tonight you are
going to get out rebounded by not by 24. Our guys have done a great job
rebounding. It's not our strength, but still, it's an effort. The ball is
going to go in for us a lot better than it did tonight, and it is one of these
games you have to learn from. Hopefully it doesn't happen again.  
Like I said in my opening comments, the game will humble you, and obviously
today we were.  
  
Q. Two things: First, any immediate prognosis on Lewis Jackson and E'Twaun?
And secondly, are you concerned you may have played your way into a 3 seed?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, you know, I think a 2 or a 3, it's really not that big of
a deal. Just like a 1 or a 2, some people can argue that. The percentages say
the better seed you have, the more you're going to advantage. It's small, but
it's still -- so you're fighting to get the best seeds you can. But it still
comes to us, especially as a matchup. The matchups are very important every
year, but they're going to be very important to us with our group.  
E'Twaun got hit a little bit. He was able to go back in the game. When I put
him back in the game, I didn't think it made a whole lot of sense for him to
go back in. I didn't take him out because of his injury, I took him out
because the game was over. Those other guys needed to play.  
Lewis, the guy said he stepped on top of his foot, but they thought it would
be okay. They didn't think it was something where he couldn't come back and
play here this week. But I really don't know the answer to those questions,
I'm just taking what the trainer said during the game.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what you saw from the Minnesota defense,
especially in that first 15 minutes?  
COACH PAINTER: I thought Minnesota was great today. You know, silver lining to
us, playing so poorly. Just kind of the Big Ten Tournament, I think we've got
six teams in the tournament now, and that's great.  
I thought their size, they do a good job with their size. They zoned us the
time before. We had some success against them man to man. We actually had some
success against them to start the game against the zone in Minneapolis. So we
just had some good looks at the basket, and the ball just didn't go down for
us. But they have good size, good athleticism, good quickness, very good
balance. At times the guys he brings off the bench, they're just as productive
as the starters. So he's got a good group.  
  
Q. You know, Moore goes down and Jackson goes down. Do you get to a point as
a coach, what's next?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, you can't feel sorry for yourself. You have to play. We
have to play better than we did today. We have to rebound better. But I'm
proud of our guys. We're 27-5. We've had a great season. We've just got to re-
group, come out and play better and play smarter. When you get down, you can't
get frustrated. You've got to chip away at it one possession at a time, and
you could see where our frustration showed.  
Injuries are part of the game, and you've got to take it in stride. When other
teams have injuries and we beat them, we don't have any sympathy for them, so
we know people aren't going to have sympathy for us.  
  
Q. What's your thoughts about, they're thinking about expanding the
tournament from 64 to 96. What's your thoughts about expanding it?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, it's one of those things in theory, right now, it makes
for good conversation. A part of me likes it, a part of me doesn't. I think
there's some rules that have happened in college basketball from the three-
point line to the 45-second clock and the 35-second clock that everybody said
don't do it, don't do it, it's a great game, and it was better for the game.  
This is obviously expanding it and getting more teams in. But it'll be
interesting, the criteria of the expansion in terms of who now is going to be
the next teams that come in, and will it water it down a little bit.  
I like it. The teams keep adding Division I since they started in 1985, '86,
whenever it was. It went to 64 and it eventually got to 65. There's been a lot
of teams jump into Division I. Are those teams going to the NCAA Tournament
now? No, they're not, but are they going to work towards it, or is it going to
be more towards major schools. It's interesting to see. You can't really have
an opinion about something you haven't been through yet, so it's hard to say.  
  
Q. Between the 27-5 record but then Robbie's injury and then the game today,
whether it's from the committee's perspective or even just fans looking at you
guys, what's the most fair way to look at Purdue right now? How should people
be evaluating you guys, where you are right now?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, they have to evaluate us really for where we are in terms
of the guys on our roster and the guys that are currently playing in my
opinion. I think we're 4-2 without Rob. I think we're a good basketball team.
Obviously we're not better at this point than when Rob Hummel was playing. I
think that is a pretty profound statement. But we can't control a part of
that. We've got to go out and play and not make excuses, and we've got to
figure a way -- our guys figured a way to win the Big Ten without him.  
We had a tough loss against Michigan State and then going on the road, played
Penn State on the road versus Indiana, and then winning the first round
against Northwestern. And so guys are familiar in your league because I think
it's tough because we're now making an adjustment, and we've had some games
under our belt.  
They have to evaluate us in our current state, and we understand that. We're
just going to find out tomorrow where we play, and then we're going to watch
some film and go out there and try to battle.  
  
Q. You've often said some coaches in this situation will say, you know,
forget that, go on, play a new day. But you've always kind of talked about
you've got to sit in it a little bit, there's not a lot of days before your
next game. I want to ask you that, to respond to that, given that the NCAA is
right around the corner. And then the other thing I wanted to ask you, I
noticed because you put all the other guys in the game and I noticed Stevie
Loveless wasn't there. Is he with you?  
COACH PAINTER: Yeah, we had a travel roster of 15, and I wanted to leave that
open in case Rob wanted to come to the game. So with that -- you know, I
talked about the comment -- the comment comes from us when we lost that first
year and we were 9-19 and haven't forgotten about it.  
There's also particular games that happen when the wheels fall off and you
have a bad day, and they had a great day and we had a bad day, and I look at
it as we need to burn that tape, forget about it, because we had 27 great wins
this year and we need to play to our strengths and go out and just prepare for
our first round opponent.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2010

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  69  
Purdue - 42

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Smith to make an opening statement. Coach?  
COACH SMITH: Well, you know, I thought we really -- it was a very impressive
and dominating performance. I thought our guys were focused and ready. We got
off to a very good start once again. I think that's been a big key, making
shots and defending.  
I think certainly Purdue is a very good team. Again, but we were -- it's as
good a half as I think I've been a part of as a coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk about what it means to you guys as players after
all that's happened this season to become the first Minnesota team to make it
to the Big Ten championship game?  
RALPH SAMPSON III: Well, for me personally, I feel that it's a great honor to
be here, make the championship. I didn't know that we were the first team to
make it here, but upon hearing that, I feel that you look back at all the hard
work we've done over the course of preseason and practice and battling people
like Trevor in practice and how it's all paid off to this moment right now,
and I feel the team, we're very motivated for this game, and we feel that
we've come a long way and we have a lot more to go.  
COLTON IVERSON: Yeah, I just think that us hanging in here through the season,
I know we've had our ups and downs and we've just been hanging in there. We've
been working hard and it's paying off. We wanted to reach our goals, make it
to the tournament and win the Big Ten championship. I just think we need to
come prepared tomorrow. We have a tough Ohio State team and we need to come
ready for it.  
  
Q. When do you guys realize that this team was as talented as it showed in
this game against Purdue?  
COLTON IVERSON: Are you talking about them or us? Well, we've always had the
talent, just we needed to be able to build chemistry and start working
together, play as a team. Losing some players, we've had some distractions,
and we just needed to learn. Devoe has done a great job replacing Al Nolen
this season, second semester, and we've all clicked together in the second
part of the season.  
RALPH SAMPSON III: I agree with Colton. I believe we always knew that we were
talented and we always knew what we had, but we needed to come together as one
unit, work like a unit to reach our goals. And I feel as the season went on we
were able to do that because we always knew we had the right pieces but just
had to, instead of playing as individuals, play as a team. And as soon as we
were able to accomplish that, we were able to get anything done, and I think
that's what's showing right now.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how physical you two were today in the paint and how
much that contributed to your success as a team?  
RALPH SAMPSON III: Personally I feel that the aggressive -- being physical
today came off of the game last night. I think it carried over because
Michigan State was a very aggressive and physical game. It was a close one all
night, went into overtime, and I feel that coming into today, I don't think
that the level went down for me and Colton in the post. I feel that we kept it
up through the night and came into this game with it.  
And I feel that -- we knew that Purdue was a good team, we knew we had to keep
them off the boards, and we just carried it on from there.  
COLTON IVERSON: Yeah, I agree with Ralph. I feel like the game yesterday
against Michigan State got us really prepared for a tough Purdue team and then
just carried over from last night, a very physical game, and we just came
tonight ready to play with the same intensity as we would any other game.  
  
Q. After building such a tremendous lead in the first half, what did you
guys talk about in the locker room to stay focused and stay ready because
Purdue is a fantastic basketball team?  
COLTON IVERSON: We just knew that we had to come out in the second half like
the game was starting over. You can't let any halftime lead -- you can't be
comfortable with any halftime lead. You've just got to come prepared in the
second half again and act like it's 0-0 and just keep the intensity and just
keep going hard.  
  
Q. Ralph, how different is this Purdue team from the one that you guys saw
during the regular season, and specifically how different is it in terms of
guarding them?  
RALPH SAMPSON III: Well, it definitely was an adjustment guarding them because
they had lost Robbie Hummel. He's a great player and a value for the team.
They adjusted for that and it made them look a lot different than we saw them
during the season. I didn't play the first time against them, and in the
second half of the season, second game, I did, and it was -- from that game to
here was a big difference.  
They definitely were a lot more tougher this game. They really came out and
were trying to knock down shots, but I think that we pressured them out of the
comfort zone that I felt that Robbie Hummel was really putting them in there,
and I feel that -- just the game looked different from the first time --
second time we played them.  
  
Q. For both players, how much do you think it'll help tomorrow, the fact
that no one on your team had to play more than 26 minutes tonight?  
COLTON IVERSON: That's good. I mean, we spread out some minutes so people
don't get too tired. I didn't even realize that. But I guess that's good,
keeps some legs fresh. We've been playing -- we had three games in a row,
tomorrow is going to be the fourth, and we can't let it -- we can't get
fatigued or anything, so we've just got to come like it's any other game, and
you've just got to have the same intensity.  
RALPH SAMPSON III: I feel that, like Colton said, it keeps our legs fresh, it
keeps players still energized. And like Colton said, this will be our fourth
game coming up against a really good Ohio State team, so we're going to need
everything we have in order to compete and in order to keep our focus on this
game and to eliminate distractions that still might be lurking around.  
  
Q. Yesterday Devoe said he felt that you guys were as good as any team in
the Big Ten, and he also said as good as any team in the country. Do you guys
feel that you are playing with that sort of confidence as a team, and do you
also look at that confidence going into the Ohio State game? Do you guys feel
like you can play with anyone in the country at this moment?  
RALPH SAMPSON III: Yeah, I have to agree with Devoe on that one. I feel that
our team has really come together. We're really playing -- I wouldn't say our
best basketball right now because we still had some slips on this game right
now, but I feel that we're getting there, and I feel that we can compete with
any team in the country, and I feel that we can compete with any team in the
Big Ten. I feel that we've kind of proven that in this tournament right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Smith?  
  
Q. In a situation like this as you're advancing through a tournament, how
much does your experience, being in these situations, advancing in tournaments
like this, how much does that help in terms of getting these guys prepared to
play a game like this?  
COACH SMITH: It can be useful, but it's more important to have good players,
and we have some pretty talented players. Colton and Ralph are very talented,
big men that are proven now and starting to play their best basketball.  
It helps because you've been through the wars and because of age, I guess, and
longevity and experience in a number of different opportunities. But it's all
about preparation, whether it's with your staff. That helps, also, because all
the guys on the staff have coached in tournament play, and so we draw from all
those resources, and it's been helpful for I think the focus of the team and
their mental concentration, probably all starting with -- they talk about
being a unit, one unit, team work, playing together, playing unselfishly, and
those are the things as a coach you work for. You want your team to get to
this point.  
So experience, it's a combination of the whole year of -- for them,
understanding what it takes to get better every day, and we proved that today.
The thing about coaching, when you have good players, you look like a pretty
good coach.  
  
Q. Late in the first half I believe you were up 37-9 at the time. Lawrence
turned it over like 26 seconds to go, and it seemed like you were kind of
irate at him at that time. Two-part question: No lead is safe in any ballgame,
and in the start of the second half, Damian, the defense he showed out there
on the court, is it just the tone you guys wanted to set for the second
half?  
COACH SMITH: Well, Damian is as good a defensive player as I've ever coached.
I've been in the business a long time, and I've had some pretty talented --
coached some pretty talented players over the years. Damian Johnson is the
most versatile, defensive player I've ever coached at any level.  
I said before, I was disappointed he wasn't part of the All-Defensive Team,
and I think our kids were disappointed and he was disappointed, and he's
proven that he can do it all defensively, that he can go at anybody on the
court.  
Having said that, Wes turned it over two or three times by halftime, and he
was leading us in turnovers all year, so we need him to just be a little more
patient, let the shot come to him, keep it off the floor. That's what that's
about.  
  
Q. Do you think your team play its way into the NCAA Tournament today?  
COACH SMITH: You know, you never know. It's one of those, there's a lot of --
the committee has a tall task ahead of them. There's a lot of good teams, a
lot of talented players. You know, the best way for us to get in is to win
tomorrow.  
  
Q. You didn't let up on the gas, and I think we were talking about last
night, my perception of your team from one minute to the next is so good at
times, but you out-scored them, ran them off the court and still managed to
out score them in the second half. That must make you feel good as a coach.  
COACH SMITH: Well, we've had two bad games this year, and that's it. I said
that last night. We've been as consistent as anybody. We may not have showed
it in the win column, but we've been a pretty consistent team, even through a
lot of challenges and distractions.  
I've said all along, this group has been as -- I'm proud of their camaraderie,
their solidarity, their unity, and they're pulling for one another. You can
see they care about each other. Devoe Joseph has evolved into a pretty good
lead guard. People have accepted their roles. They appreciate what we've been
trying to get them to do all year long. As I said, this is a culmination of
all those hours of preparation. We're looking for that type of consistency.
You shouldn't get too high and you shouldn't get too low, just -- we always
talk about moderation. John [Wooden] used to talk about balance, and we try to
get that as a coach and we try to get that from our players and in life and in
the game, too.  
  
Q. With the stretch of games you guys have played here at the tournament
with Ohio State going into double overtime, most of their top players played
almost the entire game, do you think fatigue will play a factor for both teams
tomorrow?  
COACH SMITH: It's a good question. It's all about mental preparation. They've
got it all. Those guys, I've been impressed with them, Matta, and just the
conditioning of Lauderdale and Evan Turner and Lighty. You're right, Buford,
those guys. It's a championship game. The adrenaline will be high, the
intensity level will be high. You know, we've tried to prepare for this point
in time with the use of our bench and developing -- because you never know
what's going to happen, injuries, other things, and so we've been able to plug
guys in, and they appreciate their role like a Devron Bostick. He hasn't
played much, but he steps in and gives us quality minutes, Paul Carter, Justin
Cobbs, all the guys have done -- you can see what Colton Iverson has done for
us and right on down the line.  
So we have a lot of faith in each individual player, and that being the case,
I would hope that we'd have an advantage when it comes to that.  
  
Q. What would it mean just to win a Big Ten Championship for Minnesota, to
you as a coach?  
COACH SMITH: Well, it would mean that we have -- and I said before, I think
we've been doing it the right way, preparing the right way, recruiting the
right way.  
There are things that happened in the course of the season that may not --
that people question, but that's part of being a coach. You know that's
coming.  
So for these guys, as they mentioned before, sticking to it, just sticking to
the game plan, fellows, just don't be diverted by all the negative things you
hear, see. Keep your eye on the prize. That's what it would mean, for not
necessarily trophies; they come and go. I'm worried about how these guys take
something with them into their life after dealing with so many things and then
fighting through it, whether it's from the media, from anywhere else. That's
going to take them a long way in the future in their life. Wins and losses,
that's really nothing.  
But we're going to play and we're going to give our best effort, and we do
that and we'll be fine. As long as we do that, we can hold our heads up high,
and we can look in the mirror and say we did our best, and that's all we can
do.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  88  
Illinois - 81

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Weber to make an opening statement. Coach?  
COACH WEBER: I couldn't be more proud of our kids. I told them after, I wasn't
very proud to be their coach at the start of the week. I didn't like how they
played, I didn't like how they competed, and I didn't like how I coached, to
be honest.  
And in a week I think they grew up, they matured, they competed, and I thought
it was a tremendous last night, maybe even a better effort today. They just
have so many weapons, and I think we just kind of -- we had defended pretty
well, and then just as we got into the stretch run, we just couldn't stop
them.  
We scored, we had opportunities. We needed the ball to bounce our way, a shot
to go in, maybe a call to go our way. I thought Mike Davis, when he got a
rebound, I thought he got fouled. They ended up getting it. I thought that was
a crucial play, and we didn't get a foul. But it was a great effort by our
kids.  
I don't know what's going to happen. Obviously I think we had a good showing
here, but that doesn't mean anything. Hopefully it'll work out because I think
we're one of the top 65 teams in the country, and if we get in the tournament
I think we can do some damage.  
  
Q. Demetri, can you talk about the play at the end of regulation and the
play at the end of the first overtime, the two plays when you guys had a
chance to win?  
DEMETRI MCCAMEY: The first time, the regulation, we was going on a side ball
screen, and I felt like I got bumped a little bit. But at the same time, I
didn't make a play then. Then in overtime, the first one, I got the ball just
like the Indiana play we drew up, and drove it, and I was going to have to
take a tough shot, but I seen there was a little bit of time on the clock and
tried to throw it to Mike Davis real quick, but I should have shot it and at
least tried to get a shot attempt up.  
  
Q. Demetri, talk about the comeback. You guys went down nine after the big
run. You guys battled and fought back. Who motivated you at that point? Did
you take change? What happened there?  
DEMETRI MCCAMEY: Everybody, the coaching staff, the players, and we just felt
like the whole game, don't let up now. They make their runs and it's time to
make ours. Just the whole staff and all the players, we just got together and
just said let's man up and we made a run ourselves. The ball just didn't
bounce our way towards the end.  
  
Q. Both D.J. and Tyler, there were two threes late in the second half where
it appeared both you guys got fouled. What are you guys' thoughts on that?  
D.J. RICHARDSON: It was a pretty aggressive game throughout the whole game, so
we couldn't really complain about fouls at that time because there was times
we fouled them, as well. We weren't going to complain, just had to get up and
keep fighting.  
TYLER GRIFFEY: Yeah, the balls weren't bouncing our way. Like coach said, we
needed a couple to go down that didn't. It wasn't really anything, just got to
play hard, can't worry about the fouls, can't worry about the refs, just got
to keep playing hard.  
  
Q. Tyler, obviously a new situation for you with Tisdale fouling out and you
having to be in at crunch time. A lot of extended minutes for you. Talk about
your experience and being in that situation really for the first time in
college.  
TYLER GRIFFEY: Yeah, I was fortunate enough to hit a couple shots, a couple
shots went down. I still need to work on my defense, situational plays like
that. It was just tough one to swallow, especially for me. I felt like I could
have done a couple things better, a couple more things to help the team out.
But then again, we got -- tonight look for Selection Sunday -- or tomorrow, I
mean. We've just got to look forward, can't hold back too much, and just see
what's ahead.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Weber?  
  
Q. You had several players in double figures. I'm sure you're pretty happy
with that as far as good balance there. Take us through the elephant in the
room here. What was the thought process at the end of the regulation,
especially at the end of the first overtime, 12 seconds to go, you don't need
a three. Seems like they were trying to spread people over to maybe pit the
wing. Just take me through that.  
COACH WEBER: I don't know which one was which to be honest. You know, the one
we ran, it's a ball screen and a pop for our big guy. We had success the whole
day with that. You know, they had to make a decision, are they going to switch
on Demetri or are they going to let him get into the lane or get into the
basket, and if they help or over help our big guys shoot the ball. We were
able to do it against Wisconsin and do it today and had good success.  
They did start rotating, and this one of them that's how Mike Davis got open,
because they started cheating up on the guy that ball screened and popped. I
didn't want to call time-out because sometimes they're so hard to get it in
on. They put Lauderdale on the ball, and I thought Tyler had an opportunity.
One of them we just called it five wide where Demetri drives it. If they don't
help, he goes to the basket. If they help, we send it back to Tyler, and Tyler
caught it with about three, four seconds left, and I know it was a long shot,
but those are the kind of payoffs you've got to make.  
Again, I don't know all the different ones. The one D.J. had in the corner, we
were up two, Demetri got in the lane, pitched it to Billy, Billy swung it to
D.J. D.J. is one of the better three-point shooters, he had a wide open look
that looked good. It didn't go in. I thought we guarded pretty well for most
of the game until down the stretch, and they just drove it down our throats,
and we just -- hindsight maybe we could do some different things. But a lot of
foul trouble, got a lot of freshmen in there, sometimes three at one time, and
a new experience for all those guys.  
  
Q. When Evan picked up his fourth foul, they started rotating him a lot on
defense and were able to kind of keep him out of the way. Did you guys try to
do anything to attack him, because it seemed like he was playing with four
fouls for a really long time?  
COACH WEBER: Well, he's a smart player, and he has good length and he's got
good athleticism. I think any time we did attack him or get a switch, he was
smart enough to keep space and not make the call or have the call go against
him to get his fifth, and we finally got it, I think, what, second overtime,
finally gets the fifth foul.  
But you know, you learn as a veteran like him what you can get away with and
what you can't. Down the stretch you make sure that you don't foul out because
they need him in the game. Obviously he made a huge difference for them.  
  
Q. There's always a lot of talk about the eye test with the selection
committee. What do you think today's game showed to the selection committee
before tomorrow?  
COACH WEBER: Well, it's one of the best teams in the country. They're a
possible No. 1 seed. Really out-played them for a lot of the game. They did
make the run, got up nine, and to our kids' credit, really we weren't up this
much at their place 10 days ago, but we were up some at the half, and they
made the run. And I said, guys, now this is it. I didn't like the body
language, I didn't like how they looked at me, and I just said, you know, is
there any sense in laying down and letting them run over us and talking trash
to us? Let's step up and make a game of it, and we did, had chances to really
win it. But sometimes the game of basketball is funny, and sometimes it's not
meant to be.  
  
Q. You chose not to play Tyler in the second half after he had a fairly
strong first half.  
COACH WEBER: I think he played. He shot shots down the stretch. Maybe --  
  
Q. I mean before the overtimes.  
COACH WEBER: I thought he got in somewhere in there, but Tisdale is a veteran,
didn't have a lot of minutes. I think he was rotated in and out. Maybe not as
many minutes as -- I don't know, I'd have to look back. He did get 28 minutes,
so he -- you go with your veterans, the guys that got you there. Tis played
real well yesterday, got in some foul trouble. Mike Davis gets 18 rebounds for
us.  
So as I said, we had three freshmen on the court at some times, too, so quite
an experience for those guys.  
  
Q. You alluded to the trash talking, and I know that we talked to Evan
Turner and Coach Matta about it. Was it just the nature of being the
semifinals of the Big Ten Tournament or were there a few things that were a
little over the top?  
COACH WEBER: I don't want to make any comment.  
  
Q. When you got up 10 or 11, in looking back, do you think maybe you lost
maybe a little bit of your aggressiveness after you got that lead?  
COACH WEBER: When it was nine, I remember back we beat the press and had a
couple open shots and turned them down, and I thought we got real soft and
tentative. Tisdale had the little handoff, they stole it. We had some other
plays where we just didn't play strong and aggressive. It's that fine line.
You don't want to come down and jack up a shot and then you guys are going,
you don't have any control. But you've still got to be aggressive, put
pressure on the defense. They're going to pick it up. You know, they're older
guys; they know what's going on. They've been through a lot of wars, and they
made some plays, some steals. That's what got them back in the game. But to
our kids' credit, we did not quit or die when we got down nine, either.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2010

  

### [William Buford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20688)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

### [Evan Turner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18476)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  88  
Illinois - 81

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Matta to make an opening statement.  
COACH MATTA: Well, obviously what a tremendous college basketball game, and
just the turn of the events throughout the course of the -- I mean, the
changes of momentum. I think we went on like a 20-0 run at one point. It was
just, there were guys out there making great plays. I'll be honest with you,
there were so many I couldn't recall right now. Proud of the guys. I thought
they showed great toughness down the stretch to win the basketball game.  
You can ask these guys.  
  
Q. Evan, how surprised were you that the Illini did not attack you when you
were on defense when you had four fouls as much as they could have?  
EVAN TURNER: I don't know. I was just playing defense. Coach Matta just told
me to be smart. I knew once the game got close, they were going to get
tightened up. They weren't trying to attack, they were just trying to find us
and lay off. We weren't laying off.  
  
Q. Evan, what did you say to your teammates in the huddle after you fouled
out?  
EVAN TURNER: I just told them keep the game going. Definitely just finish off
strong. We're up by four, we're a better team, and just do what we've got to
do.  
  
Q. Evan, what did you say to Demetri after the game?  
EVAN TURNER: Way to play tough, and that was it.  
  
Q. William or Evan or both, for I think about 30 minutes it seemed like you
guys couldn't get a shot to fall. I think you were down 50-39. Just talk about
what Illinois did on defense to keep you out of good scoring opportunities,
and what do you think changed the game other than of course your shots
falling?  
WILLIAM BUFORD: You know, we had good looks, I just think we weren't knocking
down the shots. We just had to play hard on defense. We couldn't let that
affect us at the other end of the court.  
EVAN TURNER: Also, the balls just kept going in and out, in and out. We knew
they were going to fall eventually and we were going to get on a run because
we hadn't been on a run the whole game. We were just trying to persevere.
We've been through tougher times than this, and we knew we were going to come
back and win.  
  
Q. This could be for both of you, but 50 minutes for William. Evan, you
played every minute until you fouled out. Are you worried about tired legs in
this tournament?  
WILLIAM BUFORD: No, not at all. You know, I was a little tired and fatigued at
the end, but tomorrow is a new day. I'll just give my body some nice rest
tonight and that'll be it, come in tomorrow and play hard.  
EVAN TURNER: Not at all. We were in it to win it. We could have gone for 80
minutes we were in it to win a game, however long it took, and it's another
game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Evan, what happened with D.J. Richardson at the end of the first half?  
EVAN TURNER: No, they were just running their mouths too much, and that was
it. They were just running their mouths too much. They were hitting shots and
front runners, and they were running them off entirely too much. That's all
I'm saying.  
  
Q. Evan, you put the press on I think when you guys were down by 11. From
your vantage point at the top of the press, how do you think that changed the
way the game was being played from Illinois' standpoint?  
EVAN TURNER: I think once again, they felt the comeback. We had momentum
switch a little bit, and we definitely smelled blood, and they stopped
attacking after a while, just kept attacking, kept coming.  
  
Q. You guys had the buzzer-beater yesterday, double-overtime game today.
Does it finally feel like March?  
WILLIAM BUFORD: I really -- ask him.  
EVAN TURNER: Yeah, I mean, it is March, definitely every game seems to come
down to a closer game, closer moments. You've got to do what you've got to do.  
  
Q. Evan, I don't know if you've ever been asked this question, but have you
heard of the term headless?  
EVAN TURNER: No.  
  
Q. That's what you are, just want to let you know that. You started second
half. At what point do you decide to put the pedal down because you're not a
selfish player.  
EVAN TURNER: You know, definitely something just clicked, knowing that I have
to make a play. I might have to keep the ball a little bit more once the game
starts winding down and starts getting close.  
Coach Matta and I always talk about getting my team the shots and finding
myself open a little bit more, staying in the shots and sometimes you just
have to will your way, you just have to make things happen. And that's pretty
much it.  
  
Q. Evan, you mentioned they were kind of running their mouths a little bit.
Did that get you going at all?  
EVAN TURNER: It definitely got me going. Usually I don't really -- I show
emotion but I don't really get too much into it like that. For them to start
running their mouths, they really, really annoyed me. I knew we were a tougher
team and everything we've been through. I started thinking about the sand
pits, all the injuries, we always battled back through that. I knew what type
of team we had. I knew what we had was way tougher than what they had, and
definitely I wasn't trying to lose.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Matta.  
  
Q. Talk to me a little bit about this kid Diebler. He seems to be a
forgotten guy, and it literally seems with all the stars that you have there's
this guy hanging out, good players in the background, and you've got this kid
hanging out that just can get on a hot streak like nobody's business and
really hurt a team?  
COACH MATTA: I was saying shh because I don't want anybody to know about
Diebler. No, I've said this -- I think Jon Diebler is a tremendous basketball
player, and a lot of times throughout his career, like you said, he's gone
very unnoticed. I like that from the standpoint of he's, number one, one of
the greatest kids I've ever coached, number two, one of the hardest workers
I've ever coached. All he wants to do is win. I go back to his freshman year
when he shot 29 percent from three, and people were -- every time he'd shoot,
if he missed everybody went crazy, and we just kept his mind right. I'd see
him make them in practice, and to his credit he's just worked so hard. But he
doesn't care, he just wants to win. I love that about him.  
  
Q. What did you see out of Kyle Madsen when you put him in today? Seemed
like he was really getting in the paint, roughing it up.  
COACH MATTA: Yeah, Kyle was tremendous today, and for him, being the fifth
year senior, I don't know what his line was, but seven rebounds, four points,
it just -- I think the biggest thing he did was defensively he knew what the
what was going on. Dallas was struggling with the pick and pops, and Kyle
picked up on it. We were even able to switch some at the end and Kyle did just
a tremendous job. Proud of the way he played today.  
  
Q. I'll ask the same question I asked Evan. How surprised were you that the
Illini did not attack Evan as much as they could have when he had four
fouls?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I think we were aware of what they were going to try to do,
and if you notice, he wasn't guarding the same guy every time down the floor,
so we kept moving him from position to position to position. You know, we were
well aware they were going to try to do that, and the one time I looked up and
Mike Davis had him in the post, I'm like, that wasn't supposed to happen that
way. So to Evan's credit, he avoided the foul.  
But we were watching for it to make sure -- we kept him off Demetri as much as
we could. But out of the press, sometimes we scrambled back into it.  
  
Q. Just to kind of follow up on what he said, during that one time-out when
you put Kyle in, Dallas was struggling a little bit, you were a little intense
at that point, and that kind of, as you said, set the tempo a little bit. Just
kind of follow up a little bit on that. And have you ever been involved in a
game in which you scored 20 straight points and still almost lost the game?  
COACH MATTA: Well, the time-out, I just didn't think that we were as dialed
in, and I thought the first half and I thought part of the second half, we
were five guys playing basketball as five guys; we weren't five guys playing
together, especially on the defensive end of the floor. And the time-out was
basically to pinpoint -- we needed to come together defensively and get the
stops.  
As Evan said or Will said, we had great shots I thought. Those things were
going in and out, and I thought it was poetic justice when Will in transition
flipped the one up and it rolled around and went in. I thought we deserved
that one. I think from the standpoint of getting our guys to understand -- I
was telling them during the timeouts, Illinois wants to win the game, and we
can -- I told them at halftime, if you would have told me you were going to
play like this, I wouldn't have even come today. I thought they showed great
heart and great toughness to do it, and this puts us I think four out of the
last five years we've made it to the championship game of this tournament.  
I didn't answer the second part of your question because I forgot it, so I was
trying to cover a plethora of things. Maybe you got something out of it.  
  
Q. I asked Matt Painter yesterday about his team and NCAA seeding in the
tournament. I'm just curious, from your perspective does seeding really matter
to you in terms of the No. 1 or No. 2, and do you think your team deserves a
No. 1 seed?  
COACH MATTA: Well, it's hard for me to say, but seeding is very important to
me. I think that seeding in the NCAA Tournament and just knowing what the
committee does and how they peel apart a team and break them down, they're so
diligent in everything that they do to select the teams, if you will. So
seeding is very, very important to me.  
I think that in regards to a 1 seed, I'd love to have it. In the six years
we've been a 1, (or) we've been a 2. There is a difference. I don't know,
deserving? We're kind of on a roll right now. If Evan Turner doesn't go down
as the best player in college basketball, I'd like to see what would happen in
those six games that we played. But injuries happen, so you know, it's kind of
out of my jurisdiction to pick. But I'll take what they give us; I always do.  
  
Q. How much are you aware of the trash talk going on? And you know Evan
pretty well, did you know he was annoyed?  
COACH MATTA: You know, I didn't see -- you hear, you see. There were a couple
times things were said to the bench, and I'm sure our guys said something. But
that was a high level basketball game out there, and I hope you guys don't
take this and make more out of it, that Evan said they were talking -- there's
talk going on all the time.  
I will say this: I thought the officials did a tremendous job of controlling
it from that standpoint. Those guys did a great job talking to the guys and
getting it stopped.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  58  
Wisconsin - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Weber to make an opening statement. Coach?  
COACH WEBER: Obviously it was a big game for us, and all the things that we
didn't do well on Sunday against them, I thought our guys did a great job of
preparation, listening, and we executed what we had talked about. And we
didn't do a very good job on Sunday on the defensive end and the rebounding
end. We won the battle of the boards. They still had 21. That really was kind
of their only offense in the first half. But that was important.  
And the whole thing, I told Demetri, Mike Davis, they needed their best
defensive effort of the year. For most of it we did. Hughes didn't go down
quiet, Bohannon, two seniors that have had great careers, put a scare into us,
but we still won, and the most important thing is we're playing tomorrow. We
came here to keep living one day at a time, so we're excited about it.  
  
Q. This is for any of you three. This is the first win on a neutral court.
How does it feel to get that monkey off your back this season?  
DEMETRI MCCAMEY: It's great. When you keep losing away from home and things
like that, your confidence gets shot down a little bit. But at the same time,
we knew we could compete with a top-25 team, and we just wanted to prove on a
new season and new court that we could come out and compete and win ball
games.  
  
Q. Mike, what did you think the difference was today, and when you play them
last week?  
MIKE TISDALE: Just the overall intensity. Coach said it, it's a whole
different ball club today. We came out fired up. Everybody was getting in the
stance, talking. We had energy. That's what we were missing at home. So you
know, it's another day to live. Hopefully come out with the same thing
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the feeling on the floor when they cut the lead to
two? What was going through your head at that point?  
DEMETRI MCCAMEY: We didn't doubt ourselves. You could hear Coach Weber from
all the way down the hall, "Keep your head up."  
Me and Tisdale were talking to the fellows and kept our composure. Mike Davis
was in there fighting, D.J. was in there fighting, and we got that one
rebound, and it helped us seal the victory.  
  
Q. Mike, did you go into this game thinking that you needed it to get into
the NCAA Tournament? And what's your thought about that now?  
MIKE TISDALE: We knew it couldn't hurt. The thought is we're in the Big Ten
Tournament right now, we're not anywhere further than that. We play Ohio State
tomorrow. There's no thought process after that. So we're going to go back to
the hotel, get some good food, and we're going to get ready for Ohio State.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about your shooting. You're normally a pretty good
15-foot shooter, but today you had two three-pointers. You don't normally
shoot three-pointers. Talk about that?  
MIKE TISDALE: I was joking around with coach, shooting a little bit more of
them in practice and they were open, so I was trying not to force anything,
and I felt like if I was open and could shoot it, then I'm going to take it.  
  
Q. For Demetri, Ohio State, obviously you've played them twice this year.
They swept you guys and won by double digits. What's it going to take to turn
that around?  
DEMETRI MCCAMEY: The same thing today on the defensive end. We have to have
another game where I play decent defense. Tomorrow we have to keep our mind on
defense and keep our mind on Ohio State, and once we do that, I think we'll be
fine.  
  
Q. For D.J., talk about the Big Ten Tournament atmosphere and how that
was.  
D.J. RICHARDSON: It's great. Big Ten has been treating us well the whole year.
That's why I chose this school to go to to play against these great Big Ten
teams. We've got to wait for the matchup tomorrow. I think that will be a
great matchup for us.  
  
Q. D.J., when you hit the shot with I think around 6:50 or so, the three, a
lot of people sitting there thought that might have been the dagger. Did you
think at that point that maybe you had ended it?  
D.J. RICHARDSON: Well, I did it before against Indiana, but I tried to stay
confident and tried to get my swagger back and tried to knock down shots. I've
been in a slump the last few games, so I tried to get the confidence back in
my shot.  
THE MODERATOR: You can go back to the locker room. Thank you. Questions for
Coach Weber?  
  
Q. Is it fair to say that through this year your team has played up to the
competition and down to it? And I'm only saying that because I see Utah,
Bradley, Minnesota, great wins today, and then Michigan State?  
COACH WEBER: We have I believe the fourth-most top-RPI wins in the country. We
have proven all year we can beat people. Ironically he brought up the thing
about the neutral court. It's been a -- usually we've had great records on
neutral courts, and we have a good fan following, whether it was at Georgia or
in the United Center or Vegas, and we just haven't played well. Our focus has
not been very good there. And I don't know if they played up or down to it. I
think it's more that when they play a good team, they have a sense of urgency.
Maybe a little fear factor. We haven't played well at home the last three
games, and I think a little bit of a casual attitude. That's how our team has
been all year. I think more than anything, casual, laid back, and that's what
gets us in trouble.  
I went back Monday. I told the coaches I'm going to coach the way I want to
coach. We went after it for about an hour. All competitive drills, very
physical, gave them a little bit of reprieves on Tuesday, came back, the same
thing on Wednesday. I said, guys, this is how we should be playing all the
time. I think we came back and got the message and that's how they played. If
we have a chance we're going to have to battle tomorrow. Same thing. We're
going to have to guard them. We've had bad matchups with them. But that's got
to be our focus and let the scoring tomorrow.  
  
Q. You just talked about the wins on the road and at home. Your history here
is very good now, and now over a 60 percent winning percentage here with the
win. Will that help you tomorrow?  
COACH WEBER: Well, I hope so. We have great fan following no matter where we
go. Our fans have stuck with us, so that's a positive. I don't know if there's
any secret to it or whatever, but we get up for the tournaments.  
Even two years ago when we had a real tough year, we ended up getting in the
championship coming out of the bottom half of the league. Our guys rise up,
play well, a little bit of fan following, enjoy the atmosphere. I don't know
if there's any true secret, just hopefully we get them motivated and get them
ready to play.  
  
Q. You referenced Mike Davis' and Demetri's defense. How did they defend
differently in this game?  
COACH WEBER: Well, one, Demetri just gets casual. We demanded he play 40
minutes again. He's got to handle the ball, he's got to do the ball screens,
he's got to make all the reads. I think we wear him out, and I think he takes
time-out on the defensive end. That's really what we tried to emphasize to
them.  
Jordan Taylor took it to them on Sunday. We still had a few baskets, but I
think we made them earn it. Mike Davis, he's just starting to come back. He
played pretty good against Iowa the game before ours, and I think maybe
unanticipated, they posted him up, and now we adjusted, and we said we've got
to fight them in the post. We can't let them get it.  
You know, one of the big things is play defense before your man gets the ball,
because if you let him get it in his comfort zone, it's tough to stop them. I
think they both did a good job of playing defense before their man got the
ball, getting in the stands, fighting them, and we limit them. He still got
14, but I think he had to earn it much more than he did at our place on
Sunday.  
  
Q. Is it easier to coach a team up once you lose to them last week in
preparation for them, or winning two games in a season, would it be harder to
come back?  
COACH WEBER: Well, the only reference I had was we beat Michigan State my
second or third year here in the last game of the season at their place. And
then we had to come back and play them here in Indianapolis, and they out-
toughed us. They wanted it more. I thought that was going to be the key here.
No matter what, those guys just beat us, and they're in good shape in the
tournament. And I thought maybe the difference could be if we just kind of
wanted it more, out-toughed them, and that might be a by-product of what
you're talking about, the quick turnaround and maybe not playing as well on
Sunday and a little more determination.  
  
Q. What's your thoughts, there's been a lot of talk about going to 96 teams
in the NCAA Tournament. What's your thoughts about perhaps expanding it?  
COACH WEBER: Well, I've said since the beginning and I've said for years, I
think it needs to expand. I didn't know about 96. If it goes there, I'd be
happy. But I think at least a little bit -- those guys get to play the No. 1
seed, now you're getting another six, seven teams in the mix. So there's
always going to be a few teams unhappy on Sunday. There's so much parity, you
see it around the country. I was at Southern Illinois, I know how hard it is,
I know how hard it is to get a schedule. So I think it's a good thing.  
It's great for student-athletes. What is the best experience you can have as a
student-athlete? To be in the tournament. And why not reward kids? And then as
a coach, we're always worried about our jobs, and no matter what anyone says,
if we get another 32 teams in, that means 32 guys probably keep their job a
couple more years. And I'm for coaches because I know how hard a job it is,
and it is for programs, for fans, too.  
  
Q. If you would, what do you recall about your two games with Ohio State,
what it takes to stop them and a comment or two on Evan Turner.  
COACH WEBER: I thought he made an unbelievable shot today. I'm sure Coach
Beilein is going to be living that one for many, many years, wake up with
nightmares about that thing. They played so well, gave themselves a chance and
then Evan hits the bomb to win it. Evan is a great player. He's versatile,
he's improved. I've watched him since his sophomore year in high school and he
continues to get better and better. He works at it, he loves it, he's grown,
he's stronger, and he's way better than he was a year ago. So he's got
unlimited potential.  
We actually did okay on him. It was the other guys that really hurt us;
Diebler had, I think, 13 threes against us, Lighty just drove by us. Those
matchups are going to be important for us. We didn't score well at our place.
They went 1-3-1 zone. We didn't shoot the ball well. They only had one
possession at their place and we were able to score more, but they were
playing for a Big Ten championship, it's 53-49, they get, boom boom boom,
three plays, and now we grab the game for us at their place a couple weeks
ago.  
It's kind of ironic you have Wisconsin three times in a very short time, you
have Ohio State three times -- less than a month. It makes it tough. Maybe
we'll have the advantage, like you talked about, with Wisconsin. But no matter
what, they've got to be feeling, first, relieved about today, and then second,
we kicked Illini butt two times. I hope we can have a little bit of a mental
edge.  
  
Q. Piggybacking off the question before about the expansion, do you see the
other side of the argument that we kind of live in a society where everybody
gets a ribbon and maybe 96 teams might let everybody in?  
COACH WEBER: I totally understand, and I think that's one of our faults in our
society today. I don't mind it at a young age because I think you need to keep
kids positive, interested, wanting to be part of it. I think too much is done
with the kid that scores 30 points in a fourth grade game, and he's six-foot
tall and everyone else is four-two. To me that's not good, either.  
But at the same time, we have expanded the number of teams in Division I from
when I started 30 years ago. You know, it's -- I don't know how many it is,
maybe 75 or more teams have added on. But yet we've only -- we only grew one
time in the tournament. And so why -- how come you don't keep up?  
You know the old comparison with football, that they're getting half of the
teams in the bowl game. Again, I just go back to the student-athlete. And
there's so much parity, mid-majors, the budgets are better, the coaching is
better. I was in the Valley; I know how good it is. There's two or three teams
every year that could maybe get in the tournament that don't because of
scheduling or whatever.  
My year at the Valley, SIU won -- if you go back to our Sweet 16 year, I think
we played 27 games away from home. We had -- if I'm right, we had our nine
games in conference at home, and then maybe one or two non-conference games at
home. The rest of them were neutral or away games. So you're talking
tournaments, all that stuff. So it's tough to schedule. No one wanted to come
to Carbondale. They told us that there was no way to get there because they
didn't want to play there.  
It's very tough, and I think it would help everybody to be honest.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2010

  

### [David Lighty](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18475)

### [Thad Matta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17026)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  69  
Michigan - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening comment from Coach Matta.  
COACH MATTA: Well, obviously a tremendous win, and as we just talked in the
locker room, we weren't as mentally ready to play the game as we should, and I
think -- I've been trying to sugar coat it with the guys, but 10 days off at
this stage, we didn't have -- especially defensively, the things that we
needed to do, the adjustments we needed to make throughout the course of the
game. To their credit, they kept playing obviously until the buzzer.  
Hopefully this game can shake us -- some of the cobwebs out and get us back on
track. I thought at times we did some great things. I thought Michigan played
really well. Douglass got going, Harris got going, Sims was going early, and
proud of them for continuing to play, and obviously he hit a huge shot there
at the end, and we'll play again tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for David and Evan.  
  
Q. Evan, with only 2.2 seconds left on the clock, was the play we saw the
only play you guys had drawn up, you just get it down as quickly as possible
and get it off before the clock expired?  
EVAN TURNER: Yeah, definitely. I think, as coach said, did a great job drawing
up a play. Kind of similar to a play from last year except it was from the
opposite side. It was just a play where it -- somebody trapped me I could
throw it up the courts. It was a great play, and it was a good shot, and we
had a little bit of luck.  
  
Q. I have a question about that play in particular. You see a lot of teams
when they have 2.2 seconds kind of rush up a shot. Have you worked on that in
practice knowing that 2.2 seconds actually is kind of a long time where you
can take a few dribbles?  
EVAN TURNER: 2.2 seconds is a long time. They did a great job throwing the
pass. Jeremie Simmons did a great job of creating a diversion and I was just
trying to get the ball up and get it in shooting range and keep my follow-
through, and it went in.  
  
Q. Evan, your release came with .2 seconds on the clock, so how conscious
were you of the remaining time as you were coming up the court?  
EVAN TURNER: I was really conscious. I was very conscious. What my coaches
told me, you probably only have two dribbles, so I knew by my second dribble I
had to get it up, and that was pretty much it.  
  
Q. Did you think guys would kind of swarm you on that play? Everyone knows
who you are, but did you think you'd have to face a double- or triple-team
there?  
EVAN TURNER: Honestly I thought they were probably going to crash or something
like that. The whole game they were swarming me. They gave me one good look. I
guess being open, it felt a little bit free. I had a lot of time to shoot the
ball. I felt like I was in the gym by myself.  
  
Q. Evan, again on that shot, have you ever hit anything like that from that
type of distance in that situation before?  
EVAN TURNER: Maybe just playing around with my teammates. You know, last year
and this year after practice we just sit in the gym and shoot half-court
shots. But definitely when I go to the gym at night, sometimes I'll just shoot
deep sometimes, but it's just a joke. But it definitely went in, and you can't
really practice for those moments, you just have to come out and come ready.  
  
Q. Dave, I think you guys were up 51-38 with just a little bit more than ten
minutes left. I just wondered if you could explain a little bit about how
maybe what Michigan did to come back, and was it also like Thad said, just a
little bit of you guys not having played in ten days and maybe not being used
to a game situation in that long?  
DAVID LIGHTY: You could say that, but you've got to give Michigan credit. They
never gave up. They kept playing and kept coming at us. I think they hit like
two back-to-back threes in that stretch, and I mean, that gave them a lot of
confidence.  
Like I said, they just kept attacking us. They came ready to play. Like coach
always says, when our minds are right, our game is right. We've just got to
get our minds right now.  
  
Q. David, what did you think when you saw the shot leave Evan's hand?  
DAVID LIGHTY: I was sprinting behind him as fast as I could, because I thought
they were going to double-team him, so I thought I was going to be open. But
when it left his hands, it just felt like it was floating up there forever
pretty much, and when it went in, I felt like I was at a loss for words pretty
much.  
  
Q. David, the talent that you're bringing to the floor, is it nice to be in
a position where everybody else is focusing on somebody else on your team and
leaving you in the situations that you're in, because it seems like from an
outsider's perspective that you're bringing a lot to the table?  
DAVID LIGHTY: Of course, he's a great player, so you have to draw double-teams
towards him or he's going to hurt you every time. He makes things a lot easier
for all of us out there on the court. If I get the ball on a wing or something
like that, it's kind of like one-on-one, and I like to penetrate. So I try to
take my man as much as possible.  
  
Q. This is an NBA environment here. How did you like it?  
EVAN TURNER: It was cool. Coming to the Big Ten Tournament is always fun, and
a lot of passion, a lot of action. It's March time, so it's the most fun time
of the year. You know, it's cool. I liked it a lot.  
  
Q. For both Evan and Dave, just the idea of what this shot and this win, the
opportunity it gives you to come back tomorrow. As coach talked about, maybe
this is the wake-up call that you guys needed for this game and the rest of
the season. What will you guys as leaders tell the rest of the guys after
this?  
DAVID LIGHTY: I would say it's a wake-up call. Watching games yesterday,
watching Syracuse go down, you know, watching Kansas go down to the wire
almost and things like that, it's kind of like we almost did the same thing
pretty much. We have to get our minds right. It's kind of like second life,
second wind for us. So coming out tomorrow with our minds right is going to be
very important.  
EVAN TURNER: Yeah, I just think this is a game to shake the cobwebs out. We
really got back in game mode. I think there's not much to be said. We know we
really have to finish off the game and keep our foot on the pedal now that we
have the opportunity to do so. That goes without saying, and we definitely
know what we did wrong. We just have to come back tomorrow and really keep
executing.  
  
Q. Both of you guys, Evan, I think you said earlier that you had not made a
game-winning shot like that, but have either one of you guys been in a game-
ending situation like this, what happened today, whether you made the shot or
not?  
EVAN TURNER: Yeah, I mean, last year versus Sienna, that game we went back and
forth for like the last couple minutes on shots, and I missed a shot last
year. So this year I was really fortunate enough to hit the shot.  
DAVID LIGHTY: For me, most definitely. My freshman year there was a couple of
them. Of course Ron Lewis hitting the three versus Xavier and the tournaments
in overtime. Mike Conley hitting a floater to win the Big Ten championship.
And then we also had a chance to send it to overtime at Wisconsin when Jamar
shot a three. I've been in that situation a couple times, but I think this one
might be the best one.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Matta.  
  
Q. Coach Matta, it didn't end up happening, but does anything focus a team
that's supposed to be doing what you're doing right now by coming out and
losing to a team you had no business even being around, other than the rivalry
factor?  
COACH MATTA: Well, I disagree. I think Michigan is a heck of a basketball
team. I mean, you've got -- in my mind, the way that Sims started the game, I
mean, that was like an NBA power forward there, and then the way Manny got
going, and then the pieces are there. They beat us once this year. You could
say we didn't have Evan, but we were down halftime at our place. Matchup wise,
this is hard.  
Last year Manny hit the shot on the drive, and we switched, and he shot over a
7-5 wing span over Dallas. That was a heck of a shot on his part.  
But you know, and I think our guys have a pretty good understanding of being
in this type of environment, that anything can happen. And right now you're in
March. Michigan is playing for more games. We're playing for hopefully
positioning. And a lot of times the hunger may be -- and I attempted to talk
to the guys about this last night, you can't come over here and just be
satisfied with where we are today. Let's continue to make noise. That was
probably the frustrating thing for me in watching the game today. I didn't
think we were as sharp as we needed to be. We bobbled passes, we threw passes
we normally don't throw, we missed screens. But at times I thought we had some
great things going, and that was just the -- I'm always striving for 40
minutes of it, if that answers the long question.  
  
Q. You just mentioned a little bit about positioning. Do you tell your team
as far as team goals, do you guys look at the one seed at all as a possibility
and say we maybe have to win this tournament or win some more games?  
COACH MATTA: You know, it doesn't. My goal is to play the best basketball that
we can, and I think when you get into an objective type of -- I don't think
they're sitting over in the Hyatt over there saying, if this happens, this
happens, then this -- you could beat yourself up as a coach to do that. So our
thing is let's just play our best basketball and let the chips fall where they
may on Sunday.  
  
Q. I may be ahead of myself a little bit, but what's the process of talking
with Evan about his future? You've done that with some other guys before. How
does that work with you?  
COACH MATTA: It doesn't work well. (Laughter).  
I'm going to give Evan Turner the most credit. He's very similar to Michael
and Greg from the standpoint of all he wants to do is play great basketball.
His focus has never wavered. I think Evan and I have a tremendous
relationship. I asked him to come to me if things ever went on in his mind. He
never has. I think when the season ends, we can sit down and present the
information.  
So many times people forget how the process works. Stu Jackson and Ned Cohen
in the NBA office can pretty much tell you what's going to happen, and so the
outside influences don't need to get involved. And that's trust with a player
and a coach having that relationship. But we haven't even talked about it. You
can see by the way he played today, it's not on his mind right now.  
And the great thing about Evan, Evan doesn't want to just play in the NBA.
Evan wants to be a great player the day he goes and have a great career.  
  
Q. What was the discussion in the time-out after the Harris basket? And is
it rather appropriate -- Evan has done pretty much everything. One thing
missing on his résumé is a shot at the buzzer to win a game. How appropriate
does it feel that he got that?  
COACH MATTA: Well, the time-out was 2.2 seconds, and kind of like you said, we
were going to put it in his hands. We had an alternate option if it didn't
work. But I told him get it up there as quick as you can. We had guys
positioned, I knew we probably couldn't throw the cross-court pass, but it was
more of make a play. And he knew how far he could get with the 2.2 seconds,
and they gave him a running start, which was good for us.  
As far as his check box of -- that's definitely one, a half court shot to win
a game. Great, great play. The hardest part for me, I was debating in my mind,
do we throw it, run a home run and try to loop it in and make a play. I
thought we had enough time, and fortunately I chose the latter.  
  
Q. At what point did you realize the shot might actually go in, and were you
surprised that Michigan didn't put even anybody in the backcourt?  
COACH MATTA: Um, yeah, I don't know what they -- John Beilein has won more
games than I'll ever win, so I'm never going to try to think of what he's
thinking. I'm not that smart. But I think that from the perspective of -- what
was the first part of the question?  
  
Q. At what point did you realize --  
COACH MATTA: Oh, as he let it go -- it's funny because I was so mad kind of at
how we had played throughout the course of the game, but as he let it go, I
thought, damn, that thing has got a chance to go in. As it kept going, going,
going, boom, went in, and obviously I'm not sure it was supposed to go in with
how we had played for 39 minutes and 57.8 seconds, but fortunately it did.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2010

  

### [Jon Leuer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20657)

### [Bo Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17045)

### [Jordan Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20658)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  58  
Wisconsin - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Ryan to make an opening statement.  
COACH RYAN: We'll just go ahead and take questions.  
  
Q. This is for both Jon and Jordan. You guys at this initial stage have any
explanation for the cold shooting early that went for most of the game?  
JON LEUER: You know, we were getting some decent looks, and they just weren't
falling. But we had to work a little bit harder to finish inside. Obviously we
missed some bunnies, but for the most part we were getting good shots, it was
just a matter of us finishing.  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Yeah, I mean, like Jon said, the looks were there, just weren't
knocking them down, which is kind of the difference from Sunday to Friday. But
we've got another chance now when we come back to play next week, and
hopefully we can get it done then.  
  
Q. Did you guys feel once you got that string of three-pointers that you had
a chance and had them on the ropes a little bit when you cut it to two?  
JORDAN TAYLOR: Yeah, I think we always feel like we have a chance even when
we're down 16 with seven minutes or whatever, but Trevon hit some big shots
and obviously the crowd, got our bench behind us, got some energy and we just
couldn't pull it out at the end. But I think we waited too long to have that
sense of urgency.  
  
Q. Was Tisdale doing anything different than he had in the previous two
games you guys played against them?  
JON LEUER: No. We knew the coaches did a great job of scouting for it. We gave
him too easy of looks and let him get comfortable. He just got on a roll, and
he's a good player. He's worked out his game to become a good player, and he
knocked out some shots. Sometimes you've just got to tip your hat when a guy
can do that.  
  
Q. Jon, do you think they made it tougher for you to score down on the low
block than on Sunday when you played them in Champaign?  
JON LEUER: To be honest, I don't think anything really changed. I just missed
some shots, probably didn't make the right reads on a couple of them, maybe
should have kicked it out. But for the most part I didn't finish.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for Coach Ryan.  
  
Q. Coach Matta said earlier today when they ended up winning their game that
there is that possibility when the better teams come in, the other team is
playing for their lives, that dynamic sets in. Do you feel like that's what
happened today?  
COACH RYAN: I've never played darts with anybody thinking that I was the
better guy. I always thought I had to do something really well to be
successful. As a coach, when you say "the better team," we split during the
year; Illinois has got a very good team. We didn't do anything different that
way. I'd like to maybe make up some stuff that you guys could fly with. When
you're 1-for-10 within five feet of the rim, like Jon said, you can try to
explain it, we can try, we just didn't finish. We played against teams that
struggled that way, and after the game, we don't go, "how the heck did those
guys miss those shots?" We just always think, okay, good, maybe we rushed
them, maybe we did this, maybe we did that. But it's still about the end
result.  
I thought for sure the first question was going to be why didn't we press
sooner. You surprised me, caught me off guard.  
  
Q. Two times you've played Illinois in which you just went unbelievably
cold. You missed 15 of your last 17 shots up there, and today I don't know
what it was, but it was ridiculous. Illinois, is there something about
Illinois?  
COACH RYAN: We've done that, you know -- fortunately you can count on one hand
how many times we've done that or that I've coached teams that have done that.
If you're not turning the ball over and if you can get to the free-throw line,
a lot of times you can have those kind of cold nights. You know, and we didn't
turn it over a lot. If we did, the front end of those one-and-ones in the
first half, our free throw total would have been up. But when you're in a game
like that where you're not hitting shots, you need 20-plus free throws, and
you need to turn the ball over anywhere between five and nine times.  
We lose by four, and you look at the two statistics that I just gave you, the
five to nine we took care of. We didn't get to the line enough. And then
defensively, some of those same shots that were hit today were not hit Sunday.
But there's a lot of coaches saying that in their post-game conferences right
now. You've got to get it done when the clock is moving. And we didn't, and we
paid for it collectively.  
  
Q. Have you ever coached a player like Trevon that can get so hot so quick
and just take over a game like he did toward the end?  
COACH RYAN: Well, I don't know if he actually took the game over. Sometimes
out of desperation in life we do things. Necessity is the mother of invention
and all those other clichés you can throw out. What you never want to be known
for as a player is if the game is not on the line, watch me shoot it now.
That's not Trevon. Trevon has hit shots to win games when the game was on the
line. So he's been through some streaks as a shooter where he really has a
tough time getting his shooting rhythm going. And you have to then maybe get
to the free-throw line, drive, finish. How many shots did he miss around the
basket? A couple times he could have pump faked, could have been at the free-
throw line for a few more, and then that would have taken care of that
statistic that I gave you before.  
But we didn't. I think he was expecting some contact. He didn't get it. But
he's capable of making plays, and those threes that he hit, without a doubt,
that triggered -- we had some other big shots in there, too, and we had some
good stops. That's a recipe for a great comeback. I thought it was Michigan
State all over again from two years ago. I really thought that once we got it
down there that we could close that, sometimes because the other team is on
your heels and you get a little tentative. They didn't, though; they took care
of the ball. We were trying to get the jump on those last couple fouls that
were called. We were trying to get a jump ball because the hour was ours.  
The other thing is when you pressure, I've seen it happen a few times, the guy
thinks he's going to get fouled, he keeps the ball in the corner, he's trying
to protect it, we're not fouling, next thing you know ten seconds go off, we
get the turnover, and I thought that was going to happen on one of those last
possessions, but we were called for a foul and we didn't get it.  
  
Q. I know you're not happy with the loss, but are you proud of your team
being down double digits so late, able to make the comeback and get it down to
one possession?  
COACH RYAN: Yeah, we're the same guys on the left-hand side as we are on the
right-hand side. We can't change who we are. So am I -- yeah, I'm not going to
make any statements about our players about this, that, the other thing,
because it's 40 minutes, so we went over some things during a couple of those
timeouts. You've got to keep believing. As poorly as our shooters shot the
ball, they were still the ones that were igniting some good things that were
happening.  
So their leadership was still being exhibited with our full court pressure,
with our trying to get them to make some tough decisions, and we did. I mean,
we get a team to turn it over, what did they end up with, 17 turnovers? Come
on. That's -- you put a team in that position where there's a difference of
12, you've got to be on the other side with that one.  
And then when you're not, you lick your wounds and go to next.  
  
Q. When you got two seniors on your team that have played in a lot of games
and they start the game a combined 0-for-17, I think it was, what do you tell
them?  
COACH RYAN: Make the next one. I don't go, hey, you guys are 0-for-17; I think
maybe if you made a couple, we've got a chance here.  
We don't make a big deal out of it. The players know it better than anybody
else. I'm so proud of those guys that, as mad as you get about certain things.
But what I saw out there, I won't forget for a long time, and I don't think
our players will, either. I think they reached down and got some things. We
changed the lineup, we put a couple freshmen in there. Those guys made some
things happen because it was getting away from us. Then we go back with our
other guys and we chip, and then, boom. How many threes did they hit when the
light went on to end the shot clock? Give them credit, because we've done that
to people. We have beaten people the exact same way.  
And I know it's frustrating for the other team. But you hang around long
enough, you're on both ends.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about McCamey. You frustrated him on Sunday. He had a
pretty rough game, rough week as a matter of fact with all the showing of the
ESPN incident. Why weren't you able to do better against him today?  
COACH RYAN: What ESPN incident?  
  
Q. Well, the play in which he was taken out of the game and coach swore at
him. It was shown --  
COACH RYAN: The only thing I get as the head coach is a DVD of all the
possessions. I don't get any announcers. I don't get any sideline deals. So I
can't answer your question, because I don't know what happened.  
  
Q. Forget that, just talk about what you did to him Sunday as opposed to
what he was able to do today.  
COACH RYAN: Well, you give a player credit if he gets things done. We still
tried to do some things to disrupt him. We still tried to get him to turn the
ball over. I don't know how many he had, but it wasn't enough. Yeah, he had
eight assists. He gave the ball up. He didn't force a lot of shots. So I
thought he was well within his game. He played within himself. Maybe he didn't
do that Sunday. You know, I don't know. I can only coach one team.  
But he did what he needed to do for his team to get where they're going to be
playing, and that's in the semifinals. So I just give credit to players that
get things done.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  72  
Michigan State - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening comment from Coach Smith.  
COACH SMITH: Well, we're just really pleased to get the win. That was a very
hard-fought, physical game. But you expect that in tournament play, and I
guess very well-coached and well-disciplined Tom Izzo team. We haven't had
much luck against them, but we were finally able to pull out a win, and we
made some great plays down the stretch to get the win.  
  
Q. You came in here with that attitude about respect. Can you just talk
about how that affected the way you played, especially late against a team
like Michigan State?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: Well, the only thing you can control is your effort and
your enthusiasm, so we just used our shirts with respect just to play hard. It
was just a team thing. We kept it between ourselves, but anybody wants to earn
respect in anything they do, so we're just going to play hard, and if we do
that we have enough talent to compete with anybody.  
  
Q. Devoe, can you tell me what you saw Michigan State do different tonight
than what you saw them do the previous two games where they got the win?  
DEVOE JOHNSON: Well, I think Michigan State still executed very well. They got
the ball inside to Raymar Morgan. He was having a good game. I think we just
came up with some big plays down the stretch, we rebounded the ball down the
stretch, and we just closed the game a lot better than we did last game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just the leadership amongst you guys just down the
stretch? What were you telling your teammates to make sure that they didn't
falter like they did so many times this year late in the game?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: You know, coach is there to lead us through that way. I
mean, we're out on the court playing, but like I said, there's really nothing
that -- you can tell the younger guys what to do, but everybody has been
playing basketball for all their lives. Ralph, Justin, Rodney, they're young,
but they've been playing ball. So if they were in the game they would know
what to do. You just have confidence in your teammates that they're going to
make the right plays, and I think everybody has confidence in each other and
that's what got us over the hump. We trusted each other and we got each
other's backs tonight.  
  
Q. Devoe, zero points in the first half. You really came on strong in the
second half, eight points in overtime, I believe. Talk about just taking the
team on your shoulders, especially in overtime.  
DEVOE JOHNSON: Well, I just got some shots to fall in the first half, some of
my shots. I didn't get that much shots, and some of the shots weren't falling.
As soon as they started falling, I was able to help our team get the victory.  
  
Q. Devoe, what made you ready to hit those shots?  
DEVOE JOHNSON: I just think I was just very composed and just wanted -- I was
just very excited to win the game. I wasn't trying to put it in my hands, I
was just trying to get the shots. I was in the zone to the point where I
wasn't really thinking too much, I was just playing basketball.  
  
Q. Just talk about obviously the NCAA Tournament at-large bid and how much
that was sort of a motive for you going into this game.  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: Yeah, you know, we all watch ESPN and we all see who's on
the bubble and stuff like that. We've been in there talking and we know for us
to get in there we have to get quality wins. Just with the respect thing, with
that motivation behind us, it just pushes you to play harder. I think this is
my first time that I ever beat Michigan State, so everybody collectively just
gave 100 percent effort to go towards our résumé for the tournament.  
  
Q. What does this do for you guys moving forward? Obviously you want to get
to the title game and win it because that is the automatic bid, and that
opportunity is still there for you.  
DEVOE JOHNSON: Well, that sends us to the semis and we're going to have to
play a good Purdue team tomorrow and we're going to have to come to play. We
just have to keep playing aggressive like we did today and keep playing with
confidence and the excitement that we did today.  
  
Q. Starting off in overtime, you guys had the ball, missed a three, Raymar
Morgan put in an and-one and the momentum was on Michigan State's side. What
caused you guys to keep your composure through the rest of overtime?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: I think that was the difference between this game and the
previous two. We just stuck with it. We didn't put our heads down or anything,
it was just on to the next play. When we did that, it gave everybody
confidence. I think Devoe might have hit a three to tie the game up, and from
then on it was zero-zero, we were just fighting from there.  
  
Q. Lawrence, you kind of touched on this, but you saw so many things that
were uncharacteristic of a Michigan State team, nearly getting in fights,
getting beat so bad on defense, some of these guys are hacking really hard.
You see them committing turnovers, shooting poorly. What do you think you guys
did to contribute to that?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: Yeah, I mean, they're a good team, but I think it's more
to our credit, the way we played. We're no slouches, either. If they miss
shots, we played good defense. We boxed out hard, and we rebounded as well. We
did some things we could have did better, too. But they're a great team. But I
think I just want to give my teammates all the credit because we really came
together as a team today and played hard.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys came close against Purdue and Michigan State, one-
point losses. Now that you guys have beaten Michigan State and finally gotten
over that hump, what is this team capable of? And have you finally kind of
realized the talent that's here and not the talent that you guys are
missing?  
DEVOE JOHNSON: Well, I think the sky's the limit for us. As long as we stay
focused and follow what the coaches say and just play our game and play with
confidence, I think the sky's the limit. I think we've got just as much talent
as any team in the Big Ten and in the country, so I think the sky's the limit
for sure.  
  
Q. Lawrence, can you talk a little bit about your play the last couple days
going up against some of the Big Ten's best guards, what kind of what your
attitude was coming in?  
LAWRENCE WESTBROOK: Yeah, I'm just a competitor, and however coach asks me to
play, that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to play hard and give my team a
spark on defense. I really like playing against guys like that because it
pushes me and it shows I can do another side of my game. I look forward to the
challenge, so hopefully I can do the same thing with whoever coach puts me on
when we play Purdue.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Smith?  
  
Q. Something that Devoe said just there leads me to what I'm saying, having
as much talent as a lot of teams out there. Why is it that one week we look at
you guys and you're world beaters and then other times we're looking at you
and you've got that record in the conference that you have. What do you think
is the contributing factor there overall?  
COACH SMITH: Well, it's in the eyes of the beholder. If that's what you're
seeing, that's not what I'm seeing. That's your opinion. I didn't see up and
down. I saw close losses where we didn't make plays. We lose to Miami on the
road, a tough team. We lose to a team like Texas A&M by one. I'm answering
your question. We lost about six games by about one point, two of them in
overtime. So we haven't been far off.  
I've been trying to stay positive and tell those guys, don't listen to the
garbage, don't listen to the static, don't listen to the people that
disrespect you. Concentrate on what we have to get done, and we'll be fine.  
We've had a lot of distractions this year, and that's been the whole -- but
I've been so proud of these kids the way they've stayed focused and been able
to do what they've been able to do and get as many wins that we've gotten.
You're right, we're as talented as anybody when we play the right way. I think
every coach in America feels that way about their team, especially when they
get to this level. If you don't feel that way, you're not going to win any
games. I've got as much confidence in this team as in any team I've ever
coached.  
Guys like Devoe, Westbrook, you're not going to find any guys with bigger
hearts and mentally tougher than these two guys. Like Devoe said, the sky's
the limit.  
  
Q. With Blake struggling to really get any shots in the second half and
overtime, could you talk about how Devoe was able to step up, especially
offensively, and really carry this team in overtime?  
COACH SMITH: Yeah, because he was struggling. He really had his shot blocked
about four or five times, and he kept trying to drive to the basket. But he's
a clutch performer, and one of the things he gives us at the point guard spot
now that our previous point guard didn't have is to be ability to knock down
the three-point shot. He's got that mentality that he -- he's going to keep
shooting. Same way with Wes [Lawrence Westbrook] and Blake, because I have
confidence in them, and that's why they're in the game.  
So we struggled tonight. We really struggled shooting the ball until we got to
the overtime where we shot 75 percent. We made shots. But I like that our guys
showed the toughness that we had to and handled the physicality that we had to
deal with throughout the game.  
  
Q. Michigan State plays a very physical brand of basketball. Could you just
elaborate and talk about how your team matched that physicality today unlike
times in the past?  
COACH SMITH: Well, I thought when you get on a stage like this and it is for a
tournament -- we probably have a lot more to play for than they did. Certainly
without Chris Allen, they've got -- we all have our issues that we have to
deal with within our own programs. But I thought our guys in the end, you
know, they talk about finishing the play, and that's one of the things we have
-- sometimes you can sense when guys mature and they grow up, and that's what
we did. I don't know if I answered your question. My mind was wandering there.
It's getting late, and I'm tired and ready to get to bed.  
  
Q. How has Devoe kind of embraced this role more and more as the season has
gone on of being the leader out there at the end of the games?  
COACH SMITH: Well, he's a pretty talkative guy, and one of the things we talk
about is being serious-minded, and I think it's taken him a while because he
is a very happy-go-lucky kid and he is a very excitable kid, and the players
really love him. We've got a close-knit group of kids, and they get along
great.  
But again, sometimes guys will try to do -- because he wants to win so bad,
you have to sometimes -- I thought that's how he got his three-point shots. We
were trying to do some things, and we took the ball out of his hands, let him
come off some screens, and he was much more comfortable. And that's what he
brings, and that's how he developed into the leader, because he can do a lot
of different things. As I said before, he can score off the dribble, he can
get to the free-throw line and make his free throws, and now he complements
that with his ability to get the ball to his teammates because he's been
primarily a shooting guard his whole life.  
He's evolved into it because the players have accepted it. Guys like Justin
make him work every day in practice so that's how you get better. That's how
he's developed into the point guard that he is now.  
  
Q. Are you concerned going forward from here for the first time this year
you're going to play three games and three games you're concerned with how
your players are going to react to that?  
COACH SMITH: Well, we played three games in, what was it -- no, we didn't. In
Anaheim? But you know, some guys logged some long minutes, Devoe and Blake.
But otherwise we've got good balance in the minutes played. They know we've
got a lot to play for, and a lot is riding on tomorrow night's game and every
game. So we try to get our guys to understand to play at your level, not worry
about -- just give the greatest effort you can give, the best effort, and
that's what we got tonight, and that's how I'll look at it tomorrow. We won't
concern ourselves with three days -- they're high right now. I know they're
pretty pumped up and their adrenaline is flowing right now. We've got to get
them to bed and get them some rest and get some fluids in them and get focused
for a very good Purdue team.  
  
Q. You've had some tough losses going back to Tim Bograkos hitting that shot
at Rupp Arena. How does it feel for you personally getting off the mat at
Michigan State?  
COACH SMITH: You're right, we've had a lot of tough losses over the years. It
feels great. It feels good, but it's one game. We've had our battles against
Michigan State. Tonight to do it here when it's such an important -- for us,
the magnitude of the game, I think it's huge for our confidence, our team, and
for my confidence, as well, that we finally beat the Michigan State Spartans.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  69  
Northwestern - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Painter to make an opening statement.  
COACH PAINTER: I felt it was a hard fought game, and that's what you get every
time when you play Northwestern. They're a tough basketball team that makes
you prepare differently. And we've really struggled with them. They've beat us
the last two times. That was the only team in the league we haven't beaten
this year, and there's a reason why, because he does a great job. They really
stretch you out, they shoot a lot of threes, they break you down, do a lot of
backdoor cuts, and then they're switching man-to-man defenses tough. They're
always maneuvering and adjusting to how you're playing and what you're doing,
and then they go to the 1-3-1 with their length and their size.  
So I thought our guys did a great job in the second half with their effort and
getting on the glass, and I thought that was the difference in the game for us
was our effort in the second half. Lewis started it with two offensive
rebounds right away. He's really known for his offensive rebounding.
(Laughter). And did a great job of really getting us going, and very
important, JaJuan got one soon after that. I thought when it came down to it
just getting those extra cracks at it off the glass after we struggled to
rebound in the half first.  
  
Q. You guys got off to obviously a very slow start offensively, 1-for-11,
but it seemed like you both kind of just finally -- E'Twaun hit a three from
the corner and got it going. Did you have to maintain your patience through
that drought?  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: Yeah, it happens like that sometimes if you get in the game.
We did a good job of keeping our composure and just staying about the flow of
things, and it started working out for us really in the second half and
towards the end of the first half.  
E'TWAUN MOORE: Sometimes when you start off slow like that, you kind of want
to rush and hurry up and take quick shots. But we just had to be patient and
just still be aggressive but not force shots and just let it come to us, and
we did a good job of that. We finally found our rhythm about middle way of the
first half, and took off from there.  
  
Q. For Lewis, coach talked about the start of the second half, a couple
three-point plays. Also distributing the ball to your teammates, and you had
quite a few assists that second half. What was the difference from the first
half to the second half?  
LEWIS JACKSON: I think the first thing mainly was defense, just the coaching
staff and players told me to quit worrying about it because Northwestern runs
a good scheme in basketball, and I didn't play that first time because I was
injured, so I was mainly concerned with what the coaches told me, to get
aggressive, and then once I started driving, I got guys like JaJuan and
E'Twaun better shots, and I think that really opened up our offense, and
that's what I'm known to do, just getting guys better shots?  
  
Q. You picked up two quick fouls early in the game. Talk about your mindset
trying to stay aggressive, because to me even, though you came out a few times
and then went back in, you seemed like you were pretty aggressive even with
two fouls.  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: I think it's always easier on the offensive end, staying
aggressive. But on the defensive end is where kind of -- you kind of try to
not get that third foul or that fourth foul, and really I just tried to move
my feet, keep my hands up as much as I can just to avoid foul trouble.  
  
Q. Lewis, in what ways do you feel like your team has progressed in terms of
learning how to play without Robbie?  
LEWIS JACKSON: I think guys like Keaton Grant and Chris Kramer understand we
have to step up more, but we still know that we have a guy in JaJuan Johnson
in the inside that can really be a big presence. A guy like E'Twuan Moore,
once he gets it going, he's unstoppable. So we know once we can feed off him,
and we just have to step up and make big shots, but we also know going to that
glass because Rob was so big on production and rebounds that everybody has to
come in, me Keaton, everybody, E'Twaun has to help with the rebounding. Once
we get it, we can push it and have fun like we did on the offensive end
because we have enough weapons?  
  
Q. Can you talk about your aggressiveness? You had 16 points in the first
half. You ended up with 17 free throws. Just talk about your aggression today,
and did you feel good offensively?  
E'TWAUN MOORE: Yeah, they did a lot of switching, so I had big men on me a
lot. I just tried to drive the ball strong until someone stopped me and try to
get all the way to the rim. That opened a lot of things up for us because
after that they started sticking guys in, then after that started kicking it
out to Keaton and Lew and other guys started getting open shots, and that
definitely opened up a lot for JaJuan. We had to be patiently aggressive.  
  
Q. On that matter of the first half, at about eight minutes to go, you guys
were down eight or something like that and you got in groove there knocking
down threes, and then as you commented on, just back on your aggressiveness.
You kind of got in the zone there?  
E'TWAUN MOORE: Yeah, coach did a good job of drawing up a few plays that was
pretty good. Got a few open shots. My teammates did a good job of distributing
the ball. Got a few open shots and knocked them down. Once I got the first
two, I started feeling good. The rim started feeling a little bit bigger and I
got into a little rhythm, and that was it.  
  
Q. Lewis, you kind of touched on this a little bit, but those two guys had
huge games offensively. You came in about seven and a half minutes left, you
did a lot offensively and then Chris is the one who gets that three-point play
at the end of the game that gives you guys a little bit of separation.
Everybody needs to step up without Rob, and tonight really kind of was that,
right?  
LEWIS JACKSON: I think so, and I think that speaks on our veteran leadership,
how this program has guys from Kramer that's a senior to even myself as being
a sophomore. Everybody trusts each other. Our big two scorers still trust that
if one of us is open, we can knock down that shot and it's no problem with
whoever makes the shot and we still rely on our defensive principles to get
wins.  
  
Q. In athletics it's kind of interesting, certain players in different
sports really like certain facilities or venues, beginning with your state
championship game of your senior year you've had some monster games in this
building. What is it about E'Twaun Moore and Conseco Fieldhouse?  
E'TWAUN MOORE: I don't know. I just -- I don't know. I kind of like playing at
Conseco. They have nice rims, nice backgrounds, almost like a second home for
us. We always get a good fan base when we come here and just always feel good
coming to play. I'm glad that it's always been treating me good. The shots
have been going down, so....  
  
Q. Can you talk about the defense, you guys' defense between the first half
and the second half? They shot 47 percent in the first half, 30 percent in the
second half. What was it about your defense that tightened up?  
JAJUAN JOHNSON: Our guys are doing a really good job of pressuring the ball.
We held them to one possession in the second half, and I think that was a big
thing with rebounding. They out-rebounded us in the half first. Once we picked
that up and we stepped up our defense, it was a lot more effective for us,
really.  
  
Q. Coach Painter, you got a lot of contributions tonight from some guys that
haven't stepped up. I don't want to stay not stepped up, just haven't put a
lot in the stats sheet lately. How do you see that as the development with
everything coming along without Robbie Hummel?  
COACH PAINTER: Well, I think some guys that haven't been playing or some guys
that have been playing five to ten minutes a game are going to have
opportunities to play more with Rob being out. We start smaller, and we try to
play four guards and spread the defense. And tonight we just didn't make
enough shots to make Northwestern really honor us. Each one made four threes,
no one else really made a three. We need some of those skill guys to get in
there and make shots to open some things up.  
You know, Patrick did a good job of coming in there and contributing. Ryne
Smith, like you said, got some rebounds. I thought John Hart and Kelsey Barlow
did some good things for us. Those guys just need to be solid. You don't try
to step in there and do things that you can't do, just be solid, play to your
strengths, and like Lewis talked about, either Lewis is going to be a coach or
a politician, if you didn't notice. You can play off those guys. You've got to
play off E'Twaun more and JaJuan Johnson, it's no secret. And before we had
one more guy there in terms of playing off of him. Now those guys have to step
up and take their shots when they're open. But they also understand they have
to probe the defense so Johnson and Moore still get their touches.  
  
Q. You kind of answered this question, but you've had three games now
without Robbie, several practices without Robbie. In what ways have you seen
this team progress over the course of the last two weeks?  
COACH PAINTER: We've actually had what I consider five games, counting the
Minnesota game. We got beat by Michigan State, then we beat Indiana and Penn
State, now we beat Northwestern. I think probably the biggest test for us
without Rob was when he got injured in that game. We were down nine in that
second half, and we were able to come back and play.  
But it's a huge adjustment because we run motion, and Rob Hummel is the
quintessential foreman in motion because he balances things, he can shoot the
basketball, he can pass the basketball, just like in Bill's Princeton stuff,
Coble is so good at that four spot and John Shurna is so good at that four
spot, you take a four out of his system you don't plug somebody in with
skills, same thing with us. We have to make some adjustments. We don't really
plug a four in, we plug another guard in. So that adjustment is difficult. But
we out-rebounded Penn State the other day, and we out rebounded Northwestern
today. Those are the things we try to hang our hat on.  
Our next opponent, no matter who it is, we have to out rebound them, but if we
don't we have to shoot the ball better. We're not going to get out rebounded
and shoot the way we did today and win basketball games. You've got to
understand how you're going to win, but you've also got to understand how
you're going to lose and be proactive about that as a coach and really drill
that home to your players.  
  
Q. In talking to E'Twaun talking about when he got in the groove knocking
the threes down he said you drew up some plays, and this being an intense game
a big smile came across your face. Comment about E'Twaun and then also
Chris.  
COACH PAINTER: Well, E'Twaun, he got in the groove, but he actually had some
shots tonight that he could have made. He was 6-for-16. I don't think that's
really a groove for him. He got to the free-throw line, which was important.
But we just tried to kind of isolate him on the same side with JaJuan with
their switching man to man and force them to play one of them, and he did a
good job driving it. He hit some threes when we were down 11 to get us going,
so that was important. He's a guy that's stepped up all year. He's been really
consistent in his whole career, but he's really being consistent this year on
both ends of the court. I talked about the rebounding stat from a team
standpoint.  
Kramer gets the most important basket and they continued to press right there
when the shot clock was at -- excuse me, the game clock was at 48 seconds. We
were going to have to shoot the basketball, and it was one possession. We
advanced it to JaJuan and then he made a great pass to Chris, and then Chris
finished it and made his free throw, which was important to put back to two
possessions. That was a key play, and Chris is a guy that's very valuable to
us. I thought he made a huge mistake when he had three fouls to cut that kid
off, to get that fourth four. You play in a lot of college games you have to
understand how to play the game once you're in foul trouble. He didn't have to
do that. The foul occurred about 18 feet from the basket, and he could have
still cut him off or just waited or let him go. So he's got to be smart about
that because it hurts us when he's not in the game, especially defensively.  
But he's a tough kid. That block he made, he's very athletic. He made a huge
block against Buford at the end of the Ohio State game that saved us. He's
done a lot of little things like that to help us in the past four years.  
  
Q. Just looking ahead a little bit, I want to know your opinion on where you
feel this team should be seeded in the NCAA Tournament. Do you feel you
deserve a one seed?  
COACH PAINTER: You know, I started, I said a one to a three no matter what
happened in the Big Ten Tournament, and I'll stay with that. I don't think
we're a No. 1 seed, if we don't win it. But we're somewhere in there.  
I think to win it a team or two has to stub their toe probably. The last team
they're probably considering -- there was a couple teams in there that are
probably still on that line. We would have to be able to win it to get a one
seed. If not, I would say if we don't win it we're going to be a two or a
three. In my opinion that's what we deserve. That's our body of work. We've
been undefeated in non-conference, won our league. Obviously we tied with Ohio
State and Michigan State, were able to win this game and advance into the
semis. I'm proud of our guys. They've played hard and I know they'll get into
the NCAA Tournament and continue to do the same thing.  
  
Q. You talked about Bade a little bit earlier, and he may have played his
best nine minutes of the season when JaJuan was in foul trouble. How important
is that for him confidence-wise as the season goes on?  
COACH PAINTER: I think it's huge for him, and at times he hasn't really gotten
much of an opportunity. We got to a part of the season where we really stuck
with JaJuan Johnson and Rob Hummel, kind of similar to Ohio State's four guys.
We kind of used more Hummel and Johnson kind of the same way, and then they
played 35 to 38 minutes a night so he didn't get as much time just because
those guys were so productive.  
Every time he gets opportunities like this, he's done a good job for us.
Tonight he made his free throws and he made that basket, and he did some good
things defensively and really played well and laid wood on some of those guys
inside.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Draymond Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20678)

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  72  
Michigan State - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask coach to make an opening statement. Coach?  
COACH IZZO: I'm so proud of the two guys next to me. And I'm happy for Tubby,
because they deserved to win. He played -- we've had some tough games, and
we've won a lot of those. And I think it proves they're a tournament team, and
I hope they're in the tournament now because of maybe what they did, and then
we'll get something out of this loss. We just didn't play very well. We didn't
shoot the ball very well, and we really struggled to defend the first half.  
Give them credit, the second half we started pounding it inside a little bit
more and we defended a lot better. We found some lineups. But in fairness to
our 18-of-34 from the line, that's never happened, it's my fault because I ran
these guys into the ground. We don't do what Ohio State does. Give them
credit. I played Kalin and these two guys just stretches that they were so
tired by the end, they missed some free throws.  
But the effort was there from them, and that's really all I care about right
now, and we'll move forward.  
  
Q. What can you learn from this loss?  
RAYMAR MORGAN: I think we've just got to come out with better starts.
Defensively we just weren't there early. They had some hit shots, and they
made plays. I think we've just got to stick together as a team and just keep
fighting.  
DRAYMOND GREEN: Well, I mean, like Raymar said, we've just got to stick
together. We're going to watch it on film. We know we made a lot of mistakes,
learn from our mistakes and get ready to move on.  
  
Q. Raymar, you hit the three-point play to start overtime. It looked like
all the momentum was in your favor. Did you guys run out of legs or did those
couple shots take some of the steam out of your legs there?  
RAYMAR MORGAN: As a player and a competitor, during that time I don't think
you can run out of legs. At that point in time, I think it's just all about
heart. Those guys came right back in it, and I think Devoe Joseph hit a big-
time three. We just never really bounced back. But in overtime it's gut-check
time. There's really no excuses for the letdown we had. Hopefully we can learn
from it, though.  
  
Q. For either of the players, could you talk about Joseph's effort in the
second half and in overtime? Do you guys feel like you were guarding him
pretty well? Was he just making some pretty tough shots especially in
overtime?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: He did make some shots, but he put his team on his back and he
carried them. He hit some tough shots, but tough shots or not, you still have
to defend them. He hit some tough shots, and he wasn't doing that the first
game we played them, nor was he doing it the second time we played them. But
we knew he had improved since the last time we played them, and we had a game
plan to stop them, but he hit some tough shots, and we just have to learn from
it. Guys improve over the season. He wasn't that good. I mean, he probably
was, but it wasn't showing. But now all this tournament it's showing, and you
have to give them credit. I mean, he played like a warrior, and he rallied his
troops, and they rallied behind him.  
  
Q. I guess you and Colton Iverson weren't best buddies tonight, but can you
talk about the play that he had on the interior tonight and the problems he
caused for you guys?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: He played great. I don't think we ever saw him play that
great, but he played a great game. He's a competitor, and you have to give him
credit. He was relentless tonight down low, and it took a while for us to find
an answer for him, but maybe once we found the answer, it was a little too
late.  
Like I said before, we just have to learn from it. I mean, they were a little
bigger than us, but at the same time, I think heart -- the guys of your heart,
it doesn't matter what size. So he just made some tough plays and he made some
good shots, and he was relentless on the boards and offensive rebounding. I
pretty much think he was the X-factor of that game for them.  
  
Q. It looks like you even have blood on your jersey. You've been as
consistent and as team spirited and shown as much leadership as anybody on
this team, but do you think you can get more out of other guys at this point
in time knowing there might not be a whole lot of season left?  
DRAYMOND GREEN: I know we can, and I know we're going to. Guys are going to
step up, and for me and Raymar, I think we just have to keep doing what we've
been doing. I know guys are going to step up. I know Kalin played better
tonight than he's been playing. The rest of the guys are going to step up. I
think Korie had a better game tonight. Guys are going to step up, and we're
looking forward to it. We're looking forward to making a run.  
I think this is a learned lesson for us. Now we can wipe our slate clean and
just try to get this ship rolling.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for Coach Izzo.  
  
Q. The Ohio State game today was very close, Illinois needed to win. This
factor of teams having to win versus teams that do not have to win. Does that
factor in as the course of a game goes, at least as it starts in your opinion
sometimes to the outcome?  
COACH IZZO: I'm sure it factors in. I hope not because I hope our program and
our team is more competitive than that. Every day you have something to prove,
and we're playing for a lot, too, we're playing for a seed, we're playing for
a championship. We're playing for all those fans that showed up tonight from a
lot longer ways away from a lot of people came.  
You know, we've just got a couple guys that have to realize that, you know, as
I said tell in one and done time my bad goes out the door. You don't get to
have bad moments. Guys, we missed lay-ups, breakaway lay-ups, we missed free
throws, and I do give them a lot of credit. They hit some shots, but as good
as Joseph played and he hit those two big daggers late, they were 4-for-14.
They shot 38 percent. I mean, our defense was so bad early, and it was really
a lot better the second half. So I hope that's not the case. As everybody
knows, we haven't won a championship here in ten years. I get very -- I hear
that a lot, and maybe because when I was a higher seed, but if that's the
case, I'm going to vow next year to try to change that just like I have Big
Ten Championship and Final Fours and everything else because that's a cop out.
If you're going to lace them up, as Magic Johnson would say, we come from a
place that one of the greatest competitors that ever lived is from, and if we
are doing that, shame on us. Is desperation always a big factor for a lot of
teams? Sure. I just hope that -- Illinois to me should have been in any way,
and Minnesota now.  
You know, Tubby deserves to be in. He's gone through a lot this year and got
his team ready, and I give them all the credit and hope on Selection Sunday
they show up.  
  
Q. You told us on Tuesday you were galvanized, fired up. Did you see this
coming? Did you have maybe --  
COACH IZZO: I mean, let's face it, guys. They played well. I think he's right.
You know, he hit a couple shots -- he hits that one coming off falling away in
front of their bench, and he hits the one from four, five feet outside the
three there with the shot clock running down. They made some shots. But you
know, we just couldn't guard, and Chris Allen has become our best defensive
player.  
You know, the blame should go on, I guess, me and him there because I had to
make a tough decision, and the problem when you make decisions is if you can
just affect the player, it would be good. I just have trouble right now
looking at Ray and Zeke [Isaiah Dahlman] because I had to make a decision that
affected them. I don't really care about affecting me, but I do care about
affecting them because I get another chance, they don't.  
There are a lot of reasons we lost the game. We had our chance. We had our
chance at the end of regulation. I thought we almost had a lay-up. We had a
chance and we missed a lay-up. I'm going to go for a rule change on the blood
thing, but that was amazing. We had our chances, and we didn't get it done.  
You know what, we didn't deserve to beat them up there, they deserved to beat
us, so maybe this is a pay-back because they earned the right to win.  
  
Q. On your wings, would Chris have played tomorrow had you won? I assume he
would have. And also, why was Summers not playing in the second half?  
COACH IZZO: Whether Chris would have played, you know, I don't know that. That
was something I'd think about after the game. I just needed somebody that, you
know, could guard somebody, and I just -- between me and my assistants and
some of my team, we just didn't see that. That's not why we lost, I can
guarantee you that.  
  
Q. You've always put a premium on leadership, and there really seemed to be
a lack of it during crucial times tonight. Who's going to be that player, that
guy in the NCAA Tournament who steps up and shows a leadership role?  
COACH IZZO: Well, I don't think we're going to say shazam, it's going to
happen in three days. But Draymond is our best leader. But I'll tell you
something; I've been as critical and hard on him as anybody, but Raymar is
really starting to step up. Some guys aren't great leaders, and if you're not,
you've got to be a great follower, and you've got to be a great team guy, and
Raymar is really, really stepped up. Draymond is going to have to do it, and
he's got some help from one of his bruise brothers, and that will be enough to
get it done.  
They had a lot to do with what went on tonight, and they had a lot to do with
bringing us back.  
  
Q. Last year you guys went down to Ohio State and I kind of got a sense that
there was a lot of unfinished business left. Do you have the same sense with
this team this year?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, I said all along, I don't know how good this team
is. We had some deficiencies, and unfortunately we had a couple guys that just
didn't have the year maybe they had last year. But at the same time, I didn't
think this team was quite as good as last year. We were missing that defensive
guy, and we got Chris moved into that spot, and we're missing a center a
little bit.  
But we have a lot of basketball we still have left to play. We've got a good
team. It's not a great team yet, but there's a lot of good teams out there.
There's a lot of teams that aren't great right now. I told my team the same
thing, and I don't think they repeated it.  
It's been a little bit of a tough year in a lot of ways, but we won a lot of
games, and we've played pretty dog gone well when you look at the big picture,
who we scheduled, what we've done. But I like most of you do not feel we've
reached our ceiling, and yet I don't know -- sometimes you have those years
where you never reach it. I like the challenge ahead of us right now, because
I want to really mix it up a little bit, and we're going to have some fun with
the three of us, and we're going to go from there.  
  
Q. At what point will you decide if Chris Allen will play the next game, and
are there certain factors that will go into that decision?  
COACH IZZO: Yeah, it's strictly mine, and unfortunately the public will
probably be the last to know, no insult intended. But I'd just like to say
that I appreciate a lot of my media, but the landscape has changed for you
guys, and the landscape has changed for me. I understand yours, and I hope you
understand mine. I never close anything off, I never do anything like that,
but when we're to the point where we're dismissing a guy from practice or
suspending a guy and we're going to get information from parents and AAU coach
and all that and high school coach and all this, then the rules change a
little bit. If it's between me, the kid, and you, it's open-door policy all
the way. So I will make that decision probably with some guys on my team
maybe, maybe with my assistants, and we'll move on.  
This is about fixing the program, not worrying about an individual player.
It's making sure that we have the leadership you talked about that we don't
have and that we have guys that feel like we owe the senior, and that's what
I'm looking for. You all know I haven't found it yet, but I'm still battling.
I'm going to probably find it before I'm done.  
  
Q. The boys earlier talked about improving on mistakes from tonight. What
specifically do you see in the team that needs to improve to reach that
ceiling you talked about?  
COACH IZZO: Well, you know, I mean, defensively we were just not very good
early, and then I thought we were selfish offensively. We got charges and
running into guys and doing things that were open guys I thought in various
spots, and that's why we've got to make some changes.  
As I said, these two guys helped me a lot at halftime, they helped me a lot
after the game. I'm a big fan of player-coach teams, and in some ways we took
a step in that direction tonight. With every negative, there's sometimes a
positive. We're not a dog team, we're a good team that lacks some things that
usually hold you back from being a great team, and I'm going to keep searching
for them in the next four or five days and hopefully we get into that
tournament and we take another step.  
But in saying all of that, hey, we go 18-for-34 from the line or whatever we
went, and Joseph hit two just monster shots, you asked a question about the
high to low game, I thought they did a great job, and we adjusted. We weren't
quite -- they're bigger than us, and so we didn't do a good job wanting to put
more pressure on the ball. We made some adjustments, took that away our last
15 minutes, and that includes Joseph's two shots were really good. If we play
that way defensively and don't make those crazy turnovers -- we had lay-ups,
we missed breakaway lay-ups, we had a throw-ahead to a guy for a lay-up. That
was too bad. But all in all, our loss is hopefully Minnesota's gain, and
hopefully the Big Ten's.  
As usual, the country kind of slaughters the Big Ten it seems like. There's
five or six teams -- I think there's six teams now that deserve to be in, and
I'm going to blow my horn for them, not for us. Whatever seed we get, we get,
but I'd sure like to see Minnesota and Illinois in because I think they
deserve to be in because our league was tough this year, and I'll close on
that note.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2010

  

### [Bill Carmody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16994)

### [Drew Crawford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20668)

### [Michael Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18147)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Purdue  69  
Northwestern - 61

  
COACH CARMODY: We got off to a good start, four-point lead at half, and I
looked up almost midway through the second half, we had 34 points, 34-30, and
we had 38. In that first ten minutes really was the difference because credit
their defense, we just weren't able to score. We fought back -- actually did
we get to one or two? We got to one with whatever it was, a minute and some
seconds to go and had a chance. So the guys hung in there.  
But they made a play at the end, Kramer made a play at the end, and that was
it. I mean, I thought our guys played hard. We turned the ball over a lot,
which was disappointing. They forced a lot of turnovers, and usually we do
too, but we didn't tonight. I don't know how many they had, but it didn't seem
like we really put the pressure on them.  
And you know, their two guys sort of dominated. We had a hard time stopping
Moore when we played a matchup, and Johnson, in our 1-3-1 zone. That's about
it. Like I said, I thought we played hard. We had a plan, and just weren't
able to get it done.  
  
Q. Obviously a win today could have greatly enhanced your NCAA chances. With
where you guys are at now, do you feel like you guys should get in the NCAA
Tournament, or how do you feel about that?  
DREW CRAWFORD: I mean, that's not really for us to decide. We just -- we're
just going out here working hard every day, working hard in practice and
playing our hardest in the game and just giving it everything we've got, and
so what we do on the court -- we do what we can on the court, but it's not for
us to decide who's getting in and who's not. So we just give it all we have,
and that's all we can do.  
  
Q. Can you talk about just like the style of this game, very bruising, a lot
of fouls called, a lot of free throws? Juice, have you fouled out of other
games this year?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: I don't think I've fouled out any other games except for
today. But today's game was a physical game. There were a lot of fouls called.
It was just a tough game. I think we did a good job of slowing them down and
limiting them on their transition points. We just didn't get enough defensive
stops, and we just didn't get the shots and shot selection that we usually
get.  
DREW CRAWFORD: Yeah, like Michael said, it was a real physical game, and
defensive stops hurt us, and also our defensive rebounding a little bit, I
think they had 17 offensive rebounds, and that led to a lot of second chance
points. It kind of hurts us a little bit when we're in foul trouble.  
  
Q. Juice, I guess you're kind of used to, at least the last couple years,
this being the end of the season. You still have a pretty good chance of
playing at least another game. Can you talk about that feeling that maybe the
season isn't over after this loss today?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: It was a disappointing loss for us, but knowing that we have
a great chance to make it to a postseason tournament, that's a good feeling.
Still, this is going to be in the back of our minds. We have a long ride home
now. We have to work hard and continue to get better and just make the best of
what we can and try to win the next tournament that we're in.  
  
Q. For either player, E'Twaun Moore did tie career high but he only shot
6-of-16. Without Hummel, I'm sure you knew he was going to be a big part of
their offense. Talk about E'Twaun Moore, and did you guys feel like you did
defend him pretty well? He had 17 free throw attempts, but how do you think
you defended him?  
DREW CRAWFORD: I mean, he kind of killed us in the first half. They were
running a play where he was just getting out to the corner and just kind of
isolating, and he hurt us a lot in the first half. And then getting to the
line a lot, as well.  
I think we could have defended him much better as a team, a little more help
defense. And then also, when he was missing, we've got to be able to get those
rebounds, as well. So that's something we struggled with a little bit.  
  
Q. Drew, can you talk about, you played much better today. Were you feeling
better? Was it something psychologically you went in there with? And Juice,
just talk about the technical that JaJuan got.  
DREW CRAWFORD: Yeah, my back has been hurting me a little bit for the past
couple weeks or so, but that's just something I've got to really try to
mentally block out. Tonight I was able to do that. I think I was able to do it
last night, too. My back was feeling good last night, as well. So that's just
something I have to be able to move on from and not let it worry me and just
come and play with energy because I think that's what I need to bring to this
team is energy.  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: Me and JaJuan Johnson were just playing physical down there
in the low post when we were playing our 1-3-1. The ref caught him talking to
me, and he got the technical foul.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Carmody?  
  
Q. Do you feel good about your NIT chances?  
COACH CARMODY: I'll say what Drew said, I thought he handled it pretty well.
You play and you see what happens. It's changed the last couple years the NCAA
has taken it over, but I would think we have a pretty good shot, yeah.  
  
Q. Kind of the same question as Juice, just this not being -- probably not
being the end of the season for you guys, a little bit different feeling for
you and just your thoughts on that.  
COACH CARMODY: I'll say what Juice said. You know, it's a long bus ride home,
and it's a tough -- it would have just been so nice to get this win tonight.
So that's hard. We weren't that far away from it. You know, so if you do get a
chance to play in the NIT, I think it's really good to get to play basketball,
and that's what these guys do. But it's hard to think about that right now.  
  
Q. Are you surprised Marcotullio took that off-balanced three, I guess it
was?  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, we had a play for him coming out of there, and I think
Mike was gone by then. We got a little screen from our center there, and
usually it's open to shoot, but he bounced it once. He's got to get better at
that, because yeah, last night he took a couple baseline drives and sort of
jumped into guys and hoping that the refs would bail him out, and that's not
the way it works.  
I thought we were going to get a good shot out of it. It looked like it was
going to cover. But they recovered in time.  
  
Q. Did you expect them to try and make it a very physical game coming in
when you were preparing? Did you expect that physical a game and that many
fouls?  
COACH CARMODY: Well, that's how they play. They pick you up all over the
place, and that's how they play. That's their style at Purdue. It probably has
been -- when Coach Keady was here, too, I coached against him for a few years,
and it's rough and tumble out there, and you have to be able to execute when
you get knocked around a little bit. But it was not unexpected.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  69  
Michigan - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening comment from Coach Beilein. Coach?  
COACH BEILEIN: Great basketball game with just a very unfortunate ending for
Michigan. Great shot by Evan Turner. That's all I'll say right now, and I'll
save anything else for later on.  
  
Q. For any of the three of you, can you describe what those last few seconds
were like starting with after Manny hit the shot? Did your emotions go from
one swing to another?  
MANNY HARRIS: It definitely hurt. We were excited, but at the same time we
knew anything could happen. They had two seconds, a lot of time to shoot and
score, and that's what Evan Turner did; he made the big shot. But it
definitely hurt.  
  
Q. From an intensity level, was this about the biggest game you guys have
played today? Right from the start it seemed like there was much more
intensity than the court.  
ZACK NOVAK: I don't know, we just really wanted to win this game, and I mean,
we obviously felt like we had a pretty good shot to do that. I mean, they got
ahead and we just kept fighting back and fighting back, and this is one we
really wanted, and it's disappointing.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the resolve you guys showed getting down by 13
points and coming back and every time they opened up a lead you were able to
match them?  
DESHAWN SIMS: We were just fighting. The game was intense from the beginning,
and we had the mindset that we did not want to stop playing today, and we
showed that for 40 minutes of the game. Unfortunately our tournament ended
short, but we definitely didn't want to stop playing today. All 16 guys on our
team.  
  
Q. Manny, would you say those shots that you hit near the end of regulation
-- near the end of the game were the biggest ones of your career?  
MANNY HARRIS: I can't really say that, but I mean, we just tried to, as a
team, do the best we can. Coach drew up good plays, and we were able to --
well, I was able to finish, and the other guys, too. It was so -- it was just
unlucky that we weren't able to come out with the win.  
  
Q. To any of the guys, when you're in the time-out huddle before Ohio
State's last shot, were you talking about making sure Turner did not touch the
ball, and if so, why is it he was able to get the ball as easily as he did?  
ZACK NOVAK: In the huddle, we actually -- we never talked about denying the
ball, especially back there. I mean, you've got two seconds. We just wanted to
stay with them, stay in front of him, make sure he had to take a contested
shot and make sure they didn't get any threes off. He hit a heck of a shot.  
  
Q. DeShawn and Manny, you guys have obviously played together for a long
time. Can you talk about playing your final game together and what it's been
like for the two of you?  
DESHAWN SIMS: We don't know if it's our final game yet, but it's definitely
been a great adventure. Me and Manny have known each other for a long time and
we complement each other's games. The Michigan program has helped us a lot,
and to become stars somewhat. But it's been great playing with Manny and
playing with all the guys that I've come across since I've been at Michigan.  
MANNY HARRIS: Same thing, it's been real fun playing with DeShawn. Like he
said, we knew each other for a long time and it's been a real good three years
playing with him. Unfortunately, it didn't end like we wanted it to end, but
it's been fun.  
  
Q. For Zack, you and Stu, a good start, a couple Indiana guys and Stu just
from right up north of Indianapolis. Your thoughts on the beginning of the
ballgame. I think you guys had the first seven out of the first 12 points. And
talk about the play of Stu in the second half.  
ZACK NOVAK: DeShawn came out really strong, I thought. Harris hit a lot of
really tough shots and got us going in the right direction. When we got down a
little bit, Stu and Manny just pretty much put us on their backs. Stu hit five
threes. I think most of them were in the second half, not all of them. That's
kind of what he does, he takes and hits big shots. I don't know, it's just
disappointing.  
  
Q. Coach, take the laymen through those last couple seconds. We've seen so
many passes being lobbed toward that high area at the other end. Your strategy
kind of went against that.  
COACH BEILEIN: As I answered the gentleman's question over here before, I
don't think Evan Turner is going to hit a half-court shot better than anybody
else is going to hit a half-court shot. We wanted to limit that type of
opportunity. So we matched it up in a zone that whatever area people want to
was going to be a one dribble. Either one or two guys was going to be in front
of him.  
Stu, I actually was worried about Stu fouling him, because Stu went right
through his hands, and he actually shot it through Stu's hands a little bit.
So whether we were man or whether we were zone, I don't think it made a
difference. If you try and put two guys on Evan or you try to deny him by
throwing over the top, then he even can get closer. So it's six of one, half
dozen of the other; a half-court shot is a half-court shot. If it was in
quarter-court, there's a whole different defense you're going to play. But
when you've got to make a half-court shot, it's a lot different.  
  
Q. You've talked about this season being difficult at times. If that is the
end of this season, is that as difficult an ending as you can ever remember?  
COACH BEILEIN: That's a great catch phrase, microcosm of the season. That's a
little bit of the frustration that we have this year. Some things that you
can't always control happen to you. It's certainly indicative of some things
that happened.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Manny's play, especially that last shot he made?  
COACH BEILEIN: I think over the last two days of the tournament, he's been
outstanding. He's really -- he's made shots. He's got to work like crazy on
his in between game, and he's really made some big shots today and let the
game -- he got good numbers. He let the game come to him a whole lot more than
forcing the game. So I'm really proud of the way he played, and defensively I
think it's two of his better defensive games, as well, which is really big for
a guy who has aspirations of playing at another level. You have to be able to
guard as a guard on the perimeter.  
  
Q. Was there a point when you saw this team come back as hard as they did,
and you saw DeShawn and Manny and Stu play as well as they did, was there a
part of you saying, where was this in the regular season when it really could
have helped you guys?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, I wouldn't want to point any fingers at anybody. But
collectively as a team, you see Stu hit the five threes, and yeah, there's a
lot of times that -- there's just -- we have one or two guys have a good game
and the third guy just didn't have an average game, had just a very poor game.
Having that third and fourth scorer is very, very important. We've never been
able to establish that now, either because of youth, or who knows. Who knows
why people can't make open shots sometimes, but we haven't been able to do
that.  
The good news, it was at least nice to see it in the tournament to know that
we do have some of those bullets in our gun.  
  
Q. Can you take us through the review process? Can they or did they review
when the clock started when Evan Turner touched the ball?  
COACH BEILEIN: I tried to be a part of that, and they wouldn't let me be a
part of that. I was in my coaching box. It's a whole 'nother issue for another
day. But I heard the buzzer go off when the ball was in the air, so I assumed
everything was good, and the game is actually -- after all these years it's
not the first time I've heard that buzzer and saw that ball go in, and son of
a gun, it looked in from the get-go, as well. So it's unfortunate, but I don't
think there was going to be any replay or anything that was going to make a
difference. I haven't looked at it, but I usually trust that those officials
are paid a lot of money and they're going to make the right call.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  76  
Penn State - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll ask Coach Smith to make an opening comment.  
COACH SMITH: Well, it's always good to get a win in a tournament, but
especially the first one is always a tough one. But I thought our guys were
focused and we came ready to play. We really didn't get -- we really didn't
play against a healthy Penn State team with Talor Battle laboring, so we were
very fortunate along those lines. But we were happy to get the win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the athletes?  
  
Q. Your team wore respect t-shirts during warm-ups. How much does that theme
come from what happened with Damian Johnson?  
COACH SMITH: We talked about it. We've been talking about that all year. We've
been talking about respecting the game, respecting yourself, respect for that
name on the front of the jersey. So that's what that's about.  
DEVOE JOSEPH: Just like coach said, it's just something we thought of the
whole year, something that's been said. We've got to respect our opponent,
everyone has to respect each other, and it's the word that means a lot. We
just put it on a t-shirt because it means a lot.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the start of this game and how -- I mean, a lot
of times games get away from you early in the first half. You know if you come
out with effort or not, and you can kind of tell you guys came out there with
a lot more energy than you had maybe in that Michigan game the last time you
were away from home.  
COLTON IVERSON: I think we just came really prepared for this game. The
starters got off to a real good start. They came with a lot of intensity, and
they started, I think it was 7-0. Devoe was hitting some good shots that got
us going some, and we just kept going from there.  
DEVOE JOSEPH: I agree with Colton. We came with energy. It's the Big Ten
Tournament, and we set a goal at the beginning of the year to win the Big Ten
Tournament, and we started by playing good basketball today.  
  
Q. Devoe, can you talk about what this win perhaps did for your NCAA
Tournament hopes and how much can you guys enhance that with a win tomorrow
against Michigan State?  
DEVOE JOSEPH: I honestly don't know what it did for our NCAA hopes. That's up
to the committee. But I just know that a win tomorrow is going to get us to
the next round. Right now we're just focused on winning the Big Ten
Tournament. If you win the Big Ten Tournament, you obviously go to the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. What was the conversation at halftime? Obviously you all have given up
big leads in the past. What did you do to make sure you preserved that lead
going into the second half.  
COLTON IVERSON: I think that we came in in the second half and we just came
with intensity. Again, the guys -- the first few minutes of the second half
are the most important. You can't let them gain any more on the lead. I think
we had a nine-point lead at halftime, and we held it and we got off to a good
start again, and we just kept going from there.  
DEVOE JOSEPH: Like you said, we know we've let up some leads in the second
half, so we said, just come out and keep going. It's zero-zero again, just
keep going hard and keep playing.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about Michigan State and what this game did for your
confidence? I know Penn State played them pretty well before. Do you think you
can pull off the upset?  
DEVOE JOSEPH: Well, this game definitely gave us confidence, and I think we
were playing good basketball lately. Last time we played Michigan State we
lost by one point, and we made a lot of mistakes in the last four minutes, so
I definitely think we can pull off the upset. They're a good team, and we're
definitely going to need to come and play real good basketball to beat them.  
  
Q. If both of you could just elaborate on how it's been two months but if
that taste is still fresh in your mouth from Kalin Lucas hitting that game
winning shot in Minneapolis against you guys.  
COLTON IVERSON: Yeah, it was obviously a disappointing loss at home. We felt
like we had the game, and we just kind of slipped at the end. It was just
something that we can't let happen again. We've got to come ready to play
tomorrow and just get it done.  
DEVOE JOSEPH: Kalin Lucas, he's a good player and made a tough shot. A lot of
the players made tough shots down the stretch, so we've just got to get closer
to our men down the stretch this time and stay with our defensive principles.  
  
Q. Colton, can you talk about the difference between this game and the last
two times you guys have played Penn State in those last two games were very
close? What was the difference today in your opinion?  
COLTON IVERSON: I think we just came with a lot more intensity for this game.
We know there's a lot on the line. We can't let anything slip away anymore.
This is our last chance to get to our goal, to get to the tournament, so we've
just got to come ready to play every game from here on out?  
  
Q. How much does it help for the sake of you guys' momentum? Obviously you
had a great shooting night tonight, and you're playing tomorrow night. How
much does that help in terms of sustaining momentum?  
DEVOE JOSEPH: Well, it helps. If you make shots the night before, you come to
the next game with a lot more confidence I feel, so I think it definitely
helps.  
  
Q. Did it fire you guys up at all that some people were picking the upset,
Penn State?  
COLTON IVERSON: Yeah, I saw that some people picked us to get upset in the
first round. You can't listen to that stuff. You've just got to come here to
play, give them respect, and you've got to -- you know they're a good team,
and they played a lot of teams close. Like you said, they just lost to
Michigan State at home, and they were in it the whole game, probably should
have had it. We knew they were a good team, just had to come prepared and not
let anything slip us up.  
  
Q. Can you talk about those early turnovers that you all forced and how that
kind of seemed to set the tone for the game?  
COACH SMITH: Well, yeah, again, I think these guys came with -- they were very
active, had a lot of quickness. Again, making shots makes you a little more --
keeps you ready. I thought one of the keys was putting Lawrence Westbrook on
Talor Battle, because I thought he did a good job of making Talor work at both
ends of the court. It sort of took something away a little bit from Lawrence's
offensive game, but I liked his attitude, and he kind of -- when you see your
leader stepping up and taking on that challenge, then I think it invigorates
and inspires the other players to play harder.  
  
Q. How much can you use motivation to your players knowing that you guys are
on the bubble? Of course if you win this tournament, you're in for sure, but
have you been able to use that at all, hey, if we win one, two, three, games,
we're probably going to get in?  
COACH SMITH: Well, not really. They see and read. They're intelligent kids. We
don't really talk about -- I try to concentrate on a single day. It might
sound corny, it might sound cliché, but that's the only way I think I can
coach. We know that the only thing that can -- there's only one certain, and
that's if you win, if you play the right way, and I think when you get into a
single-elimination type tournament like this, it's all or nothing, do or die,
you've got to come ready to play.  
We still, as I mentioned, have an opportunity to reach one of the goals we had
set for ourselves this year, and this group has been very good about staying
focused. We've lost some tough games, but I think it's solidified us and
united us in a way that's been very beneficial.  
  
Q. Obviously Michigan State is a very physical team and they're a great
rebounding team. The way that Colton played today and Ralph didn't score as
many points, but he was able to rebound pretty well, can you talk about just
what those two big guys are going to mean for you?  
COACH SMITH: Well, any time a coach coaches a team, they're always one of the
top rebounding teams in the nation. Certainly we'll have to do a better job
than we did today. We've got to really find a way for all of our players to
help out. It's not just up to Colton and Ralph and the post players. We need
to get our perimeter guys involved, and I thought today they did in the second
half. You know, guys that didn't have any rebounds in the first half got
rebounds in the second half, Lawrence Westbrook, Blake Hoffarber, and a couple
other guys. They've got to step up and do that tomorrow. But I like the way
Colton and Ralph have been rebounding the ball all year long. It may be a
situation where we might have them both in the game, if we're not able to play
with them on the boards.  
  
Q. Knowing Chris Allen won't play tomorrow for Michigan State, how does that
impact your game plan against the Spartans?  
COACH SMITH: Well, they've got a lot of good players, so nothing -- Chris is a
pretty talented player, and certainly I know any time you lose a player as a
starter that has the talent he has, it's going to affect you. But they have a
lot of depth, and that's why their team is always -- he plays a lot of
players, so I'm not sure -- I don't think it will affect how we will approach
the game and how we will prepare for the game.  
  
Q. Seems like Devoe Joseph is getting more and more comfortable with his
role. Talk about what he was able to do early for your team and what you need
him to do going forward in this tournament?  
COACH SMITH: Yeah, he's learning how to control the tempo and the pace of the
game and the flow, and you know, he has that ability to knock down the open
shot. That's something that we really -- that's taken time for him to
appreciate and grow into this -- into being the leader, the point guard on the
team, but he's done an excellent job. And going forward, it's something that
we've -- we're getting that from Justin, as well. So we'll see how he
continues to grow, and again, it adds -- I like the way he's been defending,
and he's got the total package.  
  
Q. You've coached in a lot of NCAA games. They're thinking about changing
the format a little bit and raising the 32 teams to 96. What's your thoughts
about them changing the way the thing is going to be run?  
COACH SMITH: I think it would be a great idea. I'd certainly love to see --
I've been on the NABC board, and it's one of the things we've promoted and
talked about for years with the NCAA. I think it's a -- especially with the
increase in the number of Division I teams now, why not?  
When I first got in the business years ago in 1978, '79, there might have been
100 Division I teams. Now there's 347. Just like football. When they
increased, they increased the number of bowl games, so why not increase the
opportunities for these student-athletes to participate and enjoy and be a
part of this March Madness? I think it's long overdue, to be honest with you.  
Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Northeastern  73  
Indiana - 58

  
COACH CREAN: I think the story of the game for us was really when we were up
six, had six turnovers within four minutes and went down four. The bottom line
of this game was the points at transfers, the transfers came at very tough
points for us. There were times I think our youth showed maybe in the sense we
were tentative in our first postseason type of action here with a lot of our
-- with probably half our team. But when we just were confident and attacked
and got the ball into the middle against their press, we did some really good
things. But we had a couple tough times with the ball, and they made us pay,
and we've just got to continue to build our will on both ends of the court,
build onto the rebounding mindset and culture that we've started to build
again this year, and take that into a lot of different areas as we continue to
bring the program back. I thought our guys moved pretty well defensively. They
made a couple tough shots. When half your shots are threes, some of them are
going to go in. But I think to hold them to 22 percent in the game, I think
was a tribute to the way these guys defended. They were very active. But
again, it was the points off turnovers, which got us and they did a great job
of capitalizing on that.  
  
Q. Just for whoever, or Verdell, what part do you think the zone and how
they extended that in the second half had to do with those turnovers that
coach talked about?  
VERDELL JONES III: I think when they extended the zone, we became very passive
and we weren't attacking it. We had a game plan, we just weren't following the
game plan, and that affected us.  
  
Q. For all three guys, what do you feel like you accomplished this season,
and in what ways do you think you're better maybe individually than you were
the first game?  
DEREK ELSTON: I feel like the team, you know, just came as a whole. You know,
in the beginning we kind of -- a lot of people wanted to do their own separate
thing, and coach kind of got us together and told us we've got to play as a
team, and that's exactly what we came to do.  
I mean, it wasn't always the best at times, but every time in the huddle
everybody was always together. So, you know, individually, I felt like I was
real passive in the beginning, and then towards the end, I kind of picked it
up a little bit. I just felt like the game was coming to me finally.  
VERDELL JONES III: I felt like we finally meshed. We had some returns from
last year, but we still pretty much had a brand new team with six freshmen
coming in. I thought at the beginning of the season we were -- we really
didn't get -- play well together yet, but I thought through the Big Ten and as
the season went on and the more battles we fought with each other, we became
closer on the court.  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: The main thing is I feel we got better overall individually
and as a team, like Derek said. We came together toward the end a little bit,
and we gave it a run.  
  
Q. Derek, can you just talk about what you just mentioned, how maybe at the
start of the season you were a little passive? What triggered that? We could
tell in the box score your minutes have gone up the last few weeks, your stats
have gone up.  
DEREK ELSTON: You know, in the beginning of the year, I kind of -- I actually
started, I wasn't playing too bad. Then towards the middle, you know, the Big
Ten came, and I don't know, just I kept beating myself up. It really wasn't
anything anybody was saying to me, it was just kind of all me mentally. But
you know, I think it was after the Ohio State loss, I kind of talked to my dad
and I got with Coach Buckley and a couple of the coaches, and they just sat me
down, and you know, they told me -- I told Coach Buck, my main thing I was
doing was I was trying to be like my dad, and he told me I had to go out there
and be my own player, and that's exactly -- when I hit the court a couple
practices in after that, I just felt into the game, I felt involved with the
guys early. In the Big Ten in early practices, I didn't even feel involved.
But I finally put my foot down and said I've got to start doing something, and
like you said, my minutes went up, and then I got some confidence back, and
then I started to roll with it.  
  
Q. Verdell, can you talk about what were the big differences between
Northwestern five days ago and Northwestern that you faced today?  
VERDELL JONES III: I thought our turnovers were the biggest thing. I'm looking
here, and they got 29 points off turnovers. If you want to win any game,
that's unacceptable. I mean, I thought our turnovers was the biggest key and
biggest difference.  
  
Q. Verdell, how does the end of the season compare to last year for you?  
VERDELL JONES III: I mean, we still lost in the first round, so it's still
very disappointing. I mean, we had three seniors go out in a way we didn't
want them to go out, and we've just got to build for next year.  
  
Q. What's the biggest thing that the three of you each feel that you need to
work on before next season?  
CHRISTIAN WATFORD: My main thing would be just get in the weight room, just
putting on weight for the physical aspect of the game and just keep working on
my skill package.  
VERDELL JONES III: Like Christian, weight. I'm still very thin, and I don't
want to get beat up as much. My outside shot, pretty much every aspect; you
can never stop working.  
DEREK ELSTON: For me, I feel like my defense just needs to come along, just
guarding someone one-on-one. That's the biggest part.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Crean, please.  
COACH CREAN: You started off talking about the zone. What did they do
differently in the second half that kind of made it a little bit better, or
what helped them more so, I guess?  
COACH CREAN: What helped Northwestern?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
COACH CREAN: I think when we go back and see the tape, they got some
unchallenged points. There were a couple of rotations. We'd come out of the
timeout and we played very tentative, our young guys played extremely
tentative. It's to be expected to a degree when you're in the postseason like
this, and you've got to go through it, and there's so many things. I'd like to
have a dollar for every time I've said this season we have to go through it.
But we do. We come out of a timeout, they run out of bounds, play one out,
we're not alert to the ball, they get a layup. I thought our guys did a pretty
good job. When you shoot that many threes, and we hold them to 22 percent from
the three-point line and we're predominantly zone to the very end of the game
-- they had some good movement. A couple times we got caught not coming all
the way over with the cutter from the weak side when they overloaded the zone.
But the adjustments we made this week, for the most part they were good.  
A couple times we got a little -- we just weren't as alert as we needed to be,
and that tentativeness played into it, and I think the bottom line, when
you're turning it over like we did, you just lose confidence so fast because
they're getting easy baskets.  
  
Q. No one expected Jordan to make eight threes again, but he only got three
shots. Was that them taking him away, or was that him not really looking for a
shot?  
COACH CREAN: You know what, I think -- constantly. I didn't tell him to shoot
on Saturday. I didn't have to. Too many times I reminded him that he could
make shots. He played like a freshman today, and he's done an outstanding job
for us in a lot of respects. We expect a lot out of him. I think there was
some tentativeness and apprehensiveness on his part. It was not a game where
we could run a lot of screens because of their switching. It's a spacing game,
and when we got the ball -- that being said, he did facilitate some, but we
needed to make some adjustments in a hurry. There's two things a guard can
never do, just like a quarterback in football can never do. You can't throw it
across your body, and you can't pre-determine your decision. And he was pre-
determining his decisions a little bit in the first half, and in the second
half if you noticed we took the ball screen out of it. The ball screen was
ended in the first half because we were so tentative around the half court
line.  
Now, we take the ball screen off and all of a sudden we're attacking that much
better, and it shouldn't be easier, but it was. I think they were keyed on
him, there's no question about that. But I also know that he passed up some
opportunities that none of us would have had a problem with him taking. Just
all part of a learning process for him.  
  
Q. You talk about your young team needs experience, things for the first
time and go through processes, how many of those things did they go through
this season with the overtime victories and tough losses? Do you feel like
they gained some of those experiences this season?  
COACH CREAN: I think every time they set foot on the floor. When so many
things are new for them, there is -- there's no question. A lot of guys have
made a ton of progress, and what they're talking about is exactly right. I
mean, they have to be able to mature their bodies and grow into certain
things. We have to be able to learn how to really defend at this level, and so
much of that is strength, it's hand placement, and we rarely ever get called
for having our -- hardly anybody gets called for having our forearm into
somebody, but we rarely ever get called for that because we're not strong
enough yet to hold people off. We're not strong enough to body up people on
cuts and drives, and we've really got to -- we've got to get to that. Our
bodies have got to really take a totally different look.  
And this is -- every program I've ever been in year one to year two is such a
big jump. I think it's that way maybe in any sport, but certainly in college
basketball it's a big difference, and that's -- our toughness training, our
ability to get stronger, our ability to really will is the biggest word in my
mind right now. We've got to develop more of a defense of an offensive will.  
We do trap drills every day. We spent ten minutes yesterday doing trap drills
around mid court because we felt like they would pressure us more because of
the way we didn't deal with the press very well at our place near the end of
the game. The first turnover from Tom Pritchard, I mean, he basically just
puts it in his stomach and hands him the ball. That's not how we want to play.
So we've got to continue to develop a toughness. We've made strides there, but
we're not even -- we don't have close to the physical and mental toughness yet
we've got to have to compete at the highest level in this league.  
  
Q. I know this has been a grind --  
COACH CREAN: Ya think?  
  
Q. Are you happy to have a chance to breathe here or would you much rather
get back to practice tomorrow?  
COACH CREAN: Absolutely. I love the game. I love coaching so much. I felt the
same way last year. It's a grind.  
But I told the team something, I'm not sure they believed me, but this is the
best conditioned team in March I've ever been a part of, going into the way
that we practiced and our energy level and everything. That includes the Final
Four team that we had. I mean, really, really in good shape.  
Now, are we as good, are we as tough, are we as strong? No. We all know that.
But I've enjoyed this team. I've enjoyed coaching them. There's been a lot of
trial and error in this. You guys see where we're at on gameday, and a lot of
times it's not very good. I can promise you with the trial and error and the
rebuilding situation that we've been in sometimes, I'm shocked we're as far
along as we are. I know our record doesn't indicate that, but this program has
endured a lot, a lot. And certainly we're not -- we're not through the tunnel
yet, but I love coaching, I love coaching them, and I love watching them get
better.  
And now we've got to put our energies into recruiting even more so and doing
the things that we have to do to move the program forward as they get a little
break before we start back up.  
  
Q. Derek talked about having peaks and valleys out there. What did you think
he did near the end of the year to gain more playing time?  
COACH CREAN: I think people forget he was starting for us during the Big Ten
season. It wasn't just because I said, hey, let's give Derek a shot. He was
earning it. We wanted to go bigger. Like I said, there's been -- the injuries
set everything back, as they do on any team when you don't have a lot of depth
to begin with. We took a couple of very good shooters out of the lineup from
November and December when you look at Matt and Maurice. We weren't going to
make up for that in one guy or two guys making a ton of shots. So we had to
play differently, and Derek has learned how to do that. I think it's
confidence for him, and it's alertness, it's awareness. It's not playing with
anxiety, it's playing with that alertness. And he made a lot of strides this
year, a ton of strides, and I think you've seen some of that. But he also made
some freshman mistakes, and he's no different than anybody else. But he's been
-- our young guys have made some very good strides, and we just had to --
sometimes they're not as noticeable, because sometimes when they're out there
as much as they are, they're not nearly as noticeable if they were out there
in bits and pieces because we'd have an older team where they could stand out
a little bit more. They're going to continue to get better, I have no doubt
about that.  
  
Q. Moving forward, how do you address the need for some big guys?  
COACH CREAN: Well, I think we have a lot of needs, and I think we've got to
develop the bigs that we have. We've got a very tough situation right now in
the sense, if you people have followed our program at all, which I know that
you have, we had to get a team on the floor before we could build a program.
Okay, that was last year. Then we were able to recruit guys that we wanted,
that we had a chance to develop relationships with. We're very bottom heavy.  
We have to have a balancing act right now between what do we need to do in the
short-term versus how are we not going to have to start over again when these
guys get older.  
In the purest sense of your question, there's no doubt we're trying to address
that in a big way. They've all got to get stronger, bigger, better, more
athletic that we have in the program, but we need to continue to address that.
But I look at our team, and we also need somebody that's better at getting in
the lane. We need somebody that can get in the lane and create havoc, that can
get into that paint and make decisions to get the ball to shooters.  
Our team will look different when you add the spacing element into it that
Matt Roth and Maurice Creek bring. Obviously Maurice was our best guy as
absolutely being able to get in the lane and make a play and make a good
decision with it. But we're not anywhere close to being done recruiting, and
that'll pick up again tomorrow in a big way. So we're going to address it. We
have been, and at the same time I have to sit here and look ahead into the
future and figure out, okay, how are we going to not have to do this again,
and that's what's hard, because there's a lot of good young players that we're
recruiting that we want, and we've got to make sure that we get those, and
we've got to make sure that we have the ability to sign them when they come.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2010

  

### [Jarryd Cole](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20622)

### [Todd Lickliter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16034)

### [Cully Payne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20621)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  59  
Iowa - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach?  
COACH LICKLITER: I'll just say that I've always been impressed with John's
teams. Michigan has been a tough opponent for us. Played them better at home
the time before this, and then this time I thought we competed hard. They got
away from us early, and we cut into it but just couldn't make it up.  
But this team has fought, and they've competed hard all year, and I've always
been proud of them for that. It doesn't mean it's always looked real good. The
last two games on the road people were very critical, but that's what happens
sometimes. This team is trying to become a good team, and I'm proud of them
for the effort today.  
Cully played beyond his years today, I thought, and that's a real good thing.
I think he enjoyed it. I told him coming in here, he's going to love Conseco,
and I think he must. Jarryd has been a very good leader for us. We're
obviously going to have to shoot better than 5-for-20 from the three to be
able to beat them. But it was -- it just wasn't to be today.  
But it's a really good group.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Cully, you seemed to be more inclined to really push the ball and be
offensive minded today. Was that by design or by nature, or just because you
like Conseco Fieldhouse?  
CULLY PAYNE: Coach kind of joked about it coming here, he's like, you're going
to play great at Conseco Fieldhouse. I'm like, what's so great about this
place. I love it, but it's great. That was kind of our game plan today, push
the ball a little bit more. We got a lot of transition stuff, which was good
for us, so that was kind of the game plan.  
  
Q. Jarryd or Cully, can you talk about switching to a zone defense? What was
that like for you?  
JARRYD COLE: You know, in practice this week we were trying to -- trying to
mix things up a little bit. You know, in Big Ten play, everybody knows what
you're going to do basically. You scout all year for each other, and most
likely are going to play each other twice. You get into a tournament it's nice
to mix things up, give people a different look, and we did, and it ended up
being successful for us, but not successful enough.  
CULLY PAYNE: Like coach kind of said in practice, the zone will throw them off
a little bit and take a little time off of the shot clock in the backcourt,
and I think the zone was good for us today.  
  
Q. Either player, I've heard speculation about your coach's future. Have you
guys heard anything of that, and has it affected the team at all?  
JARRYD COLE: Personally, no, I've never heard anything. I don't know if you're
talking about us as players leaving or him going anywhere. I've never heard
anything. Whatever you hear, I don't know, it's news to me, I guess, too.  
CULLY PAYNE: I think like Jarryd said, we haven't heard a lot about it, but I
know that I came here to play for coach, and our staff, and we've got four
great guys coming in. With the freshman class I know me, Eric and Brennan,
that's coach's first class he recruited. We've got a great, true foundation
and we're excited for coach, so we're kind of by his side the whole way. I can
speak for us freshman class and the whole team that coach is our guy.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Lickliter?  
  
Q. Coach, three seasons ago, take me through this: If I had sat there and
told you that by this point almost the entire team would have transferred out,
most of them would have been guys that could start and Iowa basketball would
be in the state it's in now, would you have said I'm crazy or would you have
said that's part of the plan to begin with in the sense that you have freshmen
coming in that are your guys?  
COACH LICKLITER: I'm not sure I follow the question.  
  
Q. The question is, this is the worst Iowa basketball I've seen in probably
35 years as far as the amount of wins. What I'm asking you is because of the
style of play that you had at Butler, you knew you'd have to come in and shape
this over the course of time. Has that went like you thought it would or is
this beyond what you thought it would be as far as a bad season?  
COACH LICKLITER: Well, I didn't anticipate -- you don't look and project wins
and losses, you prepare daily and try to put the best players out. I think the
hardest thing coming in here has been that the recruits that we've been --
that we have targeted, that we feel like are going to be able to compete have
got to go through some tough times. We're not recruiting All-Big Ten players
to Iowa their freshman year. If we do, great, if we can find them.  
But realistically what we've had to do is recruit players that will develop
into that, and that has been hard for players to go through the frustration,
the grind, the hard work. So we've had to continue to fight through some of
that.  
Of the players that have left, I had recruited one of them to-date if I'm not
mistaken. It's not -- if you look back, players have left the University of
Iowa before I came. If you look at Butler, I had very few players leave. I had
a few. I didn't have a plan for -- as a matter of fact, I take it very
seriously your commitment to student-athletes. I want them to progress and
graduate, and that's been my commitment to them.  
I think that because student-athletes can leave, there's probably some of you
sitting out here right now that if you could leave your job and go to another
job that was very similar without any repercussions, you might do it. And
there might be some days you'd do it more readily than others. But that's the
state we're in right now, and so we've had to do a little fighting through
that.  
We do have a foundation. I don't know what's going to happen. People have to
make those decisions. But we've invested; players have gotten better, and this
team is better than the first two teams that won more games.  
  
Q. There has been a lot of speculation today about your future, and it's
unavoidable. Are you confident you're going to be the coach of this team next
year?  
COACH LICKLITER: You know, my future is that I'm healthy, I have a great
family. I love what I do. I've done it well, and that's not in my hands.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, have you met with Gary Barta to discuss whether
or not you're going to be the coach?  
COACH LICKLITER: No, I haven't, no. I'm trying to prepare for the Big Ten
tournament and give my undivided attention to this team.  
  
Q. Either specifically with you or for any coach, is three years a
reasonable amount of time to judge the progress or not?  
COACH LICKLITER: I think it depends on what you go into and the amount of
support that you have and that sort of thing. You can judge some coaches as
far as wins and losses immediately depending on the situation that they go
into.  
  
Q. You mentioned how much this team has improved throughout the course of
the season. What can you say about all the freshmen that contributed and
played today, where they were at the beginning of the season, where they are
now, guys like Cully, who had a huge game.  
COACH LICKLITER: Yeah, he shows a lot of toughness, and that's handled the
grind pretty well. Now they have a whole year of Big Ten experience. It's a
Big Ten that I've talked to a lot of time, media personality a couple days ago
and said he cannot remember -- now, he's been at it a while. He can't remember
the Big Ten being this good, and we played 18 games this year. They've had a
little bit more of a grind than past teams possibly. I think they've held up
pretty well. They're pretty beat up emotionally, they're pretty beat up
physically. You saw today they don't have any quit of them. They're going to
be successful these guys. I think anyway, I think they've got the right
approach.  
  
Q. How long is this going to go on? I assume you'd like to know whether
you're going to be the coach or not. It's kind of a tough situation.  
COACH LICKLITER: Do you think that would have to do with me? I mean, it's not
-- you're asking me to answer on speculation. I don't have any. I haven't been
told I'm not, so until I'm told I'm not, I've got to -- I am.  
  
Q. A month ago, Gary said without hesitation that you will be back. Is he
not saying that now to you?  
COACH LICKLITER: He doesn't say -- we don't talk about that. We just talk
about what -- the task at hand, and I really don't -- we haven't met on
anything of that.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Northwestern  73  
Indiana - 58

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening comment from coach. Coach, your
thoughts, please?  
COACH CARMODY: Well, you know, it's a little different when you play a team
four or five days before this. There are really no secrets. We didn't really
change too much. I don't think they did. It was a really good game, hard game.
We couldn't make a shot. We had a shoot-around today, and I'll bet you we made
about five percent of our shots. I thought we got all our misses out of our
system, but we didn't. So we -- I don't know, I'm looking here, it says
7-for-31, but I think we made our last at least two or three.  
So yeah, we hung in there, hung in there, and our defense tightened up in the
second half, it seemed to me. We got our hands on some balls, and it seemed
like the only thing they got were foul shots. We were a little -- I don't know
if I should say undisciplined, but they got to the foul line and were making
some stuff there.  
But I told our team just now that -- Capocci and Curletti, you know, they came
in, and usually they've been sort of stop-gap guys this year, and I couldn't
take them out. And Marcotullio, also. I thought those guys did well. I was
going to put Nash right back in, but that combination was playing real well,
both ends, and then Thompson got hot and made some shots there and everyone
knew it, and his teammates got on the ball, and he knocked them down.  
It's a good win for us, and it's nice to be playing on Friday.  
  
Q. For either Michael or John, you guys are one of the couple teams that
beat Purdue during the regular season. What do you have to feel you have to do
to beat them?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: We know that Purdue is a good team. We were successful in
beating them this year. I think in order to be successful against them
tomorrow, we have to come out ready to play and handle their defense and have
defensive pressure.  
JOHN SHURNA: I think Purdue is a strong team, and I think in order to be
successful, we'll have to come out strong defensively right off the bat.  
  
Q. You were 1-17 as a freshman in conference, 20 wins adds on the school
record for wins. Tell us how it feels, the journey you've made in three years
here?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: It feels great to have won 20 games in a season, especially
going 1-17 in conference my first year. We have a great team and we've been
working hard and playing well today. But we're excited for what we've done so
far, but we're still working hard and trying to add more wins to it.  
  
Q. Juice, I've never seen you that emotional. Talk about when you were
making those threes at the end. You had your hand raised on the follow-through
and you celebrated with Nash a little bit. Just what you were feeling there.  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: It was exciting. I made a couple shots, and I was just
energetic and into the game. You know, it was just pretty emotional after I
got that technical foul. I just wanted to go out there and play harder and
compete more.  
JOHN SHURNA: Yeah, I think Juice is a great player. He's our best player, and
he's what makes our offense flow. And I think when he gets in rhythm like
that, it really opens things up for us, when we keep finding the hot hand.  
  
Q. You alluded to the employ of Capocci, Curletti and Marcotullio. Could you
expand upon it?  
JOHN SHURNA: Yeah, I think all three of them stepped up big for us. Alex hit a
couple big threes for us, and then Mike and Davide were getting big rebounds
for us, and Davide also hit some threes down the stretch which was huge.  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: Our contribution off the bench tonight was tremendous, and
it was huge for us. Everyone who came off the bench, they played well, and it
was just a great team effort tonight, and I'm glad that we came out with a
victory.  
  
Q. Michael, one of the interesting things about tournament basketball is you
don't get a whole lot of time to bask in a victory. You couldn't play a much
different type of team tomorrow night because of the man to man versus the
zone. As a lead guard, could you talk a little bit about how difficult that
transition is to go from playing a team that plays 99 percent zone to playing
the way Purdue plays, man to man?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: It's a difficult transition going from a team that plays
zone to man to man. But we're looking at it as like it's like a AAU tournament
where you play several games in a little bit of -- couple of different days.
Different teams play different types of defenses. All year we've been
preparing for different types of zones and man to man defenses, so I think the
team will be ready for that, and we just have to adjust on the fly.  
  
Q. You guys caused, I think, 12 turnovers in the second half. That obviously
turned it. What clicked for you guys on defense?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: Our defensive intensity. We just picked it up, and we had a
lot more pressure. John and Jeremy, they did a tremendous job of getting their
hands on a lot of balls and disrupting a lot of passes. That just led to a lot
of easy buckets for us, and that gave us the momentum in the second half.  
JOHN SHURNA: I think we were just able to stop their offensive flow. I think
we kind of got them in a bit of a funk there, and I think that was big for our
offense, too.  
  
Q. Juice, when is the last time you had a stretch like that where you made
that many threes in a short period of time?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: I think last Saturday against Indiana I made a couple threes
in a row, so about five days ago. I don't know if it was that many like today,
but I think that's the last time I made that many threes in a row.  
  
Q. Just going back to the zone, what did you guys think about the job that
Nash did in the middle and just disrupting the passes of people and making
them throw lobs?  
JOHN SHURNA: Yeah, Jeremy was great on defense. I think when we're forcing
guys to be out of their comfort zone, it's huge for our defense, and I think
them -- forcing them to throw it over his head was big.  
  
Q. Juice, did you make any significant defensive changes after halftime in
what you did or just did it better?  
MICHAEL THOMPSON: I think we just did better. Coach Carmody got on us at
halftime about applying pressure and getting our hands on passes, and I think
we just stepped up and did a better job on the defensive end.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go to questions now for Coach Carmody.  
  
Q. At the end of the day, 20 wins is just a number, but is there a
psychological feeling of achievement to have reached that total for the first
time?  
COACH CARMODY: You know, well, it's especially important to our guys because
we haven't -- I mean, in the short-term, we haven't been playing very well,
and we got to a pretty good start before the conference, and then we had some
nice wins, and then we were worn down a little bit.  
So this was a real important game for us because even in the first half we
didn't -- we started out, it's like eight-zip or something, our defense looked
-- they were doing what they wanted to do, and they were prepared.  
I don't know, the 20 wins always sounds nice and it is real important, and I
told our guys, look, most of -- we have one senior, Jeremy Nash, and so a lot
of these guys, 17 wins -- Jeremy has 17 wins and 20 wins. He knows the
history, but he's thinking it's a new era and Crawford and Mirkovic and
Curletti, 37 wins in two years, and that's good. That's good, considering that
we haven't had great success historically. And we're just going to continue to
build on that.  
  
Q. You talked about how tough these rims are and you guys started out
something like 2-of-24 from three. Were you thinking this is just not our
day?  
COACH CARMODY: I was just thinking about Reggie Miller, I was thinking, how
does he make all those shots? It's unbelievable.  
No, in all the years we've played here, that's why I always voted for Chicago,
keeping the Big Ten Tournament there, because I just hate the rims. Nothing
about the city, it's closer, collegiate, all that stuff, I just hate the rims.
But we were able to get some stuff inside, and then finally Alex hit a few and
Mike hit some, and that was it.  
  
Q. If you would answer the same question I asked Juice: When you play a zone
team like Indiana tonight and then you're going to come back and see that just
grueling man to man tomorrow night, as a coach that's part of the fun of the
challenge, but is that a difficult 24-hour transition?  
COACH CARMODY: Well, I don't know about fun and challenges, but, you know,
we've played a lot of man to man. Not too many teams have played a zone this
year, to tell you the truth, maybe three, four, five, for extended periods,
because we've usually done fairly well against them, so we're used to playing
against man to man.  
Purdue is a very good team, and instead of getting picked up at 21 feet, they
pick you up at 90 feet, so how do we handle that. I've always thought that our
offense, if the pressure isn't oppressive where you can't even breathe, then
we do decently against teams like that.  
It's certainly different and a challenge, not fun, but we're playing tomorrow,
so that's great.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the overall contribution of you guys on both
rebounding and offensively from the bench? You haven't gotten that much
probably that I can remember. But without one guy, there was like three or
four you got a lot of contribution, a lot of minutes from guys who don't
usually -- haven't been doing as much lately?  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, they were just instrumental in the win, no doubt about
that. Capocci and Marcotullio and Davide, and John was right; he made those
foul shots, and he had to get lucky because the first one he made hit and it
was like one of those Don Nelson jobs, went way up and then fell through. But
then he made all the rest of them.  
So that was really important, too, and we've been struggling all year. People
have said, well, you guys are playing too many minutes, your guys are wearing
down and all that. I sort of pooh-poohed that, if you will, but they might be
right. So it was great to get these guys to contribute.  
  
Q. Did losing to them last weekend have any kind of advantage for you as a
coaching staff in preparation for today's game?  
COACH CARMODY: I don't think so. You know, just that -- find out where that
guy Hulls is, right, because he just destroyed us. And they found him, just
like Thompson. Mike made three or four threes, but Jordan Hulls made every
shot he took just about the same last week, and he made a win, and then the
other guys picked up because of his play. I thought our guys today picked up
because of the bench and our defense the last ten minutes seemed to me to be
very good. But I don't know if it helped that we lost, except some guys were a
little ticked off.  
  
Q. When it got delivered that one-two punch at the very beginning of the
season with Coble and Ryan, could you really sit back and envision this much
success for the team this year?  
COACH CARMODY: Probably not, but we didn't have time as a staff or as a team
to do any envisioning because Coble was three days before the first game and
Ryan was the first half of the first game, so there was no, oh, what are we
going to do, who's the sixth man, now he's starting.  
But they've really come through, and I think it's just a tribute to some of
these guys that stepped up and played so well. And people talk about John
Shurna, he's really improved. But Thompson, Thompson has really had a great
year for us, a super year for us, and doing some real good things. And Nash,
it goes all the way down. They just thought that they were a good team, and
they're doing okay.  
  
Q. What was so much better about the zone in the second half?  
COACH CARMODY: Yeah, you know, like Mike said, fellows, these guys are making
passes uncontested. You have to bother guys. That's the purpose of this.
You're in passing lanes, one-three-ones extended out, and if you're just going
to be statues it's not going to be effective. No defense is. You're playing
man to man you've got to move your feet. The same thing here; see if you can
anticipate a little bit what's the next thing they're going to do, just normal
stuff, just do it better.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2010

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

### [Zack Novak](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19492)

### [Deshawn Sims](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18137)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  59  
Iowa - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started. We'll ask Coach Beilein to make on opening
statement, then go to questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH BEILEIN: I'm sorry Manny Harris is not here. The instructions from Zack
and DeShawn, we'll be getting a cold tub right after the game. The strength
coach took me literally and -- he's in there right now, so I'm sorry about
that. But I think these two guys will be fine.  
We got off to a great start, which I thought was really important always in
these tournaments, to get off to a good start with our defense. Made some
shots early. Things got a little bit cold. Todd went to a zone defense, which
I don't know, the Iowa people may know, you very rarely see, shook us up a
little bit, and they made a great comeback, and then we made a couple great
shots to get back out in front to hang on.  
  
Q. The two of you guys started off cold in the second half, you hit that one
big three. Do you think that kind of ignited you guys in the second half?  
ZACK NOVAK: I mean, we got a nice little run after that, and Laval also came
and hit a really big three. But I think we just kind of -- like you said, we
got cold for a little bit, but seemed like once that went down, we got back on
the right track and were able to finish it out.  
DESHAWN SIMS: That shot probably started some momentum for us to kind of get
back, take the lead again and got the game within four. You know, that kind of
separated us a little bit.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the team effort it took to slow Fuller out
there.  
ZACK NOVAK: Like you said, total team effort. I mean, he really hurt us when
we played there. I don't know what exactly he did today, but I mean, it wasn't
anything near that. I don't know, we had good defensive rotation on him, and
it seemed like almost every time somebody was making a hit on him, and then
our guards really did a good job coming in to help rebound, too, I thought.  
It was a total team effort, and I think we got it done.  
  
Q. You guys have seen Ohio State twice over the season. Can you just talk
about what you sense about tomorrow's game going into it?  
DESHAWN SIMS: It's a talented team. You know, we've just got to come out and
not be scared, just go and attack them. We played them twice, we beat them
once, and we just have to go and -- it's all or nothing, and try to win it.  
ZACK NOVAK: I mean, we beat them for a full game, and I think we beat them for
a half then the next game. We're confident going in. They're a really good
team. They've got a lot of talented guys. But we're going to be ready to play,
and just go out there and have fun, see what happens.  
  
Q. How important was it for you guys to jump off to such a quick start and
start so strong after the Michigan State game, just like rebounding from
that?  
ZACK NOVAK: I think it was -- it was just good for our psyche. We came out.
Shots were falling, people were making good plays, and kind of built us a
little bit of a cushion there. Any time you can do that in a tournament, in
any game, that really helps. They're a good team. They fought back, and they
definitely didn't give up.  
But I thought we did a good job coming out.  
DESHAWN SIMS: We always have good games with Iowa. They battle us and we
battle them. We didn't know their mindset. They didn't have the season they
expected just as well as we did. So we knew both teams was coming to fight,
and we had to come out and try to sustain some energy.  
  
Q. Manny obviously had a tough game against Michigan State the last time
out. What did he do differently today, and maybe how did you see him prepare
differently than that game?  
DESHAWN SIMS: He played confident. He let the game come to him. He hit his
first shot, and that usually does it for him, for a player of his caliber,
just being able to hit your first shot. You see the ball going in, and it just
gives your overall game confidence.  
ZACK NOVAK: Yeah, I mean, he was good today. Like DeShawn said, he came out. I
remember he hit a three in transition, just pulled up a real nice shot, and I
mean, when he's on, he's really tough for anybody to stop. When he just lets
the game come to him, we're a really good team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Beilein?  
  
Q. On paper with the talent you have, if I said eighth seed coming into this
tournament at the beginning of the season, is that where you envisioned you
would be right now?  
COACH BEILEIN: Well, we were seventh last year. There wasn't a lot of
attrition within the league last year, from last year to this year. I don't
think too much about those things. I wanted us to get better. I had hoped we'd
get better. We won nine games in the league last year, we won seven this year.
Obviously we weren't as good. But it was smaller than people think, probably,
about the difference, but it's a difference.  
  
Q. Did you limit DeShawn's minutes intentionally because of the nature of
the tournament? It seemed like he played fewer minutes today than --  
COACH BEILEIN: What was his final minutes?  
  
Q. About 30.  
COACH BEILEIN: I mean, that's pretty -- we wanted -- playing Iowa, we do not
like to play big. They really play really big because they set so many ball
screens, it takes some stuff away. I wanted to make sure Zack Gibson gave us
some minutes there. And so 30 -- it turned out 30 and 10 or something. I did
play them together for a second.  
  
Q. If you could talk about your two games with Ohio State and the
differences between how they both play now.  
COACH BEILEIN: I think that Ohio State was in a bit of a transition. They
started out in the league with four out of five on the road without having
Turner and had gotten beat I think maybe up in Wisconsin and then came to us.
They looked like they were feeling like who they were without such a fabulous
player.  
The second time we played them, I thought they really had -- they'd all gotten
better without him, and then adding him, it's just an X factor to really make
them -- like one of the league co-champions or tri-champions and a great
chance to win the National Championship.  
  
Q. In that vein, just talk about the opportunity that your team has
tomorrow. You could have a special win with a win over them tomorrow, just the
opportunity you guys have in that game.  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, I mean, once you get to the quarterfinals, then -- now,
this is like the old eight-team leagues now. You're down to eight teams and
you're three wins away from really a magical experience for these guys to go
through, given the type of season that we've had.  
But it's got to go through Ohio State, so it's -- you have to get that win to
continue to advance, but it would be great to beat them. They're very, very
talented. We're going to have to play our best game. We're not going to be
able to shoot 6-for-25 and can't give up a bunch of offensive rebounds and
turn the ball over late like with he did today. We'll just do our best. That's
all we're going to do.  
  
Q. They're talking about expanding the tournament to 96. What's your
thoughts about that?  
COACH BEILEIN: The NCAA Tournament?  
  
Q. Yes.  
COACH BEILEIN: I've never been in favor of that. Being a guy who was in the
low majors to mid-majors and the high majors, I just think it's really a great
tournament right now. Now, they may know more than I know, but I just -- when
we were at Canisius, we only won the tournament one time, and we won the
championship game three times. But it was huge to just get in there for no
other reason than you won that tournament.  
Same thing at Richmond. Were in it a lot, but only once we won it. It was just
great to get there. I think it's really nice and tight right now and we
probably should keep it that way. But I'll do whatever people say. And if
we're the 96th team in sometime, I'll be happy about it.  
  
Q. They didn't start off really on fire. Can you talk about their form
especially early?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, they came out and played us man, and we really executed
them to be able to get them the ball.  
When they go zone, that presents the different issues getting the ball to the
right people at the right time, and the timing. I'm glad -- we may see zone
from Ohio State, as well, I'm glad we could work on that a little bit today.
But the zone really changed that plan from Manny to DeShawn. We dialed them up
a lot at the beginning of the game.  
  
Q. After Michigan State you talked about eliminating turnovers, Manny,
having a season low at that point. How pleased were you at those areas?  
COACH BEILEIN: I liked everything until those last three. I mean, we finished
with eight, but we had five going into those last four minutes. Those three
gave them a chance to come up in the game.  
But it's important, now Iowa is a little bit less aggressive than Michigan
State at turnovers, but that was a huge part of our game with Michigan State.
I mean, they deserved to win. They were certainly better than us. Their record
shows it. But those turnovers just changed that game from a 10-point game to a
30-point game in no time.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Harris and Sims and just kind of the way they're
working together inside-outside? There's one time in the second half they had
a give and go, and the team work and how they're clicking?  
COACH BEILEIN: Yeah, they room together. They see each other a lot and they
look for each other in our offense quite often, sometimes too often. You can
see like DeShawn threw one up right after that thinking he could get him, as
well. That's where we're got to separate from being great friends and finding
the next option. But they've really done a good job with that and they've
clicked together and it's no secret we try to go to the two of them a lot.
DeShawn is one of the leaders in the Big Ten in shots taken and Manny is
pretty close.  
  
Q. You guys had I think it was 16- and 14-point leads where Iowa came back.
Are you concerned that maybe you guys were a little complacent at times out
there?  
COACH BEILEIN: No, you know, to win we had to make a foul shot. We had the
three turnovers. I don't think any of them were careless turnovers, and I
don't think we stopped playing defense. If there was a time tough in that
game, four or five minutes to go, and they got to the one and one, we were
careless with our unnecessary fouls, and then they were just -- you saw they
were just going to drive it in the last four minutes and try to slow -- to
change the game and lengthen the game. So we've got to take care of the ball
better, and if we hadn't had those fouls early we could have kept them off the
foul line or guarded them differently.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2010

  

### [Talor Battle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18139)

### [Ed DeChellis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17001)

### [David Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20644)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Minnesota  76  
Penn State - 55

  
COACH DECHELLIS: I thought Minnesota played very, very well tonight. They shot
the ball well. They executed, and we really didn't have any answers for them.
And I thought we didn't -- we obviously didn't play our best game. But I give
them a lot of credit. I thought they played extremely well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Talor and David, please.  
  
Q. Talor, how were you feeling, and with the shooting, was it just one of
those nights, or did the health have something to do with the shooting on your
part?  
TALOR BATTLE: I'm not an excuse-maker. I just had an off-night. You know, one
thing I'll say is going to the basket, really finishing, I really didn't have
a lot of confidence in my ankle. Or lift for that matter. There's some shots
when I attacked the rim, and like I said, I didn't have that lift and that
strength that I normally play. But there's no excuse. Like I said, I really
didn't play well tonight. No excuse on my foot.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about how much the early turnovers hurt you guys trying
to get started.  
DAVID JACKSON: The early turnovers were, you know, hurting us because they
were getting easy transition buckets. It really set the tone for the rest of
the game, and we kind of dug ourselves into a hole that we never could really
get out of. But I think if we would have eliminated some of those turnovers it
would have helped us out and maybe cut their first half lead and maybe it's a
different ballgame for us.  
TALOR BATTLE: I think the reason we had those turnovers, we came out with no
toughness. There was a couple plays I think in the first half, they made --
they took about four or five balls right out of our hands, and that's just
unacceptable, and that really slowed us from getting any kind of rhythm
offensively. It hindered us in that regard for the rest of the game.  
  
Q. Talor, what are your impressions of Minnesota? I know you guys had a
couple close games with them earlier in the year. They're sort of on the
bubble for the NCAA Tournament. Do they seem like an NCAA team to you?  
TALOR BATTLE: I'm not one of those guys that chooses, so I guess it doesn't
really matter what I say. They're in our league, and hopefully they get in and
make a run. Obviously the way they played tonight, they've been hot. They lost
a couple close games here at the end of the season, so they'll hopefully make
a run, and like I said, they're a Big Ten team, so I hope they get in.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach?  
  
Q. Points in the paint the first half, seemed to really be killer. Did you
expect that?  
COACH DECHELLIS: We didn't keep the ball out of the post, and believe it or
not, we worked on that for three straight days, post defense. We just didn't
do a very good job or they did a really nice job of getting it in there, one
of the two. I think it was a combination of both. That hurt us early and they
went to those guys. Iverson didn't miss a shot. He was 5-for-5 off the bench,
and that was something I was really concerned about, their bench play. Their
bench has been very good all year, and they did a nice job again tonight. He
came off the bench and scored.  
  
Q. Talor's ankle obviously rolled in practice. Did you expect him to be as
limited as he was tonight?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Well, he took a good roll yesterday. You know, we were really
concerned about it and put him in a boot cast yesterday afternoon and last
night. You know, doctor did what he could for him. He didn't have that lift
that he spoke about, but he's not a young guy that's going to make excuses,
but it did affect his play tonight.  
  
Q. Defensively, talk about their defense he have effort.  
COACH DECHELLIS: Well, they really got into him, and he didn't have the
quickness, again, to go back and create like he has in the past, and that's
part of it. But defensively we didn't stop them. They just made every big
shot. Offensively we weren't great. Believe me, we shot the ball very poorly.
But defensively is where we tried to concentrate on a few days here, we've got
to defend them and rebound them, and we just didn't do that. I thought that
was really poor.  
  
Q. Did you feel like there were open looks in the first half?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Well, we couldn't make a shot. We couldn't make a jump shot
early and it just went downhill from there. But you're not always going to
score. I watched the first two games, and people weren't making jump shots,
and I talked to the team about that, trying to get it inside. But it's about
you have to defend. You can't just come down and let people score, and we
turned it over and gave them 15 points the first half in transition off our
turnovers. That's just really, really hard at this point in time in the year
to be able to come back from things like that.  
  
Q. It seemed like -- is dejected a fair word?  
COACH DECHELLIS: Yeah, I think we played as poorly as we've played all year.
We've never played this poorly, and that's the worst beating we've had all
year. We've been in every game, and that's why we feel bad and the players
feel bad. We thought we had two pretty close games at Minnesota and we had
decent practices, and we thought we'd come in here and give it a run at it,
but it just didn't happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## November 26, 2010

  

### [Jamie Skeen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21505)

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  89  
UCLA  85

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will make an opening statement, and then he'll take
questions.  
SHAKA SMART : I'm proud of our guys. I thought UCLA did a great job of making
shots and rebounding and usually if we give up that many points it's going to
be a lightning night for us. We hung in there. We made just enough free-throws
to win the game. Those are good free-throw shooters in there at the end. But
really proud of the way our guys battled. I thought being able to throw the
ball to Jamie Skeen on the block and get positive production from there was a
big key for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, there seemed to be a real emphasis on getting the ball down inside
in the game. Can you talk about the game plan heading in?  
SHAKA SMART: Skeen told the team a few days ago, actually before the Tennessee
game, that he wanted the ball more. So we said okay. We'll give you the ball
more. To whom much is given, much is expected. And he produced tonight.  
  
Q. Seemed like every time they drew a little bit closer, you always had a
response. Whether it was a big three or even late in the game a couple of
turnovers to turn them into baskets.  
SHAKA SMART: When we press it's a values risk-reward situation. I thought
staying in the press late in the game, it helped us turn them over a couple of
times and slow them down. So I'm glad we stayed with it.  
  
Q. Coach, when you recruited Jamie, did you envision this type of role for
him; end of game against a high-level opponent?  
SHAKA SMART: He's one of the guys I didn't recruit. I'm in my second year. He
was sitting out as a transfer the year before I got there. A guy we knew as a
high-level player, could be very successful against teams at any level of
college basketball. And he showed it -- he's shown it these last couple of
games.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys got some key shots and some key free-throws heading down
the stretch. What does it say about your team moving forward?  
SHAKA SMART: Like I said, we hit just enough free-throws. I would have liked
to have made more. Joey missed a couple. Brad missed one. Jamie missed one
late. Darius Theus' two free-throws at the end were huge. I believe it was
either a one-point game or a two-point game when he went to the line. So I'm
proud of our guys. They stepped up. Showed a lot of fight. Put David Hinton,
our walk-on, in the game with about a minute left and he was out there playing
against -- one of the top power forwards in the country in Reeves Nelson.  
Really, everyone that came in the game gave us positive production.  
  
Q. Coach, how valuable can this tournament be for the experience you got
heading into the rest of the season?  
SHAKA SMART: You are talking about three of the top ten programs in the
country with Tennessee, Villanova and UCLA. So getting a chance to be here and
be around those coaches and those players and see what those teams do and
being highly competitive in the first game, coming up a little bit short,
learning some things about our team and being able to win the second game
against UCLA, I think that's really going to pay dividends for us down the
road both in terms of the experience for our guys but also with our resume.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Seemed like you guys refused to lose towards the end. Can you talk a bit
how you were able to hold off the huge swing and momentum?  
JAMIE SKEEN: We knew it was coming. I mean, we all just -- our coach he
prepared us for it at halftime. He told us it was going to be a huge run
coming. We were prepared and we went for it. We were prepared for it.  
  
Q. How important was it for you to get at least one win playing at Madison
Square Garden?  
JAMIE SKEEN: It was very important, because for one, we had a seven, eight-
hour drive up here. We didn't want to go back down the road on two losses. We
wanted to win the first one too. But we came short. So this was our last game.
We were definitely concentrating on winning this last one.  
  
Q. Jamie, you scored double digits within the first five minutes. How were
you able to search yourself so early?  
JAMIE SKEEN: I was in the right place at the right time. I was very aggressive
on the back boards. Whenever I seen one of my teammates missing a shot, I was
just on it. I was trying to get it.  
  
Q. Were you vocal with the coach and the team prior to the Tennessee game?
Your coach mentioned you were hungry and wanted more opportunities. Can you
take us through how you approached the team asking to see the rock a little
more frequently?  
JAMIE SKEEN: We were at dinner. I just made a joke about it at first. I said I
would love to get the ball more. My coach took it seriously. He said, okay,
we're going to get you the ball for real. I said, all right, that will be
nice. They actually -- he ran down the stretch, he ran a play for me, I would
say probably 10, 12 times in a row. The same play over and over and over
again. I wasn't complaining. So I'm glad they gave me the ball. Because my
whole life I've been playing inside-out basketball. You play inside-out and
then the threes start coming. Because they start clamping down and they
started double-teaming. So it opened it up for everything else.  
  
Q. You're saying the funnier you get the better team will be?  
JAMIE SKEEN: I'm not saying that. I'm saying I feel like the inside-out works
better than starting out firing up threes.  
  
Q. Their freshman center has been having foul problems. Did you guys know
that and was that part of the game plan to go at him?  
JAMIE SKEEN: We didn't know about the foul problems or nothing like that. We
did know he looks a little slower on ball screens, so we were going to try to
play him a whole lot of ball screen action. That was our goal, to have him out
there on the perimeter and trying to guard -- one of our guards trying to help
out his guards on hedging on ball screens.  
  
Q. How valuable can this game be playing in this tournament?  
JAMIE SKEEN: It's a great experience for us. We're playing great teams, like I
believe UCLA is one of the most winningest teams in the world, in the United
States. So this is a great team to beat.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else? Okay.

## November 26, 2010

  

### [Antonio Pena](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18399)

### [Corey Stokes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18094)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

VILLANOVA  68  
TENNESSEE  78

  
THE MODERATOR: Question for the players, please.  
  
Q. Corey, how much did their defensive pressure bother you guys out high
tonight?  
COREY STOKES: They played really aggressive. The Coach told us they were going
to come out and play and that's what they did. They came out and played really
aggressive. We missed some shots and they didn't quit during the whole game.
We continued to play Villanova basketball the 40 minutes. We didn't quit.
Tennessee did a great job on the defensive end though.  
  
Q. What was it like battling their big guys inside? Was that the best front
court you've seen this year?  
ANTONIO PENA: Yes, so far, yeah. It was real good. Williams is real big and
athletic. He can move his feet down there. Tobias is a great player. Going to
continue along the way.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the players?  
  
Q. Corey, when you guys came back and took that lead, did you feel the flow
going your way for a change, and what happened that stopped it?  
COREY STOKES: When we got the lead, Coach just told us to keep a great
attitude. That's all he kept saying, "Attitude. Keep pounding at the rock." We
continued to play hard.  
  
Q. Has their length changed what you guys want to do offensively?  
COREY STOKES: Nothing changes for us. We're going to play the same no matter
who we play against.  
JAY WRIGHT: I was waiting for questions. They played great. They played great
defense, obviously, the best defensive team we've played against so far. Yeah,
and we couldn't get any easy baskets. Even in transition a couple of times we
got out, and their length changed some of our lay-ups and, you know, sometimes
you play against a team like that that's really good half court defense, I
think they're great in their half-court defense, but you can create some
turnovers with the press or get out on the break and get some easy baskets. We
didn't get any of those. We got very few turnovers out of our press. And in
transition, we really didn't get anything. They got back, we couldn't get to
the rim. They just played a complete game. Give them a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Corey Fisher, had 26 the other night. Only has three
tonight. What's going on with him?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think Goins was -- I don't know, I think they list him at 180.
He looked like a defensive back of a football team to me. He is broad-
shouldered. He is strong and gets real low. He was very, very physical. And
even McBee, McBee did a good job on him. I just think it was one of those
nights -- ball screens. The bigs help. Williams can get out there and move his
feet. Very good defensive team. They didn't give Fish many one-on-one
opportunities. They soft blitzed him. Early he got some looks. He got good
looks and missed them.  
  
Q. He's fine physically and mentally?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah.  
  
Q. Two years ago against Texas you lost a similar game in this juncture of
the season. How does a coach, when they play quality competition three or four
weeks in the season, how do you evaluate the team?  
JAY WRIGHT: That's a good comparison. We kind of got manhandled here by Texas
the same way. You know, I've tried to explain to the guys today, you don't
have to learn that way. You could be smart about it and win and learn that way
too. But it seems like with us, we got to get beat up one time to -- we have
guys that have great confidence, and they want to challenge everybody. I love
that about them. But when you play a team like this, I thought we could have
made some extra passes. Because challenging them, they were up to the
challenge.  
Then you have to be smarter. We didn't play that way. But you have to give
them credit for that.  
  
Q. What are your feelings about losing -- what Corey called a street fight?
Was it disappointing to lose a street fight, because I know you guys pride
yourself on toughness.  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. I did say that. I mean that in a complimentary way. I think
they play -- I love how they play. So I just think they were better at that
tonight. You have to be smart in a street fight also. And I thought they were
a little tougher and a little smarter. When they drove the ball and we helped,
they made extra passes. We kind of tried to challenge the big guys every time,
you know? They had six blocked shots. So I just think they were a little bit
better at it tonight. We have to get better at it.  
  
Q. You guys are known as a guard-oriented team. So when Maalik and Corey are
struggling like they were tonight, how were you able to -- how in the future
can you overcome that and still win a big game?  
JAY WRIGHT: Well, that's something that's going to be -- we have to deal with
that this year. Like in the first half we had Stokes, Fisher and Maalik Wayns
all had two fouls. We kind of lost -- we were lucky to be down at five at the
half. We're going to have to figure out ways to play bigger when we don't have
those guys in the lineup and play effectively.  
  
Q. Jay, I know last year you guys got off to a hot start and almost kind of
wished you hadn't; how did tonight help you in the long run?  
JAY WRIGHT: I would much rather win this and we can learn. I think we learned
enough last year. I would much rather win this. This will be a tape we're
going to look at. You're going to see we weren't tough enough and we weren't
smart enough. So it's going to help us. It's definitely going to help us.  
  
Q. Villanova fans were out giving Bruce Pearl a pretty tough time? Can you
imagine what it's like to coach in this situation? What does it say he's able
to win this tournament with everything going on?  
JAY WRIGHT: I have a lot of respect for him. I know he's a good guy. I do know
it. I know he has integrity. And this business is tough. It can get to you. He
might have slipped, but I admire the way he's handled it. I respect the way
he's handling all of it. His team, man, he's doing a great job coaching. For
this point in the season, they know their personnel really well; I think a
little better than us. When we got the three guards in foul trouble, we
weren't in sync. We weren't prepared for that. We have to do a better job of
having the lineup, a big lineup that can play efficiently.  
  
Q. Jay, your teams have always had interchangeable parts off the bench the
last couple of years. Specifically on your list of priorities and things you
pontificate about. How much more meticulous do you have to be with your
substitution patterns at this juncture of the season with your depth?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think -- our substitution patterns are actually pretty easy job.  
Because we're not interchangeable. We know who subs for who. Our problem is
going to be a situation like tonight when guards are in foul trouble and we
have to play three forwards. How are we going to play efficiently? In our
other games we got away with it. Against a them like this, that can really
score and really defend, and then when you have three forwards, they know
you're going to war with those two guards, they did a great job of stopping
us. We have to get better at playing the three forwards.  
  
Q. Is it a little weird to think of a Villanova team with three forwards?  
JAY WRIGHT: It is. We got two of our guards are out, so we might hopefully get
somebody back.  
Thanks a lot, guys. We enjoyed this tournament. This was extremely well-run.
This was awesome.

### [Tyler Honeycutt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21510)

### [Ben Howland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13695)

### [Malcolm Lee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21509)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  89  
UCLA - 85

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will make an opening statement and take questions.  
BEN HOWLAND: I thought we got off again back-to-back nights of poor starts,
really fueled by some quick bad shots early in the game. Anytime you spot a
good team which we've done in our last two games an 8-0 start, I don't think
we ever had the lead. I think we were fighting uphill the whole way. We had it
with the chance to take the lead the beginning of the second half and miss two
foul shots. We did a better job in the second half of rebounding the ball. Too
many turnovers; 21 turnovers is going to be hard. Allowing a team to score 89
points, and they're a very good team. They shot extremely well from the three,
but most of those threes were open. Most of those threes were not contested
shots, but rather open shots off the penetration and kicking. They were able
to break our defense down too much.  
I thought that Skeen is obviously a very good player. He hurt us today. 23-9.
Their three top players, Skeen, Burgess and Rodriguez all played very well. We
had a chance there late in the game with a 1-point deficit with the ball, but
we just couldn't get control of the ball and they ended up getting a lay-up
and went up three. That was obviously a key juncture. We did a good job,
showed the will of heart fighting and having a chance during the last couple
of minutes to possibly win the game if we could get a loose ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players first?  
  
Q. You made that three-point, you guys are down one. Are you thinking you
guys are on your way at that point?  
MALCOLM LEE: Yes. I thought we were going to get the stop. But it was
unfortunate, but I'm just happy that we came back. We have to stop letting
teams get out on us early, two games in a row. I think we gave them 8 points
straight. We have to get off to a better start.  
  
Q. Malcolm, seems like this was a good game shooting from the outside. Is
that something you're working on a lot, shooting the ball better and scoring
more for the team?  
MALCOLM LEE: Most definitely. Coach has been working on my stuff, getting
extra shots before and after practice. Not only with my mechanics, just
confidence. I think a lot of things to do with shooting is confidence and I
just have confidence.  
  
Q. I think it was you that had the turnover when you guys were down one. Can
you talk about that play? What happened there?  
TYLER HONEYCUTT: I tried to grab the ball and the dude was on the floor and I
kind of tripped and fell. I knew we didn't have any time-outs. I tried to give
it to somebody who was right there. There was a player right there between us.  
BEN HOWLAND: I don't think he had control of the ball. We were talking about
that play, he was tripping over someone as it was occurring, at least in my
mind. I will go back and watch it. That obviously could have been a key play
for us. We had a chance if we could just get possession on that one.  
  
Q. Can you talk about getting in a hole and trying to climb out two games in
a row and not being able to get those one or two points that will give you the
lead?  
TYLER HONEYCUTT: That's very hard. We started out low both games and being a
slow first half and having to pick it up in the second really hurt us instead
of coming out aggressive in the beginning and not having to play behind the
whole game.  
  
Q. What can you guys do better on defense? Seems like both these games
people have been --  
TYLER HONEYCUTT: This team we knew there were a lot of good three-point
shooters. They got a lot of open threes towards the end of the game. One that
he missed and we got the rebound and went to the free-throw line. But we have
to play better defense in the post and outside.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players?  
  
Q. Malcolm, you were shooting well from three-point range. Did you want that
last three-point that could have tied the game?  
MALCOLM LEE: No, because I seen Reeves right there open. And Reeves has been
working on his shot a lot. So I had confidence in him a lot. I easily could
have shot it myself. I seen him open.  
  
Q. You outrebounded this team by 14. Is this a game you normally would
win?  
MALCOLM LEE: Yeah, because usually the team that controls the ball wins. It
was just unfortunate. I think what separated us from them is I think they shot
a high percentage; am I right?  
BEN HOWLAND: 48%. They shot 45% from the three, which is really --  
MALCOLM LEE: Yeah. I don't know if they're a team that live and die by the
three. The three was definitely on their side.  
  
Q. For either of you guys, there's no doubt you guys have a lot of talented
players on this team. What do you think is the main problems with the team and
why you guys aren't able to get over the hump and get some big wins?  
TYLER HONEYCUTT: We're still a young team. Still playing together and trying
to feel each other's chemistry. Make sure we have sets right. A lot of players
forget the sets, because this is our first time learning them. But I think as
time goes on, we'll become a lot better.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, guys. Questions for the coach?  
  
Q. You talked about the way your team showed heart tonight and back to
Wednesday, but you never had a lead in either game. How do you balance the
teaching, the positive with that negative?  
BEN HOWLAND: We do have a real young team. And we knew that both these games
would be very difficult no matter who we were playing. Tennessee, VCU, we
started with Villanova. This is a process. We're playing without a senior on
our club. As Tyler alluded to, we have a lot of growth that we have to make
from our younger players.  
We had a lot of turnovers in the first half. We had some freshmen throwing the
ball away. Our rebounding in the first half was not great out of our front
line with the exception of Reeves. We have a lot of things to improve on. Our
defense was really disappointing. I thought the game started today -- we
really took bad shots early. If you go back and watch this game, you would see
that the first three or four shots were in the first ten seconds of the
possession in half court. Off on your own. Dribbling the ball. We have to
learn to come out and play good defense to start games, number one, to give us
a chance.  
Number two, take care of the basketball. A lot of turnovers. 21-13. That's
eight more possessions they had tonight. Which is a huge difference in a close
game.  
We have to get it inside more. We only got to the line 12 times. They got
there 28 or 26 times. So those two things, not getting to the line enough,
taking care of the basketball, doing a better job defensively. I think we're
going to be able to score. I think we have a team that is going to be able to
put some points up on the board. But it doesn't do any good. We're putting up
85 tonight. But the other team had four more. 89 points allowed is going to be
hard to win a lot of games.  
  
Q. Coach, you've coached so many big games in this building. Especially at
Pitt. And Pitt is fairly ensconced as the top five or top ten program. Any
part of you sitting and thinking what would it have been if I stayed at
Pitt?  
BEN HOWLAND: Not really. I'm proud of what we've accomplished at UCLA. I love
Pittsburgh. I always will be very appreciative to Chancellor Nordenberg and to
Steve Pederson for giving me that opportunity. And when I left I really spoke
out strongly that I thought it would be in the best interests of the program
that they hire Jamie, which they did. And Jamie has done a terrific job,
continued success and is one of the finest coaches in the country.  
I'm very happy where I'm at and feel very lucky. This is a childhood dream to
be coach of UCLA, coming from the West Coast and watching all those teams. I'm
very excited. I think we have a good group to work with as we move forward. I
really like our young group. I like the two kids we have sitting out that
become eligible next year in the Wear twins. We signed a very good player in
Norman Powell. I'm excited about the future.  
This is a tough stretch playing the top five or top six like Villanova. VCU
you could see how motivated they were to play against us. They're very good.
We crushed them by one in '09 in the tournament on a neutral site. And they've
got a very, very good team, a lot of veterans. Rodriguez and Skeen are really
veteran guys. Burgess is a very good player. You have to give them a lot of
credit. Who hurt us in the first half was Brandenberg on two of those threes.
I don't know how many threes he made going into the game, but he made a couple
from deep. So they had a lot of balance. They played a lot of people.  
They did a good job on Rozzell. Rozzell is their leading scorer. He normally
averages 18. He had 7 tonight. We probably should have doubled the post
earlier than we did. Skeen really hurt us.  
  
Q. With David and Travis and Norman coming next year, can you elaborate what
they'll bring to the team and how much better you think the team can be next
year?  
BEN HOWLAND: I think this team we have now has to develop. I think we will. I
think we have a good group of kids that are good kids. They're going to work
hard. They're disappointed right now. They have two losses in a row. And our
next game is in Kansas against one of the best teams in the country. Won 61 in
a row or whatever it is. So we have a tough road ahead of us.  
The opportunity to keep improving so that when we get to the conference we're
ready to play in the PAC-10.  
  
Q. Were you comfortable with Reeves taking that late three-pointer or do you
want somebody else to take it?  
BEN HOWLAND: You know what, being down in the situation, no time-outs, as I
told the team after the game, I had to burn three of our time-outs in the
first half just to stop the bleeding each time that we were falling down,
falling behind. The big thing for me is defensively we have to be a better
defensive team. We have to have better shot selection. Too many questionable
shots. Part of it, as they alluded to, we have kids still don't know exactly
what to do, where to go, because it's all new. We're dependent upon a lot of
young new players playing major minutes.  
  
Q. You look at Josh Smith's line, how disappointing is it for him, big guy
like that to have two points, one shot, the whole game?  
BEN HOWLAND: His big thing for us is he has to get better defensively. He'll
be fine offensively. But he had four fouls in 13 minutes of play. He's
averaging a lot of fouls per minutes played. You have to get him so he'll be
able to stay out of foul trouble and do a better job on the glass as well.
Josh will be fine. He's a freshman. This is all new. He's having to learn a
number of things for the first time. So there's a lot more to the game than
the normal high school kid probably comes in ready for.  
  
Q. Was the reason he didn't play much in the first half was the defensive
problems?  
BEN HOWLAND: Josh? I thought he played --  
  
Q. Seemed like he was on the bench.  
BEN HOWLAND: I thought he played less in the second half. He was in foul
trouble.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.  
BEN HOWLAND: Thank you.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

VILLANOVA  68  
TENNESSEE - 78

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the players first, please.  
  
Q. Tobias, you've talked always in terms of team. What does it mean to you
personally to come in here as a freshman and be part of a team that -- be part
of a team that knocks off number six at the Garden?  
TOBIAS HARRIS: It means a lot. Especially coming out here playing really well
versus, like you said, a top-ranked team, gives us a lot of confidence. We
have to continue to stay focused going into our next games.  
  
Q. You talked about how this whole situation has brought your team closer.
Can you talk about just kind of winning this for the coach and what it means
for what's going on in Tennessee right now?  
TOBIAS HARRIS: It's just showing how hard work is paying off. We don't really
focus on a lot of the media stuff. We just like to go out there and play
basketball each night. And coming off a night like tonight, it showed us what
hard work has done. We have another game on Tuesday, so we have to refocus and
get ready for that one.  
  
Q. Scotty, talk about the back-to-back nights, big games, talk about getting
it done on this stage especially against a team like that.  
SCOTTY HOPSON: We worked all year to get to this point. We're still learning.
Still battling. Still just want to win championships, come out and compete
every day. It's a whole process to get to where we want to be. I think this
team can still get better. It's a long way to go. We have to keep working.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the championship, you guys have been to a lot of
finals and haven't won. How good was it to give Coach Pearl his first
tournament title?  
SCOTTY HOPSON: It's great for him and this basketball club. We wanted to come
out and be aggressive. We hadn't won a championship game. This is our first
one with this basketball club. We hope it isn't going to be the last.  
  
Q. The fans were out there yelling a lot of stuff at you all game? Do you
hear that and does that motivate you to shut them up?  
SCOTTY HOPSON: We're going out there competing. We know the fans are going to
be a part of the game. At the same time we're going out there and competing.
We have to keep our poise and our purpose and execute our game plan.  
  
Q. Scotty, do you feel you guys do a good job of extending your defense and
pressuring them out high around the perimeter?  
SCOTTY HOPSON: I think so. We're an athletic team. We can make deflections and
get in the passing lanes and disrupt people's offense. I think that's what we
did tonight. We just tried to smother the guards and make it tough on them on
the defensive end and then rebound well.  
  
Q. Scotty, your first couple of years it seemed like you were deferring to
either Wayns or Tyler. What does it feel like to be the go-to guy?  
SCOTTY HOPSON: That is what they expect from me. Coach wants me to attack. I
can't be nonchalant. Stay in attack mode all the time. I had a couple of
opportunities and I wanted to take advantage and be aggressive.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the pressure role of breaking the pressure and getting
to the middle of the court against Villanova is the key?  
TOBIAS HARRIS: One of the things Coach Pearl told me as I was getting
recruited was to be a point forward. At that position, I think, Mel did a
great job getting to the gaps. Trying to make it and make plays for other
guys.  
  
Q. Just nine rebounds tonight and matched up with Yarou inside, physical
play. Talk about that aspect.  
TOBIAS HARRIS: It was real physical down there. Brian was matched up with
Yarou and I was matched up with Pena. One of the things was to get more
rebounds. So tonight getting nine was pretty good. After the rebound I have to
break.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach will make an opening statement and then he'll take some
questions.  
BRUCE PEARL: I think building on what was said there, the fact that Tobias is
so versatile, and Trae Golden doesn't play tonight because of having that
fever for three games, he had seven assists and two turnovers against Virginia
Commonwealth.  
And so we really needed Tobias to handle the ball a lot and break the press.
And he was just solid. He didn't turn it over. That was the big key. You can
tell at times he has the ability to take some things over.  
I thought Scotty stayed patient in a sense that he is our leading scorer and
kind of our go-to guy, but he didn't force things. He only got 11 shots. But I
like to see him get to the rim. He had some beautiful passes out there as
well. You can see he's not hesitant. He's comfortable and he's bought in.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it's like to have a senior point guard in the
last few minutes two big steals?  
BRUCE PEARL: He makes those free-throws down the stretch. It's terrific. We're
not a young team, we're a new team. I talked about that a lot in the pre-
season. Really I've learned as much about this team in the last five games as
any. Four starters. I had some senior guys that were backups. Melvin was a
backup. Brian was a backup last year. Cameron was a fourth-year junior,
backup. Those guys are all starters now.  
I thought Goins' defense, I thought the physicality of his defense and the
ball pressure he put on Wayns, I thought was very, very significant.  
And I thought that Scotty did a great job on Corey Fisher. Scotty's length
bothered Corey. And Scotty stayed down and Corey was getting some of the shots
he was getting, but he wasn't getting to the rim, and he wasn't -- he was
having to shoot over that 6'6" frame. Last night he had 11 rebounds. Tonight
he didn't rebound but he had three assists and one turnover and he played
great defense against one of the best guards in the country in Corey Fisher.  
  
Q. Even though you guys were two points away from the Final Four last year,
a lot of people were overlooking you guys this year, talking about other SEC
teams. You guys are ranked 24th. Do you think winning a game like this shows
you are legitimate and did you have any many doubt how good this team was?  
BRUCE PEARL: I had plenty of doubts how good this team could be because of how
new it was. But we worked very hard in the pre-season. One of the hardest
working teams I have had. Because there were a lot of opportunities and there
was a lot of competition for positions. And this team is beginning to trust
each other and beginning to care about each other and rely on each other.
Because there's a lot of guys who played out there, played some roles.  
All it means right now is that we beat a very good basketball team tonight.
That's all it really means. And at this point in the season, we're good enough
to beat Villanova here. We have so much in front of us. We have so many tough
games ahead. We're picked fourth in the SEC East. So there's some really good
teams picked in front of us. And we know that we have to keep on working and
see if we can get better.  
  
Q. Do you think that loss to Indianapolis could have been just relying on
that getting the guys' attention and buying in?  
BRUCE PEARL: We certainly weren't playing as well. The competition, Villanova
brought something out in us. I can't say enough about how much I enjoyed
preparing for Villanova. To watch the way Jay Wright coaches and to watch his
system and to watch how he puts the pieces in place, they're a hard cover. I
thought he did -- he's got a good basketball team. I really enjoyed what he
does.  
  
Q. You mentioned playing without Trae, you're without Josh Bone and another
point guard, without Trae, what was the plan down to your third point guard?  
BRUCE PEARL: I think, again, Skylar McBee played point guard this summer in
anticipation, we only had two. He handled it.  
Having Tobias Harris and Steven Pearl in that back court with him takes a
little ball handling pressure off. I thought Steven Pearl played very
effectively tonight. He gave us great energy. He got a lot of loose balls and
made a lot of tough big-boy plays. I thought just again complemented this
group. John Fields had five rebounds and 14 minutes with two blocked shots.
Didn't score but played a role out there. And played effectively.  
  
Q. Coach, defensively I think that's the fifth game you've held the opponent
to 36%. Not just tonight but overall. Talk about the distinct defense.  
BRUCE PEARL: My teams have historically been 94 feet fast-breaking which we
still have a fast-breaking team. Full court pressure defense, because we're so
long. I only have one player under six foot tall. That's Melvin.  
The closer we get to the basket, the better we look. The farther we get away
from the basket, the more quickness becomes an advantage. And so we can't
extend too terribly much defensively. We have to use our length and make
people score over us. I thought when you guard Villanova, you have to do a
great job in ball-screen defense.  
Ball-screen defense is everything. We spent a lot of time on it. I thought we
were prepared well.  
  
Q. Brian Williams got off to a slow start. Can you talk about his
performance?  
BRUCE PEARL: Brian has to be as excited about playing the next game as he was
about playing in Madison Square Garden. Brian can rebound and defend and
handle the ball at a high level. He obviously can score around the basket.  
This weekend -- I thought maybe his last game -- didn't he play fairly well in
the last game before he came here? So he has picked it up. I know his
teammates were awfully proud of him.  
  
Q. What does it do for you that Hopson was able to step up in the second
half of both games here and really show leadership?  
BRUCE PEARL: Well, it's exciting for him that he was able to do that. And he's
not deferring. But I'll tell you what, in addition to getting to the rim and
making some exciting penetrations, he also had a couple of nice passes and
just played aggressively, but he was still unselfish.  
So it's a nice step for Scotty. I think, yes, you have a bunch of guys to
write about at Tennessee right now. You can write about Melvin Goins and his
defense. You can write about Scotty Hopson stepping up and you can write about
Brian coming back home. You can write about Tobias Harris one of the better
freshman in the country that's not getting the same kind of hype that a lot of
freshman are. That's okay. That's not the kind of kid he is. He's just all
about trying to win.  
So there's a lot of good stories. And then Cameron Tatum really, really,
really quietly -- when you have four guys in double figures and Melvin has
nine, it was a great team effort.  
  
Q. I know you said all this means is you beat Villanova at Madison Square
Garden. But with all the distractions, how much did this team need this
tournament for the guys? Because not a lot has been written about them this
year. It's mostly been about the --  
BRUCE PEARL: That's positive. It would be good for people to write about these
kids and how we play. We're in the season right now. And I think the focus
should be shifted to our season and where we're at. Obviously, happy for the
guys. We've handled some adversity. Now we have to handle some success. That
will be the next step for this basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.

_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU  72  
TENNESSEE - 77

  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players?  
  
Q. Guys, you came in shooting 49%. Obviously you were hovering in the 20 for
much of the game. Can you talk about what Tennessee did for you defensively
taking you out of your shot selection?  
JAMIE SKEEN: They switched everything so they made it hard for us to catch it.
So when we would run our plays, we had places we wanted to be at. They took us
out of where we wanted to be. They made it a little bit hard on us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players, please?  
  
Q. Coach, what happened to Rodriguez in the first half? Was that anything to
do with an older injury or a new injury?  
SHAKA SMART: He reinjured an ankle that he had turned a couple of weeks ago.
So it's a little bit of old and a little bit of new. It certainly hampered
him. It took a way from his explosiveness. He did such a great job all year
getting by his man and creating shots for his teammates. I think the injury
affected him. Tennessee did a good job guarding him.  
THE MODERATOR: Do we have questions for the players?  
  
Q. Can you talk about the experience of being the first VCU team to play
here at the Garden? It's obviously not like playing in Hofstra when you come
to New York.  
JAMIE SKEEN: It's much different. Bigger atmosphere, I can tell you that. I
just wish we had better results.  
  
Q. Does it say anything about the majors in general that you were able to
hang with a team like Tennessee even though you weren't shooting the ball
well?  
BRANDON ROZZELL: I think every team comes in trying to compete. That's what we
did. We wanted to go out there and compete and we did a good job versus a good
team. We showed the nation we can play.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach is going to make an opening statement and then take some
questions.  
SHAKA SMART: I thought our guys battled and I really can't fault their effort.
Really fought until the very end of the game. And I'm proud of the way they
did that. I did think that we didn't play as smart as we typically do. I don't
know if that had to do with some nerves or being the first time in Madison
Square Garden, playing on national TV. But we made some mistakes particularly
on the defensive end and even executing on offense that are unlike us. I
thought the way we shot the ball for the first 30 minutes of the game
obviously made it tough. But we're a good shooting team. And I knew it was
going to turn. It took a while. And at the end it turned, we made some shots
late. Obviously didn't get enough stops to get it done.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. How healthy was Joey even before he got hurt towards the end of the first
half? And how much did that affect him throughout the game?  
SHAKA SMART: He's been banged up for the last two or three weeks. Really
hasn't been able to practice at full strength and it hasn't hurt him so far in
our games. He's been phenomenal in our games averaging 18 and 10 coming into
this game. It certainly was -- he was less than 100% coming in. And then after
turning the ankle, you saw. He just had a hard time getting by his man.
Probably at 60 or 70% of where he normally is.  
  
Q. Would you rest him completely tomorrow? I realize you have the holiday
now in between tonight and Friday, but was there any practice time planned in
between just the same?  
SHAKA SMART: We're going to practice tomorrow. Joey probably won't practice.
We'll evaluate his ankle and see how he's feeling. I would guess he won't
practice. But we're going to practice tomorrow.  
We have a lot of stuff to look at on tape. And some things to go over, some
things to work on.  
  
Q. Rozzell, 1 for 6 in the first half. He finished 7 for 15. Keeping you
guys in the game in the second half. Anything execution-wise that you guys
overcame in the second half or was it a matter of missing shots in the first
half?  
SHAKA SMART: No, I thought we got a lot of good shots in the first half that
we didn't knock down. And Brandon made those same shots and even tougher shots
in the second half. He's a guy that can get hot like that.  
So I thought he did a great job of that. But, again, even though he shot the
ball subpar for us, I thought if we would been able to bear down and get more
defensive stops when we needed them most, we would have been able to win the
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay.  
SHAKA SMART: Thanks, guys.

## November 24, 2010

  

### [Ben Howland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13695)

### [Lazeric Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21507)

### [Reeves Nelson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21508)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

UCLA  70  
VILLANOVA - 82

  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to start with questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. Can you talk about trying to contain their speed, their guards and their
dribble penetration, especially in the first half?  
LAZERIC JONES: I tried, I guess. Didn't do a great job at it. It wasn't my
best effort at all. I guess we have to go back in and practice and correct
some things, hopefully come back and try to bounce back and get a win
tomorrow.  
  
Q. How did Maalik and Corey compare to some of the other guards you guys
have played speed-wise and stuff?  
LAZERIC JONES: They were the way they were supposed to be. They were really
good guards, some of the two best guards in the country. We learned a lot of
things, I sure learned a lot of things. I have to go back and get better. This
team deserves better. I'll be better.  
  
Q. Reeves, what did you think about the physicality of the game tonight?  
REEVES NELSON: I mean, I think it was pretty even on both sides. I don't think
they bullied us around or anything like that. It was a physical game. I think
we matched their level of being physical.  
  
Q. Reeves, tough shooting night for you. Is it playing in the big arena? Was
there tough shooting angles?  
REEVES NELSON: No. I take responsibility for not shooting well. I thought I
got fouled on probably three of the shots I missed. But the rest I didn't see
it that way. And there's nothing you can do.  
  
Q. What were the halftime adjustments you guys made and what allowed you to
get back in the game?  
REEVES NELSON: We just let them go on a 15-2 run there. We had them -- it was
like a three-point game and they went on a big run. We wanted to try to cut
their lead in half. Like ten minutes to go, and I thought we did a pretty good
job of chipping away at that big lead they had.  
  
Q. Did that take a lot out of you when you came back?  
REEVES NELSON: Yeah. We played our hardest. I think everybody on the team can
say they played as hard as they could and tried as hard as they could. At the
end of the day that's all you want to be able to do.  
BEN HOWLAND: I thought that as Reeves was talking about, they got off to a big
lead to start the game, 8-0 run where we were sped up, made a couple of bad
turnovers to start the game. They got out on us. And then we played well, come
back and it was 30-27. They went on a 14-2 run fueled by some turnovers,
inability to stay in front of the ball. We probably should have hedged the
screens differently than we did. That's my fault. I was worried about them
slipping screens and hurting us that way. But you have to give them credit.
They're a very, very good team. I thought we did a good job coming back,
fighting back. I think we had it to six, is that correct, in the second half?
And missed some free-throws. We had an opportunity six, seven, eight, nine. We
missed four free-throws in a row and got stops and had a chance to whittle the
lead. I think Josh, that was the beginning of four in a row. Because we were
down six, shooting one coming out of a time-out.  
And then I think we got a stop, and missed two more, or maybe they scored and
we missed two more again. But we made a number of mistakes at both ends of the
floor.  
We have a very young team. We have to learn from this. This is an outstanding
Villanova team with a lot of experience that return from a number 2 seed in
the tournament a year ago. They're very well coached. Obviously, Fisher is
fantastic. Even with an off-shooting night, 6 for 19, he still manufactures 26
points, because he gets to the line 15 times. You can tell he really has a
good feel how to shot fake, get us up in the air and draw the foul.  
But we have to learn from this game. We'll watch this tape tonight as coaches,
try to edit, show our team some of it before we come over here for tomorrow's
walk-through and kind of move forward and get ready for VCU.  
  
Q. Can you take any solace in the fact that you were able to hang with a top
ten team, given the state of your program right now?  
BEN HOWLAND: I beg your pardon?  
  
Q. Can you take any solace you guys were able to hang with this top-ten
team. You have this young group of kids coming off a bad season.  
BEN HOWLAND: We thought we had a chance to win. We're going to every game with
the expectation to win. So it was disappointing at halftime to be down as big
as we were. Especially when we had it 30-27. We made a lot of mistakes. We
missed some open shots. The first half we had three air balls. They were all
open shots. Actually two of the three were. Another one was probably an off-
balance leap and leaner.  
But we've got to do a better job at executing and taking good shots
offensively. Obviously we have to improve defensively. At the end of the day
they shot 40% from the field but got to the line way too many times. Their big
kid, Mouphtaou, very big factor tonight. He hurt us early in the game. And we
were trying to get deflections rather than play behind him and make him score
over us. And our foul trouble hurt us tonight. We ended up having 28 fouls,
which is a lot of fouls.  
  
Q. How do you account for those fouls?  
BEN HOWLAND: A lot of mistakes. In other words, for example, Josh's (Smith)
first two fouls, he's trying to deflect the ball. Instead of get back behind
the man and make him score over him. Because he's a big guy. He's hard to
score over. But those are things that come with experience. And they're a fine
team. And we'll get better with experience. That's one thing you can't make up
for, is we have a young team, a lot of guys, our JC point guard starts is
playing in a big-time game really for the first time against a top-ten team.  
So these experiences will help us. Bottom line is we have to learn from it. We
have to bounce back. We're playing a very good VCU team, very well coached, a
team that we're going to have to really play well in order to have success on
Friday.  
  
Q. Coach, you said you made some mistakes. What were some of the keys coming
in? What were you trying to do --  
BEN HOWLAND: Trying to slow them in transition. We tried to do a good job of
staying in front of the ball, which was really a big problem for us all night
with those two guards. Wayns really hurt us at the end of the half. The way we
knew he was going to go two times in a row, that's the way he wants to go.  
So our hedging -- they were able to attack our bigs when they did hedge and go
right by him. We have to get better at hedging screens. Just basic fundamental
things that are key to having a good defense.  
  
Q. Only seven turnovers for them. How hard was it trying to force them into
mistakes?  
BEN HOWLAND: They don't turn it over a lot. That's the kind of team they have.
They have it in those two kids' hands a lot of times. A lot of the time. And
they do a good job of handling the basketball. They are very good at spreading
you out and -- the second half we held them to 31% from the field. We did a
better job defensively in the second half. They got to the line 20 times in
the second half, which is a lot.  
  
Q. What about the job that Malcolm Lee did coming become?  
BEN HOWLAND: I thought Malcolm Lee did a good job considering he had one
practice which was yesterday prior to the game. He did some shooting on Monday
or the day we left. I can't remember what day it is right now. I guess it was
Monday. And he did a good job considering. You can see he was starting to
cramp a little bit there. And so I was taking him out a couple of times,
because he was cramping, which is an issue he's had in the past. Probably
being out a week and missing out on the conditioning aspect of that affected
him I'm sure a little bit.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Thanks, Coach. Thank you.

## November 24, 2010

  

### [Scotty Hopson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19577)

### [Bruce Pearl](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13795)

### [Brian Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20627)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

VCU - 72  
TENNESSEE - 77

  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. I'll start off with Scotty. This is your first career double, double.
What about being back in New York. You said this was the place you would get
it going again. Why were you so confident?  
SCOTTY HOPSON: I had a few games before this where I don't think I played up
to my potential. I hadn't done as well as me and Coach and the rest of my
teammates had expected. So I wanted to start off with practice this week and
get the team going, get on a good start and get it into the game. Me and Coach
always say, "practice makes perfect." Practice leads up to a good game. This
is what I think I did today.  
  
Q. Scotty, you felt aggressiveness going to the hoop. Noticeably different.
You got to the line a lot when the shot clock was winding down. Just talk
about that attitude.  
SCOTTY HOPSON: I feel like that's what's expected on this team. I'm a leader.
When it's time to lead, we need a bucket or a big play, I have to step up and
do that for this team. I think it's what is expected of me.  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the players?  
  
Q. Brian, 13 boards for you. You had gotten off to a slow start. What got
you going tonight?  
BRUCE PEARL: Obviously being in Madison Square Garden, I'm from New York City.
Never got an opportunity to play in this kind of atmosphere. So I was just
excited. And my teammates needed it and they say if I play good we would get a
victory. So I just wanted to win.  
  
Q. Brian, you guys dominated the boards in the paint 48 to 16. Was that
stressed coming in? Can you talk about going out and executing that?  
BRIAN WILLIAMS: Definitely keep executing our plays in practice and I think it
carried over to the game. The game plan we executed to the T. That's why we
got the victory.  
  
Q. Scotty, a lot has been going on around this program off the court. Is it
nice to have this game under your belt now and you guys can get back to
focusing on what's going on out there?  
SCOTTY HOPSON: I think so. We basically are focusing just on going to the
basketball court. What the athletes and coaches want us to stick to the aspect
of the game. We are doing things right on the floor and playing well.  
  
Q. Brian, how many family members did you have? You said you felt you would
have a few folks?  
BRIAN WILLIAMS: I only had eight tickets. But I think there was 50 people.
They showed the love. I appreciate that and all the fans across the nation.  
  
Q. Scotty, Coach Pearl said it would take five people to break the press.
That didn't seem to be much of a factor.  
SCOTTY HOPSON: We got two great point guards. Trae Golden, and we wanted those
to be better than their point guards. When everyone is on the same page and
come together and play with that intensity and carry the game, we're
effective. The game plan, we like to play against them. I think we executed
well.  
  
Q. Brian, being a New York guy, you talked to Tobias (Harris) about that
too, him being a Long Island guy?  
BRIAN WILLIAMS: Definitely, Tobias played in the Garden so he was telling me
with a to expect. I was ready to get out here and play. He played a great game
too. So I think everybody on our team played a great game. So we got a
victory.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the players? Okay. Thanks, gentlemen. Coach
will make an opening statement and take some questions.  
BRUCE PEARL: I think a couple of things. First of all, I need a stool. I need
a booster. Those guys really stepped up. Scotty Hopson with 11 rebounds, Brian
Williams with 13 rebounds. Huge. I thought our rebounding in the second half
was a real key. They beat us to a lot of loose balls in the first half. In the
second half we did a much better job. And I thought we really limited their
two-point baskets in the second half. I think defensively our guys guarded
really well. I thought Coach Jason (Shay) did an outstanding job with the game
plan. We had a week to get ready for them. They were a fun team to get ready
for. Because they do such great stuff in transition. With ball screen stuff,
it gave me an opportunity to really do some teaching.  
They didn't have a big post-up attack. And I think (Jamie) Skeen had a hard
time finishing over the top of Tobias and Brian and some of the size on them.
I thought Tobias got us off to a great start. That was a real key for us.
Because this VCU team had been playing extremely well. Tobias makes his first
five shots. That's pretty impressive for a freshman.  
But I thought it was a good team effort. I thought we got a lot of
contributions. If you look at the minutes played and you look at the stats
sheet, we played a lot of guys and a lot of guys contributed. That's a good
basketball team to beat.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, different mood for you now than the last time you were
in this room, I guess, three or four years ago, after the Butler-North
Carolina. How big is it for Tennessee to get a win in Madison Square Garden
for the program?  
BRUCE PEARL: I think it's big. I didn't want to get shutout here. That would
probably be justice for a guy from Boston to come to Madison Square Garden and
get shutout. But I was a big fan of Red Holzman, he was one of my idols
growing up.  
This is the fourth straight championship this Tennessee basketball team has
played for. We've been in the Disney Classic and in the Virgin Islands. Played
over in New Jersey. We didn't win any of them. But this is the fourth time we
played for the championship. And I think that's significant.  
I also thought that we had -- we were here three or four years ago, and Butler
and North Carolina, and Gonzaga, three fabulous basketball programs. You think
about those three schools. And they had great support. They had really good
fans. I thought there was a lot of Tennessee people in the building tonight.
And it was noticeable. I think it says something about where our basketball
program -- I think there were people that have watched our teams play the last
few years that aren't from Tennessee that have become fans the way these guys
are playing. I was just really pleased with the support. There was a lot of
energy in the building tonight.  
  
Q. You touched on Scotty a little bit. Especially in the second half he came
out and I think he took four shots in four straight possessions and made throw
of them. Noticeably more aggressive. Got to the free-throw line. Did you tell
him something at halftime?  
BRUCE PEARL: I thought he was fairly patient. And didn't force -- you didn't
see any body language that indicated I didn't have a big first half. But I
knew Scotty is a tough cover. And once he got taken -- get in there and taking
it deep, finishing with the contact and commanding a better whistle, getting
to the foul line, I thought that was good.  
They're a tough team to cover. It was a physical game. It was a tough game to
work. Because both teams were playing very physically, very aggressively. I
thought we did a good job with VCU's pressure. I thought we attacked it well.
And didn't turn it over much. We like to play fast. And I think playing fast
brings out the best in us. Which you can see, that's a dangerous team. VCU,
those guys can light it up.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the experience of having your son on the team a
little bit? What's that like, coaching him? And given everything you've been
going through the last few weeks, does it make it easier or harder that he's
here?  
BRUCE PEARL: I know it's hard for you to believe, these guys are so insulated
from what's going on off the floor, I'm so on them about basketball and
preparation, there's no time to spend any time on it. We don't talk about it
at all. We have to work to become a good basketball team. Having Steve out
there is wonderful. I love my players and I love my son. I think he's sort of
-- what do you want to be known for? What do you want to be known for? He's a
tough kid who gives everything he's got, and he's a defensive guy. And he's
earned the respect of his teammates. That's the greatest thing that's happened
to Steven. He's earned the respect of high major guys. And he knows his role.
So his father is proud of him.  
  
Q. Coach, points in the paint and you played against size advantage, the
advantage didn't show up on the boards tonight. Can you talk about the
difference?  
BRUCE PEARL: Well, I thought, again, I thought we did a pretty good job
getting to the rim. I would have liked to have gotten Tobias more touches
inside. And because they were playing, they wound up playing four guards a
lot. There were times during the mid-portion of that game, late in the first
half, early in the second half when they were extending on us, it was
difficult for us to get good looks and get that ball into the paint. We got to
do a better job with that. Inside shots were the inside rebounds. Even though
we missed some inside shots, we got some second-chance points. We had 16
second-chance points.  
We had 18 offensive rebounds. They had 15 offensive rebounds. A lot of their
offensive rebounds were chased-down three balls. That still gives you another
possession but it doesn't give you a chance to necessarily score inside shots,
inside rebounds. I think we got a lot of put-backs because of that.  
  
Q. You kind of reopened the recruiting pipeline back into the area, with
Brian and Tobias. Tennessee has always had a little bit of that with Ernie
(Grunfeld) and Bernie (King).  
BRUCE PEARL: Ernie and Bernie. And two of the greatest players in the history
of Tennessee basketball. And then Allen Houston sitting right behind our
bench. Those are three -- what, the top ten, 15? Those are three great New
York Knicks who played in this building. Allen lives here. Ernie and Bernard
grew up here. High school legends. Brian is from the Bronx and from the
Island. I'm sitting there listening to the starting lineups in Madison Square
Garden and the first two kids that trot out there are from New York.  
So it was special. I know -- and by the way, all three of those guys are huge
-- they are very involved in our program. Ernie and Allen and Bernard, they
attend our games, they stay in touch with our players and our kids. Wouldn't
mind coming back and keeping that thing going.  
THE MODERATOR: Last question.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the matchup between Melvin and Rodriguez.  
BRUCE PEARL: I believe Rodriguez was hurt. I believe Joey was hurt. And I
think he either tweaked his ankle or did something. He was not -- he was not
100%. And one of the things we were going to do is go at him. We got two fouls
on him early. That was part of our game plan. We were going to go at him.
They're a good team. They're really good with him on the floor, 100%.  
If he was healthy, we would have gone at him even more and tried to get Melvin
(Goins) and try to take that bull to the basket and see if we can get him in
foul trouble. We did. I think that also helped us stay in the game early.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, thanks, coach.

## November 24, 2010

  

### [Corey Fisher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18398)

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Mouphtaou Yarou](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20760)

  
_NEW YORK CITY, NEW YORK_  
  

UCLA  70  
VILLANOVA - 82

  
Q. Corey, this is the first time you guys have found adversity this season
with the way you guys shot in the second half. How did you deal with it and
overcome it?  
COREY FISHER: I think that was a great game for us. We just try to get better
day by day. That's what we're trying to do, be the best team we can be. We
played against a great team, UCLA. They came out hard, we came out hard. I
think we played hard. It ain't about making shots; it's about getting stops on
the defensive end. That's something we did today, like move. Like Mouph, came
up with 16 rebounds. That was real big. We take pride in that, guys that do
all the loose stuff.  
  
Q. They seemed to jam up the lane in the second half preventing you and
Maalik (Wayns) from driving the lane; what did you do to overcome that?  
COREY FISHER: Nothing changes. Me and Maalik are going to be aggressive at all
times. And if we don't got a shot, we're going to see the next guys. We have
guys like stokes, (Dominic) Cheek and guys that can knock down shots. That's
something we came out with. We knew they were going to be aggressive in the
second half. We got in the lane and we just took what the defense gave us.  
  
Q. Corey, when you and Maalik are on the floor at the same time, how does
that allow you to attack the defense having two point guards out there like
that?  
COREY FISHER: It gives us a great opportunity on offense. We both do the same
thing. Coach is always on us about staying on the attack. Even when we are
tired, I'm out there, "Coach, I need a break." He's like, "attack, attack."
That's -- if I'm down, Maalik picks me up. If Maalik is down, I pick him up.
If we both down, (Corey) Stokes picks us up. We have a great team and we're
trying to get better.  
  
Q. Corey, you guys get to play at the Garden all the time. Is there anything
special about doing it now, this time of year, having people come out,
Thanksgiving?  
COREY FISHER: Yeah. It's an honor just to go out and play some basketball at
Thanksgiving weekend. And there's a lot of people that would give up their
life to come play some basketball on a great weekend like this against a great
team and a great tournament. Especially in a great arena, the Mecca of
basketball. We came and we tried to stay focused on basketball and have a
great week.  
  
Q. Did you have a crowd of your people here?  
COREY FISHER: Yeah. Family. We got a lot of family here. Support and -- we got
a lot of alumni here. A lot of people take pride in Villanova basketball.  
  
Q. Mouphtaou, inside you were forced tonight; was that your mindset coming
into the game, getting every rebound?  
MOUPHTAOU YAROU: Coach always says he want me to -- he want me -- Coach wants
me to play hard. And we wanted to block the shot. That's what I was trying to
do.  
  
Q. Last year you had some health issues. How does it feel to be healthy now
and how much can you contribute all year if you're healthy?  
MOUPHTAOU YAROU: I feel great, actually. I just want to play hard. So I'm
looking forward to play against great players and a great team.  
  
Q. Was that frustrating for you last year to miss time?  
MOUPHTAOU YAROU: Yes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, gentlemen.  
JAY WRIGHT: Did you ever see a guy that big talk that sweet and nice? Did you
see that? That's what we're dealing with: The nicest, smartest big man in the
world.  
JAY WRIGHT: Good game for us. Just everything. Great to play in the Garden and
get away from home, play not really a road game, but not a home game against a
great team. You knew they were going to keep coming back at us. They are
really good. I respect them.  
Ben Howland is one of the top defensive coaches in the game. It was great for
us to see what he would do against us. He did a lot of good things. Second
half, like Joe said, they really did a good job of icing our ball screens in
the middle of the floor. And backing off our guards, making them shoot over
them, which is something we can watch film and we have to make adjustments. So
just a real good game for us. We still have room to improve too.  
  
Q. Did you think that maybe they should have drew the basket, that maybe
they should have looked more for the guys spotting up on the perimeter as UCLA
was sagging into the lane?  
JAY WRIGHT: Yes. In the second half a little bit more. They were having --
Maalik and Fish were having some success. I think that's something they can
learn from this. I definitely think they can. I would always rather them be
aggressive, though, and make mistakes on aggression rather than not looking
for the shot. Which I think we made some tonight. A little bit too aggressive
sometimes. But we'll learn from that.  
  
Q. Did you find out anything new about your team tonight?  
JAY WRIGHT: Mouph, 16 rebounds. We anticipated that when he came in last year.
He really struggled last year. You guys don't need to hear all the drama. Last
year was a brutal year for him. And now this is really his first year -- that
was like a red-shirt year. That's what we expect from him. He can be a force
inside. We never have a big guy that when he gets four fouls, we're trying to
get him back in the game. We have a bunch of little guys, just keep rotating
in.  
It's nice to have a big guy, you want to get him back in there. He was a great
presence in the paint.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you have some scouting left to do. What did you see from
Tennessee? What do you anticipate Friday?  
JAY WRIGHT: You know, they have a big athletic team. And kind of similar to
UCLA, I think. My assistants have watched. I have to be honest, that was the
first time I saw them this year was today. They've got big, long athletic
players. We got to coach Scotty Hopson this summer, and really nice kid and
very, very good player. He was on my team against the NBA guys. It was nice to
have him on my side. Going against him is going to be tough.  
I think a defensive team is similar to UCLA.  
  
Q. Jay, you have had some teams, you take a look at where this club is at
this point of the season, is it as far advanced as any of the team that you've
coached for this time of year?  
JAY WRIGHT: This team -- that's a good point. This team -- I think that's one
of the things we learned too, they're pretty mature. Having three seniors is
really big. For this time of the year they are pretty mature. And they can get
better too. But they're like a lot of our good teams, yeah.  
  
Q. How does having Fisher and Wayns make you more dangerous?  
JAY WRIGHT: As you can see there are times they drive the ball and they can be
a little overaggressive, as Joe was saying, he cleans it up with an offensive
rebound. They're really smaller guards. And we've always played with smaller
guards. To have somebody behind them that can block some shots, makes them --
we can play them more defensively. So he helps them defensively. He covers
offensively and he kind of cleans up around the basket for them.  
  
Q. Do you think opposing team gets a little surprised when they see Maalik
out on the floor driving by on the lane initially?  
JAY WRIGHT: Maalik Wayns? I don't know. Last year he had a pretty good year.
He was all-rookie BIG EAST. I think I'm more surprised with the big guy, to be
honest.  
  
Q. 15 at the half. Were you surprised you couldn't put them up sooner or
were you expecting UCLA to --  
JAY WRIGHT: I was more surprised we were up 15 at the half. We've coached
against them, I knew that team is not going to go away. They grinded it. They
did a good job. They stuck with their stuff. They never lost their
personality. That's a sign of Ben's teams. Great discipline, and they did a
really good job. That's why I feel good about this win. I feel good about our
team.  
  
Q. Jay, those of us who write in New York when the kids from the area come
back, play at the Garden, we like to hit that thing. Is that a real thing for
these guys? I know you guys play at the Garden all the time; is it still
unique, great, special, anything, or is that malarkey?  
JAY WRIGHT: I know for me one of our biggest concerns every time we play here
is it's the opponent and then it's our New York guys being in the Garden.
Because they're overexcited. They want to do well. It's home for them. It's
the Mecca. It's where they made their name. Some of them in high school -- I
remember seeing Corey Fisher playing in a high school game against Rice High
School that was unbelievable. I know they all think about it. They all do. We
wound up talking about it before. It's not about playing in the Garden; it's
about playing basketball. You hear them say that.  
It's a great challenge. It's a challenge for them. I was really happy for Fish
and (Corey) Stokes. I know coming back here was big for him too.  
THE MODERATOR: Two more questions, please.  
  
Q. Who is better right now, Corey Fisher or Kemba Walker?  
JAY WRIGHT: Great question. We got to coach Kemba in the summer. They are
similar. They have similar personalities too. I was surprised coaching Kem; he
reminded me of Corey. Great kid. Real nice kid. You think tough Bronx kid,
hard-headed. He's not. They're very close. Great kids.  
THE MODERATOR: Last question?  
JAY WRIGHT: Thanks, guys. Happy Thanksgiving.

reminded me of Corey. Great kid. Real nice kid. You think tough Bronx kid,
hard-headed. He's not. They're very close. Great kids.  
THE MODERATOR: Last question?  
JAY WRIGHT: Thanks, guys. Happy Thanksgiving.

# [MAUI INVITATIONAL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=MAUI+INVITATIONAL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## November 23, 2010

  

### [Justin Holiday](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20731)

### [Lorenzo Romar](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15641)

### [Isaiah Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19687)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Romar and Justin Holiday and Isaiah Thomas for
the press conference. Coach Romar, opening remarks.  
COACH ROMAR: We've got to give Kentucky a lot of credit. I thought they were
really disciplined offensively, and they did what was necessary to get the
ball to those that they wanted to get the ball to.  
Brandon Knight, obviously, had a very good offensive game for them. Terrence
Jones did a good job on the backboards. Harrellson did a really nice job for
them with 14 rebounds, seven of those on offensive glass. So you've got to
give them a lot of credit.  
They outrebounded us, and they were more disciplined than we were. And I think
in those two areas that made the difference in the outcome.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Lorenzo, I think both Alaska, and probably even the Kansas City
tournament, you felt sort of as learning or turning points that changed your
team the rest of the season and into the postseason. What might this one do
for you guys?  
COACH ROMAR: I think, again, my biggest fear was that we had played three ball
games where we scored averaging 105 points or whatever it was, and rarely did
we go deep into the shot clock to guard or offensively keep the basketball.  
My biggest fear was when that finally happened we wouldn't be able to adjust
quick enough. And something that even before we got here, we were working on
trying to get everyone to understand one day this is going to happen. And
we're going to have to be able to go deep into the shot clock.  
And I think that got us tonight. I think we'll do a better job as a result of
it, though. Against a team like Kentucky, a team we're going to play tomorrow
in this tournament, you're going to find all your weaknesses. You're going to
see where they are, all your warts.  
And I think our guys understand that. I think our guys understand that. As far
as the effort on the backboards, I mean, that's all; we've just got to do a
better job on it.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, what factors played into that, do you think, where you didn't
have that up and down 107 points a game kind of game?  
COACH ROMAR: They only had 15 turnovers so we weren't able to just impose our
will on them defensively. Then when we did get them to miss they were able to
get an offensive rebound sometimes and put it back in there.  
They shot 17 percent from the 3 in under 40 percent from the floor. So we did
okay defensively. But without us getting them to turn the basketball over, we
didn't get as many run-outs. And there were times we did get run-outs where we
didn't convert.  
We either turned it over ourselves or missed the layup. So we just missed out
on some opportunities that we had over there that we didn't convert.  
  
Q. Coach, it was with about six and a half minutes to play, there was a 4.7
earthquake off of South Maui, did you notice it at all?  
COACH ROMAR: No.  
  
Q. The coach or the players?  
JUSTIN HOLIDAY:  
ISAIAH THOMAS: I did. I felt the ground shaking and the rim moving, I didn't
know if it was an earthquake.  
COACH ROMAR: I did.  
ISAIAH THOMAS: The rim was moving like the hoop was moving.  
  
Q. Harrellson falling.  
COACH ROMAR: Seemed like sometimes the rim was moving anyway, we couldn't make
shots.  
ISAIAH THOMAS: I felt it.  
  
Q. Isaiah, could you talk about Brandon Knight and the way he played against
you and what kind of player he is?  
ISAIAH THOMAS: He's a solid player. I mean, he got it going for him early,
even though he was in foul trouble. But he's a good player. I've played
against him before in high school, so...he played a good game.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, can you explain what was going on on the technical against Venoy
and technical on the guy from Kentucky, what was going on?  
COACH ROMAR: They said it was dead ball technical. There was a little contact
right as we were calling timeout, that happened, and that's why they awarded
them the free throws.  
I don't remember which one you're talking about. Yeah, I don't want to go into
the explanation. I was given an explanation, but never mind.  
  
Q. Justin, could you talk a little bit about -- just the feel? It sounded
like a loud gym. Did it feel like sort of more like an NCAA Tournament than a
holiday tournament? And was there anything on the court about the whole
Terrence Jones that we talked about so much about in advance?  
JUSTIN HOLIDAY: It's what we look to play for, to have a big crowd like that.
It's the type of NCAA Tournament feel. But as far as anything going on between
Terrence, no. It was to win a game; it didn't matter who was in front of us,
all we wanted to do was win.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, you guys obviously shot the lights out yesterday and then
struggle from 3 tonight. What, were the looks up? Law of averages or something
else there?  
COACH ROMAR: Well, we didn't get nearly as many 3s up as we had done
previously. And I hadn't totally bought into where we were going to be a team
that shoots 33 pointers every game. And that was a school record. So obviously
that's not going to happen every game.  
I think we talked more to our team about what happens when those 3s don't go
down. Like tonight. That's where we have to improve as a team. But they did a
good job of trying to take the 3 away also.  
I mean, there weren't a whole lot of looks. Couldn't have been, but we just
didn't want to force up a 3.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about starting Justin on Terrence Jones
and kind of your philosophy on what you wanted to do with Terrence tonight?  
COACH ROMAR: Terrence really exploits the mismatches he has in a lot of games
because the way they're playing with them being able to dribble the ball
outside with him, he'll have a bigger guy on him, and it's been difficult for
teams to contain him on the drive.  
And we felt if Justin started on him he'd do a better job of keeping him from
just driving. And I thought Justin did a really good job of that. I thought as
a team we did a pretty good job of that.  
Terrence is a good basketball player, and he got 17 rebounds. Just he found a
way to contribute to his team.  
  
Q. Lorenzo, I just wonder, I don't mean this derogatory, but was Harrellson
something of a surprise, a guy that you really hadn't done as much as he did
tonight?  
COACH ROMAR: Harrellson took advantage of the opportunities of not being boxed
out. Some don't. Some don't get boxed out and they don't know how to go get
the ball. Well, he took advantage of it. And he hit a big 3 for them, I
thought. But aside from that, they got in the paint with dribble penetration.  
We come over and help. That left him free because we didn't rotate well enough
to box him out. That left him free on the backboards a lot of times, but he
did, he played a good game.  
It wasn't a situation where they were throwing the ball to him on the block
and we couldn't stop him, you know? He just put himself in the right place at
the right time and took advantage, again, of some of our defensive miscues.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [MAUI INVITATIONAL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=MAUI+INVITATIONAL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## November 23, 2010

  

### [John Calipari](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13700)

### [Josh Harrellson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21503)

### [Brandon Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21502)

  
_LAHAINA, HAWAII_  
  
MODERATOR: Coach Calipari, opening remarks.  
COACH CALIPARI: For us, there's nothing better, especially with a young team
to shoot 39 percent, 17 percent from the foul line, have double the turnovers
than assists and still win a game. It's lovely. It's lovely.  
And so we played how we had to play with foul trouble in the first half, which
I'm stunned we were down 1. And guys fought like crazy, and I thought we had
some great individual performances, yet our team is not there yet.  
We got a little selfish today. Defensively at the end, it was like lay up, lay
up, and foul. We left the huddle don't foul, we fouled. That's what happens
with young guys.  
But what I did like we made the four free throws we had to to finish the game.
Those balls went down, and that means we have a will to win, and it's
beginning to happen.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. How much did you guys want to make them get into some half court and not
let them get going up and down; and secondly could you talk about what Josh
gave you on the boards?  
COACH CALIPARI: Let me tell you, it wasn't just what he did on the boards, it
was what he did in pick-and-roll defense, because everybody thinks that's our
Achilles heel. And he proved today that it is not our Achilles heel. And the
only guys getting beat were our guards who weren't staying connected and
didn't get back to their man after the ball screen.  
But the way he rebounded the ball and played, Eloy came in and did pretty
well, but Eloy didn't finish. We have to get Eloy in the kind of physical
condition so he's mentally tougher like Josh. How about the 3 he made? I'll be
honest with you, he can shoot 3s probably as well as we've got anybody on the
team.  
He would be one that if we needed a 3 I would have no problem throwing it to
him because they won't guard him because they don't think he can shoot it. He
can really shoot it.  
He had a great effort. And, like I say, he was close to a double-double. And
let me say this, against a top 10 team. He was almost a double-double. That's
a big deal.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the atmosphere of the game and then to the players
there was an earthquake in the second half with about six or eight minutes to
go, did you notice it?  
COACH CALIPARI: There was an earthquake? What was it on the Richter scale?  
  
Q. 4.7.  
COACH CALIPARI: That's nothing. I thought you were going to tell me it was a
7, the building would have shook a little bit.  
What did you ask me? I have no idea what you asked.  
  
Q. Asked you about the atmosphere.  
COACH CALIPARI: It was great. The Kentucky fans are -- what happens at the
hotel, I gotta put my head down and run to my room, but short of that, it's
great for these guys. I mean, they know they're not only playing for each
other, there's a lot of people that take unbelievable pride and are invested
in this program.  
And they're emotionally invested and they're from all over the country. The
fans here that are Kentucky fans, I'm going to guess 30 percent of them are
from Kentucky. And the rest are from other places around the country. And
they're here watching this. And I betcha I'm accurate.  
  
Q. Brandon, you had a tough second half yesterday, how important was it for
you to bounce back and play the way you did today, what did that mean to
you?  
BRANDON KNIGHT: I guess it was important as far as confidence but the main
thing was trying to do whatever it took to get a win today. We knew they were
a great team coming in. Averaging over 100 points scoring, but we just tried
to do our best to get a win.  
So really just about the team, just trying to make sure we got going as a
unit?  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday in the press conference you said that after Terrence
Jones had a big offensive game you wanted to see how he handled some
adversity, how he handled the physicality that was coming. What do you say now
after watching that game?  
COACH CALIPARI: He wasn't bad. Now, the last three minutes, he went haywire. I
don't know where he went. I had to pull him out one time and told him to go
back in. And he kind of had that glazed look like -- then I was wondering do
you not think we can win this? What's wrong with you? And it was a typical,
maybe he's really winded, maybe he was -- I don't know. But I'll say this:
There were a bunch of big plays that he came up with. A bunch of second-effort
rebounds. The kid gets 16 rebounds and 17 points and played pretty good four
blocks again.  
I mean, here's what happened the first half: We were so depleted that we were
just throwing him the ball. I know you were watching the game. We just said
throw it to him here, throw it to him there and Terrence, this is all we can
do.  
We ran no offense. There was nothing, because we had guys that didn't know the
offense. We had guys that hadn't played this year out there.  
That's why I said I was just happy we were in the game at halftime. But he was
good.  
  
Q. Josh, you made a lob pass, I think it was to Terrence, for a dunk early
in the second half. And you had a good second half, it seemed. A play like
that get you going, do you think? Or how do you account for the productivity
there in the second half?  
JOSH HARRELLSON: It's always there to look to Terrence, but that time he just
said throw it one time I'm going to go get it I promise you I'm going to go
get it. I had confidence in him, and I know he can jump and I know how
athletic he is. I threw it to the rim and he got it. He promised me he would
do it. And he came through and so I'll look for it more?  
  
Q. How about the rebound?  
JOSH HARRELLSON: The thing I'm more happy about is 34 minutes playing. I mean,
last year I couldn't play 10 minutes a game without anything. But I mean just
playing 34 minutes and coming through for my team when they needed me most and
just coming out with a victory, that's more than 14 rebounds a game.  
But I mean, I just went in and battled as hard as I could the whole time and
gave my heart?  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the beginning of the game and getting out to
the 12-point lead and --  
COACH CALIPARI: That was the difference in the game, as you know, because that
gave us a gap that we needed. So when we had foul trouble, it was a one-point
game instead of 12 -- down 12.  
And Washington's one of those teams, if you're down 12, that rim is like this
big, and they start shooting 3s and all of a sudden you're down 25 before you
can turn around.  
And I had to call a timeout in the first 30 seconds of the game. It's 4
nothing and 2 things that we had talked about that we weren't going to do we
did. I'm like wait a minute, whoa. And we had a lob play out of the timeout
and then came back from there.  
But the beginning of the game, we knew this was going to be you know two
teams, talented teams, going at one another. And you could not back down. If
they push, you push back. You cannot back down. Let them know this is going to
be a hard game. This is not going to be up running through somebody.  
And that's all we were talking about. They were so well coached. They know
where to go with it. They made the plays. Isaiah, he missed some shots, but he
made the plays at the end to keep them in it and give them a chance to win.  
And we know this, in transition, they may be the best team in the country. I
know for the fact in the Pac-10 the last ten years they're the best offensive
rebounding team maybe eight years in a row, they're it. And you better keep
them off the glass and you better get back in transition.  
And now they've got post play. They've got 3-point shooters, they've got two
point guards they're like Noah's Ark, they've got a little bit of everything.
They're going to be fine and we were fortunate to be honest with you to get
where we were and sneak out. We made free throws. That's what got it.  
  
Q. Josh, can you talk about your last month, what it's been like from where
you were to now and what this game sort of, the 34 minutes, et cetera.  
JOSH HARRELLSON: It feels like I'm a totally different person all around. I'm
more confident going in the game. I know I can be there for my teammates when
they need me. I don't have to come out every two trips down the floor I can
actually stay in and play. I feel more energetic and more athletic out there.  
  
Q. Cal and Josh, after 34 minutes and 14 rebounds, can you tweet again?  
COACH CALIPARI: He'll be running an hour a day before practice.  
  
Q. Coach, would you comment on Connecticut, what you see from them, what you
expect from the matchup tomorrow?  
COACH CALIPARI: With Connecticut? I'm going to be honest with you. I know
Kimba and I told Jim after the game, I looked at Kimba and I said he's really
good. When I was -- I wasn't sure. And big mistake. And I told Kimba, when we
played against him in New York, normally I can see something and I say, yes,
let's go with it, this is the guy. And I missed it in him. I told him last
year in the warm-up, I said I missed on you. No question I missed on you.  
But they also Roscoe is playing well as a freshman. Surprisingly well. Not
that I didn't think he was any good. But it's hard for these guys as freshmen
to play well. They've got other athletes and Jim's doing great stuff in pick-
and-roll. I told him after the game what he's doing he's putting Kimba in the
best position Kimba can be in to run their team. That's what he's doing. He
can run all different kind of things but that's why he's a Hall of Fame coach
he's saying I got Kimba my best player what position do I put him in to help
him so he can win games for us. That's what he's doing. He's putting them in
pick-and-rolls, putting them into isolations and baseline to run them off
screens. Kimba's really good. But they also have size. They're big. They're
long. They're good. That was a great game today. I sat there and just -- the
only thing I didn't want was overtime. But I was watching it upstairs and I'm
like, wow, back and forth, making free throws, and then Kimba's shot that went
in. I'm like, geez, this guy -- it will be a hard game for us. Really hard
game.  
But you know what, for us at this point we're in the championship. We're going
to get some rest tonight. I may wait until tomorrow to even talk about
Connecticut, just based on the fact that these guys gotta be exhausted. And
again if I watch tape and I get panicked I'll probably call them about 9:00
and say let's get in here and watch some tape.  
But I'll watch our game first, then I'll watch some Connecticut tape tonight.  
  
Q. Cal, what caused you to pass on Kimba? Was it his size or something
else?  
COACH CALIPARI: It's not that I passed on him. It wasn't like Kimba said I've
come to -- where was I then? I must have been in Memphis. Where was I with the
Nets. I have no idea where I was. But I think what I did was we were
recruiting a bunch of guys then. And was it John Wall's year or Eric Bledsoe?
The year before? Who did we take, Tyreek? I think we got Tyreek, who is pretty
good, too. He ain't bad. But I went specifically to look at him because I like
his high school coach, think he's a great guile. I went and looked at him and
I said he's good. He was playing in a slippery gym in Pittsburgh somewhere, I
believe.  
So it's not that I passed on him. I think Jim did a great job recruiting him,
but it was like I didn't realize how good he really was. And everybody -- his
coach told me you have no idea how good this kid is.  
Like I said, I made a mistake on that one. No question. He's terrific. And let
me tell you what was great for me. I'm up in that locker room and Connecticut
comes up, I can't tell you how excited that team was. And it made me smile.
That's what this is about for these kids. It's not about me and the coach,
it's about these kids.  
Those guys were up there, I'm telling you they were doing back flips in that
locker room. And they were so jacked up and when Kimba walked in, because he
walked in late, they exploded like it was like -- and it made me smile and I
said this is why we do what we do. And I'm thinking ain't no way we're going
to feel like that after this game we've got to play.  
But obviously, guess what, our locker room was exactly the same way. I mean,
these guys were hooting and hollering and hugging. And we're young. They're
young. It's the same deal, trying to figure out how we gotta play. Anyway, it
should be fun tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MIAMI HEAT MEDIA
CONFERENCE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=MIAMI+HEAT+MEDIA+CONFERENCE)

  

## July 9, 2010

  

### [Pat Riley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15590)

### [Erik Spoelstra](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21156)

  
PAT RILEY: This is about the three of them. This is about Coach. Micky has
created an environment, a platform in which we can really go out and try to
flourish. I think the one thing we tried to get across as an organization,
when we met with all of the free agents, is I introduced Andy and Nick, Micky,
I didn't introduce myself. Coach and Alonzo was there. And I spoke about how
long they've been with us and what we're about.  
And everybody in this organization, Andy started as an intern in the PR
department. He started in the video room. Zo was the anchor. He's the anchor
and he's the image of what The Heat are about. He's a warrior. He's got a
great heart. And he extends beyond that into the community. Micky has simply
been an incredible owner for all of us.  
It's his attention, I think, to detail and the discipline. After all, he does
have a day job and it's a pretty successful business. And he brings that into
the culture. Nick Arison, when I came here in 1995, he was 14 years old. And
he was not the team attendant. He was basically running the whole show down in
the locker room. He's heard more speeches by me that he reminds me of on a
regular basis that he wants to forget.  
And I think he understood that this is a group. This is a group. This really
is stability and it's about a family. So I think that more than anything else
is what I thought about when I walked out there tonight.  
  
Q. Showing LeBron the rings, your championship rings?  
PAT RILEY: I don't know. I just -- they spoke -- the one thing that rang out
about all the free agents -- 150 free agents. On my board in my office there
are 150 green templates, names, which mean unrestricted.  
And just about every great player who became a free agent said I want to win.
That's all they say. I just wanted to win, for whatever reason, they just
wanted to win. And I know what it takes to win. And what it takes to win is it
takes really talented players who are tough and will trust one another. And I
think we have found three guys who are very, very talented and very tough and
they're going to trust one another.  
And to me that's what it's all about. So the ring was just a symbol of what
we're all going to try to chase.  
  
Q. I know both you guys really wanted things to work out with Michael
Beasley. Was it just absolutely necessary that he had to be moved in order to
bring these guys in?  
PAT RILEY: Michael -- it's a personal thing. He's the No. 2 pick in the Draft.
He came in very young. He came in a situation where he didn't start the first
year and averaged 15 points a game, seven rebounds, and we won 43 games and
made the Playoffs.  
Last year, he started for us. Udonis showed just how willing he was to
sacrifice. And Michael averaged 14 points and seven rebounds in about 28
minutes. We didn't want to do that. We don't want to do it. It's in process,
and we feel like he's a young, talented kid who has a long career ahead of
him. But with this particular move, we felt that in order to bring in other
complementary players, that we had to probably go in that direction.  
There's not been anything completed yet. But I think right now we're in that
kind of situation. But whatever happens, I would hate two or three years from
now -- and Micky and I have talked about this -- that if in fact something
like that were to happen with one of our young guys, I know I'm going to
probably regret it when he gets 28 and 19 on us one night. He's really a
gifted kid.  
  
Q. Secondly, all three players said that you guys were adamant about the
fact that, Pat, that Erik was going to coach this team. Why did you guys
express it that aggressively and make it absolutely clear to the free
agents?  
PAT RILEY: I'm just going to set that straight. I had one free agent ask me:
You're not going to coach this team, right? So we don't want you to coach this
team. No, I say that kiddingly. But that's not an issue.  
I made that comment a long time ago. And it was made as a comment as more of a
defensive thing because I keep getting challenged about the fact that I can
never coach again. For some reason, I can't coach again wherever it is, on
Mars, wherever it is.  
But Erik Spoelstra is the head coach of this team. And he's been with this
organization for a long time. He's done a great, great job. And he's going to
coach this team. I'm not going to coach this team. They don't want me to coach
the team. That's just the way it is.  
  
Q. Erik, even though this has been whispered about for days, for weeks, for
months, couple of years, it seems like, when this really became finalized,
when it became crystallized, concrete, was there any part of you that said: I
can't believe Pat, Micky, Nick, the organization pulled this off? Is there any
part of you that really can't believe from where you were two years ago, you
have these three guys to lead your team next year?  
ERIK SPOELSTRA: I'll say this: The plan has been there for a couple of years.
We all knew about the plan. Probably more than anything, the single thing I've
learned from Pat, working for him for 15 years, is to think big. Really.  
I mean, every single conversation. It doesn't even have to be about
basketball. We could be talking about redoing a kitchen or something, and
he'll turn it into making it a two-level state-of-the-art something that's not
around for 20 years, that type of thing.  
But he does think big. And he gets you to believe. He really does. So this is
something that's been in the makings for a couple of years. He's been talking
about the Triple Play. We used to laugh and sometimes our minds would wander.
You start to get excited about it.  
But when we actually got to visit in front of these players, you know, you
could see it. And the players started to believe. And I think each one of
these guys mentioned it. It's real.  
It starts from the top with Micky Arison and the Arison family, of building a
true family atmosphere and Pat making this a first-class organization,
something that we all feel a lot of pride working here. And something that
carries over. And the players really could see that in our meetings.  
  
Q. You famously told us the story, you're on vacation, you're out in the
water and all of a sudden you get an idea and start paddling back in to get
the idea down. Has that process started yet for you?  
ERIK SPOELSTRA: Yes, it has. Obviously, as soon as LeBron mentioned where he
was going, that was the final piece. And we'd been already scheming some
things in the office quite a bit on the whiteboard. It's going to be an
exciting opportunity for this franchise.  
It's not just the three of them. It really is the structure of this franchise.
And we think this is going to be a desirable place for people to come join us.
And we're not running away from the expectations. This was a bold night. Pat,
you know, refers to me a lot of times as new school/old school. The philosophy
is part of my fabric.  
So I get this. I got caught up in it. I think it's exciting. But eventually,
you know, we're going to have to get to the game plan. If I had it my way, I
would like to get these guys in practice jerseys and get up there and practice
today. But it will be about the sweat. It will be about the work. We know
where we're going, what the destination is. But it will be about the process
first.  
  
Q. Even though you've been thinking about it for a couple of years, and like
Alonzo said, you guys have been confident it would happen for a while now,
could you take me through as much as detail as you can recall, just from the
time you called Dwyane that morning of July 1st through the meetings, through
the final announcements of their intentions and how each moment or each time
your emotions kind of wavered or went through that whole process?  
PAT RILEY: It was a tough week. 12:01.1, dial. And he picked up. He said,
that's pretty quick, Coach. And he can still refer to me as that. The next
call went to Udonis and went to other free agents that are on this team. Then
finally I got in touch with Chris. These were people that we wanted to reach
out to at that particular time and show our interest.  
We were about ready to go into meetings in Los Angeles. So Dwyane, I think,
has given us something that we at times have taken for granted. And I've seen
that it was a heavy load. I mean, one-man dominant teams that are constantly
banging their head against the wall to try to do whatever they can to do to
win doesn't mean that he doesn't have enough around him. He has enough around
him. But you can't win in this league anymore really big with one guy. I don't
care how great they are. I think LeBron proves it. I think Chris proves it.  
There are these three players, collective 21 years, one championship with this
kind of talent. So he was desperate. I mean, Dwyane's desperate to win. And
we're just glad that he's back. And we're glad that he actually was in a
position where he could draw Chris, and then the final thing was above and
beyond. While we can dream of those things, we never expect those things to
happen.  
So it's a reality. And I think Dwyane had a lot to do with it. And I think
they respected him enough to come down here.  
  
Q. Pat, Dwyane talked about the desire to have Udonis back. Where do you
stand with Udonis?  
PAT RILEY: We're very, very active in conversations with him. Until probably
Monday or Tuesday, you know, I have a very good feeling that we're going to be
able to do something to have UD consider. He deserves -- again, he's like Zo.
He's part of being an anchor here. So we'll do everything we can.  
And when the troops went up to his house for his birthday in "We want you
back" T-shirts, I have one in my office to remind me, that I think there might
be some good news in the beginning of the week about UD.  
  
Q. It's pretty well documented that some of these meetings you were seen
pacing nervously, even last night, this morning on the tarmac, if you will,
seemed like even then, with all this decided, you still seemed
(indiscernible). Is the overriding emotion for you relief? What is it?  
PAT RILEY: Tim got a telephone call from Andy. And Andy finally -- what time
is it? It's 11:20. It was about 11:10. He said the deals are done. And we call
it landing the plane. He said the deals are done. They're finished.
Transactions have been completed. They've been through the League office.  
And, again, I cannot thank Andy Elisburg enough. This doesn't get done without
him. And, I mean, he's like a left hand and a right hand but he's your brain.
But that was what it's all about. You want to make sure that these deals are
done and that they're into the League and they're okayed and everybody is
healthy.  
So that's when I felt really good about these three guys. Now we've got to
move on to Sunday and Monday.  
  
Q. Pat, the feeling of accomplishment when you pull something like this off,
is there any comparison at all to the feeling you would have gotten as a coach
when you win a championship?  
PAT RILEY: This was a process that when Micky and I sat down and talked about
two years ago when we had to make a major move with the franchise and we
traded Shaquille O'Neal. I mean, at that particular time we felt with Dwyane's
injuries and all the things that were going on with the franchise that we were
going to probably rebuild.  
That was the time to think about it. And there was no doubt that we started to
look at, well, 2010. And we wanted to be able to create a platform and free up
enough space to be a player in '10. That was two and a half years ago.  
So it's been that kind of process and that thinking since that time. And we
disciplined ourselves as much as we could not to take any contracts. I mean,
there are things that could have interrupted this process. We were in active
trades at the trading deadline two years in a row that we wanted to bring
players and surround Dwyane and maybe sometimes those trades didn't go
through. And I'm glad now that they didn't, because we possibly couldn't have
been able to do this. We were actively always trying to improve the team but
really had our eye on 2010 to be a player.  
And so to me it was sort of a work in progress all the time.  
  
Q. You had Showtime, Magic and Kareem and Worthy. When you visualize these
three players that you've got now in this franchise, how good can they be, as
three players altogether?  
PAT RILEY: We were talking before we went in and had our meeting with LeBron.
And we were talking about how do you compare the possibility of being able to
do what we could do, which is we had the ability, we had the ability as a team
to take in three players, two players plus two, maybe one plus three or four.
We had enough room to be able to take in players.  
So we started to compare -- LeBron would be Magic and Dwyane would be Kobe and
that Chris would be Kevin Garnett. We started to think about in those terms
about the people who we were talking to. So he actually liked that
conversation we had when we were talking about Magic with LeBron. He sort of
lit up and he said that would be great if I didn't have to score, that he
could be maybe the first guy since Oscar Robertson to be a triple-double guy.  
But he also said to us his goal was to be the Defensive Player of the Year. So
they're arguing about that now. It's going to be interesting to see D-Wade and
these guys in practice. So their heads are in the right place. And they have a
great respect for that history of those kinds of players you're talking about.  
  
Q. Pat, even with you guys, with those guys taking less money, it would seem
that you're approaching the salary cap. How confident are you that there is
going to be enough money left to get some of these last couple of players that
you really want?  
PAT RILEY: I think, I mean, from a room standpoint, I think we're still going
to be within range to be able to negotiate with some players. So that process
over the next two days will take care of itself.  
  
Q. Talk about the -- give us a picture of what you did with the rings. Did
you just lay them out? Did you have them on your hands?  
PAT RILEY: It's like a weapon.  
ERIK SPOELSTRA: We were wondering what it was. He put the bag, put a piece of
paper over the bag. What is that, jingle bells?  
PAT RILEY: Habit of duplicating them. So they've always said that I was a man
that had some savoir faire. It's up to you to judge.  
But I try to match up, like my wife, my jewelry and my belt buckle and
whatever it is. So sometimes you have to have a sterling silver ring and
sometimes you have to have a gold ring. It wasn't my idea. It was more my
wife's than anything else.  
So over the years they multiply by duplicating them, and so -- they're in a
bag in my desk. And now I'm going to lock them up and put them in a safety
deposit box.  
Chris still has one that I gave him. Don't lose it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [MIAMI HEAT MEDIA
CONFERENCE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=MIAMI+HEAT+MEDIA+CONFERENCE)

  

## July 9, 2010

  

### [Chris Bosh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14442)

### [LeBron James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13888)

### [Dwyane Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13885)

  
THE MODERATOR: It's Dwyane Wade's house, but it's now also LeBron James'
kingdom. LeBron, on behalf of all South Florida, thank you. Welcome. How does
it feel wearing a Heat uniform?  
LEBRON JAMES: Wow. I mean, it feels right. It feels right. And to be in this
position to wear this Heat uniform every single night, we're going to make the
world know, not just this league, we're going to make the world know that The
Heat is back.  
THE MODERATOR: LeBron, you met with six teams. They all made very professional
presentations to you. What stood out about The Heat's visit with you when you
met with The Heat brass?  
LEBRON JAMES: I think Pat and Micky, Nick Arison, those guys, everyone who
came up, they were stand-up guys. The organization is a close-knit group. It's
all about family, and that's what I'm all about. When they said we had the
possibility of all of us joining together also, I couldn't turn that down.  
THE MODERATOR: So it's Wade's house, LeBron's kingdom, and Bosh's pit, baby.
Visitors beware. Visitors beware. Enter at your own risk. Chris, in 2008, the
three of you were on the United States Olympic team in Beijing and on your way
to gold. And this is a solid gold trio, baby. On your way to gold, you guys
began to dream about some day playing together. A few days ago you thought it
might be pie in the sky. That pie tastes pretty good right now.  
CHRIS BOSH: It's great.  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to Miami, Chris.  
CHRIS BOSH: Thank you.  
THE MODERATOR: What do you want to tell these people?  
CHRIS BOSH: Well, I'm not going to lie to you. When I first heard the
possibility of all three of us playing together, I really had to go home and
think about it. I said there's no way. Of course it sounds nice, but I'm not
sure it's going to happen.  
The days and months -- not the days, the months, but the months passed by and
me and Dwyane, we wanted to come here, and then LeBron wanted to come. I mean,
let's get it done, man. Let's get this thing done.  
THE MODERATOR: I want to ask you two a question first. Chris, first of all,
what turned you on to coming down here. What was your presentation like from
the Miami Heat? What stood out to you?  
CHRIS BOSH: Like LeBron said, it's about family here and the organization. And
every time I hear the Miami Heat, I hear first-class. That's all I hear from
everybody.  
And I was telling my friends, you know, this is a world class organization and
a world class city and a world class arena. And we're going to bring some
world class basketball to this arena with these guys right here.  
THE MODERATOR: Jose has a question for you, Chris.  
JOSE PAÑEDA: Chris, talking about world class. You might have been watching
the World Cup. You see the passion. But there's no more passion than this
Latin Hispanic city of Miami. (Spanish). We do everything here with salsa,
with merengue and with some serious passion. Now, Dwyane, Dwyane might have
told you a little bit about it here. He knows a few words in Spanish. I know I
taught him a few. LeBron, I don't know about you, we'll work on you. Don't
worry, we'll get it. But I hear -- I hear -- (Spanish).  
CHRIS BOSH: Si.  
JOSE PAÑEDA: For Latin fans, and they are numerous out here, why don't you
give them some taste of your Spanish. (Spanish).  
CHRIS BOSH: (Spanish).  
JOSE PAÑEDA: (Spanish).  
CHRIS BOSH: (Spanish).  
THE MODERATOR: You know, we know South Florida's Hispanic community loves the
Three Kings parade. It just started. I want to go back to Dwyane and LeBron
for a moment. Guys, you've had some of the greatest match-ups individually in
NBA history. It's been show-stopping every time you two step on the floor.
Tell these fans your thoughts about wearing your Superman capes for the same
team. What's it going to be like, Dwyane?  
DWYANE WADE: You know, I look forward to day one, to every matchup against
LeBron. And now I guess I'm going to have to look forward to every practice
against LeBron. Because it's going to be amazing to be on the court, to know
that connection that we have. Not only will we be playing against each other,
but when we have played together, it's going to be there. It's just a look.
And you know it's time to turn it on. So I feel sorry for whoever gotta guard
both of us.  
THE MODERATOR: There is not enough kryptonite out there; there is not. LeBron,
what is this going to be like?  
LEBRON JAMES: I mean, just like D-Wade just said, we're going to challenge
each other in practice. And the way we're going to challenge each other to get
better in practice, once the game starts, I mean, it's going to be easy.  
I mean, with me and D-Wade running a wing, Pat could come back and play like
he was back in his Kentucky days. Just throw it up there, we're going to get
it.  
THE MODERATOR: We know you guys are going to enjoy the sun and the fun and all
the spoils of South Florida. But we also know you Three Kings came down here
to win championships, not one. Championships.  
LEBRON JAMES: Not two.  
THE MODERATOR: Tell us about that.  
LEBRON JAMES: Not two, not three, not four, not five, not six, not seven. Hey,
and when I say that -- when I say that, I really believe it. I'm not just up
here blowing smoke at none of these fans, because that's not what I'm about.
I'm about business. And we believe we can win multiple championships if we
take care of business and do it the right way.  
THE MODERATOR: I know you three guys are anxiously awaiting to see how the
rest of this team is put together. What's important to you three guys as the
rest of this team now will be assembled around the three of you? Dwyane, why
don't you start.  
DWYANE WADE: Sacrifice. This team right here is going to be built on sacrifice
from all of us. And that's not just from a money standpoint. That's not just
from a shot standpoint. That's everything about this. We're about business.  
And we're going to have fun. Yeah, it's going to be Hollywood down here. Yeah.
That's what they say, yeah. But when we step on the courts, it's going to be
about business, and everyone who wants to be a part of this organization is
going to have to make that sacrifice.  
See, he just sacrificed his arm. Way to go.  
THE MODERATOR: LeBron, we know you'll do everything humanly possible to win a
championship here in Miami.  
LEBRON JAMES: Absolutely. That's the only reason I'm here, man. I'm here to
bring another championship, to bring that feeling you all had a few years ago,
when y'all was able to win that championship. So me and C.B., we're here to
make that feeling come back.  
THE MODERATOR: Chris Bosh, you've got to feel like the luckiest big man in the
world right now.  
CHRIS BOSH: Oh, yeah. I mean, for one I get to -- when I get a rebound, I got
LeBron on my left I can outlet to, and I have D-Wade on my right. Like a video
game. I don't know. I mean, that's all I gotta say.  
Yeah, I'm lucky. I'm lucky. And you know what, everybody's been really
receptive here. Thank you for coming out on such short notice, like you said
before. This is amazing. This is amazing.  
THE MODERATOR: You know what, Chris, we're all lucky. We are all lucky. Ladies
and gentlemen, this is the first time in our beautiful 22-year history of the
Miami Heat that you have seen this. It's unprecedented. It's out of this
world. Let's hear it, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, your Miami Heat.

# [MIAMI HEAT MEDIA
CONFERENCE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=MIAMI+HEAT+MEDIA+CONFERENCE)

  

## July 9, 2010

  

### [Chris Bosh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14442)

### [LeBron James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13888)

### [Dwyane Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13885)

  
THE MODERATOR: As you see, LeBron James, Dwyane Wade, Chris Bosh, this is
going to be your opportunity to ask them questions. If you have a question,
please raise your hand and we'll send a mic.  
  
Q. LeBron, about 24 hours ago you were sitting in Connecticut. And you know
what the reaction was in Cleveland, what your former owner, his reaction to
your decision. And then you come to Miami and you have this show tonight. Can
you just sort of take us through emotionally what these 24 hours have been
like for you?  
LEBRON JAMES: It's been the process -- the process that I believe that I
wanted to go through when I did my short-term deal a few years ago. And it's
been emotionally draining at times.  
It's been exciting. It's been nerve-racking. I've been scared at times. I've
been afraid. But at the same time I've accepted the challenge to move on. And
I feel great. I feel great now and the fans and this organization has put me
back in a family-oriented place where I've always been.  
  
Q. LeBron, what would you like to say directly in response to what Gilbert
put out last night, and what do you have to say to the fans in Northeast Ohio
that you left behind?  
LEBRON JAMES: First off, I don't have a reaction to what Dan said. You know,
when things hit the fan you see guys' true colors. And I understand that. I
wish that organization the best of luck.  
I wish those fans the best of luck, because I still do love those fans, no
matter where I put myself for the rest of my life. I still got a lot of
friends on that team. And I wish them the best of luck.  
But as far as me responding to what Dan has to say, I don't have a reaction,
because at the end of the day Dan's comments will not stop me and my family
from sleeping at night. It just won't do it. It's only just going to make us
powerful, more powerful.  
  
Q. Now that everything is settled, you guys are all here. Can you go ahead
and end the madness and explain when this partnership really was formed and
how many meetings you all had together and dispel some of the rumors and all
that kind of stuff?  
LEBRON JAMES: I can take it. The partnership was formed, I think it was June
25th of 2003, I think, or around -- it was one of those days, the day of the
Draft. That was the day when this partnership was formed.  
No one even knew. We didn't know. But we was all drafted 1, 4 and 5. And then
once again, being a part of the same Olympic team. Once again, we was a part
of a team but didn't know this would happen. But we was forming then.  
Losing in the world championship, and then winning a gold medal, once again,
another opportunity where we were together but didn't know we would be
together like this.  
As far as the rumors and allegations about us having a meeting in Miami and us
having meetings on Mars and all these other places, that stuff was all rumors.
We talk. We're friends. We talk throughout the year all year long about our
lives, about our seasons, how they're going.  
But we followed the process just like everybody did, after that July 1st date.
I hate to speak for all of us, but we're here now. And we're here for a long
time.  
  
Q. LeBron, this question is for you. What did Pat Riley say to you during
that visit that really stuck out with you? And the reports that he brought
championship rings, if he did, what did you think?  
LEBRON JAMES: I think from a basketball standpoint, Pat threw out the
possibility of us teaming up together. That was great. The possibility of us
All-Stars, us superstars uniting to become one, that was great. But that
wasn't the best thing about it.  
As good as Dwyane Wade is and as good as Chris Bosh and as good as I am
individually, that wasn't even the best part of the meeting. The best part of
the meeting was the whole family thing, how we are a close-knit family.  
We do everything as a family. We win. We lose. Blood, sweat and tears, all
that as a family. And that's what I've always been a part of my whole life.
That's always, since I was a kid, what I always seeked for. And when I heard
that from Pat and from Micky, it was -- that was kind of like the icing on the
cake for me.  
And the rings was pretty cool. (Laughter) I need a few of those.  
  
Q. I didn't go to Saint Bs, by the way, I went to Archbishop Hogan?  
LEBRON JAMES: I hate Archbishop Hogan. They're a rival. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Dwyane and Chris, you guys, since the July 1st part of this, when it was
all legal to talk technically, you guys have obviously -- you share the same
agent. You've had conversations, and you guys were obviously technically the
first two to commit here again. So take us through, if you can, the detail of
your guys' conversation, the wave of it went through, hey, let's try to play
together, maybe we can't play together maybe we can play together, and just
when it finally came to fruition that you guys decided to team up and say,
hey, let's see what's going to happen with LeBron.  
DWYANE WADE: I think LeBron said it best. It was established beforehand, the
possibility, and the coolness of everything, of us possibly playing again, it
was there from a long time ago. I've had a relationship with Chris since day
one, since he came in -- we came in together and we both signed with the same
agent.  
Through this process, our meetings was overlapping. The agent was a very busy
man. And we really didn't get much time to talk in between, because we had to
go through this process. And we had to listen to everything. So we didn't talk
much in between. But we went to dinner every night.  
And we tried not to talk about it too much then, because we wanted to -- as
they say in the movies, wanted to woosah a little bit and calm down. So once
the process, we were off the two first two days, then we was able to
communicate and see what each other was thinking a little bit. We had some of
the same opportunities, some of the same teams we was interested in.  
And I think for me and for Chris, it came down to Miami. And I know Chris was
fond of Chicago.  
(Lost audio)  
LEBRON JAMES: Every single night there's times where you have to take shots,
contest the shots that now we don't have to take. So you can look at it and
say that the number's going to go down or we can't play our same game, but I
don't buy that. I don't buy it at all.  
I think what's going to be the best for us is now the pressure of making every
shot or shooting a high percentage just for our team to win is not a big deal
anymore.  
You look at Game 7 of the Finals between the Lakers and the Celtics. Kobe
Bryant shot 6 for 24 from the field and they still won, because he knew he had
help and guys came through for him.  
It's been a long time. And I can say all three of us, if we shot 6 for 24 from
the field, we still believe we can win a basketball game.  
  
Q. You guys could be the biggest thing to ever hit sports before you play a
game, and I'm talking about because of Twitter and Facebook, the dotcoms,
cable news, all that. Do you guys embrace that? Do you love that? Or is that
just, that's just kind of something that comes with this? Was that even a
factor in you three getting together?  
CHRIS BOSH: I think you have to embrace it. We all have to embrace it because
whether we like it or not this is the attention that's here. I know just with
social media and the Internet and TV and cable and satellite and all that
stuff, you have so many different avenues of information that people can get.
So we have to embrace it.  
You have to like it, because it's going to happen anyway. So we just have to
have fun with it and at the end of the day it's playing basketball. When we
step on the court we just do what we've been doing our whole lives, just play
this game and play it the right way.  
  
Q. Dwyane, could you address that, please?  
DWYANE WADE: What was the question? Just messing with you. What you mean, us
taking care of ourselves or y'all writing about us?  
  
Q. Just everything. I mean, this is a worldwide story. Do you acknowledge
that? Do you look at this as a worldwide story?  
DWYANE WADE: It is. I mean, the biggest stories you have, you have three guys
in their prime deciding not to wait until we get older. We're getting
criticized because we decided to do it when we was a little younger than wait
until we're in our 30s to say let's try to get a ring now.  
LEBRON JAMES: They would have criticized us, also, if we would have took the
max deals. Doesn't matter what we would have did, we would have got
criticized.  
DWYANE WADE: So bring it on. We'll accept it. At the end of the day we know
what's important. And what's important is winning ball games and winning
championships. So once you do that, winner take all, and you guys will be
writing good stories.  
  
Q. Chris, Dwyane had said a couple times through this process that without
you or without LeBron here, he probably would have gone elsewhere. You took
that call from him on Tuesday and said "I'm feeling Miami." That made his
decision easier. Obviously then we know what LeBron's decision was. Does any
part of you feel like you were responsible, really, for pulling all of the
last parts of this together and really making this happen?   
CHRIS BOSH: Not really. I think it was more of a collective effort. I know
these two guys; they have to make their own decisions. There was no point
where we asked each other to, okay, we're going to talk and we're all going to
go here. We have to play in the best positions for our families, for
ourselves, and for our careers.  
And winning was the top priority for everybody. And Miami was the obvious
choice. And I think we're all intelligent guys up here. So when me and Dwyane
saw where it was, LeBron had to do his thing and take his time, do his
meetings, process his feelings. Because I know it wasn't hard leaving Toronto
and I know it wasn't hard leaving Cleveland. But we just have to take that
chance. And we were not afraid to be great. So we've jumped in the water and
now it's time to swim.  
  
Q. All three of you guys, I'm sure you know some of the comments that are
already coming out around the league. Orlando's questioning LeBron's
competitiveness. And Joakim called you guys Team Hollywood already. Sort of
respond to that first. And secondly, what were your reactions to the "Beat LA"
chants out there tonight?   
LEBRON JAMES: We're in the same conference now with Orlando, so we'll deal
with them later. As far as Joakim, I got a little history with Joakim. If me
and D-Wade or me and Bosh, or Bosh and D-Wade went to Miami, then he wouldn't
have said nothing about Team Hollywood -- I mean, to Chicago. He wouldn't have
said nothing about Team Hollywood. And what was your last one?  
  
Q. The "Beat LA" chants.   
LEBRON JAMES: LA team is a team -- I think every team in the NBA wants to get
to that point and that's to hoist the trophy. But it's not just about beating
LA. We understand what the fans want, but it's a process. Starting from day
one, starting from training camp, us processing and taking every team as it's
our last and not taking no games for granted.  
And Orlando, that's funny that they questioned my competitiveness. I like
that. I like locker room -- we're going to put a lot of stuff in the locker
room before the season start. (Laughter) I know Pat and I know Micky, they're
going to do a lot -- if they don't do it I'm going to have a lot of stuff in
my locker. It's on.  
DWYANE WADE: You're trying to make -- we wanted to play when we got out there,
heard the crowd. You're really trying to make us come out of the suit now.
We're competitive.  
And you don't make this decision to come together. And I understand people are
going to say stuff. And we accept it with open arms. Bring it on.  
That's why we play this game. We play this game to have that competitive
nature, competitive juices. You expect those teams to say that. We don't
expect them to say, okay, Miami's won it. We don't want that. We didn't play
together so people can just lay down. We want to come out here and we want to
give this Miami crowd a show every night. And even on the road. Because every
place is going to sell out when we come to town. So they can thank us now.
(Laughter).  
CHRIS BOSH: Yeah. I mean, you know, I like Hollywood. I really like Hollywood.
Maybe we can run with that one. But, I mean, what was the question again. I
can't even remember.  
  
Q. Having the target on your back.  
CHRIS BOSH: I mean, every great player goes through it. If you want to win a
championship, you're going to go through it. The Lakers go through it. Come
on, they're chanting "Beat LA" at a, I don't know, a conference, a thing, a
Miami thing. They were chanting "Beat LA". So when you're on the top people
always want to knock you off. That's where we want to get to. It's a lot of
hard work to get there. But once we're there, I think we'll maintain
everything.  
And we know that it's going to put the target on our backs more so then. But
even now, just with us coming together, it's going to be out there. So we just
have to be prepared for that and we have to stay behind each other, keep each
other standing tall and just support each other and that's all it's about.
When you're having tough times, you rely on your friends, you rely on your
teammates to pull you out of it.  
  
Q. I know you guys may not anticipate this happening too often this season.
But let's say that there's just three seconds left and The Heat's down 1. Who
is taking the last shot?  
DWYANE WADE: Coach. It's Coach's decision.  
LEBRON JAMES: Absolutely. That's Coach's decision. I mean, I think Coach Spo
has a great feel for the game. Throughout the course of the game he's going to
know the best possible chance for us to win a game. And if it is the case
where D-Wade takes the shot and he makes it, we're going to celebrate. If
D-Wade misses it, we're going to pick him up and get ready for the next game.
The same with Chris. The same with myself.  
One game or one possession is not going to define who we are. It's not going
to define who Coach Spo is. We're going to get ready for the next one. The
fact that we feel like Coach is going to put us in the best possible chance to
win is all we can ask for. And if it goes down as a victory, we're going to
love it, of course. But if we take a L that night we get ready for the game
tomorrow.  
DWYANE WADE: To speak on that. We've got other teammates as well. I think
LeBron showed his substance in ball games. I think I've shown it. I know Chris
has hit big shots. There's other guys on the basketball court that can take
shots. Udonis has them; he has a lot of big shots here in Miami.  
It might not be 6, 3, 1 taking shots. It might be someone else. And this is
about Miami Heat. So keep saying who is going to take the last shot, well
somebody on The Heat going to take it. It's not necessarily about 6, 3, 1
taking it. It's about Miami Heat taking it, and we live with the consequences.  
  
Q. LeBron, you talked about the criticism a little bit. You've got people
saying that coming here you've diminished your brand because you're with these
guys, whereas had you gone to New York they would have said you were all about
your brand and nothing else. Or had you gone to Cleveland, they would have
said all he cared about was being the main guy on his team. Did you almost
feel like you were in a no-win situation in making your decision; and that
being the case, how much does it help to have the support of these guys and
this organization?  
LEBRON JAMES: In the life I live today, the way I am blessed, the way the man
above has given me these God-given abilities, there's no way I'm in a lose-
lose situation. Every day I wake up, see my family, my two sons running around
just loving life, there's no way I'm in a lose-lose situation. I'm going out
here playing a game of basketball, the game I love, the game I played as a kid
for free, and we still play for free.  
So there's no lose-lose situation for me here. I'm playing a game of
basketball. And it just so happens we've got cameras and people writing about
it. So until you understand who LeBron James is, LeBron James is in a win-win
situation and will continue to be in a win-win situation.  
DWYANE WADE: Yah. (Laughter) that was a yah moment. You all wanted to say it
too. You're all shaking your head yah, what he said.  
  
Q. LeBron, yesterday when you walked out before the decision, it almost
looked like you were the jury foreman about to give the defendant the guilty
verdict. Today, when you came down from the sky, with the dry ice and these
guys, you looked like a little boy on the playground. Is that accurate? And
can you tell me how tough yesterday was compared to how much fun tonight
was?  
LEBRON JAMES: Yesterday was really tough. Mixed emotions, like I said, before
earlier. At the end of the day I think my mother helped me. She really put the
icing on the cake for me. Yesterday I talked to her before I came and did the
interview on ESPN with Jim Gray. And she was like -- I told her where I was
leaning towards. She was like: I believe you're making the right decision. You
gotta do what's best for you, because at the end of the day people are going
to do what's best for them.  
If you put the shoe on the other foot, we would see how people will react. And
it's kind of the opposite what my mom was going to say. Because sometimes my
mom get long winded and she say things that's off the wall, but at the same
time I know she has my best interests. But yesterday she was -- she gave me
the green light on where I was leaning towards. That made me feel more
comfortable in that interview, even though how tough it was, because I was
letting a lot of people in Northeast Ohio down.  
It's tough. But today, to be here, to be part of this Miami Heat organization,
to see those fans come out on short notice, to be here with D-Wade, to be here
with C.B., I understand now that I've made the right decision.  
And to also hear my former owner's comments, I absolutely know I made the
right decision.  
  
Q. Dwyane, could you talk a little bit about the role that Pat Riley played
in putting this whole thing together, and do you think he got as big a charge
out of this as he did coaching a team to a championship?  
DWYANE WADE: You want me to give Pat Riley more credit and more credit and
more credit? He's already in the hall of fame, what else do you want?
(Laughter).  
You know, as I said from the beginning, I had a lot of trust in Coach Riley.
We have four years in a row here where it wasn't pretty. We failed to win some
ball games, but all along I had a lot of confidence in him as a man. He looked
me eye to eye and told me that he was going to do it. He was going to get it
done. And we wasn't going to be down forever.  
And I believed him. Of course, I had to go through this process, but all along
I believed him. So what he did, what he continues to do is make sure that with
the opportunity that Micky Arison has given him to put this organization first
class and at the top of the heap, he makes sure every opportunity he gets he
does it.  
I've been here when he made one of the biggest trades in NBA history with
getting Shaq down here and then also getting Jason Williams, Antoine Walker
and James Posey and Gary Payton and those guys down here.  
So he's proven. And he once again, he did something miraculous. So I'm sure he
will have his own one-hour ESPN sit-down to talk about how great he is.
(Laughter) but he is great. And we're glad, and I'm happy, and I think LeBron
and Chris is going to see this, to have the support that we have in Mr. Pat
Riley and Mr. Micky Arison is second to none.  
And I told them as soon as I heard the comments from Cleveland, I told LeBron,
I said, you know, I'm happy that you're here, I'm really happy you're here
because we have a first-class organization. And we have an owner that would
never do that, no matter what you do. So he made the right decision. And it's
because of those guys.  
  
Q. There seems to be a notion out there that because each of you have been
the man on your respective teams that there could be chemistry issues and that
there needs to be an alpha dog on each team. How do you answer questions like
that?  
LEBRON JAMES: You look at our 2008 Olympic team, the biggest thing that I got
out of that, not only did all 12 guys -- because we had 12 guys on that team
also. But not only did we all sacrifice things, Dwyane -- D-Wade, Flash, what
you guys call him, he came off the bench and had no problem with coming off
the bench. He's a starter. He's always been a starter. He's an All-Star. He's
a superstar. World renowned, and he came off the bench. And that's what
sacrifice is all about.  
At times, yeah, there's going to have to be an alpha dog that steps up, gets
in somebody's face. If I need to be that guy, I will be that guy, to make sure
that everybody is understanding what this is all about. This is not just all
about D-Wade and C.B. and LeBron. It's about the whole team. It's about the
whole organization, starting from the top to the bottom.  
So, I mean, it may change from game to game. But if I have to be that guy,
then my leadership, my command, I'm up for the taking. But this whole
sacrifice thing or saying that we can't do it together, you know it sounds a
little crazy.  
  
Q. The crossbar has been raised high. Expectations are through the roof.
Point-blank, if you don't win a championship in season one, will this season
be considered a failure in your mind?  
DWYANE WADE: Yes. We're here to win a championship. We're not here to sell
jerseys. We're not here to pump up ratings. You know, you don't make a
decision like this. LeBron don't make a decision to leave his hometown. Chris
don't make a decision to leave Toronto to come here just to get out of the
first round. Our goal is to win championships. If we don't do that, we're
going to be harder on ourselves than you all can be on us.  
So we've got a long way to get to that point. We've got a lot of building to
do. We still have a roster to fill. But we feel we have enough here from top
to the bottom to do that. And everybody is willing. So, yes, our goal is to
win championships. Just like our goal was to win a gold medal. If we didn't do
that it was a failure. But we accomplished it. We know the Lakers are the
defending champions, two-time defending champions, and they're very, very,
very good team. It's going to take a lot to get to the point that they have.
But we're up for the challenge.  
  
Q. Bosh, you haven't had a chance to formally address the city of Toronto.
Is there anything you have to say to the Raptors fans?  
CHRIS BOSH: First and foremost, I miss Toronto already. That was home for me
for seven years. I got there when I was a 19-year-old rookie. And I learned to
love that city and the city embraced me like I was one of their own.  
And I poured my heart and soul into every game I played. And I know this isn't
easy. It's not easy for me. It's not easy for Toronto. It's not easy for the
organization or the staff or anybody.  
But I appreciate every moment I had. I had some great times in Toronto that
I'll never forget for the rest of my life. And stuff like that is priceless.
So I know they're going to be mad at me a little bit, but I did it for my best
interests. And I think if somebody was in my shoes they'd do the same thing.
And I'd ask them not to boo me when I go back. I hope they don't.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Northern Iowa  67  
Wichita State - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: The tournament runners-up are with us. Head Coach Gregg
Marshall ask him to start off with a statement on this game, and go to
questions for the three student athletes of Wichita State. Gregg, please?  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, it's obvious that we hit a real dry spell there at some
point in the second half. I'm trying to get some clarification on exactly how
long, then we'll have to figure out why. But they were definitely down the
stretch, the better team. We had a good run but weren't able to finish, so
congratulations to them.  
  
Q. You guys were the first team in the tournament to score over 40 points on
UNI. Then obviously in the second half there is a 12 minute and 14 second
stretch where they went on without a bucket and they were a 23-3 run. For the
players, what was going on in that stretch? There were a couple of buckets
that the shot went halfway down and came out. What was going on?  
CLEVIN HANNAH: I think we did get a couple of good looks that we missed
against a good team, good defensive team like they are. You've got to take
advantage of the good looks that you did against them and knock them down, and
we didn't do it.  
GARRETT STUTZ: We had good shots, just they didn't fall. I missed a couple of
shots during that stretch, a lot of us did. And we fell for jump shots at that
point. We didn't continue to be as aggressive as we were earlier in the game.  
  
Q. Northern Iowa was able to rest guys in their first two games. They had a
little easier time in their games. Was fatigue any kind of a factor?  
J.T. DURLEY: No, fatigue really wasn't a factor. I mean just we got outplayed
in the second half the last 12 or 14 minutes of the half.  
GARRETT STUTZ: I don't think fatigue was a factor either. We played hard all
throughout the game and all throughout the tournament, and we just came up a
little bit short.  
  
Q. Going into the halftime with the lead, what do you feel went wrong in the
second half besides the scoring drought?  
GARRETT STUTZ: I'm not really sure. I've got a lot of things going through my
mind right now. Effort was there, effort, passion and intensity was all there.
We just couldn't finish, couldn't put the ball in the basket, and that will
hurt you when you're playing a good team.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about now waiting to find out what's next, the three
players, please?  
THE MODERATOR: Clevin, then Garrett and J.T., thank you.  
CLEVIN HANNAH: I guess we just wait it out and see where we stand. I know
we'll be playing somewhere in some tournament hopefully. But just wait it out
and get back to see what we can do to get better.  
GARRETT STUTZ: Yeah, just recover, get our minds right, physically get right.
Then just try to continue to improve every day and everything we do to just
get better.  
J.T. DURLEY: I mean, you know, this was kind of a let down to play anything
less than the NCAA Tournament. But we'll play somewhere, anywhere we can play,
we'll play.  
  
Q. Ahelegbe scored 20 points today, can you talk about the trouble you had
in defending him?  
J.T. DURLEY: He's a good player, they get him open on screening and they drive
to the hole and make free throws and knocks down open shots. He's just a good
player.  
  
Q. Just the experience of getting here to the championship game? How
beneficial is that going forward?  
CLEVIN HANNAH: It's real beneficial. We're sort of a young team. We've got
almost everybody coming back, so I mean, experience is going to be a big
factor, but it's just a tough loss to lose the way we lost.  
GARRETT STUTZ: Just remember the feeling and how bad it sucks. And just
remember that through the off-season and do anything you can not to be feeling
this again.  
  
Q. Can you what would your message be to the rest of the league about this
program and where it's coming? As you leave it right now and the legacy you
leave behind, what do you expect out of this program in the next couple of
years?  
CLEVIN HANNAH: I expect for this program to be one of the top on coming soon.
They've got a great coach that's going to lead them to where they need to be.
And they've got great players. I just want to let them know that they can do
it whatever they put their minds to and play hard with each other. They can
play anywhere with anybody.  
  
Q. Clevin, Kwadzo was talking to you there at the end and had his arm around
you. Was he consoling you or what was he telling you at that point?  
CLEVIN HANNAH: He was telling me congratulations on my career. We had respect
for each other, and he's a good player and just keep doing his thing.  
  
Q. If you could meet with the selection committee right now, how would you
state your case for you guys to get in?  
COACH MARSHALL: I don't know. 25 wins, a couple of top 25 victories,
undefeated at home. Very talented team, very -- and I think our team is built
for this type of tournament, built for postseason play. We've got size. We've
got 7-footers, we've got long, rangy athletes. We're going to defend. Tonight,
I don't know what happened. I'll have to go back and watch the film. I like
Clevin or Garrett, whoever said it. I have a lot of thoughts in my mind about
what happened and why.  
I know we turned the ball over. I thought we settled for too many jump shots,
but Northern Iowa's a great team. They're well coached, they're seasoned,
they're experienced. They'll win games in the NCAA Tournament. They'll win at
least one if not two games in the NCAA Tournament.  
You know, I've got experience as an NCAA Tournament coach, and hopefully I can
get them prepared to compete with whoever we play. You know, in this league,
it's a pretty good basketball league. We had to play a team with 20 wins in
the quarterfinals that was getting top 25 votes for December as a 2 seed. So
that goes to show you the depth of the conference.  
Illinois State's a quality team. We played Pit early without Clevin Hannah,
and it was a great game for 30-something minutes, we were right there with
them.  
Anyway, you asked the question, I'd love to get an opportunity to coach Clevin
Hannah in the NCAA Tournament, but I'll coach in the NCAA Tournament again. I
just wish that he got an opportunity, because he's a special little player.  
  
Q. Coach at the 16-minute mark, UNI went on a 23-3 run for about 12:00
minutes, could you talk about what happened in that time?  
COACH MARSHALL: I think I have. I think I just addressed that.  
  
Q. Going into halftime with the league, what did you feel your team had to
do in the second half to keep the consistency up in the second half?  
COACH MARSHALL: Playing for an NCAA Tournament berth outright, I don't think
it was a matter of intensity, we couldn't get the ball to fall in the last 20
minutes or whatever it was. They made some great shots. Couple times we had
the ball in our hands and couldn't come up with it.  
The breaks didn't go our way in the last 12 minutes. But we've had a good run.
We were intense. And of course except for the last minute or two, I thought
they got a little down. It's my job now to get them back up because we'll be
playing somewhere against somebody that's going to be a good basketball team,
and I'm looking forward to it.  
I've said all year that I've loved coaching this group. It's an unbelievable
group of young people and they're also talented and long and athletic
basketball players.  
  
Q. I know you've addressed the 12-minute drought, it looked to me like this
team peaked here. You probably played your best basketball in St. Louis up
until that time. Is fatigue a possibility in your mind?  
COACH MARSHALL: Might be. We haven't played three games in three days.
Demetric getting the fourth foul hurt us because David Kyles is already out
for the year. Who knows, he may be able to come back for some post-season
play, but he's not available right now. He's our fourth guard. Demetric was
actually the fifth guard, and he was in foul trouble. So we weren't able to
distribute the minutes like I would have preferred, but that's happened
before.  
It's a much better problem than when Hannah and Murry are on the bench with
fouls and can't play because of that reason, so at least they were out there.
But 37 minutes is a little too many for Clevin. And everyone else played 34
less.  
So you're talking three days in a row. I don't know. They have the same
situation. They won more convincingly the first two games, so they were able
to get more of a rest. But hopeful Leo owe it may have been, it looked like we
may have hit a little wall, I don't know.  
They've been a resilient group all year. I'm sure they'll bounce back here.
But we've got a few weeks or at least a few days before we have to play again.  
  
Q. You talked about maybe settling for jump shots. Northern Iowa seems good
at making teams do that. Just discouraging people from getting to the basket.
What is it about their defense that makes them effective?  
COACH MARSHALL: They're well schooled. Ben does a great job. They're tough.
They're not super athletic, but they're always in the right position, and
they're very, very, very physical and strong.  
So like I said, they're going to give somebody in the NCAA Tournament an L,
and some fits on the floor.  
  
Q. Yesterday you talked about how much Clevin had grown as a person from
last season until this season. Talk about how hard it is to see him go out of
the MVC Tournament with a loss like this?  
COACH MARSHALL: Yeah, you know, he helped this program grow. I'll worry about
not coaching Clevin Hannah after his last game. That's going to be hard
enough. I don't want to have to worry about it until then. Right now what I
want to see is what Clevin has done.  
He came in after we had zero minutes returning in the back court. And he was
the captain of our ship. We went from 0-6 in the Valley and got really hot and
had a great run last year tour of towards the end. Finished with 17 wins and
overachieved for a team that was picked ninth. And this year we're picked 5th,
and we overachieve again and finish second in a very good basketball
conference.  
He's the guy. He's our Most Valuable Player, first team all conference player
and all tournament. He's the catalyst to the first Shockers team to be in the
finals in a long, long time. So I think he's left a great legacy whenever he
does finish, and I hope it's not for a while. I hope it's several weeks that
he gets to continue to display his unique talents because he's a great young
man. And I just really like coaching him.  
  
Q. I guess Jake Koch had not taken a shot until tonight. When he starts
firing away like that, does that throw the scouting report into an uproar?  
COACH MARSHALL: We knew he could shoot. I was not crazy about Blair's defense
on those two shots that started the game. But he's looking like he's going to
be a very good player as a freshman, Blair had his hands in his pockets and
doesn't know how to contest yet. So I have to work with him on big league
contests. He's got one more year to figure it out.  
Hopefully he'll do it one more year a little bit better, because a kid like
that, you don't give him a contest, he's going to make it.  
  
Q. You guys really controlled the boards coming out of halftime. The first
nine minutes of the second half, you were never able to pull away. How
frustrating was that getting second chances and not being able to capitalize
on them.  
COACH MARSHALL: That was the big key for us because we lost the game up at
their place by three. They killed us on the offensive glass. We addressed
that. We had plenty of opportunity to score. We had 52 shots, they had 46, but
we didn't make them.  
We had some guys that had poor shooting nights and also had some guys that
made some bad decisions. But a lot of the credit, again, goes to their
defense. I mean, somebody said that's the first team that scored 40 against
them or more than 40, we scored 52, but that's not enough against them. They
had 67. A lot of those were gifts at the end with the fouling, but it's hard
to score 60 points against them. They're very good defensively for the reasons
I mentioned earlier.  
We lost our composure to a degree as a young team and the first time in this
situation. I would have loved to have knocked all those shots down, executed
better, and won the game and went to the NCAA Tournament without a doubt. But
it didn't happen. What I've got to do is get this group back up so they can
live to fight another day and they've got to understand the strides that
they've made.  
So you become a little bit of a psychologist at this time in my situation. Ben
gets to relax and enjoy the next week or two.  
  
Q. Just getting to this point, how much of a benefit is that going
forward?  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, I think it's better than losing in the first round.
Let's see, first year -- let's go back over that -- first year I'm kicked out
for spinning around on a knee without saying a word. That is pretty much the
low point.  
Second year, we have the clock debacle. Everyone runs off the court, including
the referees and they're asked to come back. We put more time on the clock,
and we lose in the quarterfinals on a great shot from Booker Woodfox after two
dribbles and a ham sandwich.  
Then this year we were able to win two games and get to the finals, so I think
we're making strides. I'll take it. It's a big improvement.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Best of luck in the postseason.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Northern Iowa  67  
Wichita State - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: The regular season and Tournament Champion Panthers are with
us. We'll have Coach Ben Jacobson open up with a statement on the title game.
Then we'll go to questions for the starting five student-athletes of UNI.  
COACH JACOBSON: Thank you. That was a very good basketball game. I think two
very good teams. I think we saw those of us in our league know and the country
saw today why Wichita State is in that picture for an at large bid. They've
crept back in there the last couple of weeks and they should because of the
quality of team that they have. They've got the ability to play at a high
level and they've done so a lot this year.  
I think you saw two tournament teams out there today really battling hard. I'm
proud of our guys for sticking with it and making plays. Our defense was good
in the second half, and it had to be. I'll leave it there.  
  
Q. Adam, going in at halftime down by throw, what did you guys feel besides
scoring that you had to come out and do in the second half to try to get this
game away?  
ADAM KOCH: I think one of the biggest things we needed to do was try to
continue to get some stops and get some defensive and offensive rebounds to
attack the glass and get an advantage there.  
  
Q. You guys went on a 23-3 run for about a 12 minute period. Is there
anything that you did differently during that time that helped you establish
that big lead and eventually get a convincing win?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: The 23-3 run, it was probably more had to do with our bench.
Our bench stepped up huge for us tonight just like they did the night before.
So I think our bench was the biggest difference in that stretch and then
probably in the entire game overall. They made huge plays for us and they wore
down the starters for Wichita and the guys that were playing all the minutes
for them.  
JOHNNY MORAN: I have to agree. The bench did a great job. Sparking the defense
and offense for our team. Yet we just kept battling and they started knocking
down shots and everything just kept going our way.  
  
Q. Adam, you're held to four points tonight. I don't know what they were
doing on you. Talk about the way your little brother stepped up today?  
ADAM KOCH: Jake played great today. We've got confidence in him to make shots
and make plays. He's doing it all the time in practice. It was great to see
him today play with confidence and aggressiveness to start making those plays.
When he's coming in and being that productive for our team, it just gives us a
huge lift.  
  
Q. Ali and Johnny have referenced it in reference to today's game, but the
bench averaged 21.3 points through the course of the tournament. We've got the
starting five up here, but talk about their contributions throughout the
entirety of the Tournament here in St. Louis?  
ADAM KOCH: Definitely, when they come into the game, there's not a drop off
on. The energy and the level that they play at, it's tough for other teams to
match up against when they come in and they're able to do the things that they
do. For 40 minutes to have that kind of level of play from us, it's pretty
tough.  
  
Q. Talk about the Missouri Valley Conference Championship games. What's with
that? Is there a certain extra thing you bring to it or what's going on
there?  
JOHNNY MORAN: I do love St. Louis. It's a great place to be. No, sometimes
it's the right time or my teammates have given me opportunities to score the
ball or pass the ball whatever. I think it's just how the game goes sometimes.  
  
Q. It was 46-42, they called the timeout, and you guys were smiling. Almost
like you knew you had them at that point. What was going through your heads?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: Kwadzo always smiles that's why he's got me smiling. That's
just how our team is no matter what happens in the game, you can be down by
10, 12 points and we know we can make a shot and spark our run.  
KWADZO AHELEGBE: Ali was telling me that I had to close out the hatch or
something like that. And I laughed and it was like all right, I won't mess up.  
I've got two great shooters, so it's easy. Sometimes if the shots aren't
falling I'm sure it will next time.  
  
Q. Talk about how important it was to be aggressive? It looked like after
the Opening minutes you got that lay-up, but it was attack, attacking attack.
How important was it to take it to Wichita State?  
KWADZO AHELEGBE: I was focusing on the two games I had before. And I came out
aggressive and they had a little success with that. So I tried to come with
the main focus with that. But like I said, I have an easy job.  
When you can get to the basket and nobody's there because you have two great
shooters, it's easy, easy money.  
  
Q. Three straight days we've seen teams go on long scoring droughts. Do you
see them getting frustrated? It's got to be a helpless feeling for them when
the shots aren't falling and there is somebody in their face all the time?  
KWADZO AHELEGBE: I don't really focus on that. I just focus on playing
defense. Because if I don't my coach might whoop my butt, so (laughing).  
  
Q. Can you just kind of compare this year's MVC Championship to last
years?  
JORDAN EGLSEDER: This year was huge for us. We worked really hard this off-
season to get ready. And I mean as well as everyone did. But this is our last
shot. So this is huge for us. I mean, just for comparing to last year, man, we
did it this year. We had Travis and Carlton with us last year. But this year
we just played great basketball. Our defense has been great all season.  
Just to be able to do that with everyone, with all the targets we had on our
back this year, we got everyone's best game all year. Just to know that, we're
really proud of that.  
ADAM KOCH: I think the biggest difference like Jordan said was the expectation
going into this year. Last year I don't know if we were expected to win the
conference championships, but this year we definitely were. That makes it
different this year. It's special though.  
  
Q. What is the feeling like knowing that you're going to be one of the
team's selected to go and play in the big dance now?  
KWADZO AHELEGBE: I mean, it feels good. We get to practice for about a week
now and wait for selection Sunday. But I mean it feels good knowing that we're
going to be one of the teams. We don't know where we're going to be, but it
feels good knowing that we can just worry about practicing and getting better
now.  
JORDAN EGLSEDER: Yeah, it's a great feeling to have. Having that experience
last year, you know, I'm going to do some things different. I'm sure we'll do
some things different to prepare ourselves for this first game.  
  
Q. For Jordan and Adam, speak to how physical this game was. I mean, Kwadzo
ended up with a cut over his right eye. Kind of looks like a boxer a little
bit. Speak to how physical this game was?  
JORDAN EGLSEDER: It was a really physical game. I mean, we like it that way. I
mean, me and Koch were down there banging, you I mean, everyone, Jake and
Luke. That's how it goes down here. Both teams want to win so we're going to
give it our all. That's just how it is.  
ADAM KOCH: Yeah, our two games during the year with them were the same way. So
we knew going in it's going to be physical. When you've got so much on the
line for this game and both teams want it, it just takes it up to another
notch. You just couldn't back down. You had to keep fighting for anything you
could get.  
  
Q. You had a steal from Garrett to help you guys build the lead. He had been
dribbling a lot. When you see a 7-footer doing that, do you say at some point
I'm going to get that?  
KWADZO AHELEGBE: No, I was actually denying him because I didn't want him to
touch it. And you're right. I saw a 7-footer dribbling the ball, and for any
guard your eyes are going to light up (laughing). Yeah, I got that one from
him.  
  
Q. You said you loved St. Louis. Well, the NCAA Midwest Regional Tournament
is here this year. Are you hoping to get in the Midwest region and if you get
back to the Sweet 16, you're back here in the loop?  
KWADZO AHELEGBE: Let's take it one game at a time. And wherever we are, I
don't think it really matters. But if we were close, it would be great for our
fan support.  
  
Q. In previous tournament experience you guys have been not favored in your
NCAA games, and now you're going to go into a tournament and you're probably
going to be favored over the team you're playing. How do you prepare
differently and do you take a different mentality with that?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: I think just as a group we don't care about what anybody
else thinks. We'll all have a chip on our shoulder no matter what going into
that game. It's not going to factor in what everybody else thinks because
we've got our chip on our shoulder trying to prove other things out there.  
  
Q. Could you kind of analyze what you saw during that 23-3 run or 12 minutes
that they went without scoring?  
COACH JACOBSON: That would have been midway through the second half, if I'm
not mistaken. Defensively we got better. Did a better job on some ball screen
things and did a better job at defending the post. And I do feel that our
bench played a factor in that, whether they were on the floor during that run.
But leading up to that is where they really played a factor. Being productive
in the first half offensively. Really going after guys defensively.  
Our starters at that point in the game should have had some juice in them and
our bench was the key to that run.  
  
Q. Jon Wooden has said, It's one thing to get there and harder to stay
there. " Was this year harder than last year's run?  
COACH JACOBSON: I don't know if harder is the right word. They're very
different. And for me as a head coach the first time I've gone through as a
head coach, I've been an assistant and player in this situation, but as a head
coach it's different. Not just for me but for our team.  
There are cases on the road where the crowd is bigger and they're more into
it. They know we have a basketball team that's going to be in the hunt for the
big title. There are certainly some differences.  
Last year we just got things rolling. Everything was fine. We just kept
winning games and we kept going, and it's still hard to win in this league and
hard to do what we did last year. But this year it takes a very determined
effort every day at practice and every day you step on the court because of
what those expectations are.  
I'm proud of our guys for that determination they showed every day to make
sure they're ready to play as well as they can because they knew they had to.  
  
Q. The five guys that were up on the podium are well known to league
observers. They've been contributors now for two years. Your bench averaged
21.3 in the tournament. Even Lucas is a two-time sixth man of the year. Maybe
these other guys, can you talk about the respect they earned in this
tournament and give the perception that you guys are a deeper team than what
the perception has been?  
COACH JACOBSON: You know, I would throw Kerwin in there with Luke. Both those
guys, they were very good year last year. Kerwin had a good year this year. So
their experience has helped us. Those two guys, I know we can count on them in
any and all situations. Late game, if there's a run going either way. I know
those two guys because of their experience and quality of player they are, we
can count on those two.  
I think those three freshmen, maybe I should have been playing those guys a
little bit more a month and a half ago. They've done a great job at practice,
and obviously this weekend and in particular the last two days. What we saw
out of those three freshmen, that was good basketball.  
I liked how they defended. They come up with Sonnen with big hoops in the
first half, and Anthony with hoops, and Jake extremely important today at the
offensive end. They've got a great understanding of what we have to defend and
rebound the ball. For the freshmen, they do a good job at the defensive end of
the floor.  
  
Q. Before the game, if somebody would have told you that Adam wouldn't score
the point and you'd win by 15 points, what would you have said to them?  
COACH JACOBSON: I certainly wouldn't have thought that we would have won the
basketball game let alone by double figures. If Adam doesn't even get on the
scoreboard. Although we've had other games where any of these five guys up
here have had two points or four points and when they're averaging 11 or 12,
and we've had other guys step up and make plays and come through for us
offensively.  
I just think the depth of our team and the trust they have in each other,
they're not worried about themselves getting points. They just want to win
basketball games and that showed up again today.  
  
Q. Was the plan to use that second group to gap the other team's starters
coming in or is it just kind of these guys are playing well? How you did that
evolve?  
COACH JACOBSON: I'll tell you where it evolved was yesterday. The way those
guys played yesterday really helped me and our staff in terms of how we could
approach this game, because those three freshmen played so well yesterday.  
I felt great after that basketball game because I felt like we were going to
be able to play ten guys today. And I felt we were going to do our best to go
after them and try to put as much pressure on as we could and keep going to
those guys on the bench. Hoping at some point during the course of the
basketball game that we'd get a little bit of a run to get separation. Because
I knew it was going to be a close game. Just hoping there would be a spot in
there where we could get a little bit of a run.  
  
Q. Could you just speak about what the next week is going to be like now
that you have a spot in the tournament? Is anything going to change as far as
practice goes?  
COACH JACOBSON: No, I think our experience last year will help us. We'll do
some of the things we did a year ago, and there are as Kwadzo mentioned there
are things we can do different this week than we did a year ago. And we'll
have a day or two off to start the week. Then we'll get back to practice and
really work on our stuff, really work on some things at both ends of the
floor.  
That was important coming in here. We had four days of practice and really
worked on some things at the offensive end and it helped us. So I really enjoy
these practices. Thinking back to last year when we were just working on our
team. We've got a chance to get better during the next five or six days before
Selection Sunday.  
  
Q. Being down by three points at halftime, what did you tell the guys
starting the second half?  
COACH JACOBSON: There were a couple plays I didn't like. Adam Koch reached in
and fouled Hatch. He had no business reaching in there. Jordan had a rebound
he didn't get. Jordan didn't show on the ball screen on Hannah. There were
some plays I did not like in that first half.  
So we talked about three or four specific plays, and then got back to this is
what we've got to do. But there were three or four specific plays that I
talked about. For us to be good and win games, we have to do things the right
way. We had to be fundamentally sound. I didn't like a couple of plays in that
first half. After we talked about those we got on to bigger picture stuff.  
  
Q. You had so many guys contribute down here. Now you have a 12-day layoff,
how do you keep that momentum rolling?  
COACH JACOBSON: I think enough things have happened right now. We need to take
two days off, two of the next three days off. Whether they're two in a row or
not, you know. Then you're almost to mid week. You can have three good
practices just working on your team. Then you're a day off, you've got
Selection Sunday and you start working on the next opponent.  
So ten days seems like a long time, but when you break it down as you did a
year ago, and we may shift around a little, but it goes a little faster. What
I like the most is the time with our team working on our stuff. We'll get
three good days of that for sure.  
  
Q. I remember after the Purdue game you said we're going to get one of these
things, meaning a win in the tournament. How do you feel about the tournament
going into it right now, where you guys are at? Is this something you've been
pointing towards before the end of the season?  
COACH JACOBSON: I really like how we played here. We had a very good win over
Illinois State before we got here. We played very well in the second half of
the Drake game. Then two terrific games. I thought we really played well. We
knew we had to to win both of those games.  
Again, I knew today was going to be a close game. So that momentum helps as we
go into practices getting ready for this. That's an important part and we've
got momentum and confidence in the things that we're doing.  
Certainly this is on their list of goals. They get to decide as a team what
their goals are, and there are a couple still on there that we have not
gotten. So there is a lot of motivation still.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Jake Koch and Adam? What similarities do they have?
Different styles, one's a senior, one's a freshman, but what makes them
similar and a guy like Jake to do what he can today?  
COACH JACOBSON: You know, there's -- Adam drives it better. I think about the
basketball stuff first. Adam is much more athletic. He drives it better, he
gets to the free-throw line more. Jake, at the same age Jake is shooting the
ball better from the three-point line. Adam is now shooting it better from the
three-point line.  
But in terms of their personalities, Jake's a little bit more outgoing, if you
will. Adam has really grown into that. I can tell you this, they have been
really good for each other. Adam has had a tremendous impact on Jake's work
ethic in terms of getting in the weight room, in terms of getting extra shots
up, in terms of doing all the things you have to do to do what an Adam Koch
does. Being consistent over two years, and being in the running for player of
the year as a junior, being player of the year as a senior, to do that you
have to be consistent in your approach all year long.  
And I think Adam's had an impact on what it takes for Jake to be really good.
Jake's outgoing, he's fun to be around, his teammates love him, and that's
been good for Adam.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  65  
Illinois State - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: The victorious Shockers are with us. As mentioned, they have a
date in the championship game tomorrow afternoon, 1:00 o'clock. We're going to
have Coach Marshall open up with a statement, and then questions for the three
student-athletes for Wichita State.  
COACH MARSHALL: It wasn't a see-saw affair like yesterday, but in many ways it
was a similar game. It was a very physical, tough game against a very good
team, and that's what you're going to get. I just am very pleased to win and
to play another championship on CBS. It it's been a long time coming for the
shockers and for me personally the last couple of years. Now we have that
stage. So we're looking forward to the opportunity.  
  
Q. For the three players, they got within one point of you four times late
in the game. Two points a couple of times. But you never relinquished the
lead. What kept you from giving up the lead?  
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS: Well, defense. We said defense a lot. So when it got that
close we just kept our composure and grinded out and executed our plays.
Luckily we kept the lead.  
TOURE' MURRY: Learning from games earlier in the year, we had games in the
same situation that may not have worked out the same way as the game tonight.
We just learned from it, and just growing with experience.  
We came out with a big time stop on defense, and on the offense we had big
time players step up and make big time stops, and that's how we kept the lead
up.  
  
Q. Can you comment on just the mono-a-mono element of this game? The give
and the take. It wasn't for the feint of heart I guess is what I'm trying to
say.  
TOURE' MURRY: Definitely two great teams going at each other really tough. We
have great players on our team and refuse-to-lose attitude. And we wanted to
go to the championship. That's been our goal all year and we finally made it.  
GARRETT STUTZ: We knew nothing was going to be handed to us. We had to reach
out and take it. They felt the same thing. We have two good teams going after
the same goal, it's bound to happen.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the home-run ball to hash the score? Garret, you had a
particularly good view, probably not wanting to be there, but talk about
that.  
GARRETT STUTZ: Yeah, when we were in the huddle we talked about that being
option, and it's a readout of our press break. We made the right call. Graham
made a great catch and great finish.  
TOURE' MURRY: That's been our go-to play all year. That play worked for us it
seemed like every time we ran it. We feel like that play can build us to the
next step and get us some points when we do that.  
COACH MARSHALL: I'm going to say we said first of all you have to have trust
in players to make plays. I'm not the smartest coach in the world, but I've
got a lot of faith in these guys. I told Toure' if it wasn't open, we had
plenty of timeouts. I'm not sure how open it was, but he made the pass and
Graham made the catch and the lay-up. Like he said, big time players make big
time plays. Those were two guys hooking up. We were having a hard time with
the pressure. It was probably not the most wise call to make, but we needed to
get the ball down on this end for a while, and we eventually did that.  
  
Q. You started the game with eight of the first ten points for your team.
Can you just take me through how you were able to carry that early load for
your team, please?  
TOURE' MURRY: Well, my main thing is to just come out aggressive, you know. I
know Osiris going to come at me, so my thing is to come at him and get him in
foul trouble a little bit. That's their best player. When he's not offensively
in the game it's tough for him to score. So my main thing was to go at him and
get aggressive, get momentum.  
  
Q. I know you played the option, but what did you see that made you throw
it?  
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS: Well, I kind of see like down the floor who was getting
back. And both the big men came forward and the defender playing with him. And
Graham Hatch, I know he can grab the ball because he's an athletic player. So
I just threw it, and hopefully he'll make the catch because I just trust him.  
  
Q. You guys have Osiris Eldridge the conference's leading scorer to one
point in the second half and eight points overall. Can you speak to your game
plan going against him?  
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS: Main thing was to come out and make him shoot contested
shots, because he's a very good shooter. When he shoots the open shots,
usually he makes them. So my main thing was just contest. And I know my
teammates are going to help me when I got picked off by someone. It was all
team effort, and we did it.  
  
Q. Garret, you played Northern Iowa twice. They obviously have a very good
inside game. What have you learned from those first two games that you can
take forward tomorrow both offensively and defensively to have an impact on
the championship game?  
GARRETT STUTZ: The last game, I watched that film a couple times obviously,
and it was a low point in the season for me. I've just got to come out
tomorrow and be the aggressor. I can't wait for them to send a punch at me
first and I go back at them. I have to come out and really stick it to them.  
  
Q. Demetric, you hit a big three there kind of late where you looked at J.T.
and hit the three. Just take us through that play and what was going through
your mind?  
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS: Well, the intention was to get it to J.T. So I looked at
him and seen that Osiris was backing up on me. But I still wanted to on get it
to J.T. Then I felt he was too far so I had confidence to knock the shot down.  
  
Q. Late in the game with about 1:30 left you grabbed the offensive rebound
and missed free throw that put you up by nine and that turned out to be the
difference the way Illinois State came back. Can you take us through what
happened on that play?  
GARRETT STUTZ: We have sets with the two guys on the free-throw line. And we
communicated to cross and tried to get under the basket, and Graham did a
great job getting his guy low he and he kept it alive. The ball was right
above me I grabbed it and laid it in.  
  
Q. Wichita State hasn't been to a conference tournament final since 1987.
Can you sum up what this means to you individually and what you think it means
to the team and the school just to get to this stage to deliver this?  
TOURE' MURRY: I think it's a great thing for the whole Shockers Nation.
They've been looking to go to a championship. Since we've been in St. Louis,
we've never been. So we're just happy to make it, so we did it for the whole
Shocker Nation.  
GARRETT STUTZ: It's obviously a tremendous opportunity for the team and the
fans. We're really looking forward to it, and glad we made it this far, and we
have one more game to complete before the true postseason.  
DEMETRIC WILLIAMS: It feels really good to be a part of this team and go back
to a championship for the Shocker Nation. And bring the win back home.  
  
Q. The progression of Garrett, I would imagine nine other coaches in this
league are noticing that. What do you think their attitude about that must
be?  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, he's an excellent young player. There's a lot of great
players in this league. We happen to have three -- I'm sitting up here and if
you caught me smiling, I'm happy that we won, but it dawned on me that we have
two sophomores and a freshman on the podium here and they all played great
basketball today.  
So they're probably thinking, you know, I've got to get my 6'10, 6'11, 7
footer. Because if he stays healthy and continues to work with Kerry
Rosenboom, our strength and conditioning coach who does a great job, and he's
starting to get that edge, and he's always wanted to win, but the gnarliness,
and the toughness are starting to emerge. I guess he's been around me for a
while.  
By mean he just is coming. I really don't care what they think right now.
We've got to do the best job that we can do for Wichita State. We've got
another 7-footer coming next year that's not nearly as offensive minded, but
he's quite a man. He can block some shots and rebound.  
  
Q. You had your largest lead of the game of 10 points, and the Illinois
State came back after that. Can you talk about what happened late in the
game?  
COACH MARSHALL: They made the shot. I don't have a play-by-play here, and I
don't have a photographic memory. But I do remember turning it over one time
on the sideline. J.T. Durley said he passed the ball and it was deflected. And
they got the ball, I don't know whether it was a missed call or not, but
Durley said it was deflected. I think he missed one free throw one time. They
missed one for two, and that happens. They hit some threes.  
You've got to foul and hope they miss so you can come down and launch threes.
Three for two, three for one, three for zero. But we again made 75%.  
And I think that was the only turnover as I recall. We worked some clock, but
they're a very talented team, and they've got a lot of guys that can score,
and that's what they did.  
  
Q. You're playing awfully good basketball after grinding the last few weeks
or so of the season. You seem to have caught a bit of a second wind. Can you
talk about that generally right now?  
COACH MARSHALL: Well, it's a season. It's a long season. Seasons like in a
year. You have seasons. You have fall, spring, summer, winter, they're not all
the same. Every game's not the same. Every opponent's not the same. You have
highs and lows, and some people want to jump off the bridge, and others try to
keep it more even keel. You have good guys that have the talent, ability to
shine in situations like this. And this is a different game. Everybody is
giving their best. Everybody wants to win a championship in March. Some guys
have a little more athleticism, maybe more skill. And I'm fortunate to have a
group like that.  
Northern Iowa's got a group like that, and they've proven it before. This
group has not proven they can win a championship yet, but their opportunity is
tomorrow.  
  
Q. You mentioned on the home run ball you wanted to get the ball down the
court. Given the previous play you didn't get the ball inbounds, was that more
of a viable option at the time and maybe a surprise factor?  
COACH MARSHALL: I think like I said, it was a gamble. I understand that. But I
think we did get the ball inbounds if I'm not mistaken the play before. That's
where Durley threw the ball into their bench. So I don't know, but I know that
we were struggling against their pressure. They were all in. Their chips were
in, all hands on deck. They were nine guys and somehow you've got to relieve
the pressure. You fill a water balloon to a certain point, and it gets bigger
and bigger and bigger and bigger, and sometimes you have to relieve the
pressure. So you stick a little pin in it and the water's going to come out.
So we were able to relieve the pressure in a big-time way.  
Toure's done that. I mean, you've seen the play. In three years we're probably
10 for 10 on it maybe, if not more. It hasn't failed us yet. One day it's
going to fail and I'm going to look like a ding-dong. And Graham's going to
trip over himself.  
He did go to the basket once he caught that ball. He took two or three
dribbles and he's getting banged a little bit. He still puts it in the basket.
Again, you've got to have faith in your players to make plays. Those guys they
hooked up and made a big-time play.  
  
Q. How important has it been for Demetric to step up and give you what he's
given you?  
COACH MARSHALL: Man, are you kidding me? Wow, you could write a story about
that. This kid must live for the postseason. I haven't seen him play like this
all year. Now he's strung a couple of games together and he was playing well
at the end of the season, but you have to grasp your opportunities in life and
this is an opportunity for him.  
He didn't verbalize this to me, but I could almost tell. I'm not at all
insinuating that he was glad that David Kyles was hurt, but there became a
little bit of a different bounce to his step once that happened, and he's
emerged to fill the spot. And he's filled it quite admirably, if you will.
He's a big part of why we won today.  
  
Q. Getting back to how the team was able to shut down Osiris Eldridge. What
was your approach to him coming into the game? And overall how pleased were
you with the team's performance. Toure'?  
COACH MARSHALL: Tonight Toure' Murry had 17 points and he was 6 of 9 from the
field. When we needed a basket in the end, I said, everybody get out of the
way. We're going to run the C play. Give the ball to Toure' Murry and see what
he can get you. And he got us a big hoop with a pull-back jumper. He's a
dynamite performer.  
But what people don't see and fans don't understand as much as coaches is the
defensive player that he's become. He's the lock-down defender now, and he
loves the opportunity to play against guys like Osiris Eldridge who has proven
to be one of the best players if not thee best and most athletically gifted in
this league.  
So Toure' Murry did a marvelous job. Our zone, we always knew where he was.
And if he was getting shots, by and large, they were contested shots.  
  
Q. The players were asked what it means to them to finally get to that
championship game. What's it mean to you? Is there a sense of accomplishment?
I know you have one game left, a big one, but.  
COACH MARSHALL: I'm glad you asked that question because it is a sense of
accomplishment. It is a 25th win on a year where we were picked fifth in the
valley. It's a chance to win a championship. I didn't realize it was since
1987, but I trust Mr. Hurdle there.  
It's a chance for us to give back. You know, we have a great group of fans. I
caught myself just hesitating to walk off the court today because of what they
mean to us and me personally and just soaking up the excitement that they were
experiencing along with our team. It was great. It was a great feeling. And
the best is yet to come.  
It's kind of a double-edged sword because it's a sense of accomplishment, but
still the biggest accomplishment is right there in front of us. So we've got
another game tomorrow, and we've got a great opponent. But we keep battling.
And if we keep battling, we've got the horses to give anyone a game:

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2010

  

### [Jim Les](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16450)

### [Sam Maniscalco](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20486)

### [Andrew Warren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20485)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Northern Iowa  57  
Bradley - 40

  
COACH LES: I guess I'll start by telling you what I told the team. Sometimes
you've just got to take your hats off, and, you know, they were the better
team tonight. I thought they played extremely well. Doesn't mean we have to
like it, but I thought they were aggressor from the git-go. And they played
well. I thought the contributions in the first half from their bench was huge.  
If you had told me going into the game that Farokhmanesh and Moran were going
to go 6 for 28, I probably would have liked our chances. But I thought Sonnen
and James coming off the bench in the first half, made shots and really did a
nice job for them.  
In the second half, I thought we came out a little more intensity on the
defensive end of the floor. Got some stops and turnovers. It seemed that we
had a lid on the basket because we had four point blank opportunities to score
the ball. Which I thought would have cut the lead into the single digits or
around there and get us going. But we couldn't seem to get it down. But hat's
off to Northern Iowa for being a very good basketball team.  
  
Q. How did they defend you differently today and how did it affect you?  
SAM MANISCALCO: I thought they hugged me. We knew that was going to happen. We
watched that in film. It's just unfortunately the ball didn't drop for me. The
ball didn't drop for any of us. I thought we let that affect us on the
defensive end.  
When shots aren't falling, you can still always play defense, I thought they
out-toughed us today and got the 50-50 balls and that was kind of the story at
the end.  
  
Q. Andrew, the beating in the second half of the first five minutes, they
couldn't get any shots to fall. Kind of looked like that was going to be the
time you guys could make a come back. Take me through that period a little
bit.  
ANDREW WARREN: Yeah, it was somewhat the game we played them in our place. We
were down in the half, and got them back in the game with our defense. And if
we wanted to turn this thing around, we had to get some stops, and we did
that. But like coach said, we couldn't get any shots to fall.  
But if you stop them and you can't score, you're down, and the team has more
points than you do. It's harder to strengthen that lead, and we couldn't do
that today.  
  
Q. Sam, did you believe that maybe it was cold shooting or just their
defense that held you from scoring?  
SAM MANISCALCO: I thought it was a little bit of both. Their record shows
they're a great defensive team, sometimes they force you into taking some off-
balance tough shots. But those are shots that some of the time we normally
make. Like I said, unfortunately, they didn't fall for us tonight and that was
kind of the story of the game.  
  
Q. Andrew, you guys started the second half with a lot more intensity than
you started the game. Could you take me through maybe why that was?  
ANDREW WARREN: Well, we were down. We were down in the score, but we had to do
something. So, you know, you control what you do defensively and that's what
we had to do to try to make them and force some turnovers. We had had to get
stops.  
We did that, we just couldn't score, you know. I think we held them in the
50's going through the game. We talked about how we're going to win, keeping
teams in the 50's, maybe low 60's to give ourselves a chance to win. We did
that but didn't convert and make plays.  
Like Sammy said, they got a lot of offensive rebounds and loose balls and
things like that that we needed to come up with to give ourselves a better
chance to win.  
  
Q. Can you speak to this season as a whole and how it's gone for you guys?  
ANDREW WARREN: Like a roller coaster, very up-and-down. We've had good
stretches; we've had bad stretches. And to have a good season, you know, you
have to be consistent. And we weren't very consistent this year. I think
that's something to look forward to working towards for next year this is
Andrew speaking.  
But you never want to say the season was a bad season, there are a lot of good
things that you can pick and choose. There were some highlights that we can
definitely take for next year with the core group of guys we have coming back.
Definitely take this summer and build upon it.  
Sammy's back, Taylor's back, the young freshmen that gave us great
contributions throughout the season, they're all back we can work together and
be healthy this summer.  
I think Coach is excited and looking forward to really helping us come
together and work on some of the things that we need to correct that we
learned from this past season.  
  
Q. Talk about the second half in terms of you had some good looks. You shut
them down defensively. Can you just take us through that?  
COACH LES: You know, I can't fault the effort to start the second half. You
know, we just talked about guys stepping up and making plays and getting their
hands on balls and making them miss and imposing their will on the defensive
end. Then using that energy to get us going in transition.  
You know, it played out exactly the way I wanted it to, we just couldn't
complete some of those point-blank shots. And I think that got a little
frustrating for them also. I wish I could explain it, but it almost seemed
like there was a lid on the basket.  
That intensity that they came out with, I thought was encouraging. Like you
said, if we dropped three or four of those maybe it cuts them to single digits
and gives us a second life.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what your seniors meant to your program?  
COACH LES: They've been great. I think in the locker room for their
contributions of the program, they're great young men. Excellent student-
athletes, they represented our program in a first-class light. We talk about
being a family and that doesn't end when the playing days end, that continues
on.  
So we're proud of all their contributions and thankful. And I think they've
had a good student-athlete experience at Bradley because of the way Bradley
treats our student-athletes.  
  
Q. What are some of the things that you could have done to turn this game
around today?  
COACH LES: I think initially we had some impatience offensively which plays
into a good defensive team's hands. And I think Sammy said it in that, you
know, it was a little bit of both. We missed some shots, so you have to give
credit where credit is due. And their defense is awfully good. It speeds you
up.  
As they were making shots and getting separation, we tried to kind of put our
head down and take matters into our own hands without being patient. That
plays right into their tough, solid, gap defense so they led us down the trail
that allowed them to get some separation.  
  
Q. Yesterday's win seemed like it was such a kind of leave-it-all-on-the-
floor-emotional-type win. Then getting down early today. Was there any
running-out-of-gas type feeling on or anything like that?  
COACH LES: You know, we might have been a little low on energy. But I don't
want to make excuses other than that was an awfully good basketball team, and
we were going to have to play well to win, and we didn't.  
  
Q. I know you're disappointed with today, but can you talk about now we sit
again waiting with the CBI or CIT possibly. Can you talk about the possibility
of extending your season, and would you like to play in one of those
tournaments again?  
COACH LES: I think with the emotion of the game and the aftermath of it, no
decisions have been made. After the weekend I'm sure Dr. Cross and President
Glasser and I will sit down and talk about what's best for the university and
the basketball program, this basketball team, and make a decision going
forward of what we're going to do.  
But we haven't talked about it, thought about it, and I hate to make any
decisions right now after the emotion of a game.  
  
Q. This tournament seemed to present the Bradley season in a microcosm.
Great win yesterday followed by today's effort. Could you just kind of speak
to that statement and how frustrating it must be for the program?  
COACH LES: Well, with youth comes immaturity and inconsistency. I think all
year that's reared its head at different times. Today probably in the first
half it reared its head in different instances. And that's a product of
growing up and the growth process you need to make as a player and just
getting experience.  
So that is something that -- one of the things I told them is just getting a
year older doesn't make us better. There are some things we need to work on
and get better at. And they're not all just physical, some of those are
mental.

### [Ben Jacobson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19538)

### [Marc Sonnen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20541)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Northern Iowa - 57  
Bradley - 40

  
THE MODERATOR: Regular season champions are with us. We'll have Coach Ben
Jacobson give us a brief synopsis of the game, then questions for the two
student-athletes.  
COACH JACOBSON: We were sharper today to start the basketball game. I thought
our offense was quite a bit sharper. Our cutting was better, our movement was
better, our screening was better. And that, obviously, was going to be
important today with the way that Bradley defends. Their man-to-man has been
good. They have the ability to switch their defenses. That really helped us.
Our offense was much sharper today than it was early yesterday.  
I thought the guys defended pretty well. I thought they did a good job of
defending. Didn't rebound well enough in the first half, but I think they
rebounded better in the second half.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you to go to the championship game tomorrow?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: It means a lot. I mean we've been working towards that goal
the entire year. Just finally to realize that we're going to be playing in the
game tomorrow means a whole lot to me and our whole team. We set our goal from
the beginning of the year, and I think we're starting to reach a couple of
them.  
  
Q. There was a stretch there early in the second half where you guys weren't
shooting particularly well and could have let Bradley back into the game. What
were you saying during timeouts and in the huddle that kept your spirits high
and got you back on track?  
MARC SONNEN: Good thing we did,you know we had to pick up and play defense
hard and guard the ball. Try to get into the post and outside shots when we
were working as well. So we tried to do that more and guard the ball and not
give them any easy looks.  
  
Q. There was a point at 8 minutes in the game where you had a 7 or 8 point
lead in the game. How big of a stretch was that and talk about the overall
bench effort from those five guys?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: It was amazing. It's nice to know when you come out of the
game that most of the time they're going to keep the lead or increase it by
five or six or seven points. It's a huge difference in a basketball game where
on three days you're playing a ton of basketball and to have a bench like that
that can score eight, nine points with four different people, that's huge.  
  
Q. You're one of the guys that's been through this and went through it last
year. Going through the regular season and getting to this point in the title
game, was it harder this year because of everybody last year a little out of
nowhere with a 6 and 6 start, was it harder to get to this point than maybe a
year ago?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: It's hard every year to get to this point. I don't think it
was any different than last year. Everybody gives their best. In this league
you have to come in night in and night out. I don't think it was harder this
year than last year. It's been that hard every single year, so.  
  
Q. Other than the North Dakota game where I think you had 20 points, is this
one of the first times all year whereas a freshman you were just out there
playing, and you weren't thinking and you were totally comfortable out
there?  
MARC SONNEN: It could be, but I feel a lot comfortable with my teammates. And
having the coaches in the game we have a lot of leaders on our team, so they
always make you feel comfortable. In this game I hit a few more shots so it
made me feel comfortable. But having teammates like that, they're always
encouraging you to shoot the next one and get the ball on post. They're always
encouraging, so I'm always comfortable out there.  
  
Q. Yesterday you had a sluggish start in the game. Today it was just the
opposite. What made the difference?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: I think it really helped us when we jumped off to that good
start right away when we scored a couple baskets in the beginning. That was
probably one of the biggest things. When we start off good with a couple of
baskets in the beginning of the game, that definitely jump starts our offense.
When one guy makes a shot, the next guy makes a shot, and that's kind of
contagious I guess.  
MARC SONNEN: It's contagious when you have players that are hitting shots. And
after the two games we played against them before we wanted to come out strong
against them and play as hard as we can. We wanted to do the best we can to
have teammates out there hitting shots, playing defense hard. I think they
boost how we play, our toughness and things like that.  
  
Q. Both your games with Bradley this year were tight games. If you could
point to a couple things today that were different, what would they be?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: Probably just our overall defense and rebounding. They're
extremely athletic. They get a lot of offensive rebounds and leave easy
baskets for them. We didn't give up that many easy baskets tonight. Also, I
think Sam is a great player and he's so tough to guard and does so many great
things for them, he was one of our main focuses tonight to kind of slow him
down a little bit.  
  
Q. What does it mean to this team to be the top seed in this tournament?  
MARC SONNEN: It means a lot. We have a lot of seniors that have been working
so hard. Our whole team's doing so good and working so hard together. Having
leaders like that it helps our No. 1 seed to give us encouragement to do good.
We want to do it for all of us. Like the coaching staff and the fans. To be
able to come out and help them do the best we can.  
  
Q. How much fun is it to play with Lucas?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: It's really fun to play with Lucas. You know if you're
setting up a ball screen, you're probably going to get open. So it's always
fun to play with a guy like that. Also you know he's going to give his
A-effort every single night. Night in, night out. Doesn't matter what's going
on, he's always going to be there. He's a guy you can definitely trust on the
basketball court.  
  
Q. You talked about the quick turn around. How much of a factor does fatigue
play with a quick turn around for the Championship game tomorrow?  
MARC SONNEN: Well, that was the first time for me. It's hard playing after
another game after having won last night. But I think playing the earlier game
helped us out get a little bit relaxed. Just us relaxing and spending time
with each other and that and just stretching after the game especially, and
getting the ice that we need. We can relax and get fluids. That helps us out
with the fatigue.  
  
Q. Before the season, Coach had always talked about your conditioning and
how you've kind of upped that this year. Now you're down the road in
tournament play, how much does that focus on conditioning help you guys out
down the road?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: It's definitely helped us. Can you tell with almost all our
players that we were more conditioned than we were in previous years. But also
having that bench behind us. I mean, we only have to play 20 minutes a game,
you have other guys stepping up playing 15, 16 minutes making big plays for
us. It makes it a whole lot easier and we don't need as much rest now.  
  
Q. Talk about playing in the Championship game as well as you played defense
today. Do you have a preference for who you play tomorrow? Does it matter who
you play if you guys play this well?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: We're just excited to be in the championship game. Either
team's going to be a battle. It's always tough with Illinois State. They
haven't had a single game in the double digits, and then Wichita's always
tough. They play a lot like us. It's going to be hard in those games either
way. It's just exciting to know that we're in the championship game already.  
MARC SONNEN: Same thing. I'm just glad to be there and so is our team for how
hard we played. The defense has to play the same for either team we play
against. Both have really good players. So either one we play, they're both
really good teams.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. We'll dismiss you and stay with Coach
Jacobson a while longer.  
  
Q. Did Marc Sonnen and Anthony change so today that your guard court's going
to be in good shape here for the future?  
COACH JACOBSON: I tell you what I like most, they're into the seniors, they're
into the older guys. They do a great job of listening and great job of
learning. When their number is called, they've responded this year. And when
you're in that situation and you're not playing the same minutes every night
or he they really fluctuate, it's hard to be ready hard to perform your
number. When Johnny missed a couple of games with the ankle injury, both of
those guys played very well. Tonight I felt that Anthony James could give us
defensive presence against man Maniscalco. He was ready to do that and he did
a good job.  
I think both guys are just really into their teammates right now.  
  
Q. Maniscalco had a huge game yesterday for 31 points. Did you guys do
anything differently today?  
COACH JACOBSON: We felt we had to get the balls out of his hands as soon as we
could. We kept the ball screen a little longer than we normally do because we
wanted the ball out of his hands. He was terrific yesterday and he really does
a great job with his presence. We made it possible for him without leaving a
bunch of open shots for the rest of the guys.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Marc's development offensively? And specifically
defensively a couple of strips he had early. And your trust in him in big
games like this down the stretch?  
COACH JACOBSON: He came in as a good defender, and I think he's made some
improvements there. And he's playing against juniors and seniors as a
freshman, and they turn the corner on you. Now he's able to guard them without
fouling.  
That's certainly helped him. He's a little farther along offensively, mostly
in terms of making three-point shots. You know, he's always been very good
with the ball in his hands. He's always been able to drive it. He's done those
things very well throughout his career.  
But he's shot the three-point shot well at times when we've needed it. At
Missouri State when we needed it, today when we needed it. He was really good
in that first half. He was terrific. I just think -- he mentioned it. His
teammates have a lot of confidence in him.  
When the older guys, the seniors and juniors have confidence in those
freshmen, whether those freshmen will admit it or not, that's the biggest key.
It doesn't matter what I think. If those juniors and seniors have confidence
in them, that's the difference.  
  
Q. Talk about how this year's tournament and the approach your team's taking
is different than last year? And would you say your team's playing the best
basketball of the year right now?  
COACH JACOBSON: I don't know that our approach has been any different coming
into this tournament. They approach things the same way. Came down here with
the same mindset. Wanted to do everything we could to be playing tomorrow
afternoon on CBS. So really not doing things differently. I guess just the
overall experience that we've got on this basketball team is probably the
difference in what we had last year at this time.  
  
Q. You pride yourself on your defense with this team. But you came out and
shot almost 50% in the first half with just two turnovers. When your on fence
is playing that well, it's got to make the Panthers a tough outing in any
tournament?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, I felt we had some good looks in the second half. Now I
do recall thinking halfway through the first half that Bradley had missed some
open shots as well. Usually when your defense is going really good, the other
team is missing a couple of looks for you, and Bradley had some stuff around
the basket. We were fortunate they missed some of those shots.  
Again, our movement was better offense, our spacing was better offense.
Because of that we were able to get some easy stuff around the rim. Open jump
shots and when you can do that and you make a couple, both guys touched on
that. You make a couple shots early, you set a good screen and get a guy freed
up for a lay-up, when those things happen, that helps your confidence. That
happened in the first half and that was the case.  
  
Q. Could you just say a little something to preview both Wichita State and
Illinois State? What do you see in them having played them twice already this
year?  
COACH JACOBSON: Illinois State has played their best basketball over the
course of the last month. And I think that for two reasons their seniors have
played great, and Tim has brought their team along. They've got good guys,
junior college guys and freshmen that are playing great basketball right now.
They're playing their best basketball over the course of the last month and
present a number of challenges. We all know where they start with Eldridge,
and Odiakosa.  
Wichita State has a very balanced team. They have depth that is productive.
They have a great point guard. They've got size up front and they can bang
you. Their two wings, Murry and Hatch, are two guys, Hatch for sure very
underrated. Murry not as underrated, but I still don't think people give Murry
enough credit for how good he is at both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. A key stretch seemed to be the first five minutes of the second half.
Bradley had a chance. You started off kind of slow offensively. They had a
chance to mount a comeback, but your defense wouldn't allow them to do that.
Can you speak to how your kids -- even though they weren't getting their shots
-- were able to buckle down defensively?  
COACH JACOBSON: That was key. I thought we had a couple of good looks. They
were jump shots, but I felt they were good looks from Ali and Johnny. When you
make a couple of those and it balloons to 20, you have a chance to keep it
from getting really interesting.  
Now we miss those shots -- and we were fortunate on a couple of layoff
opportunities. A couple of transition opportunities to roll out and stay 13
and of 16. If it gets under 10, there was still 14 or 15 minutes left. Bradley
feels that they can win the basketball game. After we got through that five or
six minutes, I think our defense settled in again. We were able to make a
couple of baskets.  
So between getting a couple of rebounds, we were able to do that in the second
half.  
  
Q. Your second team has had a lot of success. How much is that attributed to
Lucas and the way he plays and his unselfish attitude?  
COACH JACOBSON: I think it gives the rest of the bench a lot of confidence.
Because he played so hard and without any fear. All the way down to A.J. and
Marc, this he play that same way. Because of the way Lucas approaches
everything, that has certainly helped the three freshmen coming off the bench.  
You know, Kerwin's terrific. He's had two great years. Because of our
personnel and the way things shake out with our team, he has had two perfect
seasons he's played together here. But Luke's biggest impact has been on the
three freshmen that came off the bench. Just giving those guys that energy and
toughness that helps them as freshmen.  
  
Q. Two games you felt your opponent to 40 points. Does a little more go into
that other than a couple of shooting performances?  
COACH JACOBSON: I felt like today that we did defend. Bradley missed a couple
early and they missed a couple early in the second half.  
Other than those three or four minute stretches, I felt we defended well. We
did a good job with Maniscalco today. Obviously a hard guy to contain. I
thought our guys did a good job of changing things. Every four or five minutes
we changed things in the way we defended our ball screen. Our players were
able to do it. Go out and execute it. So I felt like we defended well both
days.  
  
Q. What is your substitution philosophy? You had four or five subs in early
in every game I've seen you play this year. What is your line of thinking?  
COACH JACOBSON: I'd like to get the four guys in before that first media
timeout. I wanted them to get started before that 16 and under timeout if we
can. I want them on the floor.  
Then tonight with A.J., again, I felt like he was the guy that could help us
defensively. Those four guys have gone in around that 16 minute mark,
sometimes it's the 17 and a half minute mark, depending on how the start of
the game goes. But I want them in early so they can get moving around.  
If that starting group is playing great and we've got it rolling, I'll wait
until after the timeout. But most of the time I want them in before that first
media timeout so they can get things going.  
  
Q. Going back to Lucas, did you get any sense from him that there is extra
motivation for him playing an hour away from his hometown in Nashville and
friends and family?  
COACH JACOBSON: I don't know. I don't know if I know everything that motivates
that guy. He's got it going all the time. He really does. He's extremely close
with his family and his friends. He's that kind of kid. I'm sure that's added
to his motivation.  
But he's tuned in all the time and cranked up all the time. I do know he
enjoys being around his family and friends though.  
  
Q. Scoring 25 points off the bench today, is that going to change the
starting lineup tomorrow or how you use your bench at all?  
COACH JACOBSON: I think we'll stay with the same starting lineup. The guys on
the bench, they have been really good all year, they have. And I just like the
confidence that they play with. I think again they gain a lot of that
confidence from the older guys on our team. There isn't anything with those
five guys that are starting the basketball game, they know what their job is.  
They take a lot of pride in that. The guys on the bench are going to play well
and be productive. If they aren't playing well, that's why we use our bench.
They take a lot of pride in those five guys coming in and playing good
basketball. It's really been a team deal. So we'll continue with that rotation
again tomorrow.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  65  
Illinois State - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: The Illinois State Red Birds are with us. Coach Tim Jankovich
will start with a statement on the game then questions for the two student-
athletes.  
COACH JANKOVICH: Hard-fought game to say the least. Really, really proud of
our guys' effort. The only thing that comes to mind for me was how
disappointed I am for them that the tournament did not turn out as we had
hoped, particularly for the seniors because it's their last go round.  
We've got a group of seniors that certainly deserve to feel the joy and
excitement of what it's like to play in the NCAA Tournament. But just came up
short.  
  
Q. Late in the game you hit a couple of big threes. Could you maybe take me
through the last minute or two of the game where you stepped up and started to
hit some big shots?  
LLOYD PHILLIPS: I was just trying to win the game. Teammates found me, when
your teammates find you, you're supposed to hit shots, but it wasn't enough.  
  
Q. Osiris, can you talk about your hand a little bit? You had it wrapped
early in the game? You took the wrap off. How much did that affect you in the
game today?  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: It was pretty sore. Went up for that block last night and
came down on my elbow and my wrist and sprained it. Just tried to play through
it and do the best I could tonight to just be a play maker and try to play
defense. But I guess that's the type of things you've got to try to play
through when it's crunch time like this.  
Just disappointed we couldn't get it done tonight. But we fought at the end of
the game and rallied pretty hard and put up a fight. I'm proud of all the guys
that helped us and thank Coach Jankovich for being here these last past three
years. If it weren't for him and the coaching staff we wouldn't have none of
this.  
  
Q. Would you credit your one point in the second half to the soreness of
your hand or the defensive approach?  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: I wasn't trying in the second half to try to force anything,
try to find my shot. But I was really trying to get to the basket more. I
didn't want to take any jump shots because I felt how sore my wrist was and it
just wasn't feeling right. And I couldn't get there because the team was
helping on the defensive end. I was just trying to do what I could.  
  
Q. You cut the lead to one four different times in the second half. Can you
talk about not getting over the hump and what affect that had?  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: We had so many chances to go up and tie the game, even
mishandle the ball. Made some minor mistakes, but that's how the game goes.
You fight so hard and just can't get over that hump. But I think everybody
played their heart out tonight and you can't discredit nobody for the effort
they put out tonight.  
  
Q. When you picked up your fourth foul, it kind of swung momentum. Can you
talk about how big that play was?  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: I just tried to be as aggressive as I could guarding. Their
guards and stuff like that when I picked up that fourth foul, I had to slow it
down a little bit and just play a little bit less aggressive and kind of
slowed me down. But it just wasn't the same as having leeway to be more
aggressive and stuff like that.  
  
Q. After losing to UNI last year in the championship game in overtime, can
you talk about how much it would have meant to you to have the rematch with
them?  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: You know, it felt great. You know, it's sad that we lost
tonight, but that's how basketball is. Coaches did a great job of preparing us
in the short time we had for this game. But we fell a little bit short. It's
been great feeling. Playing UNI tomorrow in front of a lot of people just but
we just came up short.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your free-throw struggles during the game? You shot
53% the entire game and 40 in the first half.  
LLOYD PHILLIPS: We just missed them. It's a part of the game. In games like
you've got one possession, two-possession games you've got to have those.
You've got to be able to come up with them. It wasn't one guy's fault, it was
all of our faults.  
Maybe the guys that didn't get a chance, maybe we didn't inspire them enough.
Maybe we didn't give them enough motivation to feel good about themselves and
go up there and knock them down. But it's not their fault. They just missed
them. You miss shots. That's how the game goes sometimes.  
But we still had chances. Even after all the free throws, turnovers, still had
chances to win the game. We just couldn't get over the hump.  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: Kind of what Lloyd said, I think we just walked up to the
line and were thinking about it a little too much instead of just walking up
and putting them down.  
  
Q. Can you reflect on your four years at ISU for us?  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: It's been great. You know, since my freshman year I
experienced a little success. So I mean I can honestly look back and say that
I accomplished a lot. You know, I'm proud of, you know, what I've
accomplished. Just want to say thank you to everybody that had a part of it.  
  
Q. I know it's soon after the game and a tough loss for you guys. Is it
going to be tough gearing up for a game and possibly in the NIT this year?  
LLOYD PHILLIPS: It is tough, you know. You want to play in the big tournament
but, you know, that's a part of me and Dinma's job we've got to get everybody
fired up again to play. If we're not fired up and ready to play, that's our
fault, the older guys.  
It's the younger guys and the new guys they haven't done this before. They've
been a great group of guys. They've worked so hard and came to practice every
day ready to play. Came into the game ready to play. The older guys we've got
to inspire the guys to come back and get back up again and keep playing.  
  
Q. Lloyd and Osiris, it seems like the defense had issues especially in the
first half. Was that unexpected? How did that affect things tonight?  
LLOYD PHILLIPS: We kind of expected it, really. There's not too many guys in
our league that can guard Dinma one-on-one. We played man and we've been doing
a good job of giving them the ball and spacing around them. But we kind of
anticipated a lot of zone. In the first half we were kind of squared up a
little bit, but that's my fault. I'm the point guard. I have to bite down and
handle the pressure and not turn it over. I think I had four turnovers in the
first half, so I was probably more sped up than some of the new guys.  
But they played great defense. They got after us and sped us up a little bit.
We couldn't really get the ball inside to Dinma like we wanted to and that
hurts us when we can't really play to them.  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: Like Lloyd said, we played a little sped up throughout the
game, but also we just had some good looks we couldn't knock them down. They
had a lot of good looks inside that just didn't go. And we just credit them
for the good defense they played. We just couldn't get some of our shots to go
down.  
  
Q. They've run that play and had a lot of success with it. Were you
expecting it or surprised?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Which one?  
  
Q. The home run play that Graham Hatch got the lay-up there.  
COACH JANKOVICH: Yeah, we said it every time out that they were going to go
long. I was expecting it sooner actually. We were in a situation where we were
desperate and we had to try to force them to throw it up for grabs with the
guy on the ball. So we talked about that we talked about that every single
time out.  
  
Q. You guys got to within one numerous times and didn't get over the hump?  
COACH JANKOVICH: I thought that was a great question, by the way. That was the
entire second half how many times we had a chance to change the psychology of
the game and we were not able to. You only get so many of those chances, and
we felt we kept knocking and knocking and knocking.  
Never could take a one point lead to even change the whole feeling of playing
from behind and that type thing. That was unfortunate. But definitely,
definitely we were all feeling that on our bench.  
  
Q. Especially after you ended up making the run towards the end of the game,
can you talk about how important the Garrett Stutz rebound, offensive rebound,
on the missed free throw by Durley ended up being?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Yeah, it was pretty big, yeah.  
  
Q. Being down by ten with a little less than a minute and a half to go and
getting it back down to as close as one or two, what does that say about your
team?  
COACH JANKOVICH: You know, I feel when you lose a game like this and you
reflect back, this is when you realize how much goes into an entire season.
This is when it all hits you. This is when you realize how much heart and soul
everyone in your organization gives for a long, long period of time.  
Through that a team is formed and a chemistry or lack there of, and a work
ethic and a pride in the program, or not. I'm really proud of this team. I
think we've become a very good basketball team.  
And the last minute and a half, I think, demonstrates some of the intangibles
that this team has developed overtime. And I thought that from my perspective,
as badly as you always want to win, truthfully sometimes you win and you
played less than your best. You gave three-quarters effort, and you played
with some selfish thoughts. I don't see any great victory in that.  
But what I try to always judge from our team is all the things that they can
control: Their effort, their energy, their togetherness, their fight, their
toughness, all those things. And I thought we did all of those well enough to
win tonight, every one of them.  
I was very proud of our team. The only thing is we didn't shoot free throws
well enough. That is really the story of the game.  
So many times when we had the opportunities to possibly take the lead and
change the game, we missed free throws. And I would never, ever blame anyone
for that because I can tell you if there's one thing guys are trying to do out
there, it is make a shot when they get a shot. When they get a free throw,
they're trying their hardest to make it.  
Of all the things you can control, making a shot in basketball is the least
thing you can control. So I feel so good about them. I felt great about the
character they showed. And even though it looked insurmountable, it almost
wasn't. I think that to me was a little about our team in a little microcosm.  
  
Q. You were able to bounce back from a pretty bitter defeat last year in a
championship game to play a pretty good game in the NIT. Would you expect that
same resolve after this wound kind of healed?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Yeah, I would out of this team, absolutely because of what I
just talked about. What I think they're made of and how far we've come, the
pride that they have in each other and the program. Definitely I think we'd
bounce back and be thrilled to compete and raise our game.  
I wouldn't think it would be very good if it was tomorrow afternoon, but, you
know, time will heal this somewhat. I also want to say, in case no one asks,
Osiris downplayed his wrist. And in no way -- we lost because we didn't score
enough points -- but Osiris deserves a lot of credit. His wrist is very
swollen. We didn't even know if he could literally take a shot today to bend
his wrist. He can bend it forward, but bending it backwards.  
For you great shooters out there you know you have to bend your wrist
backwards to do anything with it. He didn't know literally until warm-ups if
he could even take a shot in the game.  
And then during the game, of course, he somehow managed to throw a couple in,
but played with tremendous courage. I want to say that because I don't want
people to think that that was him with a healthy hand, because that was not
him with a healthy hand.  
And I felt very badly for him that his last chance, you know, it just seemed
so unfair that his last chance at getting to a NCAA Tournament had to end with
a wrist that was painful, swollen and not as functional as he would like. I
really take my hat off to him watching what he was doing out there. And he's
such a great, great competitor. But I don't want people to think that that was
a healthy Osiris.  
  
Q. Garrett Stutz emerging over the last few weeks, how does that make WSU
more difficult to deal with?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Yeah, if you've got a seven-footer that can score double
figures every night you're in pretty good shape. You can ask Northern Iowa
about that. He's certainly come on and been a real force and a real factor.  
Obviously that kind of size is tough to deal with when someone gets their game
put together, which he obviously has, and I think that's made them -- he's a
different player than we saw earlier, without question. So it's definitely
made them a much -- it gives them one more difficult ingredient. They have
many talented players, many. And that gives them another tough match-up for
you.  
  
Q. Osiris was at ISU when you came. But can you talk about the three years
with him and what he's meant to this basketball program?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Well, you know, Osiris in the three years I don't think
anyone would say anything. But he's had a huge hand in all the success that
we've had. He's had a huge hand. If I'm not mistaken in the last three years
we may have won, I don't know, it might be the winningest -- close to the
winningest period in a three year period. He's had an awful lot to do with
that.  
On top of that he's shown a lot of people in our program how to really
compete. The thing I love about him the most. And believe me there's days when
I wanted to kill him because he's a pretty free spirit on the court. I've
always tried to give him a ton of freedom. That's the way I chose to coach
Osiris from day one, and sometimes, you know, that's not been perfect.  
But when you really look at it, you know, as good a talent as he is, as great
a talent and as great an athlete and all that, but what he is best at to me is
a winner and competitor. He's found so many different ways to help his team
over the three years that I've been here. You know, I'm going to miss him
dearly. I'm going to miss Dinma dearly. You guys all know that. Just can't
fathom going to practice without Dinma there and Osiris because it's been a
long time.  
Lloyd, I want to say this to you, you may not write about it, but Lloyd makes
coaching even more meaningful. Because he was a guy that I think it's well-
documented that I didn't care for his personality all that much last year for
a lot of reasons. And one year later as a senior, he became someone I loved
being around. I loved to coach, I loved his attitude.  
He's going to blame himself. He didn't even shoot a free throw for gosh sakes
and he's blaming himself for free throw shooting. That's where his mind is at.  
So what ends up happening with your seniors -- we were here the other day, and
the three seniors were here -- and you realize that you know the hard part is
you spend all this time and investment and you get so close to them. They
become young men, and you have to say goodbye to them. I'm just unbelievably
appreciative of all three of our seniors have given us.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Northern Iowa  55  
Drake - 40

  
THE MODERATOR: Drake Bulldogs are with us. We'll ask Coach Phelps to make a
statement, then questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH PHELPS: Well, it was an extremely tough game for us. Obviously a
physical game. To summarize the game, I felt like the shots that we were able
to knock down in the first half were good shots. Just from recollection of the
rest of the game I'm not so sure if we didn't also have some good looks the
remainder of the first half and the second half.  
Certainly UNI is an outstanding defensive team. Their numbers confirm that
throughout the season. Points allowed and also field goal percentage defense.  
But we had a couple of shots not go down in the first half. I thought we could
have built a little larger lead. Two that come to mind are Craig Stanley's
leads. One from the right side, one from the left side. Over the course of the
game when you play a physical style of defense which they're very, very
efficient at, the shot typically goes like that. We may have hit most of our
shots in the first half and it evened out in the second half where our
shooting percentage was really poor. But we knew we'd have to make some tough
shots.  
We tried to get to the free-throw line as much as possible. That was intent.
Didn't get there as much as we'd like. But in the end we played an outstanding
team. Regular season Championship. And they had a real identity about who they
are and how they go about their business and they executed that well today.  
  
Q. You guys had a tough win yesterday, very emotional win. Obviously it
looked like you guys were riding that at the very beginning. Did fatigue
finally set in? Because Josh you started off 3 for 3, and then just couldn't
seem like you could get the ball to fall later on in the game.  
JOSH YOUNG: You know, I think that we were, you know as you said coming off
that emotional game. I think that we had some momentum going there in the
first half. But I think that UNI made some adjustments defensively and they
were really able to key in on our shooters and did a good job on our shooters.
I think they made some good looks in the second half, just they were knocking
down shots and that really hurt us.  
RYAN WEDEL: I think fatigue could have been a factor but it's not a good
excuse. There are not any good excuses out there. This is our last game to
play. We were leaving it all on the court, and fatigue wasn't a factor for I
don't think any one of our guys. It's just UNI played a lot better than us
this afternoon. You know, we didn't finish up.  
  
Q. How disappointing was it for your team to go 21:01 without a field
goal?  
JOSH YOUNG: I think the most disappointing part about it is I know how good a
shooter our team can be. I think yesterday in the second half we showed we can
shoot the ball pretty well. Just to not see those shots go down and knowing we
could have knocked them down was kind of frustrating.  
  
Q. You guys ended up finishing the Game 6 of 19. Was there any point in the
first half you thought of stopping shooting threes and trying to work it
inside more?  
RYAN WEDEL: Later in the second half we started to drive more. We got in the
bonus and got some free throws. It was a little too late. We thought we had
great looks and we've just got to knock them down.  
ADAM TEMPLETON: Just to echo what Ryan said and Coach, too. He said that our
intent was trying to get to the line. We were going early. But when you have
those open looks as our team as good of three-point shooters as we are, we
have to take them. That's part of our game, so to answer your question, our
intent was to get to the line. At the same time we were shooting threes when
we were open.  
  
Q. At what point during the game did you guys feel like you were in a
shooting drought? And does pressure start to build and you start to press a
little bit?  
JOSH YOUNG: I'm not exactly sure. It was the mid point there in the second
half where we were really having a tough time knocking down our shots. I think
there were a couple possessions where we really started to press. I know in
particular myself I took a couple possessions myself to score. And kind of got
away from team ball and I think that really hurt us.  
I think we tried to get back to distribute the ball and finding each other,
but once again we were just not able to knock down shots.  
  
Q. Talk about was there a surreal aspect to that drought? You had played
well. No team goes 21 minutes without a basket. How did that play out to you
guys on the floor? Was it kind of surreal?  
  
JOSH YOUNG: As a shooter, one of the things you have to have is confidence.
All of our guys have that. So to not see those shots go down shot after shot
was kind of difficult.  
At the same time, when the shots are falling, you have to hold the Fort on the
defensive end, and we weren't able to do that either.  
  
Q. Has it set in yet that you've played your final game for Drake?  
ADAM TEMPLETON: It definitely has set in. There are already a few tears
dropping in the locker room. It's hard to believe five years for me and four
years for Josh have already gone by.  
What I can say is I've had a hard remarkable time here at Drake University
with great teammates and great coaches that care about each other, and it will
always be remembered.  
RYAN WEDEL: To echo off of that, there were some tears shed. I sat in the
locker room the past three years, and when you get to the last game of the
season, you see it's an emotional time for the seniors. I thought to myself
that probably won't happen to me. But as I look at it now being here, it's the
thing that you're going to miss is the experiences you have with these people.
All the interaction with your teammates and your Coaches, your strength and
conditioning people, all the people you see every day.  
So I think as I started to think about that it was kind of emotional. Even
being able to deal with the media on a daily basis during our games is
something I'm going to miss.  
I want to thank you guys right now. I won't get you guys in the room together.
So I appreciate everything you've done for myself and my team these past four
years. It's been great. I guess it's kind of surreal now that it's over.  
  
Q. How would you best describe your four years?  
JOSH YOUNG: I'd say it's been amazing. You know, I've had difficult times in
my career, but I think that the difficult times is what's made me stronger.
Ups and downs and I've always had people that have given me support. My
family, my teammates, my coaches. So I wouldn't trade my experience here for
anything.  
  
Q. Talk a little about UNI in terms of how far can this team go in the
tournament? And when they get to March, how far can this team go?  
COACH PHELPS: They're good. They're a very good defensive team. They have good
balance on fence. Making it to the NCAA Tournament, they'll have to get a
couple of breaks. You typically make your own breaks. They're a smart team,
very well coached.  
Having said all of that, they could cause some havoc in the tournament.  
  
Q. On that note, there was some national pundits saying UNI either needed to
win today or win the whole tournament. What statement did they make today
about the tournament worthiness, I guess?  
COACH PHELPS: They didn't have to make a statement today. Their body of work
up to this point clearly puts them as one of the best teams in the country and
clearly one of the 65 teams that will get invited to the tournament. They
didn't have to win today in my opinion. They're a very good team. I don't know
if he has a lot of company with that opinion.  
  
Q. In the first half you guys had an 11-point lead, dwindled down to one
point at halftime. What happened in the second half? That drought happened,
but what changed in the second half compared to the first half?  
COACH PHELPS: More of what happened at the end of the first half. We missed
shots. When we missed shots there's always a combination of why that happened.
Certainly defense has to play a large role in that in their ability to defend
at a high level. And then sometimes you just miss shots.  
So that drought continued, and we'll look at the film and we'll evaluate it
and learn from it for the future. But I certainly can't break it down fully
for you right here to why it happened.  
  
Q. Everybody kind of poo-pooed the tired legs theory, which is a popular one
when you have to play in games in two games that close together. Did you see
any short shots?  
COACH PHELPS: There were some short shots late. But I thought we did a really
good job last night. I think guys were talking to the sandman about 9:30. They
didn't get up until 8:15 this morning. They were full of fluids, full of food.
I thought our training staff did a great job.  
I'm sure UNI was a little fresher but fatigue, I don't see that playing a
major role in today. I think it was more those guys and the way they defend
and their physical nature.  
  
Q. You obviously had some good young players with Seth and Ryan coming back.
But have you thought about it a little bit of going on? This program moving
forward now without Josh Young?  
COACH PHELPS: Yeah, I'm going to miss him a lot. He's, you know, the poster
child for what we want to do on the court, off the court, in the classroom,
leadership-wise. We're going to miss him a lot next year.  
Not just his 15 points a game, we're going to miss him in a lot a lot of ways.
The other thing he's done is left a legacy for the Young guys to follow in his
footsteps and become leaders themselves. So we'll miss him a lot.

### [Jermaine Mallett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20537)

### [Cuonzo Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20518)

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  73  
Missouri State - 63

  
COACH MARTIN: Thank you. That was a tough, physical game both ways. Both teams
played hard, competed, Wichita State won it down the stretch. I thought it was
physical on both ends of the floor, and the referees let us play. Couple key
stops down the stretch, and they played well.  
  
Q. Against Wichita State, the narrow differences, what do you think was the
ultimate difference in all three?  
KYLE WEEMS: I think all together there were probably nine or ten plays
combined in all three of those games that were not necessarily them, but it
was just our break downs. You know, started by helping out of the corner,
helping uphill. Just a little foul in the bonus, little things like that they
got to us.  
  
Q. Go back to last year and just kind of what did you guys learn from last
year's experience? Just with the whole season the way the season went and
losing the first game here? You guys won last night. What has been the
difference between the 20-loss season last year and the 20-win season this
year. Where you guys are going to be in a postseason tournament now?  
KYLE WEEMS: We've got six or seven new guys, so of course that helped. You
know, and people like myself. And Coach even had another year under his belt,
and you I think that helped a lot.  
  
Q. How'd you view it? You had a four-point lead with five minutes to go.
Then they scored two free throws and another basket. Was it a lack of
defensive stops that turned it?  
COACH MARTIN: Oh, yeah. They were just staying the course of the game. Just
minding mistakes and break downs. That's what cost us.  
  
Q. You got it together, that's a pretty good offensive lineup for them. Can
you talk blood pressure the challenge guarding those two offensive players?  
KYLE WEEMS: They're both really good players. Stutz is big and strong, so
those two together we did a good job on them. Pretty key moments of the game,
we knew coming out that they were going to try to go inside early in the
second half and they did a good job of that. For the most part we did a good
job on those two.  
  
Q. I'm sure Coach talks all the time about being tough mentally and
physically. And I'm curious, three games against Wichita State you got five
half as that are just toe to toe to toe. The first half you played at your
place they pretty much took it to you. I wonder if that first half where they
just man handled you so bad toughened you up for the rest of the season?  
KYLE WEEMS: I think we were a tough team without that first half. But it
opened up our eyes and let us know that we can't come in and flat out out-
talent people. That is not the nature of on our team. Coach demands being
physically tough and both physically and mentally. And I thought for the
course of the season we've done that. But you're right. It opened up our eyes
that first half in our place pretty much for the rest of the season I thought
we got back to playing the way we play.  
  
Q. For the two student-athletes, is there any consolation knowing that you
guys will play another game this month. Talk about the prospect of being in a
postseason game this season or this year?  
JERMAINE MALLETT: You know, it's an honor. Coach always says tomorrow's not
guaranteed. Of course we came here with our eyes set on one prize and that was
to be celebrating around 3:00 on Sunday. But we felt that we fell short and
now the next step, whatever step that is, we're going to compete and battle
and stay together.  
KYLE WEEMS: It's a learning process for us. We lost but we've got to get back
in the game and finish out the season and we have the postseason or whatever.  
  
Q. You guys have talked about how tough you are as a team. But you have 16
lead changes. Can you speak about as a team what that says about you and your
program?  
JERMAINE MALLETT: It says a lot. Coach always preaches defense, defense. And
that's what we did. But we'd break down sometimes, but like on the offense we
move the ball and get what we want, and sometimes we don't. When we listen, we
do good. We execute. So I think that says a lot about our program, the
discipline.  
  
Q. Tonight you were very aggressive for offense and defense. Talk about
tonight versus from last night to tonight on. It seemed that you were more
aggressive offensively tonight. Talk about that a little bit.  
KYLE WEEMS: Oh, yeah, Coach.  
JERMAINE MALLETT: Oh, yeah, Coach Martin talked about being on the on fence.
Tonight was like every other game. Came out aggressive. Were making shots and
the guys kept telling me keep going, keep going. That's what I did, so.  
  
Q. This obviously isn't the first time you've been in a close game, hasn't
gone your way down the stretch. Can you find a common ground that you can put
your finger on and why it happened again?  
KYLE WEEMS: It goes back to our own break down. It's a tough piece to bite.
But we've got to stay together and get better in practice. But it's just those
little plays. Not boxing out, not getting the on offensive rebound or helping
out in the corner, just little things like that that add up to a couple of
close losses over the season.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that basket that Stutz had with 52 seconds left with
that foul that put them up 4?  
KYLE WEEMS: It was big. The foul is just part of the game. But we still had a
chance. And I thought I made a good play on the ball. And that's the down fall
last minute of the game. But give credit to Stutz and his team for pulling out
the victory.  
  
Q. A 20-win season this year, could you talk about last year compared to
this year? Particularly the vision that Coach had in hiring you and being in
the position that you are today to lead young men?  
COACH MARTIN: Well, as far as the hiring, it's a blessing and I'm grateful for
the opportunity. Missouri State for giving me an opportunity. But as far as
the program from last season to this season, you're building the keys, and you
have to be able to recruit and identify guys.  
It's easy to say let's get a couple of quick guys that can score a lot of
points, might have some character issues and that assort of thing. But when
you're trying to build for the long haul you have to get the right guys and
add some substance to them. The wins will come, but you have to build a
foundation first. You don't want a situation where you win a couple and four
or five guys get in trouble off the court. You have 15, 20 wins, next thing
you lose a couple of guys and you're down to 12. That's not a program or
foundation for us.  
We need to find quality guys. But as far as the 20 wins when you're trying to
be a champion, that's expected. I don't think going into the season I would
have said 20, because you don't know what you have until you're with 7 new
guys and you go through and Kyle Weems trying to find his way. Justin is the
one lone guy that played a lot of minutes at this level. He was a solid role
guy. But I thought our guys came in, competed and they bought what were
selling as a staff. That is always key when your guys are buying what you
sell.  
  
Q. Any consolation knowing you're going to have more basketball to play? And
what about the opportunity to coach in the postseason?  
COACH MARTIN: It's a great opportunity for our guys. Especially when you have
a lot of guys. When you have your whole roster coming back, it's good for
those guys to get their reps and they'll continue to play together. They hurt
after this loss. They felt we came here to win this tournament and we came up
short. That's part of that. But any time you continue to play and your team
continues to grow, it's always a bonus.  
  
Q. Going back to media day you said coming into this season there were some
things that you needed to work on and learn as a coach. I hear in your second
season as a Head Coach, what things did you personally learn this year?  
COACH MARTIN: I think the key as a coach is the flow of the game.
Understanding your personnel. Understanding your opponent. You can learn a lot
against your opponent how they coach their style, how they're calling
timeouts, what play they're running. Second time around you know what your
opponent is running, and you know the players and the situation. That is the
biggest key. We're just actually going through it.  
I don't care what kind of program you come from. A National Championship
program or things like that. When you look at the history of guys that come
from a championship program, they don't have a lot of success. It has a lot to
do with you and building the program.  
You can go down the track record of the last five teams that won a National
Championship and the assistant coaches where they went and got a job and
whether they win or lose in games it has to do with you building a program,
building a foundation and understanding what you're trying to do.  
If you don't have a foundation, you look around the country and you fall
short. You have to believe in something. You have to be consistent in what you
believe in. It's defense for us. And I thought our guys have gotten better
late in the season. What we try to teach is tough. But our guys will be a lot
better because they've been through it. And it's not easy when you demand guys
to defend one-on-one for 40 minutes consistently throughout the game and
carrying out assignments and it's part of it.  
  
Q. You're thinking three with 7:30 left. Did you know it was that long? Can
you talk about that kind of dry spell in a game?  
COACH MARTIN: I didn't. As long as we were aggressive, I didn't know it was
that long. I thought we were getting good looks and we rushed a come. But I
tell guys we're going to miss shots. But you can't hang your hat on that.
Square your feet up. Get the ball inside, get the post feed. But I won't say
we haven't had a shot in this many minutes because they start thinking about
it. For us on the defensive end, that's where we hang our hat. We had three
break downs on the defensive end, and that was a part of it. And I think
that's part of his growth. He got a foul on Hannah, and he got a one-on-one.
That was the play he came off the screen, and Hannah came to the basket, got
the foul and the shot fake. And he got it all three times.  
It's just part of it. He has to learn. He has to go through it. It's just one
of those situations.  
  
Q. Jermaine and Kyle both fouled out at the end of the game. Can you talk
about how hard it is to operate at the end of the game when two of your
players are in foul trouble late?  
COACH MARTIN: It's tough to do. But the thing we tell our guys is you're all
on scholarship. You're here to play and perform. Ryan came and gave us big
minutes. The guys in foul trouble gave us big minutes. That's what you're here
to do. Give us big plays. I don't see us having bench guys that get into the
game. These guys produce and perform every practice. And I thought Isaiah did
a good job. He'll battle for the start. You don't play seven or eight games
this season, and throw it in the tank and say I'll give it up and wait till
next season. Those guys continue to stay the course and continue to compete in
practice. And that's what you're looking for. Jerome told Mallett I'm going to
get that position. When you're building a championship caliber program, those
are the things you have to go through and those are the guys you have to have.  
  
Q. Wichita State did a decent job on Creekmore tonight. He was 1 for 7 from
the field. Was that more something they did? Or just inexperience in not
getting the ball to them?  
COACH MARTIN: I think you have to give credit where it is due. I would have to
say it's something they did. If he was open, nobody's guarding him, he'd make
those lay-ups. You have to give those guys credit.  
For him, getting the emotional rush and the shot, he's playing it, as opposed
to playing basketball. I tell guys all the time you can't worry about your
miss. If your man's missing, you're fine. But you can't miss your man and he's
scoring. Then you should be upset.  
It's one of those deals where he has to keep his composure. Of but Isaiah
Rhine came in and gave us good minutes. But I don't think we got the offensive
block we needed to.  
  
Q. I thought it was interesting last night, you didn't seem overly impressed
with the 20 wins. And I was serious about what kind of goals you have for your
team. It's easy for them to focus on 20, and you're winning championships and
that's the goal.  
COACH MARTIN: That's the goal to win a championship. When I took over that was
the goal. Not to be just competitive. You want to be a champion. That is the
ultimate goal for them. It's a blessing to have 20 wins. Our guys have to
understand we try to be the best team in Missouri Valley. That is the bottom
line. We have the foundation and the piece to do that. Those 20 wins, we're
grateful for it, but our guys are upset right now. The last thing on their
mind is 20 wins. They're upset. They don't want to go eat tonight. That's what
I want to see as a coach. That's when you know those guys are making progress
in the paint and loose games.  
But you know, it's grateful and a blessing. That is a credit to the players
and the staff. But more importantly it's identifying guys when you're
recruiting. A lot of guys can put the ball on the basket, but can he they fit
into what you're trying to do? Will they go to class every day? And those are
the things that you're trying to identify.  
  
Q. I asked the guys about the inability to finish down the stretch. Is there
something kind of common theme that you've seen develop over the season and
why it happened again today?  
COACH MARTIN: Not really. I told our guys when we put ourselves in position,
we have to go ahead and win it. Like I said, those key break downs with Nafis
Ricks, they have to understand you've got to be solid. I can't yell in your
ear get ready, watch the back swing. You have to have the discipline and
understand this is what I'm doing. I know what they're doing. This is plan B,
second option. The guys understand what they're doing. You have to have the
discipline. I've got to contain my guy. I can't rely on the help behind me.
I've got to be a weak side, I've got to be off it.  
It's tough. One thing about man-to-man defense, you have to be able to trust
your guys. You have to know okay when I do this, for 72 years I didn't
understand what Coach "K" was trying to do. I was on the high school team, we
were playing. I was always faithful going to my back screen making lay ups.
And I was guarding my guy. It's not easy. You have to be trustful. You feel
like you're on an island. Coach, I'm here.  
The thing is you have to be at a certain place at all times and it's not easy.
It's quick. You have to understand and make quick decisions because the other
team runs an offense, and you have to understand what's going on.  
  
Q. What kind of practice routine do you anticipate during a week in limbo?  
COACH MARTIN: For us we'll take a couple days off. It will just be all skill
work really. Just a lot of offensive skill work. Things we do all the time to
try to develop the offensive skills. I think we're getting it offensively.
Making moves off the drill. Penetrating, pitching, jump stop, not turn the
ball over. I thought we had a great season. One of the better assist to
turnover ratios in the country. That's what it's about. Taking care of the
basketball.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2010

  

### [Jim Les](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16450)

### [Chris Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20531)

### [Andrew Warren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20485)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Bradley  81  
Creighton - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Jim Les, Andrew Warren and Chris Roberts. Coach
Les will open with a statement, and questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH LES: Just really proud of the effort of this group. In particular on on
the defensive end of the floor. It's something that we were talking about all
week, and I thought in the previous two meetings, you know, we didn't put our
best foot forward like we can defensively. These guys were challenged to do
it, and whenever they're challenged, they respond.  
These two guys beside me led the way defensively in making plays. That's a
great sign.  
  
Q. You guys were switching up defenses a lot throughout the game. Can you
kind of take us through your preparation for this game? Obviously having
played them was that part of the strategy to kind of mix it up some?  
ANDREW WARREN: I think overall we just wanted to play good defense. No matter
what scheme we were playing because the last two times we've played them we
didn't really have the effort. We were missing assignments on guys as far as
matchups. We weren't playing them the way we should have played them. That was
just the focus.  
We know it's hard to beat a team three times. We had to learn something over
the first two losses to them. We just came out with a lot of effort and
intensity, and we just executed defensively. And I think a lot of what we did
bothered them, and that's why we were successful tonight.  
  
Q. Coach and Andrew both mentioned defense as the difference from your two
losses to Creighton. But just what about offensively? Off obviously you scored
more points this time than you have before?  
CHRIS ROBERTS: Defense is a big part of our offense. I mean, we can create
offense off our defense. But just offensive rebounding, being aggressive
offense, that's what really helped us.  
  
Q. When Maniscalco started having cramps, how did you guys that were on the
floor start to make up for his presence being gone? He really had a hot hand
in it. How did you atone for him not being on the floor?  
ANDREW WARREN: Any time that somebody goes down we're always taught somebody
has to step up ask that's what we did. We just had guys step in and continue
to stay aggressive offensively. I hit a couple of shots, Chris was aggressive
driving the basketball, and brown got some shots and it was three in a row,
and found a roll man a couple of times. Anytime someone goes down, somebody
has to step up, and we had good contributions from Jake Eastman, and Edwards,
the two freshmen. So any time somebody goes down, we're taught to step up, so
a lot of guys did that tonight. A couple of guys filled in and we were able to
keep it rolling.  
  
Q. Creighton regained the lead and you got that rebound dunk that really got
the crowd going, and can you describe that play and what happened after
that?  
CHRIS ROBERTS: We were rebounding hard and being aggressive. And I knew the
dunk would spark our team, and that was for our team and our fans to get
going.  
  
Q. For both players, the decision to wear the black uniform today, have you
guys planned this for a while?  
CHRIS ROBERTS: I think it was a last minute thing, we didn't know about it.
Coach surprised us or whatever, so we just suited up and played. You're in
love with these black uniforms. I got a lot of questions after the Illinois
State game. But we like them. We were surprised we only brought our red and
white and went to breakfast this morning. So thank you for allowing us to wear
these. You know, I don't know. So many jerseys or something that gets us amped
up, so we like the different look, so hopefully we can keep wearing them with
the win today.  
  
Q. Can you talk more about crashing the boards in the second half and how
offensive rebounds played into your strategy down the stretch?  
ANDREW WARREN: Well, they hurt us with their offensive rebounding early on.
And even early in the second half. Later we started boxing out and getting a
few more defensive rebounds. But offensively you know Chris sparked us several
times. Even when we had the lead late, we had a couple of big offensive
rebounds and able to on kick it back out and run some time off the clock and
we ended up scoring. So it pushed our lead up further.  
Anytime you're able to do that and teams make a run late, that is a momentum
killer for the other team, and we had some big rebounds. Taylor and Chris
really stepped up and got us some big offensive rebounds and we really killed
their momentum when they were trying to get a comeback in the second half.  
  
Q. 27 for 28 from the free-throw line. Anything different you guys have
worked on?  
COACH LES: Who missed one?  
  
Q. Sam.  
COACH LES: Oh, well, not playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Chris, comment on the free throws, please.  
CHRIS ROBERTS: That was very big for us. I mean, it was a spark offensively
when he knocked down the free throws, we buckled up on defense. So that was a
big spark for us.  
  
Q. If you can just speak to beating Creighton. Kind of your nemesis this
year, and you guys hadn't even had a lead on them until the end of the first
half this year. Can you just speak to obviously on the big stage what it means
to beat Creighton?  
ANDREW WARREN: We wanted to beat whoever was in our way today. We wanted to
beat them. Was it last year or the year before last we lost to them down here.
Lost to them in the regular season twice this year.  
It's not so much about beating Creighton. When you come to the tournament,
whoever you're facing, you want to beat them. But I guess we could use this as
a victory for next year. But we wanted to beat them. It didn't matter today
whether it was any other team in our league, we wanted to do the best we could
at trying to beat whoever it was, and it happened to be Creighton today.  
  
Q. You guys seemed to really feed off the crowd's energy today. Can you talk
about what a big enthusiastic crowd it is that helped your play?  
ANDREW WARREN: It was very big for our fans. For them to come down and support
us. They've been supporting us all year. So we just feed off whoever is
supporting us. Like I said, we're one big family, so it helped us a lot.  
  
Q. Big challenge tomorrow against Northern Iowa. Can you speak to obviously
you've played well against them this year. Can you just speak to that
rematch?  
CHRIS ROBERTS: Yeah, we're looking forward to the challenge. We've proven that
we can beat this team and we've done so in the past. We know that it's
elevated down here at the tournament. So we're just going to have to go
tonight, watch some film, and get physically rejuvenated and be ready for them
tomorrow. They're a tough team. They're not the No. 1 team in our conference
for no reason. They've proven that. We have to execute like we did today and
do the same thing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Have you ever had a guy get three free throw attempts three times in one
game? And second of all could you just talk about getting to the line and
making all of those shots making the difference today?  
COACH LES: Well, first of all, Sammy's a ton coming off ball screens, and he's
really worked hard at his set up and reading ball screens. They were really
chasing hard over the top. When you chase hard and he rises up and shoots it,
the momentum carried him in. So I thought he was smart based on how they were
playing him and trying to take advantage of that. He's a really good free
throw shooter. Him getting to the line is a positive for us and our whole
team.  
We just talked about being aggressive and being in attack mode. Whether they
were in match-up, man-to-man, we wanted to get paint touches with our dribble
drive and read and make good basketball plays. You know, we've got some guys
that are awfully good off the dribble. And I thought getting in the bonus
early in the second half and continuing to put that pressure on allowed us to
get to the line. You know, we think we've got some pretty good shooters, too,
and they knocked them all in.  
  
Q. Can you talk more about being aggressive and how getting in the bonus so
early in the second half affected your game plan down the stretch?  
COACH LES: We're the type of team that I think we can score in a variety of
ways. We don't necessarily have a low-postgame. But the ability to get paint
touches off the drive and then kickout's or get to the basket and get multiple
drives is for us as effective as maybe having a low-post score. So that's
maybe how we substitute getting paint points.  
I look at the numbers and we have 28 paint points. We don't really have a
post-up player, but we get them off our dribble drive and that is multiple
opportunities to get into the paint. And I thought our aggressiveness to do
that. You know, then you pick up some fouls and guys are aggressive attacking
the rim.  
  
Q. Obviously big game tomorrow against UNI. What do you take from this game
to bring to that one?  
COACH LES: Well, I think what we take is on our defensive effort and
intensity. This team can really defend and create some havoc on that end of
the floor. We've got to stay with that formula. And that defense helps create
some offense for us.  
We know how good Northern Iowa is especially with their defense, and it's
going to be a defensive grinded-out struggle tomorrow and we're looking
forward to it.  
  
Q. I know you were talking about your scoring in the paint. But after that
first five or six minutes did you think you'd come away with a positive in the
paint? Holding Lawson and all those guys quiet in the second half?  
COACH LES: Well, I thought and we had a couple of timeouts early to talk about
it. I just thought they were the aggressor. And tonight over the course of 40
minutes whoever was going to establish themselves as the aggressor was going
to win the game. Initially they had us back on their heels and they're a good
basketball team.  
I like the fact that this team weathered that storm. They just continued to
battle. And then establish themselves as the aggressor, and that was the
difference from probably middle of the first half on.  
  
Q. You got on Eastman a little bit in the first half. He responded on some
big plays for you. Can you talk about his game?  
COACH LES: Well, Jake -- both freshmen guards, Jake and Dyricus gave us a lot
either starting or coming off the bench. Jake's playing with a lot of
confidence. And those guys really respond. They respond when you get after
them and challenge them. He's been a play maker for us.  
When he gets on the floor I thought our run as being the aggressor started
with him getting on the floor, getting after the loose ball. He gets the
rebounds, takes the ball to the basket strong, and that's what you need off
your bench. Those guys being freshmen, had they know how important they are to
this team and they're responsible for production and they generally produce
for us.  
  
Q. Couple key points in the game, end of the first half when you went on
that flurry and took the lead and then I guess you were up 4 in the second
went on that 14-0 run and caused turnovers in that stretch. Can you talk about
both of those periods?  
COACH LES: I thought we just became very stingy defensively. And we did for
one stretch there finish our defense and hold them just to one shot. During
that span I think Sammy got hot. We called his number a few times running some
ball screens. He knocked in a couple of threes and combined that with some
stingy defense, it allowed us to get the lead at halftime.  
Then I thought Chris really established us defensively in the second half. I
told him after the game I thought his activity was unbelievable to start the
second half, and that is infectious. When a guy puts that much effort. And we
all know, those of us around our program, how dominant he can be defensively
getting his hands on balls and making plays and lo' and behold now we get out
in transition and get some fast breakpoints and get Creighton back on their
heels.  
But I think it started with our defense in both those segments.  
  
Q. Talk about the black uniforms?  
COACH LES: Well, I'm giving all the blame to Rob Bogardus on the plane coming
home from Creighton who was adamant about breaking went to Sammy and asked him
if it mattered. It really doesn't matter to me, Sammy thought for some guys it
would matter. I let Mike cross carry that football to President Glasser's
office and decide how we wanted to handle it. I don't care if we wear the
short shorts. As long as they play. So I think it was that. It was not a big
deal to me, but the guys seemed to like it.  
We're not trying to change our colors; okay. I'm entrenched in this tradition
in history as much as anybody else. So I believe Bradley red and white, but if
we've got to mix in black for a little motivator, I guess that's okay.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2010

  

### [Dwayne Lathan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20539)

### [Harry Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20491)

### [Kevin McKenna](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20490)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Illinois St. - 69  
Indiana St. - 65

  
COACH McKENNA: Well, I think Illinois State showed that they are a good team,
and you know, real athletic team. They really capitalized on our turnovers.
Again, I think we had 12 turnovers, which is a decent number for us, but they
scored 20 points off those turnovers.  
I think that number kind of -- that's what kind of turned it right before the
half is they got their heads up, and we had done a great job of I think of
controlling tempo, changing our defenses and just keeping them off balance
till that point.  
Obviously Harry hurt his foot real early in the game and wasn't close to being
the explosive athlete that he is, and you know, that hindered him and hurt us.
But he tried and he battled and he tried to give us what he could and he gave
us what he could. You know, he's a heck of a competitor. We got some really
good seniors, Harry and Rashad and Josh, I'm proud of them for hanging in
there and we gave Illinois State a run for their money.  
  
Q. Can you describe when the injury occurred and what effect it had on
him?  
HARRY MARSHALL: It happened early in the first half I think before the second
media timeout. It's the same thing that happened four weeks ago. Just stepped
on somebody's foot. I think re-stress fractured or however you want to say it.
Just affected my quickness, like Coach said, my explosiveness. I just wanted
to give it all, give my teammates a burst to see me out there and let them
know that I was out there fighting with them.  
  
Q. Dwyane, can you describe the last five minutes or so of the first half?
You played good defense on Illinois State, they were under 20 percent from the
field, as Kevin mentioned, a couple turnovers got them rolling; can you
express your disappointment in the fact they were able to get back in it and
get their momentum back?  
DWAYNE LATHAN: I felt like we was sticking to the scouting report the whole
time. Everybody was doing what we was supposed to be doing. Everybody was
playing like we was supposed to be playing. But we just let a couple mistakes
just compound into more of them. And a good team like that, you have too many
mistakes and too many turnover, give them a chance to get a run in, they are
going to do that. They are going to make a good run just like we would if it
was the other way around.  
  
Q. Dwayne, did you feel like Illinois State played a little bit off the
momentum they had in the first half and translated to their defense in the
second half and maybe forced you guys into some shots that were maybe a little
rushed or in a hurry?  
DWAYNE LATHAN: I give them a lot of credit. They played a good game, but I
feel like -- I feel like we hurt ourselves just as much as they did with the
turnovers and some of the missed assignments and missed block outs. They are
still a good team, but I felt like we just slipped up a couple of times that
we shouldn't have.  
  
Q. What was the key to the fast start you guys had tonight?  
COACH McKENNA: Well, I think, you know, our plan was to guard their ball
screens a little different. You know, we had guarded a certain way the
previous two times, and we had been working on some other things. And then we
zoned some and just tried to really keep them off balance and I thought we did
a good job of that.  
Coach Cunningham and all of our coaches just kind of put together something
that we thought would be effective, and it was. You know, not having Harry at
full strength really hinders our team, our ball handling isn't near as good.
But you look at what Harry did guarding, in my opinion, one of the best
players in our league and holding them for 10-for-39 for three games, that's
pretty darned good. And if he's not an all defensive player, or if not the
best defensive player in our league, leading scorer in our league -- you know,
to me, he's a top player in this league, no question. He proved it all year
long. It's just too bad that he got hurt tonight.  
Not to take anything away from Illinois State; I would have liked to have seen
what Harry could do at full strength for this whole game. But that's just part
of kind of what we've dealt with all year, tough injuries that we try to
overcome and like I said our guys battle and I'm proud of their effort.  
  
Q. Seemed like the momentum Illinois State took into the half time was
translated into their defensive side in the second half; did you see that from
your perspective?  
COACH McKENNA: You know, we still didn't create enough offense from our
defense like they did. I mean, again, 12 turnovers that we had led to 20
points. You know, their 11 offensive rebounds was 15 points. Last time those
two stats was 44 points.  
We did a better job and cut it down, but that's still a big number. We talked
about cutting the number in half. We weren't able to do that. The turnovers
led to direct points. When we had a lot of momentum -- we had a lot of stuff
going. We had a lot of things going, when it was 28-16, we had them back on
their heels at both ends.  
You know, defensively, I thought -- heck, we held them to 35 percent. We
fouled a little bit too much there -- we did foul at the end probably four or
five times because we had to to try to stay in the game but we still fouled a
little bit too much and just made a few mistakes here and there that cost us.  
  
Q. You walk away from this one knowing that the season probably will
continue in some fashion. What's your take on that, and do you know to what
extent Harry might be able to play if you guys do go on?  
COACH McKENNA: I would like to say we are going to play again and we are going
to pursue any kind of tournament we can. We want to play. Our guys want to
play. I've talked to Ron about wanting to play. He's in agreement with that. I
think we are a tournament-worthy team. I think we showed that tonight.  
Obviously, you know, Harry will get checked out when we get back. I was
worried about hurting Harry worse. I didn't want him to hurt himself. I didn't
want him to feel like he had to give us something when he really couldn't. You
know, it's a fine line between knowing what's inside of that young man and
having it hurt him even more or hurt our team. You know, we'll have the docs
check him out when we get back and hopefully for Harry's sake he has some more
games left in him.

### [Ali Farokhmanesh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19619)

### [Ben Jacobson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19538)

### [Johnny Moran](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20524)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Northern Iowa  55  
Drake - 40

  
THE MODERATOR: The victorious Panthers are with us, and Ben Jacobson is here.
Toward student-athletes. The procedure is the same. We'll have Coach Jacobson
open up with a statement, and then we'll go to questions for the student-
athletes and then we'll go to more questions with the coach.  
COACH JACOBSON: Thank you. You know, Drake obviously got off on to a nice
start, and I think we saw the advantage of playing the game on this floor
early with the way that Drake played and making shots and playing well. And
fortunately our defense kicked in a little bit. I thought we guarded pretty
well the last 30 minutes of the basketball game. Fortunate they missed a
couple of shots, and Josh Young got them off to a good start.  
Obviously, this league is going to miss Josh. One of the finest players to
play in this league. In all aspects. One of the best players, but one of the
finest kids to play in this league. Our league is going to miss Josh. He got
them off to a nice start, and fortunately again our defense kicked in and was
good down the stretch.  
  
Q. You're a defensive guy. Have you ever seen a game shift or just change
that abruptly? From you guys down 11, till you look at the scoreboard and you
are up 10. And you did it with defense.  
JOHNNY MORAN: Yeah, that's definitely unusual. They came out, they were
hitting every shot. We slowed down and gathered ourselves, and defensively we
just stepped it up. We knew that was going to win us the game. The defense
always does. And we found ourselves on the shots and the ball started bouncing
our way.  
  
Q. At what point did you say to yourself, man, it's been a while since these
guys scored?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: I don't think we really noticed it that much. We were just
more focused on getting stops. We were not looking up the score a whole lot.
But it was probably just -- it was probably just more that we were looking at
getting stops than anything. We weren't looking at the score and thinking
about it as much. It was more the Coach was focusing in on getting one stop at
a time. And it carried over to one stop, two, three, four, and then, you know.  
  
Q. What did you guys do different in the second half with your defense than
what you did in the first half?  
JOHNNY MORAN: We didn't really change much. We just came out more aggressive,
I think. We had that run in the first half and the energy from that carried
over and we started playing with more energy, and that really helped us out.  
  
Q. Talk a little about that sequence. You hit a three, I think Johnny draws
a foul and you hit a ball later. Can you take me through that sequence a
little? Because obviously six quick points.  
JOHNNY MORAN: It comes under the hustle. Luke got the offensive rebound and
kicked it back out to me. And Johnny's just always making plays that probably
a lot of people don't notice out there. But everyone on our team noticed it.
So he makes that play and my teammates find me open again on the other corner.
That was one of the big keys in that stretch. But it definitely comes under
hustling. And that's what Coach preaches all the time. We look up to Johnny
and Luke, and they made plays for us in that stretch.  
  
Q. Talk about the total team effort on the defensive end, and how you kind
of used that as energy to fuel your offense in that run there?  
JOHNNY MORAN: Yeah, our offense was struggling a little bit in the beginning,
and our defense really picked up. Just everybody. The big guys were doing a
great job in the post down low. The guards were doing a good job guarding the
ball, making them kick it out and contesting shots.  
Defense gets us going. I think that's our thing. When we pick up our defense,
we pick up our energy. Like I said, that run in the first half led to even
more energy coming on out in the second half.  
  
Q. You were shooting 0 for 5 in the first half from three point. Pretty
uncharacteristic, but then you picked it back up for 2 for 3 at the start of
the second half. Was it just a matter of keep shooting and they'll eventually
go in? What were you thinking throughout that time?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: It was a little frustrating coming in there and missing the
first five shots. I thought I had good looks at it. My teammates told me to
keep shooting, my coaches told me to keep shooting. I'm never thinking about
it a whole lot. If you worry about the last three shots you're not going to
make the next one.  
  
Q. How much of a difference is it, and how much of a benefit is it to go
into this game and be down and know we've done this before? We've been here,
we've made this run, just the confidence that the experience gives you?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: It makes it a whole lot easier. We look at each other and
nobody's really stressing out. There are probably people in the crowd freaking
out that we're down 11 and not shooting the ball well. But if you look at each
other, we're just calm face. We're not worried. We know we're going to make a
run.  
The big thing is our defense is going to be there no matter what, it's just a
matter of time before our offense catches up to our defense.  
  
Q. You talked about your perimeter game. But in the second half you guys
really outscored them in the paint. Was that something you were planning on
doing earlier that just didn't work? How did you adapt to DOMINATE in the
paint so well?  
ALI FAROKHMANESH: I think we just started attacking more. I think we probably
said it a little too much in the first half. But it was more our Coach was
telling us to attack the zone. Sometimes you get those looks and think you're
going to make them but they're not always falling. We were trying to drive to
the basket a little more because they were pressuring so far out there. Our
coaches told us to do that and we made the plays.  
JOHNNY MORAN: Yeah, our game plan is always to get the ball on the post as
much as we can with Jordan and Lucas and Adam down there. They really do a
great job for us. We just did a better job of finding them in the second half.  
  
Q. When you've looked at your team this year, you've had a lost runs where
it's a 10-1 run. You just seem to ride waves of momentum. What do you think
accounts for that, I guess?  
COACH JACOBSON: I think the guys mentioned it a little bit. Our defense has
been very consistent, as you know. That's been where the guys take a lot of
pride in rebounding. If we're doing that right and our communication is good,
our rotations are good, and if we're blocking out, if we're doing it the way
we're supposed to, eventually we feel our offense is going to catch up and
kick in at some point. If we are having a little bit of a lapse at the
offensive end. Once that does with the bounce we have on fence, once we get
some rhythm going there, certainly that helps when you go on a run. But really
it's just standing on our defense.  
  
Q. At one point you were down by 11 in the first half, and cut that down to
one at the half. Then clearly that led straight into the second half. What did
you do differently in the second half than in the first half?  
COACH JACOBSON: I think the biggest difference is we finally got some stops.
One of the keys for us coming into this basketball game was trying to find
some transition baskets, and Drake made just about everything they shot for
the first ten minutes of the game so there were no transition opportunities to
have.  
So that really slowed us down offensively. Then you have to play against their
zone in the quarter court and their zone has gotten very good over the course
of the years. So we had to find stops. When we did and finally got some
misses, we got a couple of opportunities down the stretch in the first half.  
In the second half it really felt like we were pushing the basketball and
finding some stuff in transition, just the result of getting some stops.  
  
Q. You guys went on a 29-2 run, they went 21 minutes without a basket. Is
that the best your team has played over maybe a period of a game?  
COACH JACOBSON: Certainly up there with some of our best stretches defensively
probably. That's a long time to go with just one basket. I mentioned Drake
making shots early and kind of benefiting from playing yesterday and being on
the floor. I think maybe -- I don't want to speak for them, obviously -- but
maybe some of those jump shots are a little longer in the second half. They're
a game and a half in, and we're just 20 minutes in.  
So we may have caught the better end of it in the second half with our guys
not having to play yesterday. But I did think we did a better job of
defending. We were in front of them more often. We contested more shots. I
think that was really the key.  
  
Q. A lot of people focused on the RPI when they talk about the National
Tournament. What would today's game show your team or show about your team
that the RPI might not?  
COACH JACOBSON: I think when you watch our basketball team sometimes you've
got to watch us for a little while. We're not a team you can watch for ten
minutes and say okay, that's one of the top 25 teams in the country. It takes
longer than that with our basketball team. If you'll take time to watch us, I
think you'll see an efficient team at both ends of the floor, and because we
are solid defensively, we've got guys that are willing to take charge, we've
got guys that are willing to come up with loose balls and offensive rebounds.
When you watch us long enough, I think you see a very efficient team at both
ends of the floor. And because of that, up five, down five, it really to these
guys doesn't make that much difference. We can play and we can play different
styles and different circumstances because we have the experience and depth to
do it.  
  
Q. Obviously we don't know who you're going to play tomorrow. But can you
talk about the two possible opponents, Bradley and Creighton and what you've
seen of them?  
COACH JACOBSON: At Bradley in our second game with them I thought they played
a very good second half. We had a nice lead at halftime and played well.
Bradley played a good second half and able to win that basketball game at
their place. Obviously with Taylor Brown at the four, really playing four
perimeter guys presents some challenges because they can drive it. And
Maniscalco played at a high level for a couple of months now, and Warren has
continued to play better the more he's played after sitting out last year. And
Roberts is doing a nice job as a senior.  
So having four perimeter guys is a real challenge to defend. And Creighton has
had a nice two-week stretch winning basketball games and playing good
basketball. And obviously this time of the year they've always played well.
They're going to play 10 or 11 guys, so depth isn't going to be a problem.
Guys being tired isn't going to be a problem. So real challenges with both
teams.  
  
Q. Lucas, four offensive boards, eight boards in total, eight points, diving
on the floor. Did he have a little extra jump today?  
COACH JACOBSON: Yeah, I think so. We see what we saw today most of the time.
But this is probably in the top four or five games of our season this year in
terms of his energy level and his toughness.  
We felt like trying to find some transition baskets and really rebounding. We
had to have some offensive rebounds and look got four of them today for us.
Today he might have been even a little higher level, yeah.

# [MISSOURI VALLEY CONFERENCE MEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=MISSOURI+VALLEY+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2010

  

### [Osiris Eldridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20499)

### [Austin Hill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20540)

### [Tim Jankovich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20496)

  
_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Illinois St. - 69  
Indiana St. - 65

  
COACH JANKOVICH: Indiana State played tremendous out of the gate, first ten or
15 minutes, not unexpected. We've seen them play outstanding over the last
several years, but I was very, very impressed with the way they shot out at
the first half.  
But because of that, just unbelievably proud of our guys. I think we were down
ten or 11 for sure, not very many things were going right at that point, but
just to fight our way back to tie it at the half I thought was just
outstanding.  
Then tough out the second half and couldn't have been more pleased. I thought
they hit some unbelievable shots late that continued to make a game of it,
despite our efforts. But just a lot of poise I thought by our guys, never
panicked and stuck with it and made a lot of tough plays down the stretch. It
was a great win for us.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about the end of the first half, you scored the last
ten points, were you seeing on the bench that the team was struggling, and did
you get it in your mind that you had to get everything going?  
AUSTIN HILL: Yeah, and I seen the opportunity like Coach Jankovich was just
saying, let the game come to you; I saw the chance and I just took it.  
  
Q. Osiris, you struggled early, then in the second half you guys fell behind
by three and you hit that three in the corner, does that get your juices going
again?  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: Yeah, got it going, just trying to find my shot throughout
the game. But I think what really got me going was defensive end when I
started to get down at guard really. That was really my main focus coming to
the game, try to do the best I could defensively and we got a couple stops. We
got a couple breakaways. We got fast break off Austin, he got a basket, and I
think that's what really got me going tonight.  
  
Q. Austin, kind of a follow-up to the previous question. Talk about that run
there before halftime, just how much you guys carried that momentum into the
second half.  
AUSTIN HILL: That was a big momentum for us. I mean, just defensive side, we
really picked it up on the defense, really tightened up at the end, so I think
that's what gave us the boost in the second half to go out and play harder.  
  
Q. Osiris, could you talk about Lathan and how he just kind of went off and
really kept them in the game?  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: He was tremendous throughout the whole game. He hit some
tough shots. He got to the basket. He's finishing, you know, strong. He's
going to be a tough player in years to come, him only being a sophomore.
Nothing I really can say.  
I think we did a good job of slowing him down a little bit down the stretch.
Hit some of those threes and getting into the lane and stuff like that, but,
yeah, he did do a good job tonight for them.  
  
Q. The free throws down the stretch, were you guys getting a little tight
there?  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: Yeah, walking to that line, usually I just walk up there and
knock them down but kind of started thinking a little bit too much and I
missed the first front end but made the second one, so I guess it's okay.  
  
Q. Austin, same question.  
AUSTIN HILL: Yeah, just going out there and just thinking too much instead of
just going out there and focusing and knocking them down like we usually do.  
  
Q. Osiris, Jackie is not in here, but it was 28-28 at half time, you were
down 43-41 with 12 minutes left and Jackie just threw down on the dunk to tie
it up; it seems like you really took control after that dunk. What about that
dunk really sparked you guys?  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: I don't know, Jackie, from the day, you know, he stepped on
campus at Illinois State we have been seeing plays like that every day. That's
just him. You know, he's everywhere. He gives of that boost every game, and I
think today he came up big. He got some big blocks, made some big free throws,
you know, in the first half makes some big baskets. That's what we need, our
young guys and Austin so everybody could step up because it's time where we
need everybody.  
  
Q. Austin, what's it feel like when you get on a roll like you did there at
the end of the half, what does it feel like?  
AUSTIN HILL: It feels pretty good. It feels real good. (Laughing).  
  
Q. What are you experiencing? Do you feel like you can't miss at that
point?  
AUSTIN HILL: I mean, anything is possible. I was just seeing the shot. The
defense really helped me out, usually pick it up on my defense, my offense
usually comes up.  
  
Q. Osiris, can you talk about tomorrow and the challenge that's going to
be?  
OSIRIS ELDRIDGE: Well, faced them in the past two times, you know, just have
to go in, January is behind us and get ready for Wichita and just try to
approach the game, like how we came into the game, just go out and just
defend, defend and let the offense come. I think if we do that, then tomorrow
will be a good day for us.  
  
Q. How about the free throws at the end?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Well, I'll say this: I just survived the second-longest day
of my life. The longest day seems to be last year, the first night playing the
late game is absolute torture, and it was no different.  
It felt like today was two days, and with all of the worrying and the respect
that I have for Indiana State; and then we take control of the game, and they
hit some amazing shots. Did they not hit some amazing shots late? When they
are down ten or whatever to continue to make it a game, and force us to make
pressure free throws; and I could think about was how sad it would be if our
seniors' careers end because we just can't drop a free throw.  
But we made just enough. It wasn't like we were going empty every time. We
were making just enough to force an extra possession and time ran out, I think
when it was 28 seconds, you could feel like, okay, enough time has gone off
that we are in pretty decent shape but they forced us to have about six
different in-bounds plays and keep changing that.  
But I don't blame at all. First round is the toughest. First round, to me,
everyone feels the most pressure. All that's on the line, I think that basket
gets a lot smaller. I certainly understood that but I was very worried that,
you know, the thought of going in the locker room and saying, if we only had
made a couple of free throws in the last minute, we would still be playing.  
So didn't work out that way, and just a great, great day for us. Great two
days for us.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Austin and the last two minutes that he had?  
COACH JANKOVICH: He did. He changed the game. We were on oxygen, at best.
Didn't have a lot going on at either end. I thought their confidence was so
high, and we needed a lift. We needed something. And for him to come in and do
that, what amazing courage; on this stage, with what's at stake, what amazing
courage. So I take my hat off to him along with the rest of the team without
question. I also say that we ask an awful lot of Osiris. We ask him, we start
him on Marshall, and you know we have got a forest fire over there with Lathan
that we can't get put out.  
So one of the other things that maybe goes unnoticed is when we finally
switched O over to Lathan despite the fact that he had 27 during the time when
O was guarding him. He really cooled him off, and that was part of what
allowed us to make a little run and get a cushion at just the right time.  
So he didn't shoot great. I thought he shot some really ill-advised shots,
which trust me, are not the first ones we've had in my time with him. In the
first half, he was a little too excited and he got confused on which was the
three point line that we are using. And so that didn't help him any.  
But, but, he's a great, great competitor, and down the stretch, you can just
count on nothing but grit from him. And we have asked him -- it would be
interesting if we could go back, it would take forever. But to go back over
the three years that I've coached him and how many six-minutes-and-down he has
had so much to do with the outcome, and having nothing to do with what shows
up on the stats sheet; just because we put him on a key guy and he stemmed the
tied and allowed us to get a cushion which allows us to shoot free throws at
the end, as opposed to have to make a desperation shot or shots like they were
in that position.  
So I give him an awful lot of credit.  
  
Q. Can you preview tomorrow's game for us?  
COACH JANKOVICH: Absolutely. I didn't get to see very much of the Wichita
game, but they have had a tremendous year. They certainly look like they
played today like they played most of the year, very talented, very
experienced team. A lot of different weapons. Not an easy match up in a lot of
ways. Now I understand their big fella is really playing, so any time a seven-
footer starts getting his game on, that's not good news, at all.  
Another thing about Wichita is they are a team that -- every team you need to
prepare for, but Wichita is a little tricky to prepare for. They have got some
unique offensive things that they do so it will be a little bit of a
challenge. It will test our memory from early in the year. We haven't played
them in quite some time as to how we defended certain actions that they have.  
So we need to get to bed tonight, but we'll have a short meeting tonight, not
much time tomorrow; that's the beauty of these tournaments, is as each game
comes, less and less preparation goes into your opponent, and so we are going
to need some to do well against them. It will be a great test for us.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Wichita State  73  
Missouri State - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: As mentioned, the victorious Shockers are with us first. They
have a date in the second semifinal round game tomorrow. They'll play the
winner of the last quarterfinal game between Indiana State and Illinois State.
We'll ask Head Coach Gregg Marshall to start out with a statement on the game.
Gregg, please?  
COACH MARSHALL: Anyone that saw the game, and obviously you guys did. That was
just a tremendously tough, well-played basketball game I thought. It's
unfortunate that any team had to lose. They did a great job. They were
shooting it so well, and competing so hard. But our guys finally caught a
break in the last minute or two, and Clevin made a couple of great plays. And
the one we found Garrett was a seal the deal type of play. Great players make
great plays and thank God I have these guys with me.  
  
Q. What did you feel was the turn around in the last three minutes of the
game itself?  
GARRETT STUTZ: We started making plays, and D-ing up a lot better throughout
the game at times we felt like we were half contesting but really buckled down
and rebounded the last couple of minutes. Of course making free throws always
helps.  
  
Q. The drive and the pass off to Garrett, take us through that play.  
CLEVIN HANNAH: I think Toure' made a bad cut. When he made the bad cut my man,
Drew, and I pump faked and got one of their players in there and I drove down
the lane. And I saw the big guys coming along, and I got to him and he
finished.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the challenge of playing against Ricks? It seems like
a real duel when you guys get together?  
CLEVIN HANNAH: He's a heck of a player. He's a lot stronger and athletic than
I am. He just makes it tough on me for the whole game. I just stayed with it,
and I couldn't lose my confidence after he took it from me. I just made big
plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. You were 8 for 8 from the free-throw line. How big is that in this close
of a game?  
CLEVIN HANNAH: In this close of a game every shot's big. But to get up there
and knock those free throws down is even bigger. So you've got to do that in
close games, and I stepped up and I knocked them down. So did my other
teammates.  
  
Q. Staying calm in a game like this where there is so much to and two fro
and back ask forth, what kind of a challenge is that? It's enough Missouri
State's trying to work their stuff. But to stay calm and collected, how tough
was that down the stretch and in the game?  
CLEVIN HANNAH: Coming out we knew it was going to be a brawl against those
guys. They're so tough and physical. We know they're going to make runs and
shots sometimes, but we've just got to stay composed and stay calm. We lost
our composure in a couple of other games and we lost those games that they
did.  
We just know we've got to stay calm and composed and everybody plays within
themselves and makes plays down the stretch, and we did that.  
  
Q. Garrett, your view on that play when Clevin gave it to you for the three-
point play at the end.  
GARRETT STUTZ: I saw him going for the offensive rebound, and I couldn't see
him at all. He's a little guy. He disappeared and the ball hit my hands.
Garret maybe all of you can get some perspective on this.  
  
Q. You outscored Missouri State 12-4 in the second half in the paint. How
much of your game was it to pound it down low?  
GARRETT STUTZ: It's been a point of emphasis the last couple of games. We
started going away from it, and our shooting percentage went down. We fell
into a shooting slump. But ever since then I think it's helping the whole team
out.  
J.T. DURLEY: Yeah, it's good for us to, you know get paint touches, especially
when me and Stutz are in at the same time, because usually we have a mismatch
on the inside. Because we're two good block scorers.  
  
Q. The big play drives away and you blocked the shot and Toure' ended up
with the intentional foul. Take us through that play?  
J.T. DURLEY: The play before that I think I got beat on the offensive rebound
and I was fighting for position. I still had to have my eye on the ball when I
was fighting, and he stumbled and threw the ball up. And I timed it, you know,
good for a block.  
  
Q. You're into the semis. How does that feel?  
J.T. DURLEY: It's definitely big time for us since we didn't make it to the
semis last year. We've got to come out and play our game. Play as hard as we
can, and hopefully we can get another win and keep playing until Sunday.  
GARRETT STUTZ: It's nice to get the first win and try to carry some momentum
over into tomorrow and take it on Sunday.  
  
Q. Talk a little about your game today and why the offense was working well
to get you those kind of shots?  
GARRETT STUTZ: Like I said, the last couple of weeks coaches have been telling
everyone we've got to work from the inside out. And that's when the shooters
are going to get open and we draw double teams and bring it to the foul line
more. I think it's been working a lot. We try to establish an inside game with
me and J.T. starting lately. You know, things just kind of clicked. We got
into a little rhythm and it worked.  
  
Q. During a game where it goes back and forth so much, could you talk maybe
about how you guys were able to stay focused and maintain your composure down
the stretch?  
J.T. DURLEY: I believe it's two tough teams going at it. And I think the
tougher team came away with it tonight. You know, it's kind of a mental thing,
I believe you know. It's mental toughness when it's going back and forth, back
and forth, grinding out possession after possession.  
  
Q. Guarding Weems is kind of a different role for you. Talk about trying to
do that as opposed to guarding at the post?  
J.T. DURLEY: It was a little tough match-up for me. But I stepped up for the
challenge. Coach asked me earlier can you guard Weems? And of course a player
wouldn't say no. But with him shooting the ball so well, he's a great player.
He's a forward that can put the ball on the floor well and create offense for
us.  
  
Q. What three very close games with Missouri State. Tooth and nail, what is
the difference. You won all three, what is the difference for Clevin and
Garrett?  
J.T. DURLEY: I think it's come.  
CLEVIN HANNAH: I think it's coming out and getting a great start first of all.
We came out and won that one on the road. I think we had an okay start at
home. When it is two good teams going at each other, you've got to be ready to
play. Just mentally ready and focused and make the plays down the stretch.  
  
Q. You picked up your fourth foul. Did you have to change your game at that
point or not?  
CLEVIN HANNAH: No, I stayed confident and kept playing defense the way I could
and just stuck with it.  
  
Q. Your team did an excellent job on Creekmore tonight. Was that a point of
emphasis going into tonight's game?  
COACH MARSHALL: Missouri State's got so many weapons. They've got four that
can get 20, Weems, Leonard, Mallett, and Creekmore. I thought our big guys did
a good job one-on-one. We were able to give them hell when we come off the
perimeter who is not a great shooter and get that second dribble. He dribbles
it the second time and you're the dig guy, you're not doing your job. The
first one, if you can get it, get it. I thought we helped. We gave just enough
doubt in their minds with their bigs with our digging that they didn't know
when it was coming and from where.  
Our big guys did a great job. Garrett Stutz is growing up before our very
eyes. Four blocks. I'm pretty sure that was a career high for him. He was a
force with his hands up and being a one-man blockade around the basket.  
Durley did accept the challenge with Weems. I thought he did a good job on
Creekmore, but he was also having to guard the perimeter which he hasn't done.
But that's our best on offensive lineup without a doubt.  
  
Q. I asked the players what the difference is between these two teams. You
were able to win all three games against them, but it certainly doesn't fit
into a 2-7 seed does it?  
COACH MARSHALL: I said this earlier, and it Bears repeating. If this Missouri
State team is a 7 seed that means you've got a good league. They're getting
top 25 votes for four or five weeks in a row in December. They win at St.
Louis, they win at Arkansas State at Arkansas. Little Rock. They beat Auburn.
Their only loss before they went into conference was a road game in overtime
at Arkansas and they lose to Northern Iowa. And we're the first team that was
able to go in and beat them on their home court.  
I've got a tremendous amount of respect with their players, and their coach
does a great job. And the breaks will eventually go his way. They're tough,
they play hard. They've got great shooters.  
I can't believe they're 7 for 18. It seemed like they were 16 for 18. When
Pickens hit the one toward the end, I'm thinking will they ever miss? It
seemed like they made every one for me.  
  
Q. With 24 wins now, do you feel like your team has done enough at this
point to get into the NCAA Tournament? Or is this a tournament you need to win
in order to get into the big dance?  
COACH MARSHALL: I think we need to win it. I've grown up in the Big South nine
years. One bid league. So I cut my teeth on that. And was fortunate enough to
win it a number of times. So, you know, we have a team that's capable of
winning this tournament and that's our goal right now, and we don't leave it
up to anyone else. I like to control what I control. The controllables that we
can control as a team and that is win the tournament. It is not up to a
committee or anyone else for that matter. We're in.  
We've got a lot of work to do, but that is the answer. I've told my team we
need to win this tournament. How many games we win if we fall short, that will
be left up for the experts, if you will.  
  
Q. For the last minute and a half to two minutes of the game there were
about three players on the floor that were dealing with four fouls. What
advice or strategy did you tell them to avoid getting the fifth foul?  
COACH MARSHALL: I was so amazed that Clevin Hannah got the fourth foul on that
loose ball that I didn't acknowledge that. He didn't have four fouls in my
book, and he's going to be out there anyway at that point. Hatch we were
massaging his foul trouble all second half. And who else had it? I guess
Durley. I don't know when he picked up his fourth. I guess it was on the
checkout when Creekmore got the inside position. At that point you go with
your best you players. We're doing offense and defense with Ellis and Stutz.
But we had to win the game.  
It seemed as if we couldn't get a break until the last couple of minutes and
they started coming. Seven, seven, seven.  
  
Q. Following up on Bob's question, you professed your respect for Missouri
State. But what is the separation? When you have three games the way that you
did that were so tightly contested, what gives Wichita State the edge to win
three times in very similar games?  
COACH MARSHALL: I've talked about this before and I've talked to Cuonzo about
it, and I mean this as everything I say is a compliment to him because I hold
him in such high esteem. But I mentioned to him when he took the job --
because we hit it off immediately -- that his situation that he was inheriting
was very similar to the one that I had inherited the year before. So I had a
one-year jump on him.  
My best players that first year were my seniors, Matt Bryer, P J, and Phil
Tomlinson. And after that there wasn't a number of quality players.  
He inherited the Lauries, and Wade Knapp, and a couple of other guys. The good
news is he had Weems and sitting there red shirting, and he had Fuehrmeyer and
a couple of other guys. But I said you're going to probably be pretty good
that first year, which he was. And the second year, which is this year, I
thought there would be a drop off because he lost all those guys. He did a
good job because he's ahead of where we were. He was 17 and 20 and still going
to play in some postseason play. He's one year ahead, if you will. Our guys
have had one more year of experience in this tournament.  
  
Q. Garrett seems to be enjoying how he's contributing and getting more
confident. Talk about what you've seen out of him?  
COACH MARSHALL: He should be enjoying it. He's really playing well. He's a
great kid. He works extremely hard. He's a wonderful teammate. An awesome
person, good student. Good things happen to great people. I don't care where
you look worldwide. You can go to Avatar, you're not going to find a better
individual than Graham Hatch.  
  
Q. First off, how do you build off this very hard fought victory? And could
you victory and could you talk about Indiana State and Illinois State?  
COACH MARSHALL: I hope to go out and watch some of it in a short bit when
we're done here. It's just an opportunity now. It's another opportunity to
improve as a basketball team and improve our tournament resume and win the
Championship.  
It's the first of hopefully three steps. It's not going to get any easier.
You've got a great 3-6 match-up coming up. We've struggled with both of them.
They're good basketball teams and Indiana State's now healthy. I just want to
go watch it, and try to figure out the best way we can to be successful
tomorrow afternoon.  
  
Q. Is there anything that Garrett Stutz can't do?  
COACH MARSHALL: I don't think he's invincible. I don't think he can fly. Let's
see, I don't think he can win a Gold Medal in sprints or high jump for that
matter. But he is a shooter. He's a pretty good rebounder, now he's blocking
shots. He's a passer, a wonderful teammate and he's a leader. He's one of the
most vocal kids in our program. He does a great job. He cares so much because
he's just that type of person, and we're blessed to have him.  
  
Q. What was the routine tonight and before you find out your opponent
tomorrow before the game?  
COACH MARSHALL: The routine tonight. The guys are showering, hopefully getting
out there to watch the first half. As soon as the first buzzer ends the first
half, they'll get on a bus to go home.  
The coaches and I will continue to scout. There's pieces in the locker room.
I'm sure there is a banquet back in the hotel. I want them to eat as much as
they can and sleep. Get off their feet. Quick turn around. I'm sure Dominik
and Matt will make sure that happens and tuck them in tonight. Get up early
tomorrow morning.  
We know these teams and they know us. There is no secret at this point in
conference play.  
We've got a little advantage. About two and a half hours of rest. Who knows
when this next game will get over. I should have called a few more timeouts
and prolonged our game. I had a couple to use.

_ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI_  
  

Bradley  81  
Creighton - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: Creighton Bluejays are here. We'll have Coach Altman start off
with a statement on the game, then questions for the two student-athletes.  
COACH ALTMAN: Well, they really got away from us in the second half. You know,
Sam just beat us up. 18 of 19 from the line. And hit those three threes off
his favorite move, and we just didn't do a good job on him. We had held him in
check the first two times and we were able to win. But today he was the
difference.  
He's a good player, and he really made plays. We had some bad turnovers, took
too many threes. We went to the boards, but we weren't able to really cash in
on a lot of our offensive rebounds: And they came up with some timely
offensive rebounds. I remember twice it was a four-point game, and they got a
two-pointer, and we fouled them on the three pointer when we got a chance to
go down four with the ball.  
We credit them, they played a wonderful game and we just got beat.  
  
Q. You really had a good game on the board. Can you talk about your
mentality of attacking the glass, please?  
KENNY LAWSON: I think a lot of guys went to the offensive glass. But we knew
they were in a zone and anytime a team's in the zone you have to take
advantage of that. Not only myself, other guys did a great job of it.  
  
Q. They switched defenses up a lot today between man and zone. Did that
affect you guys? Was it confusing at times?  
JUSTIN CARTER: Well, it was just we were standing up when they switched the
zone either the two-three or the one-three-one. And we stood up. And that's
what the zone makes do. Stand up. I think we stood up and just settled a lot
for the three.  
  
Q. I guess you guys knew they were capable of scoring points in bunches.
Could you just talk about, I guess, some of the runs they went on and what you
guys tried to do to stop them?  
JUSTIN CARTER: Can you repeat the question?  
  
Q. Just their ability to -- Bradley's ability to score points in bunches.
How did you try to slow them down?  
JUSTIN CARTER: Well, they're very good in transition, and they get a -- try to
get a lot of easy buckets out of the transition. So we tried to slow them down
in transition, and get them out of that rhythm. In the second half they had a
lot of runs that we didn't answer to, and they scored a bunch of runs in the
second half.  
KENNY LAWSON: Same thing Justin said. They have great players offensively and
it takes extra focus to stop a team like that. We showed that a little bit in
the first round and a little in the second half and we just didn't do the
things we needed to to get stops.  
  
Q. Can you talk about handling the ball and stripping the ball? Talk about
their defense a little bit. Was it different today than it was in the previous
two matchups with them down low?  
JUSTIN CARTER: Not at all. Coming in we knew they were fluent to the help side
and also a lot of hands in the zone and the man. So coming into the game we
didn't feel that it was nothing new. They got their hands on the ball, and
corrupted us when we drove and got hands on passes.  
  
Q. You guys shot 9 for 33 from the three-point line. Can you talk about your
struggles from the three-point line today?  
JUSTIN CARTER: I think it was the zone. We stood up in the zone and couldn't
knock it down. We felt comfortable coming in and shooting the ball, but the
zone made us stand up. And we just settled too much.  
  
Q. When you have a guy that's on fire like Maniscalco was today. How do you
play defensively? Do you D up on him like anyone else?  
KENNY LAWSON: When a guy's on a roll like that you have to do something to
stop him. We understand he's a good player, but we didn't focus enough on the
things we needed to do to slow him down. Once he gets on a roll, like Coach
said, the basket just keeps getting bigger and bigger.  
  
Q. When you have a guy like Maniscalco going off, is there a sense of
helplessness that you felt in the second half at point?  
JUSTIN CARTER: We just have to be more focused and understand that he's on a
roll. Kind of stop him and make him do what he doesn't want to do, and I don't
think we did that in the second half.  
  
Q. With a guy like Maniscalco, what makes it so tough to guard him and what
makes him successful at the line?  
JUSTIN CARTER: He's a great free-throw shooter, but I think we let him go
through his strengths in the second half a couple of times. And getting over
the ball screen we couldn't get over to his right-hand. We had a couple of
calls on the three pointers when he was shooting it, and we knew he was a good
free-throw shooter. But we didn't take away his strength and that was his
right-hand. He just knocked down the free throws.  
  
Q. Basically that question that I asked Justin. With a guy like Maniscalco,
how come he is so successful at getting to the line even when you know you're
trying to take his strength away what makes it so difficult?  
COACH ALTMAN: He's good at drawing fouls. He kind of leans into you and throws
his arms. You know, he draws fouls.  
I think he had the two big threes in the first half that we just made
defensive mistakes on, and we didn't make those mistakes in Omaha. We took
that move away.  
He had 15 points going off to that pick to his right. He had three threes and
six free throws. That's the difference in the game right there. He didn't get
those when we played him before. And he's a good basketball player. He's
tough, he's hard-nosed. I like everything about him. He's really good.  
  
Q. Have you been involved in a game where you had had an opposing player
have three attempts at three free throws?  
COACH ALTMAN: That's bad coaching when you foul a three-point shooter three
times. That's nine points. That's a season's worth right there. So, no, that's
obviously not very smart.  
  
Q. Coach, your athletes from the three-point line, at any point in the game
did you feel maybe we should try to work it down the paint instead of these
three points because they're not falling?  
COACH ALTMAN: Well, my man, we were 12 for 33 inside. So if you do the math we
were more productive on the three-point line. We went to Kenny, they collapsed
on him pretty hard. We just weren't effective offensively at all. But I agree,
we took way too many threes which didn't allow us to get to the line.  
We had a lot of offensive rebounds where we adjusted our shots instead of
getting to the line. Antoine wasn't very effective in drawing fouls when he
took the ball to the basket.  
So I think a lot of those things, you know, kind of went into it. I apologize
to be sarcastic there. We didn't score very well either way. You never want to
take 33 threes, but we weren't scoring inside either. We scored 12 baskets
inside, nine baskets outside. We just weren't good offensively. We had played
a little better on offensively.  
But that being said, what got us into trouble was the defensive end and them
shooting 52% in the second half and putting them on the line, you know.
However many times we did, there's too many to count. And he shot the heck out
of free throws, 27 of 28. But we put the wrong guys there and they have really
good free-throw shooters and those are the guys we put on the line.  
  
Q. You said one of the can you talk about Bradley's runs and how much of a
healthy run that is?  
COACH ALTMAN: Yeah, 9, 8-8 point runs in the first half. And you know, we jump
out. And our bench today, we can count on our bench. You know, we just really
struggled off the bench today.  
There were a lot of factors. Those runs, especially in the first half, we
build the lead and give them some easy baskets. Built another lead. We worked
pretty hard for ours and gave them some easy ones.  
I thought the key, we had the seven-point lead with a couple of minutes left
in the half and Sam hit those two threes. I thought those were two really big
buckets and kind of changed the momentum of the game.  
  
Q. In one of the story lines of the season, you have gotten off to a good
start in games you ended up losing. I know it's been a frustration for you,
but when you watch on film, what happens with the team when they go up like
that? Do they relax?  
COACH ALTMAN: I don't think so. You know today we didn't have our bench
respond the way we wanted to. Our problems stem from not getting stops we need
in the second half. So, you know, our consistency all year has been a problem
for us. We haven't done the things necessary to have the type of team we need
to have. And a lot of that goes on my shoulders. I recruit the guys, I coach
them, if the mix isn't what we need to have, then that's my fault.  
So, you know, we've got some work to do here. We've got a good base. We've got
some good players. We've got some good young players. But we've got a
tremendous amount of work to do here in the off-season, and a lot of guys are
going to have to recommit themselves. It's just not going to happen for us to
get the winning seasons and things that we've had.  
Guys have worked awfully hard for that, so we're going to have to evaluate
everything we do and recommit to a lot of things.  
  
Q. Bradley switched up its defense quite a bit today. What affect did that
have on your offense?  
COACH ALTMAN: Well, they did a good job with that. You know, we had a couple
of bad turnovers. We really had cut down our turnovers. You know, and today we
had 12 which isn't a great deal, but they were really bad times that we had
the turnovers.  
And so, you know, I thought they were switching defenses was effective. But it
was effective against us in Omaha, too. But we got more stops there in Omaha.
We scored 62 and kind of got in a hurry in the end. If we kept the score
around 65, but putting them at the line, just easy baskets we gave them, and
dribble penetration there. And I thought like you said, key offensive rebound
with the score at 4 points.  
And I can't -- I think -- oh, let's see. Who got the first one? Roberts got
the first one there and then laid it back up. And they got one and we fouled
him for a three. So it went 4-6, then we came and scored, and it went 4-7. I'm
testing my memory there, but I think that's right. So those two offensive
rebounds and as much as it wasn't us scoring, I think a larger part of it was
our inability to get them stopped.  
  
Q. You mentioned a couple of big rebounds. There were times during the game
where it got hard to hear and the crowd just drowned everything out. Do you
think that had an effect on the players in the second half at all?  
COACH ALTMAN: I don't think so. Bradley's guys are used to playing in a great
atmosphere. We've been blessed. Our fans have been unbelievable to us.  
We had a big crew here. The thing that probably hurts the most is how much
we've let them down, you know. So, you know, it was a great crowd. Our people
that came, you know, like I said, I feel bad because we've got a little
further to go than most. Our fans have really made a commitment to us both at
home and on the road and I feel really bad there.  
  
Q. Do you anticipate the possibility of getting to play another game? Would
you be excited about such a game?  
COACH ALTMAN: Oh, you know, there's a couple of new tournaments that we've
never played in before. We've been fortunate the last 12 years, and that's not
going to happen this year.  
You know, I want to play, I just, you know, we're starting a couple of
freshmen and you've got a sophomore point guard and Kenny's going to be back.
So you kind of like to play, but that won't be my decision. That will be the
decision of Bruce and the University. You know, whatever they decide, you
know, it it's their decision. But we've got some young guys on our team that,
if nothing else, we need another week of practice.  
I don't know. We do at 16-15 I think we're eligible. So if Bruce and, you
know, I'm sure we'll talk to the Valley and see what they want us to do.  
But we did finish fourth in the league. Our league's solid. I think Bradley
will give Northern a tremendous game. They had two great games during the
year. We've got good basketball teams in our league. And we did finish fourth.
I'd like to play, but again that's Bruce's decision. And if he decides, you
know, that we need to put the uniforms away and start focusing on next year,
I'll definitely do that.  
So that's going to be his decision though. I'm sure he'll talk with Doug and
get the Valley's point of view. Then we'll just go from there.
