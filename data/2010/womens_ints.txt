_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  74  
Oklahoma - 57

  
PETER IRWIN: We're joined by Sooners from Oklahoma with coach Sherri Coale and
her two student-athletes, Danielle Robinson and Amanda Thompson. Coach,
thoughts about today's game.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: I want to congratulate Texas A&M. I thought they played
extremely well and fought for the entire game. And I thought our kids fought,
too. And I could not be prouder of our basketball team and the effort that
they displayed. I just thought it was a fantastic women's basketball game. And
probably showcased our league to the country in a magnificent way.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Amanda, they kind of hide Danielle Adams for a half. Yesterday they only
placed six minutes in the first half and she explodes for 17 quick points.
Talk about when she comes into the game, what she brings them and what
problems she causes you.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: She's definitely a big impact to their team. She comes in.
She's very finesse, and she's really good with the basketball as far as on the
jump shot and she has a soft touch. Her body size really affects the game. It
affected us today.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk a bit about the challenge of three games in three
days, and especially with a team like A &M and the energy they play with?
Looked like you missed some layups that I think you normally would make. Was
that a sign of some of that and sort of the second part to that question, the
way you were able to compete three games does it bode well for the NCAA
tournament?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We have to play back-to-back games in the NCAA tournament,
but regardless our team came out fought tonight. Regardless if we were tired
or not we proved we could fight through that and we didn't let it affect us
/(.  
  
Q. Amanda, you guys got in a little hole early and you never got the lead.
You caught up three times. Can you talk about is it hard to play from behind
the whole game, is it hard to get back on top or is the score and situation
something you never think about?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: It's there, because ultimately you want to be above, you want
to be in front of the team, but it's hard but I think that we've been there
both these games in the tournament, and we know what it feels like to be
behind, and today, unfortunately, we couldn't get that lead in the second
half. But it's hard but we know we can do it. It was just one of those days.  
  
Q. Amanda, after the way you guys played this weekend so well, how do you
feel heading into the NCAA tournament? Just give me your thoughts as you look
ahead to that.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: We fought today. And I felt like we can go as far as we want
to in the tournament, however far.  
  
Q. Amanda, talk about the play of Joanna off the bench?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: She was huge today. She fell down with their post players,
got a couple of and-1s we needed her down in the post. She was there. I was
proud of her. That was huge for a freshman, and I think that will take away a
lot of pride going into the NCAA tournament. So I'm really proud of her.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the emotion? It's running pretty high right now. You
guys played so well. Talk about where that's all coming from for both of
you.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: For me, it's about our team this year and what they've done
for the program. And we would love to give them this Big 12 title going into
the NCAA tournament for their senior year, they've given so much to the
program. And it's kind of frustrating, I think, to give it to them. But we
have a bigger picture ahead of us. This is the best preparation we could have.  
  
Q. Danielle or Amanda, when there was kind of that scrum underneath your
basket in the second half. Five minutes to go and Jasmine makes a diving
effort for a loose ball and I think taps it up to you. Somebody hits a 3?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Gave it to Jo and she made a layup.  
  
Q. Not the one where she went head first. But at that point did you feel you
were right there, right at the cusp?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I think we felt that way all along. We've been that way the
whole tournament. These single digit leads is nothing, really, for us. I mean,
we've done it multiple times this season.  
You know, we fought. We tried to win all loose ball battles. I think they came
up with a lot of them, we came up with a lot of them. But ultimately in the
end they made some tough shots.  
  
Q. Danielle or Amanda, you guys have played Tennessee, Connecticut,
Nebraska, who everybody expects is going to be the 3 No. 1 seeds, and now an A
&M team is playing like they might be a No. 1 seed. Could you talk about
preparation? It even goes beyond the Big 12 of who you've faced and how that's
gotten you ready for what you're going to face now?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I think that's a credit to our coaching staff and who
scheduled those big games for us, because, ultimately, you're going to see
them in the NCAA tournament. This is why we come to Oklahoma, to play teams
like that, to fight for championships. And we couldn't be happier with our
season thus far. And we're excited about going to the NCAA tournament with the
conference and non-conference schedule that we've played.  
PETER IRWIN: Congratulations on a great season. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Sherri, is it possible this game really came down to the fact that they
made 3-pointers on a pretty good pace, eight out of 14 and you were not quite
as good as you sometimes are, 4 of 11?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Yeah. Our number was fairly commensurate with what we did
the rest of the season. They made open 3s. They shot incredibly well in the
first half, and we didn't shoot well at all in the second half.  
And despite that, we kept the margin. So I thought we missed some easy shots.
We missed some layups more than missed 3s. Layups that we depend upon. And I
think some of that was just we were just dead-dog tired and we just fought,
and fought, and fought. You would like to say it doesn't have anything to do
with it, but I think late in that game Amanda Thompson is absolutely spent.
Danielle and she spent 40 minutes a game at warrior speed for all 40 minutes.
And I think of a layup that Amanda missed and I look at her line. Are you
kidding me who has a stat line like that. It's unbelievable.  
I'm just incredibly proud of our kids, and A&M, they were good. They just shot
it a little better than we did today.  
  
Q. Sherri, these tired old eyes seemed like you were pushing a big rock up a
steep hill all day after the start. The fact that you guys were there you had
so many shots, and misses, does it bode well how you will play in the NCAA
tournament?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: We feel great going into the tournament. Our preconference
schedule and what we've had to fight through in the Big 12, not just the Big
12 season, but putting these top 20 teams back to back to back, maybe top 15,
I guess which poll you look at, back to back to back in this conference
tournament. There's no better preparation.  
I tell you what, this year in the field of women's basketball, A&M plays like
that, they'll be in San Antonio and so will we. That's the quality of this
game.  
  
Q. Could you talk big picture NCAAs. I think Amanda's emotion kind of hit on
how hard you guys are playing in that sense of, boy, this could be something
special. But talk about your impressions of where you guys are as you head
into NCAAs?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: One of the closest teams I've ever had an opportunity to
coach. These guys just wanted to win this championship for those three
seniors. They just love them. And when the team is wound together that
tightly, you have a chance to do extraordinary things. Your whole is greater
than the sum of your parts.  
And they want the ride to continue. And it's somewhat surreal for us when we
were here and won the Big 12 tournament championship in 2002, which we're
reminded of because there's a shadowy figure above our locker room of our 2002
team hoisting the trophy as the theme of the building. And that team didn't
want that season to stop. They were having so much fun together and they
enjoyed one another so much, they played for one another, that the wins were
kind of gravy.  
The cool thing was you got to play together. And I get that sense for this
team. And that's sometimes all it takes once you get to this level.  
  
Q. Similar question for Danielle, you're in a pretty unique position. I
don't know anybody who has played three of the No. 1 seeds who we expect to be
the No. 1 seeds plus A &M, could you sort of give us a quick breakdown? We
know a lot about UCONN, just about the strengths of all those teams going into
the NCAA tournament.   
COACH SHERRI COALE: We do have our strength of schedule is number one in the
country. It just so happens that we had an opportunity to also play Notre
Dame, so they're in that top mix somewhere, too. So we have seen them all. And
in no way shape or form makes me the Einstein of comparing them. They're just
so different.  
But I said this yesterday that I really do think there will be some surprises
in the Final Four. And I think it's really hard to separate, obviously, UCONN,
rarefied era, but the rest of them, really good basketball teams with lots of
different parts. And a lot of what happens in the NCAA tournament, I think, is
going to be based upon matchups. If you get a certain style against another
style, you could see some lower seeded teams moving forward. There's just not
that much of a difference between teams, I think. And maybe not a whole lot of
great teams but a lot of really good ones.  
  
Q. I know you've said in the past like you've said matchups are where it
comes down, where do you get the sense where you guys are going to be at this
point? Two, three sort of area for you?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Yeah, probably a three, that would be my guess. How many
recollect technologies, trust me, I've been to a lot of them. The unique thing
about our tournament as we go into the tournament we have the ability to be a
chameleon and I'm not sure all teams do. There's a certain way that Notre Dame
has to play and Texas A&M has to play to win. We sort of have been able to
become whatever we need to become. We're maybe not as good as the style of
play that Texas A&M has as they are, but we can play the kind of game Notre
Dame does. I choose those two at random. I think you can do it with several
schools.  
I like our ability to sort of be what we need to be in whatever type of game
presents itself. I don't know that there is a horrible matchup for Oklahoma
out there. And that's comforting.  
  
Q. The 3s they were getting, particularly, was there a particular thing they
were doing? They seemed to make a lot of cross-court passes over to the weak
side to get people. Was that something they haven't done, or something you
guys didn't react to? How did they get those 3s?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Well, early on we were trapping the ball screen in the
middle of the floor. I thought it did give them some trouble. But then they
adjusted to it and probably stayed with that a little bit too long.  
The biggest reason they got the 3s were the skip passes where our hoop was in
a little too tight, when our post defender is behind the girl doesn't have to
be there. She can cheat out a little bit. We were hammering on them. Stop
penetration, make them penetrate and pitch and close out. And so they were
trying to do what we asked them to do. We just needed them to cheat a little
bit more.  
  
Q. We've seen an incredible tournament, and we've talked a lot about where
the level of play is right now on the Big 12, and it's not as if the other
conferences aren't trying to make something of this sport. Can you talk about
how the schools in the conference, your school and some of these others, have
managed to get the level to where it is right now, because we've seen women's
basketball in this conference just really improve pretty dramatically in
recent years.  
COACH SHERRI COALE: I think it's a combination of things. I think it began
maybe with breaking out and getting to the Final Four. And we were able to do
that, and then Texas and then Baylor, and Baylor winning a championship. And I
think that we go back and that continual arrival into the deep part of the
tournament is how you build it. Kids want to come. You get great recruits to
come and play in this league.  
The other part of that is the fan base everywhere you go, kids want to come
and play in this, they want to be in this environment. They want to come play
in front of 8,000 every night you play in conference. Who wouldn't want to do
that? It's that coupled with some really quality coaches in this league. Some
people do a great job.  
And consistency. Coaches being at institutions and building programs. Not just
putting teams together but building a program, which is an entirely different
thing. And I think the Big 12 is in good shape and here to stay.  
  
Q. Danielle is playing really well, but she's played similar to that for a
long time. Amanda seems to have gone into overdrive here in the last two or
three weeks. She's approaching 20 rebounds every game. Would you agree she's
all of a sudden playing much better than she was earlier, and how often have
you seen a player make such a huge jump late in a season?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: I do think she's in overdrive, to borrow your word. I
think it's the urgency that a passionate senior feels. And Amanda is an old
soul. She has a special, special quality about her. She cares deeply for her
teammates and for our coaching staff and for this institution.  
And she wants to do special things. So what you see right now is just an
indomitable will just bubbling out off the surface. And I think everybody else
attaches themselves to that and tries to measure themselves by that same
standard. She is our captain, our leader. I think in a big picture,
philosophical sort of way that's what college athletics is all about right
there.  
  
Q. For lack of a better way to put it, this A &M team seems to be a more
aesthetically pleasing team than some past teams. Are they tougher to guard
because they seem to have some more offensive skills and maybe some better
shooters on this team than maybe some of their past teams that were
successful?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: Yes. They're much harder to guard. They just have so many
weapons. And I think their offensive confidence is a big part of that, too.
They all want to shoot it. Everybody wants the ball. And that can be a very
difficult thing to defend. Can sometimes get you in trouble. But doesn't seem
to be bothering it too much. They're all making them.  
  
Q. You just talked a little bit about Amanda and Danielle Robinson. Could
you talk about how they've played since Whitney Hand went down with her
injury?  
COACH SHERRI COALE: I was thinking about this before the game, that when
Whitney went down, I never saw our kids wince. And it was not that they didn't
care about Whitney. And they cried in their rooms and they cried far away from
that locker room probably hundreds of times with her and for her.  
But I never saw us as a basketball team even wince. We just took it and said,
"All right, this is what we have. This is what we've got to do and let's get
about the business of doing it." And I knew the day after it happened we were
going to be just fine because of that attitude and that resiliency. And so
much of that is Danielle Robinson and Amanda Thompson as our leaders. And
Danielle, I think, has not gotten enough credit this season for the job that
she has done with the load that she's had to assume.  
She was fantastic last year. But everybody in the country was watching
Courtney Paris at the block and the three people that weren't watching
Courtney were guarding Whitney. So Danielle, it's a lot easier -- you can ask
any great player anytime to be fantastic when you're maybe the third thing
that they worry about. Every game we go into, guess what everybody's first
thing is to think about? Keep Danielle Robinson from getting to the rim.
That's it. That's number one on everybody's scouting report. She's been able
to do it anyway. She's continually led our team. We asked her to guard the
best offensively player and set everybody up and get assists and we ask Amanda
to get every rebound and score every time she catches it and she's been
fantastic doing it.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you very much.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  74  
Oklahoma - 67

  
PETER IRWIN: We're joined by Texas A&M student-athletes Danielle Adams, Tyra
White, and Sydney Colson. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. This is for all three of you. Could you just talk about shooting from the
perimeter? Obviously you shoot well from 3-point range, but you also had nine
shots between ten and 15 feet that you also hit. What defensively were they
giving you that allowed you to get the looks and make those shots?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think a lot of times when we run our high-low plays, a lot of
the time whoever was guarding Danielle up top or whoever the post was setting
the screen up top, they were funneling towards me to try to almost get a trap
in to take away the pass back to the top of the key. So I found Tyra about two
or three times on that. She was hitting shots. I knew I needed to keep coming
off looking at where she was if they were helping off and get the ball to her,
and she would drain the 3. And Danielle, I mean, she's just an excellent
shooter. We looked for her all the time. She's trailing in transition. They
were looking to give her the ball for the 3 or she could take somebody off the
dribble. But I think we did a good job with shot selection today and people
were knocking down shots and we really needed it.  
  
Q. Danielle, when you came into the season, of course, coming from Jefferson
College, newcomer, getting used to the program and so forth, when I talked to
Coach Blair he said trying to get you into shape, getting you into the style
as well as the shape they want, talk about your progression from the beginning
of the season and so forth until now.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Well, at first I was hurt for like a month with a hamstring.
So that made a downfall, but I knew I had to come back and work hard. So she
just made this program for me where I had to work out each day after practice
for an hour for three days, that's where it started at. I mean for three times
a day.  
And then it progressed on when I kept getting better and better. I knocked
down it to down to 30 minutes a day. I owe it to her and my teammates and the
coaching for just believing in me and me for myself just for working hard.  
  
Q. Danielle and Tyra, first of all, Danielle, we talked about this
yesterday. They forget about you in the first half, and just talk about what
it's like waiting and waiting and waiting and then you come in the second half
and explode.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I couldn't even tell you. I mean, I scored two points in the
first half and then just became dominant in the second half. I couldn't let my
teammates down. My coaches or the fans. That was the first championship that I
ever had. So I couldn't let my teammates down or my coaches.  
  
Q. Tyra, just talk about how cool this is for Danielle from Kansas City, her
parents and grandparents and everybody down at that end when she was shooting.
Talk about you two Kansas City kids coming here winning this title here?  
TYRA WHITE: Just come back to our homes again, you know, represent we owe it
all to our teammates, getting up, having to walk through it, 7:00 at the time
with the time change and everything. I mean, feeling's just explainable right
now. I feel good.  
  
Q. There was a segment in the season, basically about middle of the way, the
team obviously was going through some struggles, some losses there. With the
fact that you did take down Nebraska yesterday and you took down a very good
Oklahoma team, do you guys see yourself as maybe a 1, 2 seed or what?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think just what ever seed we get, I'm not so sure that any of
us are even really focused on that to be honest. We just want to go out there
and wherever we end up going we're going to play hard no matter who we're
playing against.  
I think since the middle of the season, when we were having struggles, losing
those games, and a lot of the time we were losing games that were close and we
couldn't finish it out, and it was they were testing us. We had a lot of tests
during the season that prepared us for situations like this. And I think
people responded well to adversity today and yesterday.  
We went out there against Nebraska focused and ready to play. And today we
made sure that we didn't lack anything, like we did last year, when we played
Baylor. When we played Oklahoma and played Baylor for the championship, we
lost that game. We said we didn't make it to this point this far y'all to come
here and lose it. So you gotta give it all you got and you can rest after the
game is over. But for now we gotta get the W. So we're prepared for anything.  
  
Q. This is for Tyra and Danielle. The last 30 seconds of the game Tanisha
comes up with those two big rebounds and she knocks down the foul shots that
ensures that it's at least a 2-possession game. I mean, as people who have
been around her day in/day out and have been familiar with her in high school,
what is it about her character that -- I mean, obviously something like this
doesn't surprise you that you figured she can come through in the clutch like
this?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I mean, I've been playing with Tanisha since AU. She never
gives up. She's a hard worker. She's motivated. She has the courage to do what
she does. She just never gives up. That's what I like about her. She just
keeps playing through anything.  
TYRA WHITE: Tanisha, she's one of the kids that does stuff on our team, if you
tell her she can't do something she'll show you she can do it. Even when the
coaches are out there yelling at her, she may have a little smirk on her face
like, yeah, whatever. But she just has heart, and that's what a lot of us like
about Tanisha. She's going out there and giving it her all. She has a lot of
heart, and I've been knowing Tanisha since we were little. We just found out
we're cousins. Everybody on the team loves her. She keeps us cracking up.  
SYDNEY COLSON: Has a lot of heart.  
TYRA WHITE: She does.  
  
Q. How emotional were you at the end of the game? What does this mean to you
and what was it like to hear your name called as the most outstanding
player?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I was very emotional. I was very happy. I've never won a
championship in my life. Just to win with this team was great for me and to
hear that I was the most outstanding player was an awesome award. But it's for
my team. I couldn't have done it without my team. So it's a team award, the
Big 12 championship.  
  
Q. Sydney, kind of about a minute left, they steal the inbounds from you and
then the next play you kind of take a layup. Talk about how pivotal the
sequence that was for you guys and then also how important was it that you
guys never allowed Oklahoma to get the lead? I know you tied it a few times in
the second half but you never allowed them to get the lead?  
SYDNEY COLSON: That play down there, that was stupid of me I shouldn't have
called it that low. That was basically it. I knew the next play I needed to
make up for it.  
We knew they were going to come out at us in the last minute put the pressure
on us, which they've been doing for the last six minutes or so put the
pressure on us, get easy baskets. We made sure if they got a steal or layup we
didn't foul, make two mistakes out of one. And I think that it was really key
for us to not let them get a lead. We had to get scores, get a stop, get
another score. We practiced that in practice. Score, stop, score, just to
ensure you're doing your job on the defensive end, the offensive end. And I
think that we were going tit for tat in the end but we were hitting some 3s
and crucial free throws, a lot of people stepped up tonight that we needed to.
I'm happy with the effort we gave and I'm glad we came out victorious.  
  
Q. Sydney, you mentioned about the whole energy level. Last year you guys
weren't happy with Baylor. But it seemed like today you guys had constant
energy. Can you sort of talk about the difference between this year's team and
last year's with the depth and also the fact Gary Blair said you guys are
harder than ever to guard now because of all the offensive options. Do you
think that also helps just because of all the depth you have?  
SYDNEY COLSON: For sure. I think in situations when you're playing a team like
Oklahoma who will get out there, they have such fast guards. Robinson and
Stevenson are ridiculously quick. We know if they're coming out to try to trap
us, we can pass it to one of our posts and they can knock down a shot or pass
it to one of the guards and pass it off to someone to get a dribble as well.
It's important that we have such good depth this year, because people get
tired. What we try to focus on is people going into the game giving it all you
got. If you get tired, raise your hand, somebody will come in and sub for you,
and we know that we're not going to lose anything when we sub people in.  
I think that's a key part of our team. We're really deep and it helps us out a
whole lot.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, ladies. Congratulations. Good luck in the tournament.
Questions for coach.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: We saw a great basketball game by two very, very good teams.
We saw execution on the third day, one team shooting 51 percent, the other
team shooting 48 percent in the first half. Both teams powder got a little dry
in the second half, but that was because the defense picked up. We made
adjustments at halftime. They made adjustments and all of a sudden we didn't
get what we normally get.  
They took our transition game away because they did such a great job on the
offensive boards, particularly in the second half. We played a lot of zone
again. Not necessarily to save our legs for the NCAA tournament, but they're
not a great outside shooting team except for Stevenson, and so we had to play
to what necessarily was not their strengths.  
We did a pretty good job except with the pick-and-roll with McFarland and
Thompson in the first half. We adjusted in the second half. They didn't get
that action. But they sure got a lot of penetration and dipping it inside.
Thompson showed she's a -- Thompson and Smith showed first round WNBA draft
picks, they played very well. Tanisha, where is your points, did you see the
play she had with three minutes to go, tipped the ball over on a missed shot.
Huge play. Nobody ever writes about that.  
But I told her in the game I said, "You're setting the table. Keep going in
setting the table. Do a good job." She was on Stevenson the majority of the
game. Hartman was doing a good job on her as well.  
And so sometimes we have other options. This is what makes this team so
special. But look at the role players. Look at what McFarland did for them.
Look what Assarian did for us. Look at my bench again, what Colson can do.  
She's going to make some turnovers that just make my hair blond again. But at
the same time she creates offense. And she's got a no-fear attitude. I know
Danielle stripped her a few times. That hurt. But the missed layups at the
last eight minutes that Oklahoma missed, I'm sure Sherri probably talked about
that.  
Because they had a couple of point-blank ones that they just flat missed. Now,
the rebounds, the zone defense that we play -- hold on just a second -- the
set plays that we ran, the well-officiated ball game by three Final Four
officials, they never get any credit. But neither coach had problems with
officials all night. When you don't notice officiating you know you've got a
good ball game and those are three of the best.  
Folks, I'm going to lobby here for just a little bit. You just saw 2 No. 2
seeds play. Now, whether or not they give us 2 No. 2 seeds that's up to the
committee. But doggone it, we've earned the right not to be in Geno's region.
We've earned that right. And hopefully with our strength of schedule and
Oklahoma's strength of schedule, one of us deserves to be in the Minneapolis
region.  
Since I won 2 out of 3, that's me. And I know that means Oklahoma City, where
Sherri's from and the whole nine yards, but I've got relatives everywhere,
too. If not, send me somewhere but I think both of us deserve No. 2 seeds, and
I think both of us deserve not to be the last No. 2 seed which I have been the
last two years. And it better not happen again, committee. Questions?  
  
Q. These are two questions. First of all, this is the second time in three
years you guys have won here in Kansas City. Talk about the fact obviously
another title here in Kansas City. And then the next question, talk about
Danielle Adams, the beginning of the season, I know she was injured. You had
to get her somewhat in shape. Her progression through the whole season.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Kansas City has been good to me my whole career. As I stated
before. '98, '94, we recruit well in the Kansas City, Missouri, area. I eat
well in your great restaurants in town. We stay at not one of the fancy
places. We stay at the Courtyard Marriott by the plaza, one of the older
places. It's where we're comfortable. We don't have to have flash and dash.  
Just get my wife close to the plaza and she'll be as happy as can be. Danielle
Adams, she made the hard decision to come to us versus going to the team that
finished second in the nation last year, Louisville, who wanted her bad.  
But she said our system would get her ready for that next level. And that says
a lot for a young lady to say, "I'll lose the weight to play the up-tempo
style that we play." 35 pounds during the season from October on. Not in
August and September.  
And she has been everything that we asked her. A lot of times we did not need
to bring her in. And when I bring her in, she usually never goes out. But I'm
able to monitor fouls this way. And I'm able to give Tanisha Smith her shots
early on that she needs.  
When we started running the J series, what we call the high post series where
I ran one down for her and she took that high post shot out there, she's got
creativity. The only thing she was about that much late on getting that shot
before halftime.  
Now, that would have been finally an ESPN highlight shot. The shot that should
have been on ESPN yesterday, they showed some other shot in the girls' game,
when she scored on one end, went down, blocked the shot, gathered the ball,
slid on the floor, knocked the thing forward, what's ESPN thinking about? That
was the play that should have been on Sports Center. That wasn't a guard
knocking it away blocking the shot. That was a basketball player that did what
our team needed at the time. So that's my long-winded answer.  
  
Q. Your KC trio, including Danielle, those three, just what did they give
you guys today and do you think it was playing at home, it was a little more
special for those three, do you think?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Look at what Tyra White did in the first half. All of a
sudden, who are you going to stop? You're going to stop the penetration. We
reversed the ball. We knew they were going to trap our high ball screens.  
They knew we were going to -- they were going to send the girl over, Hartman,
to try to take away. And what does Carter or Colson, I can't remember, she
skips it all the way to the other side and Tyra hits a dagger. Then she hits
another one. I think she didn't score in the second half. But this is the way
this team is. All right. We will find your weakness and we will exploit it,
because we have weaknesses, too. Tanisha Smith did the little things.  
She had -- when we were in man, she was on Stevenson. Or she was switched off
and sometimes would take Robinson. Danielle Adams has just got basketball IQ.
And that's what a lot of times in the women's game players are missing
sometimes, is basketball IQ. Danielle Adams has that.  
  
Q. You mentioned Tanisha Smith doing the little things. She also did some
big things within the last 30 seconds of the game. Could you talk about the
rebounds she got and the foul shots that she hit for you to seal this?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Did you say Tanisha Smith or who?  
  
Q. Tanisha Smith.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: That's who I wanted to have the ball. When I saw
Roethlisberger on her, we knew where we were going. That was about like her
brother throwing that touchdown pass, that's Danielle Adams. We all of a
sudden knew that's where we wanted to go because we didn't want to take the
chance of losing the ball underneath. I've run that press breaker for years
and years. It's called northeast. Why? Because I stole it from Northeast
Louisiana, because they used it to beat my press when I was coaching at
Stephen F. I always give the other school credit. But it works. It's hard to
defend. We never lost the ball yet in about 15 years from that same press
breaker, whether we go deep or sprint up, hand it off, give it back to the
throw-in girl.  
  
Q. On Danielle, it's kind of a plan. You sit her on the bench, plays five,
six, seven minutes in the first half. Not everybody can respond to that. Then
she comes off in the second half and just knocks down everything?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: Jason Terry is doing it for the Mavericks, except last
night. All of a sudden, you don't want all your scoring options out there. You
want to start the game with defense. Damitria is our best post player. Take
shots, sacrifice her body, whatever. Adaora Elonu needs shots early. She
drives, shoots the ball well. She needs her shot. Tanisha Smith is going to
penetrate, make things happen, and my guards are going to read. And then
everybody is going to forget about Tyra White and she's going to eat you
alive.  
That's what we have. And then when I bring in, if I can ever get Colson
healthy, which I will next year, I'll be able to bring Carter off the bench
again. If I do not start her at the 2 guard next year and move Tyra to the 3.  
  
Q. Danielle just has an ability to sit for 30 minutes and then come in and
light it up. That's rare?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: It's her personality. She is the most easy-going kid I've
ever coached in my life. And it's just the way she is every day. Nothing gets
her excited. She just plays steady basketball. And she's such a lovable kid.  
  
Q. You sort of made the case for you guys and Oklahoma. Yesterday you made
the case for Nebraska. Still maintaining a No. 1. What about the rest of the
conference?  
COACH GARY BLAIR: I think seven teams need to be in the top four. Now,
obviously somebody will be pushed down to the five, maybe. And that would
probably be, who knows, Texas and Oklahoma State, but how do you push them
down? We've got the top conference in the country. We've got great coaches.
We've got great players, great assistant coaches. We've got great fans.  
We're willing to risk reward by playing the schedule. A lot of conferences, if
they knew their conference schedule was so tough they would play a lot of
guaranteed games, but we're willing to go out there on the road and play the
big-timers if they'll play us.  
And eventually this conference for us to get to do, we need two teams in the
Final Four one year and one of us win it. That's going to happen sooner than
later. I didn't say Sooners, did I? Sooner or later.  
  
Q. What are your thoughts about -- you haven't necessarily, from what he was
saying, been as thrilled about the change in format, the playing three or four
games without having that day of rest. What are your thoughts now? This is the
right setup for the tournament.  
COACH GARY BLAIR: I think it is. It gets you ready for the NCAA. That doesn't
bother me. My only problem -- and please take it to heart, Kansas City, I love
Kansas City -- but we have to have this tournament back in Dallas at least one
out of three years, somehow, some way, going on different weekends, try it.
Administrators, if you're listening out there, try it. We didn't write the
book on everything. Other conferences are doing it. Try it, recruiting
particularly for the north schools that are recruiting great Texas athletes to
come down and play.  
We need to build a base, then you would not just have 3100 people out here,
have one of the best games around on a Sunday afternoon. Okay. Now, you've got
a great home court advantage with Kansas and Kansas State here. Oklahoma City
you've got a tremendous advantage. We're three hours away from Dallas. Texas
is four hours away. Texas Tech is five hours away. And Waco is an hour and a
half away. So it's not that much of an advantage. But if we want to grow our
game, we need to spread it out like they're doing in the SEC. It always used
to be played in the state of Tennessee.  
Well, spread it out, and you will grow your game and now maybe the fans that
come to Dallas will start traveling up here to Kansas City and to Oklahoma
City and it would be better for everyone. And then Ohio State fans, they're
going to travel to Alaska. Those are good fans. They'll travel. So let's get
'er done.  
Is this the local station? Here the local station doesn't even give the scores
of the game last night on 10:00. Now, come on folks. And we get one page in
the Kansas City paper for our team. Come on. You got a great newspaper and
great TV stations, but this is top teams, all right. We need the media
coverage from Kansas City as well and then that crowd will go up, too. Thank
you.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State - 74  
Oklahoma - 69

  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by the Sooners from Oklahoma, Coach Sherri Coale
and student-athletes Nyeshia Stevenson, Danielle Robinson and Amanda Thompson.
Your thoughts about today's game.  
COACH COALE: I thought Oklahoma State played extremely well and they played
hard and they competed for the entire 40 minutes. Made us earn every second of
it.  
I thought the difference was we just played like a team. We had four guys in
double figures, and yet the minutes from Carlee Roethlisberger, the minutes
from Joanna McFarland were huge coming off the bench. I felt like it was a
team effort. You have to guard Andrea Riley as a team.  
And on the offensive end, sharing the basketball and a lot of guys getting
involved in scoring, that was the difference. And down the stretch some key
rebounds, and just a great team effort. Proud of our kids.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Danielle, could you talk a little bit about two things: First, you hit a
jumper and got to the line late, that kind of extended your lead. Talk about
that sequence, you turned and motioned to the bench. And can you also comment
on the fact that you were guarding Riley so much of the day, and how does that
impact things when you're having to follow her around all day?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: First, I had missed the jumper before I made that one. And
we had a little timeout. Coach said get under that one. That's the one I hit.
I got under it. And then I got to the rim, knew they were in bonus, so we were
going to get two shots.  
And then as far as Riley, I mean, I've been guarding her all year. We had that
little switch where Jasmine guarded her some and I guarded her some. But she's
a tough player to guard. 32 points, she was hot the first half. But like I
said, like she did yesterday she was going to take whatever it took for her
team to win.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, second straight game, didn't do much in the first half then came
out and lit it up in the second half. Is there a problem with knowing what the
tip-off time is or what's going on?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: I'm not sure. I was talking to AT, I don't think the goal
liked me over on the other end. But most of the time just takes me to slow
down. In the second half I always figure out what's not making my shot go in.
The first half I'm rushing, trying to do things too quick.  
  
Q. Amanda, you had 15 points in the first 11 or 12 minutes, whatever it was.
And then you went about 31 minutes without scoring. What went on early and
then what happened after that in terms of them stopping you on offense?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: In the first half, just the high post area, I took advantage
of it. The way they were guarding. She was sagging off me a little bit. So I
took those jump shots. Then I found some lanes to the basket.  
In the second half, I figured since I wasn't scoring, I figured I could start
rebounding and playing a little bit of defense. I wasn't playing defense in
the first half. So just gotta find different parts of the game to do.  
  
Q. Amanda, talk a little bit about Danielle and her steadiness. It's about
the same every time out for her. Just talk about what she brings to you guys
and that consistency.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: She's just a natural leader. She's the one that gets us all
together when we're starting to spread out. I know the look on her when the
game is on the line because she'll take over and she'll want the ball. And
that's what I love about her. She's just a great point guard, and I know she
wasn't going to back down to the challenge.  
  
Q. Danielle, talk about Riley, is it just a matter of, you know, she's going
to get hers and just take care of the rest of them, or what's the attitude?
Because she's going to get her 30, isn't she?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: You have to contest everything. Just keep her hands up at
all times because her range is incredible. So that's the mindset going in.
She's going to hit some. That's just what she does.  
  
Q. Amanda, maybe you had a little dry spell there, but knocking down those
last two free throws, can you talk about your mindset there?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: They were huge. I mean, we only had maybe like a 3-point
lead. So if I would have missed those they probably would have got another
3-point attempt. I've been in that position before. So I just had to stay calm
and knock them down like I always do in the free throw position.  
  
Q. Amanda, you guys split with Texas A &M this year, and they have a little
bit stronger post game in terms of their scoring than they've maybe had in the
past years. Could you talk about the matchup in the post and also facing them
for the third time?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: We just have -- we have to guard them together. What is her
name? Adams. She's real big down there, and she's got some good hands. Need a
little help down there, but I think we can guard down in the post. Abi is a
strong post down there, so is Joanna McFarland. So I'm not really too worried
about that. We've just got to play good defense.  
  
Q. Amanda, in the last 24 hours I've watched three games here. OSU, Iowa
State, and Baylor and OSU went down to the wire, great games the whole way.
Were those games for you as much fun to play in as you think they were
probably to watch?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Oh, yeah, that's what we live for. That's what we play the
game for, is to live for opportunities like that. And how great it is to get
the win when you're going point for point, point for point. I'm just happy to
do it with our team. And my teammates, we just enjoy the game together. And
it's a ball. It's a good time.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, I think just externally a lot of people saw what you lost in
graduation and the way Whitney Hand goes out. I don't think a lot of people
would have expected you to make a championship game in the Big 12
championship. Can you talk about how you guys came together in spite of the
things you lost from last year's team?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Starting from the beginning, we always talked about our
bubble. We have a bubble within our Oklahoma family. No matter what people
say, we have to be the ones to believe in -- I think everyone in our program
has bought into it. So that bubble is working pretty well.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about Danielle and her continued
consistent play and then the jumper she hit, the plays down the stretch?  
COACH COALE: It's such a blessing to have a kid that is so dependable as she
is. She's just so reliable. She has worked very hard at channelling her
frustration, if she misses a few shots or if she gets scored on because she
takes that personally. She's learned to play on and move to the next
possession.  
The thing I love most about her is that I can communicate with her constantly.
I can get to her. Some kids get involved in competition. They get lost in it,
they have that glazed look and no matter what you say they don't hear it.
Danielle was a sponge. She hears everything. And we call the low play to get a
jumper that she missed.  
And the next time down the floor, it wasn't even a timeout, I just said,
called the next play and said just get under it. She looked at me. I knew by
the look on her face before she ever even got involved in the set, when the
shot developed, she would make it. I just knew. It's a great blessing as a
coach to have a point guard like that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Nyeshia. She hits a couple quick baskets in the second
half and kind of gets you guys going.  
COACH COALE: Yeah, once again she came to the party a little late, but earlier
than she did last night. So maybe tomorrow we get the whole thing. She has
such an ability to ignite our team. Everybody relaxes a little bit. There's
less stress on every possession when she hits a 3. And that gives us defensive
life and it's a real positive chain reaction.  
I thought it was huge for her to come out and hit that one that early in the
second half.  
  
Q. A little disappointed you don't get a crack at Nebraska. And just kind of
talk about A &M and what they -- certainly they got your attention, but would
you like to have played Nebraska? You've been the one to hand them the loss.
  
COACH COALE: I would have liked to play someone different in terms of we come
up here. You've been in the Big 12 South battling people, we play south,
south, south. So in that regard, you know, yeah, it would be nice maybe to
play somebody that we haven't just played within the last week or so. But
still A&M is a fantastic team, and I think this tournament has been such a
reflection of the strength of this league that we talk about all the time.
Nebraska was undefeated. Undefeated. And they lose in the semis of our
tournament against a team that played very, very well, and you see all these
close games. Gary alluded to it earlier. Every game has just been a fantastic
basketball game.  
Today's between A&M and Nebraska was probably the largest margin of all
throughout the entire tournament. So I think, again, just a reflection of the
incredible parity within this league, and I think a lot of teams in this
league have a chance to go into the tournament and really make some noise.  
  
Q. How do you see A &M, your matchup with them?  
COACH COALE: A&M is very good. Different, I think, than they've been in the
past. Much more volatile offensively. I think they see themselves more as a
scoring team than necessarily a defending team, which is a little bit of a
shift in identity for them. Don't get me wrong, they still guard the heck out
of you. But they really want to go score it. And they have a lot of people who
can. I thought they looked really good today. Really in sync and in rhythm
with one another. And AT was right, Danielle Adams is a tough matchup for most
teams in America.  
  
Q. Thompson and Riley put on a show the first ten minutes or so. Riley 8 and
9 and Thompson 7 and 9. Thompson eventually cooled off and then Riley cooled
off. What happened to both of those players that the defense sort of got ahold
of them eventually?  
COACH COALE: That's a pretty predictable trend for Riley. She's going to make
some unbelievable shots. You can't be adversely affected by that because she's
also going to come back and miss some, too. And you have to stay with the game
plan. We didn't change a single thing defensively, not one thing. She just
made really tough shots in the first half and missed them in the second half.  
As far as Amanda goes, I really thought Amanda just had that. She gets this
will look, this possessed look in her eye when she knows we have to have
baskets. And she did that last night for a stretch. We couldn't score,
couldn't score. She is just creating ways to score, making plays. I don't
think she felt that sense of urgency in the first half tonight.  
And I think to a great degree she expended herself. And I think in the second
half, if we had needed her or asked her to continue to score at that pace and
rebound and defend, I'm not sure we could have gotten all that. But
fortunately other guys stepped up in scoring, and I'm not sure it was a
conscious decision by Amanda, I'm going to go rebound now since I'm not
scoring, but I think it was probably subconscious. She understood she had to
affect the complexion of the game and she certainly did.  
  
Q. First of all, Nyeshia talked about being in a bubble, but it's taken more
than just that. When Whitney goes down, that's three-fifths of your starting
lineup that's gone from last year to this year. Can you talk about from a
basketball sense everything you guys have had to do to make up for that. And
also, completely different question, you guys lost in the semifinals last year
and you still made to it the Final Four. Can you talk about what you have to
do? Because Nebraska is in that situation now of getting past the loss in the
conference tournament to get ready for the NCAA.  
COACH COALE: First question, the key there is we teach our kids all the time.
So while you guys are writing about Courtney and Ashley Paris, Courtney, and
Ashley Paris and Whitney Hand, we're still practicing, teaching Nyeshia
Stevenson and Jasmine Hartman and Amanda Thompson and Abi Olajuwon, working
with Abi every single day, so when this opportunity came she was ready to
grasp it and take advantage of it. So it's more -- it's more shocking, maybe,
to you guys than it is to us.  
We just got kids ready every single day. When Whitney went down, I think that
was the significant thing. Because turning last year into this year, you
prepare for that. We prepare for that. We knew Courtney was going to graduate
and Abi was going to have to be great. We knew that. We knew Amanda would be
able to move to a true 4 position and be comfortable there and shooters there.
We were planning for all that. The tough one was Whitney. You're not planning
for that. All of a sudden you're in the middle of a tournament and you've got
to figure out how to try to beat it. At that time the No. 3 team in the
country, which was Notre Dame. When we came out the next day and fought
against Notre Dame the way we did, we're in the game, down the stretch with
Danielle on the bench in foul trouble, and Jasmine and Nyeshia with very
little experience actually running the team from the guard position.  
I knew we had a chance to do something extraordinary with this year, because
these kids, as Nyeshia said -- she said it perfectly, they've all bought in.
They just believe.  
  
Q. Could you address the whole bouncing from the tournament loss?  
COACH COALE: When you play in a league like this, you can't be too affected
ever. You know, in the middle of conference if you lose two in January, you
can't be too affected, because somebody else is going to lose two in a little
bit and it's all going to even out. You just have to stay the course. And the
conference tournament is the last leg of that journey. We're all trying to
survive and play somebody new, play somebody different. And I think this is a
year in women's basketball where a lot of things could happen. Yes,
Connecticut is up there. In their own rarefied era, I suppose. But it I think
it will be an interesting year. You listen to the pundits what's going on on
the men's side. I heard people say there's not a great team. They haven't
watched Kansas. I think it's one of those years in women's basketball just
about anything in women's basketball will happen. I think Connie Yori and
Nebraska will be just fine.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit more about the play of Carlee and Joe from what
you said earlier?  
COACH COALE: Carlee coming in and making a 3 was absolutely huge. I loved the
way Carlee continues to shoot it with confidence, when you go through a
stretch where you're not making very many baskets, you can start to wonder
should I, should I not? And the first time she caught it on that second cutoff
of a screen, she was absolutely sure she was going to shoot it. I like that,
and obviously those three she hit helped us tremendously. And Jo continues to
look better, looking less and less like a freshman and more like a post player
that belongs right in the mix in the Big 12.  
  
Q. Can you talk about kind of winning a game on the defensive end, because
Danielle takes that charge on Riley with about 7:30 left and seemed like you
guys took the momentum for good right there.  
COACH COALE: We had to win games in a lot of ways this year. And that's one
thing I don't think that our kids are familiar or unfamiliar with any sort of
situation. And we've had to grind out a bunch of them. It would be lovely if
they could all be like last Sunday was in Norman against Oklahoma State where
everything goes in, every defensive possession is not so urgent. But it can't
always be that way. We've had to win a lot of games when we don't shoot it
well, and you do that by defending and rebounding. We had a mixture of that
tonight, made some shots and coupled it with difficult defensive stands, but
our kids know in tournament play defend and rebound. Shots will come. You've
got to defend and rebound.

### [Tegan Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20634)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  74  
Oklahoma State - 69

  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by the Oklahoma State Cowgirls, Kurt Budke along
with the two student-athletes Tegan Cunningham and Andrea Riley. Your thoughts
on this afternoon's game.  
KURT BUDKE: Well, I just can't even begin to tell you how proud I am of my
team and the effort. Third game in three days; and believe me, there's nobody
no more tired than these two up here. I thought it was a gutty performance and
a heck of a college basketball game.  
We've got a lot to be proud of. I think the only difference in the game was at
the free throw line. Other than that, I thought the rebounding and everything
that we got hurt with last time we did a much better job. We might have took
another step as a team today. So great effort.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions?  
  
Q. You guys both shot really well virtually the entire game. Then the last
eight, ten minutes cooled off. Looked like your shots were a little short. Do
you think fatigue was part of that, ended up playing three tight games in a
45-hour span?  
TEGAN CUNNINGHAM: I mean, obviously playing three games in three days
obviously took a toll. My legs were hurting early on. So, I mean, that's
probably, yeah, no one else has really played three games in three days. So
I'm sure it took a toll on us.  
ANDREA RILEY: Me, yeah. The same.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about just the back and forth nature of
this game? It seemed a little bit like when they got it out to about three or
four there late, I mean, that was one of the biggest cushions of the day. But
talk a bit about the back and forth of things and how stressful that was for
you guys.  
ANDREA RILEY: Well, I think that we really just played really well today. And
the fast speed games, playing against them like they beat us really bad the
last game, and then the game at home was kind of tight, but they just made
plays at the end. That's the same kind of outcome that it was tonight.  
When they only played one game and we've played two games. And then we played
a game so close last night, and so sometimes you have that freshness in your
legs to be able to make plays in the end.  
  
Q. Robinson hits a jumper. She missed one. I think they were up maybe three
or two and she missed a jumper, comes back and hits one and gets to the line.
Talk a bit about her play. Obviously you guys have gone back and forth this
year pretty good?  
ANDREA RILEY: She's a great player. It's basically an open floor. She really
knows how to lead her team and she just led them to a victory tonight. She did
whatever she had to do.  
  
Q. I asked the OU girls this. Same question for you. I think everybody that
watched the games last night, both games and then today's game, had a lot of
fun. Is it fun playing in games like you've had last night and today? You
pulled them out last night, didn't tonight. But is it a lot of fun playing in
such a tight back and forth game as you played up here?  
TEGAN CUNNINGHAM: Obviously it's a lot more fun if we win. I mean, I enjoyed
last night a lot more than today. But, yeah, what you play for. Conference,
every team is up for a chance. Any given team on any given night. It is fun.
But like I said I prefer to get the win, yes.  
  
Q. Talk about how this conference tournament has prepared you guys for the
NCAA tournament.  
ANDREA RILEY: I think my teammates have gained a lot of confidence, because
they really rolled off of my energy, but I think they found a way to just to
continue to be in stance, to go to the boards harder and try to do the little
things. I think that's really going to rub off going into the tournament.  
  
Q. Tegan, you seemed to recapture some of the shooting touch that maybe
eluded you the last couple of games, I don't know what you finished tonight,
nine of 18. Could you talk about that and how it felt to get that back
today?  
TEGAN CUNNINGHAM: Obviously OU didn't play me as tight as the other teams,
Ohio State really gave me no chance to catch the ball. So I mean we ran more
plays, me as well. And I just felt good going into this game. I hadn't had any
big nights so far. So obviously my legs were a little bit fresher than Andrea,
and coach made a comment to shoot the ball. He had faith in me.  
  
Q. Andrea, I know it's a difficult situation, but can you even allow
yourself to think about the possibility that you played your last game at
Oklahoma State?  
ANDREA RILEY: No, I've got confidence in my teammates. And I'm going to have
so much faith and believe that they're going to win the game.  
  
Q. Andrea, I know it's tough in a defeat also, but have you addressed the
breaking all the records, the tournament records and career in a single
tournament?  
ANDREA RILEY: The one I'm most proud of about is the assist record because I
don't really worry about scoring. So that's it.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. I think you learned something about your team up here that maybe you
didn't know before you got here?  
KURT BUDKE: I think, yeah, I think you're right. I think really it's maybe
five or six of the last seven games, I think we've done a much better job
defensively, much better job of blocking on game plans. The difference -- one
of the differences between us and OU right now is that OU has veterans that
have been to the Final Four and they do the little things right to win games
like this. They did it last night in the Baylor game. And they did it tonight.  
We were much better the last six, seven games of doing the little things.
We're not perfect yet. But my team as a whole has gotten better and we learned
a little bit more about our toughness at this tournament, yes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about some of your young players and how they've played in
this tournament?  
KURT BUDKE: I think this tournament is kind of an eye opener for some of them.
And as we look at Toni got in foul trouble tonight. But has played well in the
tournament. I thought Precious helped us tonight. I thought Carolyn Blair-
Mobley gave us good minutes tonight. You're not going to stop Danielle
Robinson, but she did a good job containing, making her shots tonight. We're
going to need everybody to win that first round game, and I think you saw
Lindsey Keller miss shots tonight but had confidence to shoot the shots
tonight. I just think this group as a whole will really rally together and I
think this tournament helped us as we prepare for the NCAA.  
  
Q. For somebody who doesn't worry about scoring, Andrea sure does it a lot.
Just talk a little bit about her tournament. It was a historic tournament for
her.  
KURT BUDKE: It really was. And just like her last answer to you about breaking
records. We just don't talk about those things at all. She doesn't talk about
those things at all. She never looks at the scoreboard. The one thing she
checks is assists: How many assists did I have? Because she really has taken a
lot of pride in getting her teammates involved and making our team better that
way. And for those that didn't come out and watch her in her career, they
really missed something. Because now we're not going to play at home anymore.
And it's a career that will be talked about for many, many years to come.
She's a great player and a great kid.  
  
Q. At halftime, Andrea was shooting great and Tegan shooting great. But
you're only up 4. Generally if both are hitting like that you've got a pretty
good lead. Do you think OU being able to score the way they did in the first
half was sort of the, kept them in the game and because you weren't going to
be able to keep shooting like that. That was a key thing.  
KURT BUDKE: It was a key thing. Again, that's where OU I think is a top ten
team, because they have four legitimate threats out there. At most all times.
They have four legitimate threats that any one of those four can go for 24
points on any one given night. We knew it as coaches. Of course we didn't talk
about it at halftime or anything, but we knew that the game being that tight,
our legs were starting to give just a little bit.  
You hoped and prayed that the kids could get through it. And they almost did.
They almost did. But OU is just a little bit fresher than us at the end.  
  
Q. Now you guys wait for Selection Monday. Can you just talk about your
feelings heading into that where you guys will be come Monday night?  
KURT BUDKE: We'll have a little party like we always do and get together with
some of our favorite people and watch the show together. And Monday night is
about a celebration of this season and how well these kids have done. And
we're not going to let anything take away from it. And I promise you I don't
know where we'll go or who we'll play, but those kids are going to play in
that game and are going to do everything they can to give Andrea Riley a
chance to play again.  
  
Q. You started in terms of talking about the game plan for having to face
us, now we're here that you have to game plan for this. What do you think? You
must have seen some things today that made you optimistic about how other
people can step forward, when she's not out there?  
KURT BUDKE: I totally agree. I mean, obviously you can't make up all her
points with one player but you can sure ask someone else to get four more, six
more, have someone else go. I mean Toni's capable of going for 20 on any
night. So is Precious. Obviously Tegan's going to have to have a good night. I
think they're not excited about playing without Andrea, but I think -- I just
saw the mood in the locker room and them looking her in the eye saying you're
not done. You're not done. And that was really good to see. I think they're a
confident group. And whoever we get I promise you it will be 40 minutes as
hard as we can.  
  
Q. I assume Carolyn made her first start tonight?  
KURT BUDKE: I think that's right.  
  
Q. 36 minutes. Talk a little bit about not only the start but 36 minutes.  
KURT BUDKE: Andrea is obviously the natural matchup but she, again, playing
the two games, we thought Carolyn could hopefully go in and contain Danielle
Robinson and I think she did. We asked Carolyn to keep Danielle Robinson
around her average. We thought that would be a great goal for tonight. And I
thought Carolyn did do that and that let Andrea not have to lead us in scoring
at this end and stop a great player at that end. And really proud of Carolyn
tonight. It was her first start, and I thought she delivered for us.  
  
Q. Seems the whole point of basketball is putting boards on the board. Why
does Andrea seem almost embarrassed about being a scorer? Could you talk about
what a great feat it is for somebody her size to come into this league and be
the all-time leading scorer?  
KURT BUDKE: It's unbelievable, isn't it? You see it right there. She never
ever talks about it. The toughness this kid has displayed in four years, and
we talked about it a little bit yesterday, all the many times she screened,
all the many times she's chipped on a screen, takes an elbow about nose
height, and all those things, I promise you, I can go back over her four-year
career and find 500 times that she was hit just a little bit harder because
who she is.  
I'm not talking illegally, I'm saying legally, of just trying to take her out
of her game. This has got -- she's got to go down as one of the toughest kids
in the history of the Big 12 for what she's meant for this program.  
  
Q. The fact you get an extra day, by losing a day you get an extra day to
play that one game without her. Because she's dribbling the ball 80 percent of
the time when you're on offense and now all of a sudden she's going to be
dribbling 0 percent of the time?  
KURT BUDKE: Right. We talked about it before we got here that if something
happened and we were eliminated early, just give us a couple more days of
practice. So I haven't even looked at really where the sites are, when we
might start. But the kids need rest right now. We'll probably go home tomorrow
and just have a nice relaxing bus ride home and get to work on Monday, and
you're right, one extra day, we'll take anything we can right now.  
  
Q. Is there an advantage to the fact that whoever you play has no idea what
you're going to do or what you're going to look like, probably because you
don't know either. I mean, literally --  
KURT BUDKE: I've got a little idea.  
  
Q. There's no way anybody can game plan for you because you can't replicate
what you've been doing?  
KURT BUDKE: No, we've talked about it as coaches already. They can get all the
film they want. It's not going to matter, is it? That's one of the different
things about this is that we obviously will hold some of the things that we've
done. But we've got an opportunity to pull out a whole new game plan. It's
like preparing for a Bowl game almost, isn't it? You can change everything in
that month you get, but we'll have to do it in about three days. That's why
the football coaches have it easy. I don't know what they're complaining
about.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  80  
Nebraska - 70

  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by the Huskers from Nebraska, Coach Connie Yori
and student-athletes Kelsey Griffin and Dominique Kelley.  
CONNIE YORI: A&M are a great team. I've said that all along when they're on
top of their game they're about as good as anybody in the country. Preseason
poll I picked A&M to win the league. Think they have the most talent. I think
they played extremely well. Gary and his staff did a great job of getting 'em
ready. Offensively they had it going. We didn't take anything away from them.
Obviously, rebounding was a big factor in the game.  
And we didn't play our best basketball, but I thought A&M just played very,
very well, and they definitely beat us in all facets of the game today.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, obviously the undefeated dream, we talked about it yesterday. Can
you just talk about this loss, and is there any kind of silver lining in it to
maybe slap you in the face a little bit before the big tournament?  
KELSEY ASSARIAN: If you would have told me we would have been 30 and 1 at this
point of the year I would have said you're crazy if you asked me that at the
beginning of the year. I'm still extremely excited with what we've been able
to accomplish, and I know the most exciting part of our year is just going to
be starting on Monday. Like coach said, A&M is a great basketball team.
Definitely one of the best teams in our league, let alone the country. And
it's hard to lose a game.  
But to lose to a team that played really great, you know, that's going to
happen. For us we know that there's things like rebounding, like coach
mentioned, that we need to improve on. When we defensive rebound we can be a
really good basketball team. She's been telling us that at the beginning of
the year. We know we have to take that to heart. That's something we have to
improve on. You have a few days to improve and get back in the gym and make a
run for it.  
  
Q. Dominique, could you just talk -- I mean, second half you guys made
pushes and they would kind of, I think, a transition, try to take advantage.
How deflating was that, and could you talk about that and talk about their
ability to get easy buckets in the second half.  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: Again, they were rebounding, their guards were getting
rebounds in, because of that they were able to attack us in transition. It's
nothing complicated. Our coach tells us the same thing when our guards
rebound, we can push the ball and we can be more aggressive in transition. So
I thought they did a really good job of that.  
  
Q. You talk about their match-up zone, it was pretty effective for them. And
also if you talk just how frustrating the foul trouble was, did you feel like
you just weren't quite yourself in this game?  
KELSEY ASSARIAN: Yeah, I mean definitely, when you get in foul trouble it's
really hard to get in a flow, and I need to be smarter as a senior coming in
and playing with knowing my foul trouble, and I need to be a little smarter.
But I'm kind of an aggressive player and it's hard to back down a little bit.
But so definitely that's a little bit. I have full confidence in my teammates.
I know they can play with or without me. But it was frustrating.  
As far as their match-up zone went, it was very effective, but we're also a
lot better shooting team than we've shown at this tournament. I know that my
teammates can knock down those shots throughout. You can go down the list.  
I know they can. They've spent hours in the gym in the offseason shooting,
hours in the gym shooting this season. We're a much better shooting team than
we showed.  
We know it. We're going to have confidence. And we'll knock down those shots
and it will be harder for teams to play things like match-up zones against us.  
  
Q. This is a Kansas City question. I know you guys a round between now and
the Midwest regional final, but the path would be to come back here. If you do
come back here, is there a little comfort knowing that you know the
neighborhood, it's a different gym but you saw it media day. Could you talk
about if you do come back here in two weeks.  
KELSEY ASSARIAN: Definitely, that would be great. But really we're just going
to take it one game at a time. That's how we've gotten to where we are. That's
how we've gotten to be as successful as we have this year. So I think to stray
away from that would be crazy.  
Of course, we'd want to come back here, but there's a lot of practices and
games between now and that time and we don't want to overlook anybody.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Could you follow up on that? You had a lot of fans here. Wouldn't that be
important to have 4- or 5,000 people here next week too?  
CONNIE YORI: Obviously we're going to find out on Monday night where we're
headed. And ideally would love to be in Minneapolis and hopefully that will
lead us back here. And if we can find a way to win two games. But our fans are
awesome. It was great to see so many Husker fans come out, and I'm sure the
Big 12 would like to have us win the game today so there would have been a lot
more Husker fans tomorrow. But I thank the fans for coming out and supporting
us.  
But obviously staying in the Midwest is huge. And fans always make a
difference for us.  
  
Q. How was your team's mood after the game? What did you say to them?  
CONNIE YORI: Well, I mean, Kelsey mentioned it. I mean, I think there were
several factors in the game. First of all, we didn't rebound the ball well and
that's a credit to A&M. And also, I said since the very beginning of our
practices, if we can rebound and compete on the boards we can compete with
anybody. I think we're good enough offensively. We didn't do a good job
rebounding. I think the other thing, too, that -- I didn't tell our team this,
but I think another thing that factored in the game today we've been a great
preparation team. We've been a great practicing team.  
When you have to play back-to-back, I think by no means A&M was in the same
boat, but I think that's been one of our strengths this year is that we've
been great in practice. Our players are smart. They pick things up. And we
didn't have that opportunity to get out on the court and work on those things.  
But mainly what I told them was that we just need to keep doing what we've
done, and we can't let one loss -- we can't lose the confidence with one loss.
That's a really good basketball team we lost to.  
Very talented. I think they're going to make a great run if they continue to
play like that, they'll make a run at the NCAA tournament. We've got to get
back on the horse, find out who we play and get excited. The best part of the
season is ahead of us.  
  
Q. Is there anything in particular you could see that was an issue in terms
of your 3-point shooting, because you struggled so much yesterday and then
today?  
CONNIE YORI: Well, 3-point shooting has a tendency to be a little contagious,
and we obviously shot it so poorly yesterday, and that became -- that becomes
contagious. I think free throw shooting has a tendency to be the same way. And
you start questioning yourself a little bit. But like Kelsey said, we're a lot
better 3-point shooting team than we showed.  
And, you know, 3-point shooting has a tendency to be a little streaky and
hopefully we can get back in the gym and get our confidence back.  
  
Q. Connie, talk about Kelsey's attitude. Because through this whole season
she's just kind of had this we're just out here playing and having fun sort of
attitude. And we've seen players that losing a streak like this, losing in the
semifinals of a conference tournament could have really brought them down and
she still seems to have kind of a positive attitude, we're just going to go
out and play the games and have fun with it. And talk about how important that
is for the rest of your team that she's taken that attitude toward the whole
thing.  
CONNIE YORI: I think all of our players are of the same mold that way. I think
Kelsey is the leader of them. We focus so much on being a good practicing team
and so much on -- the number one goal for us from the very beginning of our
season has been we're going to be a great practicing team. And we're going to
prepare well.  
One game is not going to change our season. And obviously now at this point
now it comes down to a loss will knock you out. But one game is not going to
change our season. We'll keep doing what we're doing and focus on who we are
and trying to get better and preparing well for our next opponent. But Kelsey
has really bought into that. But all of our players have.  
  
Q. Coach Blair was saying, Connie, that the major basketball powers the
Tennessees and UCONNs were looking at this game to see which of the teams were
real. Do you think with today's loss you'll have to have a strong showing
maybe in the first two rounds to remind them that this is a team that can
still compete for a national title?  
CONNIE YORI: Well, I don't think anybody from the get-go, when we opened the
season, we were picked sixth in the league. I think people kind of forget
that. And we're just going to -- we don't have a national title focus right
now. Our focus is our next practice.  
And it's real simple. And we can't worry about winning the national
championship. Our focus is let's take care of what we're doing here and
whoever we're playing in the first round, we're going to try to beat them. And
then we'll take it from there, if we're able to win.  
PETER IRWIN: Congratulations, coach. Thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  80  
Nebraska - 70

  
PETER IRWIN: We're now joined by the Aggies from Texas A&M, Coach Gary Blair,
his three student-athletes, Sydney Carter, Adaora Elonu, and Danielle Adams.
Coach, your opening comments.  
GARY BLAIR: Transition basketball. Tremendous guard play by my two Syds early
in the game. Sometimes you just gotta let 'em go. If you put your thumb on
them too much, that's not what you want. But Nebraska is such a good defensive
team and they were going to take away a lot of our wing entries.  
So we were trying to screen Turner off and get Colson and Carter in the open
court, make good decisions. And they're streaky shooters. Neither are pure
shooters, but they're streaky and they have no fear. What we did on the boards
was outstanding.  
I was really worried about them blocking us out and everything like that, but
we did a great job on the boards. Our shooting percentage was good. We went
into halftime, I told the Kansas City trio, it's your time now. Colson and
Carter gave you that lead.  
We have a lot of Adaora and some other kids, but in the second half I wanted
to make sure our scoring options was there. Try to shorten the game any time
we had a chance.  
But since they're going to press, it's going to open up the court. And when
you press and you make a mistake, it gives us an easy basket. And we had about
three or four easy baskets in the second half, and that takes the pressure off
of you.  
But this basketball team, everybody said, well, we're not going to be as good.
You're picked fourth and fifth in some polls and graduate three- or four-year
starters. And none of these kids here started last year. Danielle wasn't even
here. We recruit well. My assistant coaches do a great job of teaching. And,
hopefully, we can just keep playing a little bit longer.  
But I told our team, we're very similar to Nebraska in so many ways, because
we play with a lot of motion and fire like Nebraska does. And I said Stanford,
Connecticut and Tennessee are all sitting back watching this ball game to find
out if either one of us are for real.  
I mean, Connie and Gary, you don't say that in the same breath that you say
Tara, Geno and Pat. But Connie and Gary are not bad for what we've done with
our programs. My AD back there, Bill Burns, hired both of them. He has a
pretty good eye for talent and both of us have a good eye for recruiting
talent, getting the staff together and getting the right players to fit our
system.  
But it's our kids. We executed the heck out of our offense today. And who
would have ever thought a Coach Schaefer team on defense would play 40 minutes
of some type of match-up zone. And that's what we did. There was some open
holes in it. Okay, but they didn't find them quick enough. But give our kids
credit. That's one of the reasons why we rebounded so well. We also had an
umbrella in there. We were not trying to take out the passing lanes and
everything like we normally do.  
PETER IRWIN: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Danielle, you only played a couple minutes in the first half. I guess you
made up for it in the second half. Can you talk about how you were taking it
to 'em?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: After those two fouls in the first half, I just told myself
during halftime that I had to come back in, retaliate.  
We knew we could beat them since the first time we played them, but we didn't
succeed the first time. So we knew we had to come back and be more aggressive
the second.  
  
Q. Adaora, just talk about when you and Danielle are playing at the level
you did today, how good is this team, because the guard play has been very
consistent.  
ADAORA ELONU: I think when the both of us step up our game, it's very hard to
guard any of us, because you can't sag on our guards it opens the lane for
either me or Danielle to drive. If one steps up, then the other one would step
up as well. So I think if both of us play very well, it's very hard for any
team to guard us.  
  
Q. Danielle, when did you sense that Nebraska would be vulnerable under the
basket and whether it was in transition or whether it was throwing the ball
into the paint or getting rebounds that you could get position on their big
girls and be able to use the glass like you did?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Since the first time we played them, I was pretty dominate
down in Nebraska, so I knew I had to come back and be aggressive on the low
post.  
  
Q. Sydney, could you just talk about that 20-7 run that you guys had in the
first half where you seemed to be pushing the ball, and also the all-Sydney
back court that we saw out there, too, today?  
SYDNEY CARTER: I just think that we knew that they were going to be pressuring
us on the defensive end. So running our sets was going to be a little shaky,
just because we knew how they were out pressuring the ball, especially Turner,
she's a really great defender on ball. We were really trying to get
transition. We did start running, grabbing the rebounds. I knew I had to get
in there and help the post rebound.  
So that's what I did today, and once we got it we were gone. And it's just
good to have me and Syd playing together and playing well, and us hitting
shots is just a plus for our team because we do have the Kansas City trio. We
have Adaora and they're all scorers. Makes it hard to guard us when we have
all five people out there ready to score.  
  
Q. Adaora, could you talk about the defensive effort on Kelsey Griffin, what
was the game plan going in there?  
ADAORA ELONU: It was the same game plan as any team. We front and we depend on
our help and the pressure on ball. So we just really did what we always do,
play aggressive defense, front her, make sure no post touches the ball. Not
only on Kelsey but on No. 40, Redmon, and Montgomery. It's the same all
around, basically.  
  
Q. Danielle, when you do get the position inside and get the right entry
pass, do you think anybody can stop you inside once you gain the ball five
feet from the basket or so?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Not at all. I don't think nobody can stop me. I'm pretty
aggressive inside and pretty strong, and my teammates depend on me so.  
GARY BLAIR: Easy, easy.  
[Laughter]  
DANIELLE ADAMS: That's true. I don't think anybody can.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about this journey for you this season, because I
know you hurt your hamstring in the preseason. You had to work at getting in
better shape, even though you were hurt, and just what this means to you to
play so well today and what all you've gone through this season.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I hurt my hamstring at the beginning of the season, sat out
for like a month. I knew I had to come back and work hard, step my game up.
And just did the extra conditioning that I had to do.  
And it brought me out as the player I am now.  
  
Q. Sydney, could you talk about just what about beating Nebraska, what does
that do for the players looking ahead?  
SYDNEY CARTER: Of course, this win makes us feel great. But like we said, like
I've said before, we're not satisfied. Because we really want this ring. And I
don't have one, and I really want to get one for Tanisha and especially
Danielle and Tyra because this is their hometown, and we've said before we
just want to hold it down for them.  
I mean, we're not satisfied yet. We got a game plan to execute tomorrow and
finish it out. We're just looking forward to tomorrow.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, ladies. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that match-up zone and why you came out and did that?
Why were you so effective on Griffin and the 3-pointers? Let's talk about
that, too.  
GARY BLAIR: I just don't think they found Griffin enough on the zone. They're
a very team-oriented team. And they've got a lot of scoring options. But all
of a sudden when Griffin wasn't -- and we got the lead, then Griffin started
forcing a couple of shots, I don't know if we really stopped Griffin. She was
7 out of 13. Four fouls stopped Griffin, then about three more that weren't
called.  
But Kelsey Griffin is by far the best player in this league and one of the
best in the country. And I hope she gets State Farm All-American, but I don't
think we stopped her as much as we slowed her down. And we did a pretty good
job on Montgomery. And that was the key. She wasn't hitting the 3's. Kelly and
Turner, they were just tough. I mean, Turner the best defensive wing in this
conference bar none. She can guard anybody. We were just trying to get away
from Turner as much as we could because she disrupts everything.  
  
Q. Gary, yesterday you said a loss would probably be good for Nebraska going
into the NCAA. How good is this win for A &M?  
GARY BLAIR: I think it's great for us as long as we can keep winning. Hey, the
difference between me and you is probably only about a year's age. I mean, all
right, you need a good story, I need another good win.  
[Laughter] And that's just the bottom line. And we need to keep going. And I
think it will be good because it will take the pressure off, send them up to
Minneapolis as a No. 1 seed and let Nebraska Nation all show up there. They
had a great crowd here today. But our kids respond to great crowds on the
road.  
We go to Oklahoma and we go to Nebraska and we go to Iowa State and all of
them, that doesn't bother us at all. But this could help because now they saw
a little chink in the armor.  
The other thing that perhaps really hurt them, when somebody gets into foul
trouble, their bench cannot just come in and play, their bench has got to
score. We outscored them 36-2. Okay, that's the only thing that I think Connie
has to develop is some scoring options off of that bench, because they've been
coming in all year long and then holding the fort and making all the hustle
plays. Now I think they've got to find a legitimate score coming off that
bench.  
  
Q. Danielle is sitting there with two points at halftime. Talk about the
decision to start her and it obviously paid off. She had 20.  
GARY BLAIR: Don't worry. Coach Schaefer was in my ear, we shouldn't do that,
we shouldn't do that. Either I'm going to be a genius or a fool. I guess I was
the genius because he loves to start defense no matter what. But I felt we had
to stretch the lead. Nebraska has been behind the whole last month of the
season, and then they come firing out and they find a way to get the crowd
into it. I wanted to make sure that at that five-minute mark I was at least
even.  
And we were dominating the first five minutes of the second half and we were
up by one point. Because we threw the ball away, they scored in transition.
Even though we were executing our high series on offense to perfection, we
were up by 1. And so at least I got my scoring, didn't allow them to get down
under ten points.  
  
Q. Gary, you guys played so well in non-conference season, and then a little
bit of an injury bug with Sydney and that sort of thing. But are you guys
playing, do you think, your best basketball right now?  
GARY BLAIR: I think we are. We've done it for our last ten ball games, and
we're playing well. We're practicing well. We've got depth. And I've got a
bench full of scoring options.  
If Colson was healthy, she would be starting and Carter would be coming off
the bench. And who in our league could bring Carter and Danielle Adams and
then bring an energizer bunny like Maryann Baker off the bench, and nobody has
that. That's something that we are proud of. My assistants have done a good
job recruiting for our needs, and that's what we're going to stay with. We
will play our bench in all sorts of situations and start them when we have to.
32-6 was the bench.  
  
Q. Two years ago you were here as a No. 4 seed. I wonder if you could
compare because the personnel has almost completely turned over. Compare this
team because the obvious thing that stands out is a lot stronger post-scoring
presence, but other ways that you compare to 2008?  
GARY BLAIR: Perhaps we are not as good man to man defensively, but in the last
15 games our defense has got a whole lot better. When you lose three four-year
starters that were all defensive players first, it's hard to bring in and
replace Micheaux and Gant. So we had to develop an Adaora. Coach Schaefer has
been very patient with the defense, and we've added a few things for our
personnel. We're playing, instead of our full-court man-to-man press, we're
playing more of a 2-2-1 when we have to. We're trying to slow them down and
sometimes you have to adjust. Like we love to sit there and say we have kids
that could play 40 minutes of help. But I'd rather just play 40 minutes of
good Aggie defensive basketball. And two years ago, when we played Oklahoma
State, it was two guys that have come from the bottom of the league.  
Oklahoma State and Texas A&M were the two worst teams in this league, and I
think it gave a little bit of credit to their administration and our
administration for hiring the right people. You hire the right people, you're
going to build up a program. But building it up in the Big 12 South is the
hardest thing in America to do, because the Big 12 South is pretty doggone
good.  
PETER IRWIN: Thank you, coach.

THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Lady Bears from Baylor, Coach Mulkey,
her two student athletes, Morghan Medlock and Brittney Griner. We will take
questions for our student athletes.  
  
Q. Brittney, it had to be nice to get back on the floor. How much did you
just miss being out there with your teammates?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: You know, I missed being out there with my team. It felt good
to be back and playing with everybody.  
  
Q. Brittney, how long did it take you to feel back in a groove?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I would say my first block I felt like I was back in the
groove.  
  
Q. Brittney, similar question. Did you approach the game tonight same as
every other game mentally, or did you try to adjust anything or just try to
keep things as normal as possible?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I didn't try to change too much of my game. I just tried to
come out as normal as, you know...  
  
Q. Brittney, it looked like during introductions because I was sitting cross
from you that you took a deep breath and just ran out for your introduction,
were you getting out and seeing what the reaction was going to be? Were you
nervous at all, or how did you feel at that point?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I don't remember taking a deep breath before I ran out. I
don't remember that.  
  
Q. Brittney, it seemed like you were more aggressive starting the second
half than you were in the first half. Were you kinda holding back at all in
the first half a little bit?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I wouldn't say I was holding back, but I knew I had to step
it up second quarter, I had to go in and try to get a run, you know? So I was
trying to help my team out.  
  
Q. Morghan, with Melissa being out and Brittney missing the last two games,
it seemed like what we saw in the best moments for you guys tonight were the
way you guys will be in the NCAA, is that what you think, with Brittney back
and when Melissa comes back that's how you're going to look?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: Definitely, it will give the world a gauge what this
basketball team will look like when we head back into the NCAA, but I was
excited to have those two back in the lineup.  
  
Q. Morghan, typical Baylor/OU game, I think neither team led by more than 5
points. In your estimation what was the difference down the stretch?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I think when you have a team with three upper classmen that
have been to the Final Four they know what it takes to win at the end of the
ball game. Nyeshia Stevenson executed. Danielle Robinson got her the ball, and
I think overall their team -- they're older and more experienced and they
executed down the end.  
  
Q. Morghan, 18 points tonight, what's made you effective in the last couple
of games?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I think just playing my game, going out there and playing
hard and just finishing shots and taking my time and not rushing anything.  
  
Q. Brittney perhaps you didn't hear, but there were a small smattering of
boo's when you were introduced, did you hear that? What do you think of it?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: I just drown it out, all I heard was cheers.  
COACH MULKEY: Make sure you ask me that question.  
  
Q. Brittney, what did you learn from the suspension and the whole
incident?  
COACH MULKEY: She learned she misses her team. She misses playing the game.  
  
Q. Brittney, you had a lot of blocked shots tonight. You were cutting those
drives to the basket down. Is it frustrating for you when they start pulling
it out and shootin' the 3 which you can't get to as much?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Yeah, you know, it's a little frustrating when they pull it
out to the 3. Guess I'm going to have to start going out to the 3-point line
to start blocking shots.  
  
Q. Morghan, you played well last year in the Big 12 Tournament, too. Is
there something about this tournament that gets you motivated a little bit?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I would just have to say it's crunch time right now and
players make plays at the end and I'm just glad I'm playing well now than not.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let y'all go back to the locker room.
Thank you very much, and we'll now take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, did you hear the smattering of boos? What did you think?  
COACH MULKEY: I did. I was disappointed. It's a teenager that made a mistake,
and she's good for the women's game, and she's human.  
  
Q. Kim, can you talk about the decision to play Melissa? Was that want to go
get her action before NCAA's?  
COACH MULKEY: My intention yesterday was not to play her unless we made it to
the Finals, and M.J. and the trainers spoke with me a little before midnight
last night and just wanted to play sparingly couple minutes of time just to
get back in the flow.  
I don't like coaching like that but you have to do it if you're going to play
her extended minutes next week. I thought she did some good things out there
but it's difficult coaching like that and I'm sure it is playing for her as
well.  
  
Q. Kim can you assess Brittney's play on the floor? Did you see her sort of
have to warm her way up into the game?  
COACH MULKEY: I thought she was tentative. I thought she wasn't probably as
much of a presence in the paint as she had been. I thought she was tentative.  
  
Q. Kim, seemed like that was particularly on the rebounds, too, and maybe
they were just doing that good of a job blocking her out but she finished with
six rebounds.  
COACH MULKEY: It's her first time back in two games and it's not exactly a
team that isn't very good, they're very good, big bodies in there, they have
Final Four experience and she's got to work her way back into the flow just as
M.J. does.  
  
Q. Coach, Baylor finished 2 of 9, Oklahoma 6 of 12, what was the difference
down the stretch?  
COACH MULKEY: I think Morghan said it best. You're looking at a basketball
team in the green out there, is that what color we had on tonight, black,
green, I don't know what we wore, they're babies, and they're just really
playing hard and they're playing off of energy and enthusiasm and they're
winning ball games because they're talented, they're losing ball games -- when
I say "they" I mean "we".  
They're losing down the stretch against an Oklahoma team who has a senior in
Nyeshia Stevenson who had 4 points in the game, and I have a freshman guarding
her and you know she is going to explode at some point, you have Amanda
Thompson and Danielle Robinson, and I want our kids to hurt. I want it to
bother them in the locker room that they had an opportunity to win the game
and you didn't execute, and they did and then you go back and show them what
they did at the end of the game to win it, and when you become that junior and
that senior you're going to be the team that's talented and be able to win
that ball game at the end.  
  
Q. Kim even with the loss tonight you guys are 14-3 when Brittney and
Melissa both play, losses to Tennessee, Texas and OU. Is that what you tell
your team? Obviously, you have to like your chances going into the NCAA.  
COACH MULKEY: I do like our chances of going to the NCAA Tournament. Everybody
in the Big 12 should like their chances going into the NCAA Tournament. We are
a very good basketball team when we are all playing and you don't have
suspensions and injuries and you're right when Melissa Jones went out we were
14-1.  
It's going to be fun to coach this group through the NCAA's and it's going to
be a lot more fun if I can live long enough to watch 'em the next couple of
years because they are so talented and their understanding of what you have to
do to win at this level. It will happen for 'em.  
  
Q. Kim, these last 8, 10 days, can you see the value and the experience in
this for you as a coach, for Brittney, can you pull whatever y'all have
confined for value out of this experience?  
COACH MULKEY: Are you talking about the punch?  
  
Q. And everything that happened.  
COACH MULKEY: Let me make it clear again there is no value in that in women's
basketball. It was horrible. It was horrendous. It was not anything that any
of us are proud of. It's not anything Brittney is proud of.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH MULKEY: I think in life all of you need to look in the mirror. We all
need to look in the mirror and ask ourselves have we made some really bad
decisions? I bet we all have. I view things, Michelle, a little like you wrote
in your article. I'm a mother, and when I go into that home and recruit that
kid and I look at her parents in the eyes and they say "I want that kid to
play for you because you run a disciplined program" that came out of Brittney
Griner's father's mouth, and he expects, when she fails, for me to discipline
her and not throw her on the street.  
I would think if I coached your daughter you would want that, too. And
Brittney Griner will learn from this, and if she doesn't, Brittney Griner will
eliminate herself about we all fail in life, and she is the sweetest child in
a 6' 8" body that has been -- I've been doing this since 14 years of age and
I've played at all levels of basketball and I've played with some of the
greatest players, and I've never been around a more gentle giant than Brittney
Griner.  
All I ask is that you judge Brittney Griner before the incident and you judge
her after the incident. What made her so bad is it was done in a public forum
and you remembered this. There is not a coach in America that has not had to
discipline a kid for taking a swing at a teammate in private that none of you
ever knew about, not on the men's side, not on the women's side.  
It's not something any of us are proud, but you remember those of you who
don't have children, don't judge kids. Don't judge 'em. Let them clean up
their mess with help from adults, and if they don't clean it up, then they
eliminate themselves. It was, again, a horrible, horrible thing, and she hurts
because of it.  
  
Q. Kim, you had Whitney come in there with 17 seconds left. Was there
something specifically --  
COACH MULKEY: Trying to get a 3-pointer to tie the ball game and we didn't get
it executed, Jerry. Again, you had two juniors, a freshman, a senior and a
junior that gets limited time on the floor, trying to get a 3-pointer to tie
the ball game.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH MULKEY: Sure, sure, M.J. wasn't -- she gave you some good stuff but she
just needs to get in the game flow. She's been out how many months now, she's
been out a while, so we've got to try to get her in the flow and injuries are
part of the game. These stress reactions and fractures are just -- you don't
know what the right answer is, play her or don't play her.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Congratulations on a great season.
Good luck in the tournament.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Nebraska  63  
Kansas State - 46

  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the Nebraska Corn Huskers, Coach Connie Yori
and her two students Kelsey Griffin and Cory Montgomery. Coach your opening
thoughts about today's win and congratulations.  
COACH YORI: Well, it seems to be the story of this tournament. I don't think
anyone has played very well on offense, and I think there are factors that go
into that. Obviously this wasn't our best offensive game, but there are three
facets to the game and I thought our defense was good and the second half we
did a good job of rebounding. So we won two out of three facets of the game
and we didn't shoot well. When Cory finally made the three. We kept saying in
the time outs we're going to make these shots and obviously they weren't going
in but it was go ahead to see a couple perimeter shots go down, but again, I
think that's where we are in our league. When you're playing in the best
league in the country the 16-game schedule that you have to face is wearing,
and I think you haven't seen teams play at their best offensively in this
tournament and I think that has to do with the fact that everybody is -- the
fatigue factor has set in to a certain degree, and I think hopefully we will
see a little bit better basketball but today we had to do it with defense and
rebounding.  
  
Q. Cory, can you talk about the team going 0-18 on 3-pointers, until you
finally hit that one?  
CORY MONTGOMERY: We knew -- we're confident shooters, and we missed our first
couple but we knew we had to keep shooting the ball and shoot with confidence
and hoped that it goes in. We just did that and we were fortunate, we knew we
weren't hitting, so we had to go to the offensive glass and get the rebounds
and get the extra possessions because our shots weren't going down, and we
knew we had to tighten up everywhere else in the facets of the game because
our shots weren't going down.  
  
Q. Kelsey, can you talk about the conversation at halftime? You guys had a
rebounding deficit, you weren't hitting perimeter shots, what was the
conversation?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: It was basically that that wasn't us out there. Our defense
was good we were playing hard defense and we were happy about that, and
usually it's kinda the reverse that our offense is helping us and our defense
needs to get picked up. We knew -- we know we are a better shooting team than
we showed, we can take care of the ball better we have better chemistry on
offense and we went out there and tried to prove it.  
Shots didn't really fall but I have faith in my teammates, they put a ton of
work into the off-season and we can gain confidence from that and hopefully it
will be different next time around.  
  
Q. Cory, what does it say about you guys that you go 0-18 on 3-pointers and
you're still leading by 13 at that point?  
CORY MONTGOMERY: That we're a fighting team. If we're struggling in one area
we know that we need to pick it up in another area which we were able to do
with our defense. We wouldn't get things going on offense, so we knew that we
needed to bear down on defense and get the stops we needed as a team to help
our offense.  
  
Q. Kelsey and Cory, how much attention do you pay to the other undefeated
team in the country and do you find yourself imagining what it would be like
to play against them in the postseason?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: I think my team feels privileged to be mentioned among that
other undefeated team, but we have so many games and so many scouts and so
many practices before that would be a possibility that we don't want our
season to be cut short by overlooking teams.  
So we're taking it one game, one practice at a time. I want this season to go
on forever, so I don't want to look to that last game if that's the
possibility, so I'm taking it one day at a time.  
  
Q. Kinda following up on the halftime question, Kelsey, did you take it upon
yourself early in the second half to take command? You scored 16 of the first
20 points.  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: I don't feel like I have to take anything upon myself. I just
kind of let the game come to me. We knew we needed to do a better job of
transition, it's harder for me to double team and things like that. So I think
we really just played more of our basketball.  
My teammates do a great job of putting me in successful positions, and that
came but there is more to what came than just putting the ball in the hole.
There were defensive stops that people were coming up with and defensive
rebounds and it might have looked like I was going on a run, but it was a team
concerted effort to be able to do that.  
  
Q. Both players, obviously it's been a great season all the way through, no
losses and you keep doing things you haven't done, or haven't done in a while.
This is the first win at the Big 12 tournament since '05, talk about what that
means to this class.  
CORY MONTGOMERY: It's great for offensively us to have that first win in the
Big 12. We have never accomplished that in the years that both of us have been
playing. To have that was great and we knew we really wanted to get this first
win, and from here we'll move forward and look into our second team once we
know who we're going to play but it's great to get this first win and we're
excited.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, we're going to let you go back to the locker
room, congratulations on your win. Questions for Coach Connie Yori.  
  
Q. Connie, it was the first win in the Big 12 tournament in five years this
isn't exactly a slow build for your team and program, you've gone from not
winning a tournament game in five years to being the number one seed and
coming in undefeated. I wanted to ask you to wrap your head around that a
little and how quickly things have turned for this program in the last year.  
COACH YORI: I don't feel like our program has turned as quickly as people
might think. Two years ago we were a pretty good basketball team and I think
we finished 25 in the RPI that year. So everybody keeps looking back at last
year, but we have built this program I think in the right manner. You used the
word "slowly" I think that's the way we built it, little by little, two years
ago we were an NCAA tournament team.  
Last year we were an NCAA, played Maryland on their home court in front of
their own crowd and the number one seed that year and last year was a step
backwards, obviously, but this has been -- I felt like we were going to be a
good team this year and it felt like this isn't as much of a surprise as what
some people might think.  
  
Q. Coach, I know Kelsey is probably too humble to take any credit for it,
but can you talk about the run she had in the second half? It seemed like she
decided she was going to score, and she did.  
COACH YORI: Yeah. She kind of has a way about doing that. Kelsey has -- can
dominate a game, she can take over, and I felt like we didn't get her the ball
enough in the first half and we talked a little bit about that.  
She has a way -- I mean it wasn't just on the low block, she took people off
the dribble and she got on the offensive glass, that's her versatility and
that's the kind of player she is, and when you have a variety of ways you can
score, you have the capability of taking over the game like she did during
that section.  
  
Q. Connie, also along the Griffin line there, she also took a couple of
charges in that run that we're talking about. Why is she so good at that? I
know you've talked about it before, but can you expound on it?  
COACH YORI: Well, she's smart and she understands player tendencies and she's
willing to take charges. Not all players are willing to take charges.  
You can talk about it in coaching and you can work on it, but when it happens
quick until a game you've got to be both intelligent and tough and she's both
of those things.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about obviously you felt like you would have a good team
but there is a difference between having a good team and being undefeated at
the stage of the season, especially given the competition in the Big 12. Can
you talk about how special that is?  
COACH YORI: Well, obviously no one would have expected us to be 30-0, nor did
I, but at the same time, again, we thought we would -- if we could get healthy
and stay healthy we thought we would have a pretty good season. Obviously,
what we have done, we've found a variety of ways to win games. You don't get
to 30-0 by winning just with offense or just with defense or just with
rebounding.  
As I keep saying, you've got to find different ways to win, today it was about
defending well and doing a good job of rebounding in the second half. This is
a rarity, I might coach for another 30 years and not have this happen and I've
been telling everybody about fifty years you can have one of these seasons.  
  
Q. Coach, during the week leading up to this you mentioned maybe needing one
more win to solidify yourself as a number one seed. Do you feel this win makes
you a number one seed?  
COACH YORI: Again, I'm not on the committee, but I do think this was an
important game for us and puts us in a great position and tomorrow regardless
of what we play we're going to play a top, good RPI team, a team that's going
to be ranked in the top 20, and so this game I thought was very important for
a lot of reasons; and, again, I'm not in on the discussions, but I think there
is a good chance we will be a number one seed based on what happened today and
regardless of what happens tomorrow.  
  
Q. You talked about rest being a key and getting players rested and having a
chance to sit for a little bit as a key for this tournament. Were you relieved
that you guys pulled away there late because Kelsey was playing a lot of
minutes beforehand?  
COACH YORI: Yeah, we tried to -- I knew going into this game that we were
going to put a few more eggs in our basket in this game because we felt like
this was one we had to get. Hopefully to lock up a number 1 seed, so we felt
like we weren't going to go as deep in this game but tomorrow we will probably
end up going deeper into our bench.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, thanks and we'll see you tomorrow.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  77  
Texas - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by our student athletes from Texas university,
Brittainey Raven and Ashleigh Fontenette, and if you have questions we'll take
'em now.  
  
Q. Brittainey, you guys were up and Texas A &M went on a 13-0 run, can you
talk about that?   
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: I think we struggled on the defensive end, we weren't coming
down and scoring on the offensive end and we weren't getting turnovers.  
THE MODERATOR: You need to speak into the microphone, nobody heard you.  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: I said we didn't get defensive stops and then coming down on
the offensive end. We weren't executing and we had turn overs.  
  
Q. For both of you, what is it with Texas A &M? Is it such a hard match-up
with their guards? What is it?   
ASHLEIGH FONTENETTE: It seems like we have a mental block when it comes to
A&M. They always get the best of us. We can never take care of the ball like
we should. I'm at a loss for words.  
BRITTAINEY RAVEN: I mean every time we play A&M they give us their best game
and we give them our worst game. Since my freshman year it's been that way
every year.  
  
Q. Either or both of you, the three kids from Kansas City scored 57 of their
77 points. Can you talk about Adams and Smith and White, what made them tough
today?  
ASHLEIGH FONTENETTE: I'm sure they had confidence, they're playing at home,
I'm sure they had family and friends here. She stepped up big for their team.
They're leaders on their team, they play well.  
  
Q. Brittainey, on the turnovers, any particular reason or they just react
too quick and y'all's passes are too soft or lazy or too much air under 'em,
what is it?  
ASHLEIGH FONTENETTE: The majority of our turnovers were because we were
throwing them away, I don't think their pressure or being in the passing lane
had anything to do with the turnovers we had, most of the turnovers we had.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, thank you very much. We appreciate you're
answering the questions. Best of luck to you in the tournament, Coach?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Congratulations to A&M. I thought they played an excellent
game. You know, they had great contributions really all around from everybody
that got in. I thought they played great team basketball. Obviously, their
pressure bothered us, 26 turnovers, we've had 20 or more turnovers every time
we've played them so that was the name of the game. You can't score if you
don't have the ball and we gave them too many opportunities and they took
advantage of it.  
  
Q. Was it just a difference in heads-up guard play? You feel like there was
some bad decisions on making passes and soft entry passes?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Definitely. Ashleigh Fontenette with 6 and Erika with 6 and
Brittainey with 4. That's our backcourt right there so you're not going to be
successful if your guards can't handle the ball, handle the pressure and
handles the situation and they didn't do any of the above so it was a
frustrating night inning for all three of them.  
  
Q. Gail, can you handicap this semi-final match-up because Nebraska is
coming in 30-0 but A &M is playing so well right now, about as well as they
have all season and having played both of those teams this year how do you see
that workin' out?   
COACH GOESTENKORS: I think it's going to be a tremendous game. Both teams play
excellent defense, they both get up and in passing lanes, they're both very
physical, I think Nebraska is a much better passing team than we are, so if
you take care of the ball you can take advantage of some mismatches and I
think they did that in the first game when they played; but it was a battle in
the first game, and I think A&M is playing much better now. I think it can go
either way.  
If Nebraska is to lose, I think it's going to be tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, you had 12 turnovers in the first half and you were able to
overcome that and take a 4 lead, what happened in the 13-0 run?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: We had 15 turnovers at half, we weren't blown out, so I
felt like we were in a good position, I didn't think we turned the ball over
like that in the second half. I thought we would be able to adjust to the
pressure.  
You know, we took the lead, we were scoring in transition and then A.T. had a
tough turnover where it led to the fast-break layup, and it took the wind out
of our sails, and they won't a 13-0 run and once they scored in transition it
gave them confidence. Their wings started hitting some pull-up J's as well.
The first half they weren't hitin', and in the second half they did.  
  
Q. Gail I know Kat hasn't fared well in the last three games, is it the
defense or not getting into position?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I think they play great defense on Kat; however, I give
responsibility to Kat because she doesn't use screens well to get open, and we
talk about it before and after every game with them, if you don't set good
screens and you don't use screens you will not be open against this team so
we're still -- that's a work in progress.  
  
Q. I hate to ask this, but A &M, I can't think of any opponent in your
coaching career, even going back to Duke, you had some runs with Carolina
where they might have had 3 or 4 in a row, Gary talked about his guard play
being good. But how frustrating is it that they're the team you haven't been
able to beat yet?   
COACH GOESTENKORS: It's been frustrating, and it reminds me very much of
Carolina because when I first got to Duke -- and Carolina was so physical, and
that's when I started using guys to practice against because I wanted to
simulate Carolina and their physical play. They're very, very similar and they
had us for a while. Once we got over the hump and won that first game then we
went on a roll so I expect the same thing to happen I just hope it happens
soon!  
  
Q. Given the history here in the last two or three years, how much of the
problem for your girls do you think is from the neck up? Is it a mental thing
with them at all, do they get discouraged visually when things start to go
bad?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I think we've gotten better, I think part of it's mental,
part of it is physical we're not a great passing team, we haven't been all
year ask we're not a great ball handling team. We're playing A.T. at the
point. I think she is doing an admirable job, but she's not a true point
guard.  
So I think it's a bad combination to not have a true point guard on your team
who can run the show and calm your team down. You've got a physical, athletic
team that you're playing against. It's a tough combination for us, and I agree
with Gary his guard play has been exceptional and our guards have to do a
better job and we're bringing more guards in that can hopefully help us.  
  
Q. I guess everybody has talked about guard play and it's such a big thing
in the NCAA Tournament. You can't add personnel, so what are you guys going to
work on in terms of how you approach the NCAA Tournament with the problems
that you know that you have.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Right. I told my guard coaches, Gail and LaKale, I said
forget shooting drills I don't want you working on shooting drills every drill
we do now has to be about handling pressure, handling the ball and passing and
that's going to be our focus for the next week. We may not be able to shoot
ball but hopefully we will be able to take care of it, at least get a shot
off.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much and best of luck to you in the
tournament.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  59  
Baylor - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Sooners from Oklahoma, Coach Sherri Coale
and her two student athletes, Amanda Thompson and Danielle Robinson. First of
all, congratulations and your thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH COALE: I thought it was -- thank you, and I thought it was our kids'
will in the second half. Just a refusal to lose and a sense of uncanniness and
display of grit that they have displayed all year. Danielle Robinson was
special to play 45 minutes and carry us in scoring the way she did, help on
defense, I thought Joanna McFarland was a true freshman in her first Big 12
Tournament was really good, gave us key minutes. Then Nyeshia joined us for
the party a little later than I would have liked, but she did join and you say
she did a great job.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about penetrating all night and having to shoot
over and around Brittney Griner? She got 10 blocks but you were able to get
shots perform.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Even if she did block it, we were able to get out-of-bounds
and set something up underneath, she is a great player. The thing for me is I
had to shoot the jumper instead of taking it to the rim, figured it out late,
obviously, but better late than never.  
  
Q. Amanda can you talk about the Baylor match-ups, you guys have. They
always seem to be fantastic, and tomorrow night you have another match-up.
Talk about that as well.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: The match-ups are always interesting, of course they have
Brittney Griner, but I think we have to work on what way as a team we can help
each other out and we all stepped up to the plate and came out with a win,
tomorrow night is another match-up, bedlam series, baby, let's bring it.  
  
Q. Danielle, talk about Ny catching fire.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Ny told us over and over "I'm coming, I'm coming" and she
came at the right time. Even if she's not hitting if the first 35 minutes we
know she's going to knock 'em down that's just her mindset, she's going to
keep shooting.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about from your perspective, a game like this,
tight, back and forth, do you sort of enjoy, relish this type of night? You
look to be enjoying yourself.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: You have to. It's part of the game. Not every game is going
to be a 20-point victory, sometimes you have to grind it out, and it was about
toughness tonight, and we're so proud of our effort. We're just looking
forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Amanda, Nyeshia hit two big 3's that put you in good shape but she hit a
drive that Brittney Griner didn't block that got in. When you saw that ball go
in, is that when you thought, hey, this is one we've got tonight?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: It was a sigh of relief running back on the court, she
finally got a shot off. We had been going back and forth but we were fightin'
from behind and that drive to the basket definitely put us forward and I felt
like we had the advantage and I was just so proud of her.  
  
Q. Amanda can you talk about Abi on Brittney Griner, she won the battle of
the boards.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I felt like she battled all night, even though she was in
foul trouble she didn't back down to the height advantage. She blocked out
whenever she could and even if she got blocked on the offensive end she was
fighting to get the ball back, and it was a night of toughness and Abi brought
that toughness, and so did Joanna McFarland. I was proud of 'em.  
  
Q. Amanda, last we saw you guys you couldn't not hit a three, tonight you
guys are 2 of 10, talk about that and was it frustrating at all tonight?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Not really. Throughout the year we've -- our 3-pointers have
been going up and down, and when we're not making 3's we have to find another
part of the game that we can take advantage of. I felt like we did that by
driving to the basket and looking for D-Rob on the drives and the short jump
shots, and we can't rely on 3's, we have to rebound and play defense and just
work hard.  
  
Q. Danielle, you've had a lot of these battles with Andrea Riley and she put
up 43 tonight, talk about tomorrow. Such a show case for point guards.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah, I've battled her for three years now, and guarding
her is not an individual effort, definitely a team effort. I think last Sunday
we did a great job. She got her average 25 points and tonight she did what she
had to do to win. It's always going to be a battle, it's postseason. So it's
win or go home.  
  
Q. Talk about 10th turnovers tonight. Season low, I think.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: We'll let the point guard take care of that.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We checked in transition, but we didn't force anything.
That's something that we're going to have to carry for the next game tomorrow,
taking care of the basketball because teams convert on the other end and we
can't have that.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much, we're going to let you go back to
the locker room. Coach Coale will take some questions.  
  
Q. Sherri when Ny came off she was 0 for 4 from 3-point range, and you
stopped her and said something to her. Can you share what you said?  
COACH COALE: I don't remember, Lynn. I tried everything that I could think of
to get her immersed in the game so I'm not sure which of the 14 tactics I
attempted. That might have been -- I just knew that Ny could affect the game
not only because she can score, but she just is full of personality when she
imposes her personality on the game.  
We are better as a team when she does that and we are affected by that. Just
trying to find the button to push to get her going.  
  
Q. Talk about Joanna's development. I know it's going to be a fight down
there any night in the Big 12, but it looked especially tonight from the
physical end of things she was down there battling and playing hard.  
COACH COALE: She was and if you look at her body she is bruised up and cut up
and she's always fighting, whether it's an opposing player, game time or Abi
in practice, and she is a physical post player and she relishes those battles.
I thought she showed a lot of poise. We called her number and showed
confidence in her in the first half looking for a little pick and pop and a
pin on the baseline because she can shoot it, and I felt certain if she had
looked at the basket she might have made those two.  
She was in such a hurry, all panicked on the two attempts, but overall I
thought she was great, got some rebounds, blocked out even when she didn't get
the rebound, which is one reason that Abi had higher numbers than Brittney
Griner did, when Abi wasn't in the game she was taking Brittney Griner out of
picture, so somebody else could get the rebound.  
  
Q. Sherri, did Brittney Griner look the same as the other two times you
played her?  
COACH COALE: Looked exactly the same to me.  
  
Q. Sherri, did you have a concern, was it a conversation with your post
players about how tightly this game might be called?  
COACH COALE: No, we just -- we talked about championship behavior as we always
do and about trying not to put ourselves in a foul situation early which has
been a topic of conversation every time we've played Baylor. At their place we
struggled, we had two post players get two fouls within the first 3 minutes of
the game so it's a thing we always talk about when we get ready to play those
guys so nothing different.  
  
Q. What did you like most on Danielle's stat line?  
COACH COALE: 0 turnovers.  
  
Q. Talk about that.  
COACH COALE: I say that and how do we score enough points to win if we don't
have her scoring. I thought her decisions the with ball -- she did a nice job
of changing speed in transition, checking and rechecking and being sure about
what she did. I thought she was -- kept herself from being frustrated, which
could be really easy to get frustrated when you keep going to the rim, and she
is a clever finisher. She has all kinds of ways she can finish. She hit a
nifty scoop, and she shot a couple of those layups at 10 feet with an arcing
hook and still got blocked.  
She kept her head and to understand to play and hit a key jump shot late and
made everybody go "okay" and our team looks at Danielle, and when she is
looking good we think we can do anything.  
  
Q. Sherri, Brittney Griner hit one that was short and you guys got the
rebound and you went nuts on the sideline, you made a wind mill motion and all
kinds of stuff.  
COACH COALE: I did?  
  
Q. Yes, but do you remember what your emotions were and why that play got
you fired up?  
COACH COALE: I have no idea, I don't remember wind milling. I bet that was
attractive!  
  
Q. Your thoughts on only seven turnovers.  
COACH COALE: Again, I thought Jasmine -- Jasmine had 4 assists, 0 turnovers,
when your two guards can handle the basketball with 0 turn overs you're going
to have success and I think it's particularly important when you're not making
shots and the percentage was not all that good and you can't give away
possessions and, again it's all about speed, it's about playing at the right
pace whatever that pace is for you, and I thought both those guards were
fantastic.  
  
Q. Another bedlam game you guys were excited to get done with the regular
season, and it hasn't been a week since you played these guys, a little odd or
how do you approach tomorrow?  
COACH COALE: It's odd, but you expect that when you come to your Conference
Tournament, so our guys are excited. I think maybe not having the complexity
of the Iowa State film you wonder about those 432 sets they run, you know what
Oklahoma State is going to do, you know?  
Andrea Riley is going to score! That sounds simple and it's hard to keep her
from doing that, at least it's fresh in our minds and we'll go and try to get
prepared and do exactly what we did last weekend.  
  
Q. I know you've talked about this during the course of the season about how
good the point guards play in the Big 12, but this is a big showdown to see
Danielle and Andrea Riley, just talk about that match-up.  
COACH COALE: Well, Danielle's speed and quick wit make her exceptional, we
discussed that before. Danielle can also score and Danielle can also get her
teammates baskets, and she defends like crazy, and I think that's one of the
things that makes her a premiere point guard.  
There is not a phase of the game that she is not committed to being excellent
at and I think that sets her apart and puts her maybe, if not in a league of
her own a league that's not very crowded. I like the way she leads our
basketball team I like her swagger and the way she involves her teammates so
if I've got to defend Andrea Riley and head-to-head and defend her I'm glad I
get to do that with Danielle Robinson.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much, we'll see you tomorrow.

### [Deb Patterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14194)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Nebraska  63  
Kansas State - 46

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Deb Patterson and they are two students athletes,
Brittany Chambers and Ashley Sweat. Coach, your thoughts?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, I liked the first half. Obviously, in the second half
we just didn't establish any fire power on the offensive end of the floor. You
know what? The magnitude of any make by Nebraska in the second half is just
really intensified when we're not making conversions on the offensive end.  
So I think the second half was just a bit about our lack of effectiveness and
our scoring presence on the offensive end in the second half. Obviously,
Nebraska shot a great percentage over time but it seemed like any basket they
made was just so huge, because we were stringing together four and five
possessions without a make.  
So we struggled with that all season long, it's a game in which I thought that
separated us as much as anything in this contest, the board work was fairly
even when we're done. The turnover numbers again got to us. I think they
gained some extra possessions, you know, you hope you finish a game with 15
turn overs, and we had 12 at half and 23 in the end.  
So the 13 turnovers kinda handcuff you relative to your offense in the second
half as well so credit Nebraska's defensive abilities, and our lack of
conversion on the offensive end. I think that's what primarily changed the
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student athletes?  
  
Q. Ashley, y'all did a good job on Kelsey in the first half, 8 points, and
obviously she took over in the second half. Can you talk about the
difference?  
ASHLEY SWEAT: Kelsey Griffin is a great player, we all know that. I think in
the first half we did a great job of team defending her which is where we've
been strong this year, when we've played good defensive games we've had good
team defense and we defended their 3's so well in the first half and I think
that was a difference as well.  
Great players are going to have halves like that, but we've got to convert on
our end, too. Defense was an issue and our offense as well. Like Coach P said
stringing together possessions where we didn't get anything out of them we
can't have possessions like that if we want to have success in games.  
  
Q. Brittany, talk about just -- it seemed like in the first half you guys
were able to get in and make buckets, particularly from outside a little bit
and then in the second half it went away. Talk about the difference in the
offense between the two halves.  
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: I think in the second half when things weren't falling
early we kinda got into panic mode and we tried to get things right away and
myself and other people made dumb decisions ask we weren't staying within the
offense as much and I felt like we lost our heads and got out of the offense
and that killed us in the long stretch.  
  
Q. I wanted to follow up on what Brittany said there. We have seen
throughout this tournament with a lot of games and a lot of teams the offense
struggling, the shooting struggling. Do you think there's -- you mentioned
pressure, is that part of what's going on? Is there just something about the
setting that causes shots to be problematic? Is there great defense being
played? What's going on with that?  
BRITTANY CHAMBERS: I think it's a combination. Obviously, there are amazing
teams here and on top of that there is a pressure because everybody wants it
so bad. For us we really needed some more wins and it's kinda like a one and
done, so the pressure is on everyone because everyone does want it that bad.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to let y'all go back to the locker room.
Congratulations and good luck to you.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about Kari how is she?  
COACH PATTERSON: Hopefully we will get an x-ray, but I think it was sort of a
knee into a deep quad hit and it might be on a tendon there. But it really was
kinda spasm and I think a lot of pain for her at that point of impact, it
wasn't a cramp, it wasn't bone on bone but it was just right above that
kneecap.  
Obviously, Kari is an unbelievably tough kid. She look like America's
sweetheart, but she is unbelievably tough physically, so it's a very
significant -- when she comes off the floor it's significant. In my four years
I've seen her go through a lot of stuff at practice and in games, and that's
one of the few times I've seen her have to leave the floor in tears. I think
she'll be okay. But I think during the course of the competition it absolutely
limited her ability to feel like she could move without a great deal of pain.  
  
Q. You've gone against a Texas team that's gone to the Final Four, Oklahoma
that's gone to the Final Four and a Baylor team and won it all, can you gauge
how good this Nebraska team is? Is this a team that has Final Four
potential?  
COACH PATTERSON: I think the one thing that stands out to me at this point
against Nebraska is just their resilience over the forty minutes and the step-
up play in particular of Kelsey Griffin. I think they're an unbelievably solid
basketball team with great balance, but they're not nearly as athletically
explosive as those prior "Big 12 Final Four" teams. When I think about when
Purdue went to the Final Four, they weren't as athletic as the Purdue team
that got there, they might be as you alluded to earlier in the season a little
bit like the Minnesota team that got to the Final Four. And I think Minnesota
had an opportunity to advance because they had just the right match-ups and
they hosted early in the tournament. So I'm excited about the prospect of
Nebraska having an opportunity here in the Kansas City area. I think their
senior leadership is tremendous, their chemistry is good, and I like this
Nebraska basketball team, but I don't think winning by any stretch of the
imagination is easy for this team.  
It's interesting because they're 30-0, you know, so that just speaks to those
other elements of chemistry and just the phenomenal leader and the balance. I
think they're poised to make a great run if they get the appropriate match-
ups.  
  
Q. Coach, to come down here and to have Ashley struggle the way she did at
the offensive end of the floor, is that at the top of the list in terms of
difficult things to overcome?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, it certainly, you know, presented a great challenge to
us as a basketball team to overcome on the offensive end. You know, we have
not established over the course of this season, we were not able to establish
that we were one of the leagues best or most potent offensive teams.  
So when we were successful, by and large we found that we were seeing Ashley
at 24 to 31 points, you know, and that's a heavy load for any one player to
carry. So we had an additional challenge, I think, in that vein, as we
competed through this tournament. We addressed it and answered it, I think,
well yesterday.  
I would like to think we could have been better at that today if we had taken
care of the ball, you know? That was a struggle for us. Those turnovers that
lead to extra possessions for a team like Nebraska really just, man, they just
crush you.  
So even when we weren't great offensively, I think if we took care of the ball
we had a shot to be 7, 8-point differential against the best teams in our
league. So, yes, it added an extra challenge, we didn't answer that challenge
today, and by and large I think that was our greatest struggle this year.  
Kansas State over the next two or three years needs to find quality offensive
production, I think, to compete well because I like us defensively, and I like
the toughness and how hard we play. I felt like our young players probably got
overwhelmed emotionally for segments of the second half and maybe we didn't
play with the same spark that we're capable of defensively at times but 63
points to Nebraska I could live with. The turnovers, I think, made it a tough
game for us.  
  
Q. Coach, was depth a problem today considering your short bench and is that
something your staff looks at into next year?  
COACH PATTERSON: Oh, yeah, depth really all season long has been an issue from
the moment -- as we went into the season we were going in Kelsey Hill looking
at her being our point guard and we lost her to the ACL, and Alina didn't have
a lot of minutes, but I thought she could come in and give us quality minutes
and production in one way or another and sort of the tipping point was losing
Shalin because late in the season we had begun to use Shalin as a 3 and a 4.  
So when we needed someone to come in and bring that versatility, shooting a 3,
posting up and defending the post we had her playing the 4 spot when we had
Ashley on the bench. Obviously, depth was a really big factor today especially
once Kari got a little nicked up, and at that point I think the game had run
away from us a bit, but very big and certainly you never like to think in
terms of three catastrophic injuries, but it happens, and it did. Even with
that to get to the second round of this tournament, I was really proud of our
basketball team.  
We've signed for four, we lose two and as we look ahead on the positive side,
I think we're involved with some really tremendous prospects. At the same time
our medical red shirts will change everything for us as we move forward. So
everything has changed a lot over the course of this year with these injuries.  
  
Q. One more comment about Kelsey, you mentioned her as a step-up player. Is
there anything in her game in particular that has impressed you this season
maybe compared to others?  
COACH PATTERSON: I've always been just a huge fan of hers, even prior to the
mono and all that other stuff. The thing that just -- I love about her is, you
know, she has an unbelievable feel for the game, just an intrinsic
understanding, an intrinsic fight, toughness, leadership presence out there.
I've always said to my team anyway that she reminds me of Shaylee Lenning in
the post, you know, and I've said that I don't know that I'll ever coach a
player like that again.  
And I don't know about Coach Connie Yori, but players like Kelsey Griffin are
just special, are just good, you know, she has always been strong, she can hit
the 15-footer two years ago. She can hit it now. She's got a great drive, but
it's the maturitity that she competes with the and the confidence and she's
made the game easier for everyone around her. And it's almost like she's, you
know, usually point guards do that, it's rare when you see a post player able
to do that consistently and she does that. I just really love her game.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much, we appreciate it. Good luck.

### [Tegan Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20634)

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  62  
Iowa State - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Kurt Budke has joined us on the stage. Coach,
congratulations, your thoughts tonight?  
COACH BUDKE: Very excited about tonight's win. I thought it was a great
women's college basketball game. I thought you saw two teams really going at
each other and each finding different little runs in the game. I don't know
how many times the lead changed in the game but there was no quit in either
team. Just proud of our girls.  
We're the only team so far today to win that played yesterday, and that does
have a little affect on you. But I thought we played probably the best defense
we've played in a month today, and I thought they really did a good job of
readin' sets and being where they were supposed to be.  
We're excited about it, glad to be back in the semi finals.  
THE MODERATOR: Student athlete questions, please. Andrea, can you talk about
the night you had, you started off red hot and then it came down the stretch.  
ANDREA RILEY: In the game of basketball, it's always up and down and sometimes
you're not going to stay hot. So I had to listen to my coaches and my
teammates who continued to be in my ear, and I'm glad and appreciate how many
they support me and have so much confidence in me and they really made me push
in the end.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that play at half-court, Andrea, where you and the
Iowa State girl went up like receivers going at it on a football field?  
ANDREA RILEY: I was just looking at the ball and I was just trying to jump for
the ball, that's all I really seen.  
  
Q. Andrea, you guys changed the offense a little bit, instead of screening
at the top of the key, it was more to the left, looked like maybe you had more
room to shoot your jump shots coming off that screen.  
ANDREA RILEY: Playing Iowa State they pack the lane and make you hit shots,
and they have a good defensive plan so you have to outsmart them. So when we
went to the corner chase it gave us room and them not coming off of Tegan and
Lakyn, it really opened it up in the middle of the floor.  
  
Q. Andrea, do you always know it's coming back when you get cold for a
while? Did you sense it's going to fall again?  
ANDREA RILEY: Yes, you have to stay positive. I know I'm going to miss 15 in a
row, it happens, but listen to my coaches and teammates and staying positive
and believing and they'll go in.  
  
Q. Andrea, can you talk about the play in the final minute when you drive to
the hole and you face the 6-6 girl from Iowa State?  
ANDREA RILEY: I faced a couple this year with Bridgette Griner, Michigan
State, Koke. I've faced a couple of them this year, and I'm not scared to go
in there (chuckles.) I've played against guys that are bigger and thicker when
I was growing up, so I think I'm big sometimes.  
  
Q. Andrea, the importance of winning tonight, Coach talked about the
advancement you guys could make seatingwise for the NCAA Tournament, talk
about that and Tegan. If you would talk about what wing tonight might mean for
the NCAA turn support.  
ANDREA RILEY: We knew we hit a bump at OU when we didn't play up to our
potential, so we wanted to redeem ourselves and try to make a run in the Big
12 Tournament, because when you come here all the teams are tied for first,
everybody plays hard. It's a different team that comes out of these and I
think advancing in the tournament does help your seating in the NCAA because
it shows them that you guys do play hard and you're not going away.  
COACH BUDKE: There was a second part, Tegan.  
ANDREA RILEY: She answered it all.  
COACH BUDKE: Ms. Australia doesn't talk much.  
  
Q. Tegan, talk about playing against a team that sets a lot of picks and
screens and the job you guys did tonight.  
TEGAN CUNNINGHAM: Coming into the game, we knew they were good shooters. We
attacked them when they shot the ball and we knew who wasn't going to shoot it
and we gave help to the good players, and we had a better game plan than I
think the last time and we executed on that.  
  
Q. Andrea you took 44 shots, the NCAA record is 47. Do you feel in any way
guilty when you take that many shots or do you know when you take that many
shots it gives your team the best chance to win.  
ANDREA RILEY: I never think about how many times I shoot, but Coach Kurt Budke
told me if they're going to give you that shot I don't care if you take 50
shots and I got close! (Chuckles.)  
COACH BUDKE: That's true. That's what I told her.  
ANDREA RILEY: My teammates don't care how many shots I take, it's making them
that helps the team.  
  
Q. When you have a teammate like Andrea Riley and she's shucking up shots,
do you feel good with that? How is she as a teammate?  
TEGAN CUNNINGHAM: We have faith in her that she's going to make it, so if
they're going to give her that shot every time we'll take it every time
because her percentage is good and we're confident in her as a team that
she'll make it every time.  
  
Q. Andrea, you guys -- your team is going to play without you in the first
round of the NCAA Tournament. Do you take some of this on your shoulders to
say I want to get my team as high as I can to get them in the best position
they can be without you?  
ANDREA RILEY: That's always been the main focus, to get me to play in the
second round. I've got a lot of confidence in my teammates, and plus I want a
Big 12 Championship so that always clicks in my mind.  
  
Q. Tegan, can you talk about the last two or three possessions, you guys
fouled intentionally the next to last time and then right before Iowa State
inbounded the ball. Coach Budke called you guys over and you didn't foul that
time. Can you talk about the defensive philosophy to fall one time and not the
other?  
TEGAN CUNNINGHAM: Obviously, they're a great 3-point shooting team so we
didn't want them to get a shot off so we would rather waste time in the
frontcourt and come down and foul and we would rather have them hit 2 points
rather than 3. That was their mentality. Did we let them --  
ANDREA RILEY: We tried to foul but they did a hand-off and then -- I tried.  
COACH BUDKE: We were going to foul again. We kind of whiffed on it.  
TEGAN CUNNINGHAM: We can blame Dred on that one.  
ANDREA RILEY: Okay.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, we'll let you go. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. What about the seating aspect of things and do you get the sense she
takes this on her shoulders to make sure you guys are in the best shape
without her?  
COACH BUDKE: I don't know if she looks at if that way, she knows we need to
get -- I don't think she feels guilty about it or anything like that, I think
it's just we know we need to get as high of a seed as we can get and I told
them that I think there is no question getting to the semifinals in this
tournament will move us -- whatever spot we're at it will move us a spot and
she said it right there at the end she wants to win a Big 12 Championship.  
  
Q. Coach, these past two games you have -- past two you've played against
Iowa State, Alison Lacey has not been playing. Did the fact that Alison Lacey
not playing tonight, did that have any impact on how many shots you were
looking for Andrea Riley to take tonight?  
COACH BUDKE: No, that really didn't have any -- the reason she took the shots
is just how Iowa State chose to guard us tonight and it almost worked, it
really did. Bill is one of the best coaches in this country and he took a
different kind of a different way of doing it tonight and like I said it
almost worked.  
Lacey not being there didn't change anything, we've got a game plan still in
our drawer for her that we prepared a long time for and haven't used it yet. I
just hope she gets back in time for the tournament because they've got a
wonderful team without her but with her I think they could be really good.  
  
Q. Kurt, do you have the sense that your life will be less interesting when
Andrea Riley isn't on your team anymore?  
COACH BUDKE: You know, I don't know. She's special. She's a special kid. We've
had a lot of good times together and it's been really fun watching her grow as
a person as well as a player. You know we've got some good young ones coming
in and we're not looking forward to it but it's like OU losing Courtney, you
move on. We've got some good, young kids comin' in, some good kids in the
program and we'll see if they can make my life interesting.  
  
Q. Kurt talk about the defense that Lakyn played on Bolte tonight. I can't
remember the first game if she was on her the whole game but she didn't have
any more than 7 points up until the last 5 minutes.  
COACH BUDKE: I thought lay kin did a wonderful job, Bolte is a good shooter,
she don't need much room to get the shot off ask we knew for us to have a
chance to win we had to limit her open looks and make her work hard to get
those open looks and I thought Lakyn did a great job of hustling all night
long. I thought that was one of the keys to the game and the helpers when she
did come free did a better job of helping out to cover up.  
  
Q. Kurt, you got 15 offensive rebounds. A lot of those are in the first half
and it didn't do you any good because you missed again, but late in the game
you got the lead for good you ran a play for Andrea Riley, she drove in and
she missed but young was there and put it back. Can you talk about that play
and young's progress? She had 10 rebounds tonight.  
COACH BUDKE: Toni is coming on for us and she's going to be fun to watch. She
is one of those young once we're talking about for future years here. That set
we ran we changed the angle a little bit, we got the shot we wanted, I thought
the beginning was going to hit that one.  
But as they helped on Tegan it cleaned it up for Toni to get a put-back there.
I think executing out of time outs we did one of our better Johns of the year
listening and doing what I wanted them to do. I was proud of them tonight.  
  
Q. Kurt, I saw you talking to Andrea before the second half started, what
were you talking to her about?  
COACH BUDKE: I just told her that I believe in her and I have believed in her
for four years; and what she said, I said if you shoot 50 shots tonight and we
lose that's okay but I bet ya we win if you do. I said just relax, shoot your
shot and we've won a got of games with that young lady doing just that. It was
just a thing of hey, you know what, there are two halves to this game, go
relax and go out and play.  
  
Q. Kurt, she set a slough of records, but with her it's almost another day
at the office.  
COACH BUDKE: Isn't that something? I guess she broke her own record tonight,
didn't she?  
  
Q. Right.  
COACH BUDKE: Again, I said it last night, there is nobody more valuable to
their team than what she's done in the last four years for resurrecting this
program. She is -- I know we have a deserving M.V.P. in this league, but there
is no way in the world I would vote for anybody else but her. She has been --
if y'all think about all the game plans that have been put together for her,
all the box and chasers she's faced and triangles and two's she's faced.  
Every time she comes off a pick she gets hit and every time she is guarding
someone she gets picked and that is a tough kid to go through what she's gone
there in four years with not -- we've had some good teams. Obviously, the
Sweet 16 team was a very good team, but she's been the main character here for
four years and she doesn't get enough credit for that sometimes.  
  
Q. Kurt, how nice is it to have Andrea only gets to the line 8 times
tonight, a lot of that late, your best free-throw shooter, ice in her veins,
it's hard to deny her the ball when it counts down in the final stretch.  
COACH BUDKE: That is a great luxury to have of someone that -- we talked about
it last night her shootin' percentage goes up in the last 3 minutes and so
does her free-throw percentage. She's going to find the way to get the
basketball. The kid is just -- she's tough and she wants the ball and she
kinda looks at the end of the game like some kind of school yard game almost,
it's like tag, can you catch me? That's how it's been for four years and it's
fun to have that kind of player out there.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow.

Oklahoma State  62  
Iowa State - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the Iowa State Cyclones, Coach Bill Fennelly,
his two student athletes, Kelsey Bolte and Anna Prins. Coach?  
COACH FENNELLY: First of all, I want to thank the people of Kansas City and
the Big 12 Conference for an amazing event. It's the best Conference
Tournament in the country the way they run it and we were honored to be a part
of it. Certainly want to congratulate Oklahoma State. The biggest difference
was -- obviously, Andrea Riley scored a ton of points.  
But they made a few more hustle plays, defensively I was fine with the way we
played. Offensively we weren't very good, turnovers, and missed shots,
couldn't do the things we need to do. Hopefully we'll have another chance to
play and a little more commitment to doing the things we need to do to have a
chance to win.  
  
Q. What was it like trying to defend, trying to find Andrea Riley? Could you
have done anything differently defensively?  
KELSEY BOLTE: Neither of us really defended her. I think the biggest thing was
attention to detail and trying to get her as much as we could and just trying
to get the offensive rebounds.  
THE MODERATOR: Anna, you want to comment?  
ANNA PRINS: I agree with Kelsey. We knew she was going to get her points
tonight. The big key was defensive rebounding. Post players didn't get it done
tonight. But she's a good player.  
  
Q. Kelsey, I know you didn't guard Andrea, but when she puts up 44 shots she
always tries to get the ball what do you have to when you're not guarding her,
talk about that.  
KELSEY BOLTE: Definitely she is known for taking a lot of shots and you have
to be aware of where she's at on the floor because when she shoots is you have
to make sure your person isn't running down the lane and getting the rebound
so you have to know where she is all the time and when she's going to shoot
it.  
  
Q. Kelsey, could you talk about what you thought of the team's ability to
come back, you guys were down by as much as 15 in the first half and you were
able to take the lead at one point in time. Can you talk about what you
thought of the team's offensive play?  
KELSEY BOLTE: Kind of like Coach Fennelly said, often we were making bad
decisions. I think I was being face guarded the whole game, so I wasn't able
to do very much. I think we just need to do a better job next time.  
  
Q. Kelsey, what made it so hard to get some of those shots off and you being
face guarded the whole team.  
KELSEY BOLTE: It's hard, somebody standing in front of you all the time, it
was even tough to set screens because they were in between you and the ball
the whole time so you had to make movement every time to set a screen or even
try and get open.  
  
Q. Anna, why were you guys able to come back after being down so far in the
first half?  
ANNA PRINS: I think -- well, we started making shots and then digging deep on
defense, getting the rebound, having that not going to lose mentality at that
point and things seemed to start going our way.  
  
Q. What is it like to have Alison out on the court and were you struggling
without her, do you think?  
KELSEY BOLTE: She is very, very missed, but, you know, there definitely is a
difference when she is not out there. She is the game changer and you know,
she led very well from the bench tonight.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what she did from the bench. Talk about her role
tonight.  
KELSEY BOLTE: The girls were used to bringing up the ball and with her on the
side lines giving an extra voice for her yelling out the plays. It was
extremely helpful.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, thank you very much. Congratulations. Questions
for Coach Fennelly?  
  
Q. What was your view when Riley stuck in long and the half-court pass?  
COACH FENNELLY: We were trying to face guard, obviously, and trying to the
first two times we denied pretty well, got a time-out, made a good effort.
Kelsey's foot was out of bounds on the one and the last one we said they were
probably going to throw deep and it's a ball in the air and there is contact
and they make a call. So I guess that's what I saw, I don't know.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH FENNELLY: The three people officiating the game make that decision.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk a little bit about the defensive game plan that you
had against Andrea Riley. I know Coach Budke said that you guys were allowing
her to get so many shots and such, could you talk about the defensive play
that you had against her?  
COACH FENNELLY: The game plan was to make her a volume shooter, not foul her,
make her go to the right, lay back in the lane and make her drive at you, not
kick it to the weak side wing. She is so dynamic with the ball when you're
hedging and running all over the building and we wanted to try and make her
hit some tough shots and she took 44 shots, and I take 100% responsibility for
the game plan, and you can write anything you want about how stupid it is,
that's fine with me, I don't really care.  
That's the only chance we had to win the game, our problem was not our
defense, it was our offense. You can't shoot it the way we shot it and turn
the ball over the way we did and have a chance to win. We held Oklahoma State
to 62 points. I don't care who scores. We didn't want her to come left off the
dribble bounce and she hit two that way and we fouled her a couple times.  
There is no way you're going to stop her from scoring. That was the plan, and
I thought Denae did a great job of trying to guard it, Denae did a great job.
She drove down the lane a couple times ask we didn't step in and have the
courage to take a charging foul when we need it, but she's a great player and
certainly someone that has had a great career and certainly someone that all
of us will be glad to graduate.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned offensively, was that a product of something they
were doing or was it -- did that have to do with Lacey want not being on the
floor?  
COACH FENNELLY: I'm not -- Lacey not being on the floor impacts our team,
she's one of the best point guards in the country. So obviously that impacts
our team. But that's not an excuse. We knew -- we practiced they were going to
face guard Kelsey Bolte, which they did. And we missed I don't know how many
lay-ups in the first half. You can't go 8 for 23 in the post and turn the ball
over 18 times. You have to score the ball, they came out hot to start the game
to their credit, made some shots and we had some -- I thought open lay-ups
that we didn't convert. We missed some three's, Whit and Kelsey didn't hit
some shots.  
Offensively you've got to find a way to score, and when the other guy is hot
you've got to score once in a while to stay in the game and we got down 15
because they were making everything and we weren't making anything and we got
down 15 points.  
  
Q. Bill, what does this do for seeding in the tournament?  
COACH FENNELLY: I don't know, I hope the committee looks at a team that
competed and took a team to the wire without their best player, a lot of it
will have to do with what happens in the tournament. All of the smart people
handle that, I just -- my goal from the start of the year was to was to try
and put our team -- help our team be in a position to finish the season in the
NCAA Tournament.  
It's in our building, and I hope that's going to happen. I think we deserve to
be there, that's not my choice. But I just wanted to finish this the right way
and hopefully we finished the season the right way.  
  
Q. When was it clear Alison Lacey wasn't going to play, did y'all make the
decision or --  
COACH FENNELLY: No, that was a decision made by the team doctor, and I was
never told at anytime that she could play and that was never really in our
plans, but at least she practiced. She was running around and hopefully with
another 7 or 8 days she'll be ready to go and end her career at Hilton
Coliseum, which would be kind of cool.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for your time. Good luck to ya.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas A&M  77  
Texas - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Coach Gary Blair, Sydney Colson, Danielle
Adams and Tanisha Smith.  
COACH BLAIR: I've got 2 minutes to tell you what happened in forty minutes,
but I'll try my best. We have outstanding guards. We have outstanding guards
and you win with guards, they make great decisions the whole night. Again the
turn over battles, 26-14 was the huge key.  
We were just trying to stay even, trying to stay even with them on the boards,
and we did a pretty good job. Their bigs did not hurt us as much as they
could, because Cokie Reed is a monster in there, and Ashley Gayle is a great
defensive player.  
I thought we made good decisions. We picked the right times to run set plays.
We struggled in the first half with our zone offense, and we didn't have
transition game in the first. We thought we were going to be in problems, but
I thought we did well against their press and made about one forced turnover
and other than that we handled the ball well. These Kansas City kids, five 7
points between the three of them. It's special to be able to bring them back
home and they're the most unselfish kids you've ever seen in your life. They
will pass the ball, they will defend, when you look at Tanisha's line with 5
steals, most of them in the first half, big steals, and her assists, and
Sydney Colson came in off the bench, gave us the spark that we had to have
because we were standing around the perimeter against their zone, and I wanted
to push the ball and I wanted her to create offense off of the dribble which
she did.  
Other than that, we just -- we're not on a mission, we're just takin' this
thing one game at a time, that's all we can do. I just like my basketball
team. Questions?  
  
Q. Danielle and Tanisha is that, will you guys talk about your excitement
playing here today and maybe how many you had here supporting and you what it
felt lying to play in this gym today?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: I was excited to play in the hometown, as well as playing
against the Texas Longhorns, it's a rivalry game so I was excited. I couldn't
tell you how many people I had here. Probably over -- over 20. So I was
excited.  
TANISHA SMITH: Well, it was exciting playing here. I haven't played here in
years. At the same time, we're here in Kansas City but we're representing the
team on the front of our Jersey. So it doesn't matter if we were in Oklahoma.
We still had to execute and do what we did today. Everything was still the
same, and I probably had over 100 people in the stands.  
  
Q. Danielle and Tanisha, I think last weekend you played KU, the Kansas City
connection, I think, actually outscored KU in terms of total points. As Coach
Blair mentioned, you have 57 points among the three of you. What is it about
playing around this area that's brought that out in you, the ability to
score.  
TANISHA SMITH: It's just the area, me and Danielle played on the same team and
Tyra played on our rival team, so it was a team effort.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: It was a home game to us, a lot of support, just another home
game back in college station bought in Kansas City.  
  
Q. A team that's athletic like you guys and you struggled against them a
little bit, that's basically the only game you played against them, what's
going to be the key. I want to address that all three of you.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: When we went out there to Nebraska we were in there the whole
game, it was the first three shots that killed us, they shot three 3's, we're
down 9-0 and the rest of the game, every time we locked up at the clock we're
down 9, if only we could have gotten the three 3's at the beginning, we know
who their shooters are, we're going to handle the press, be strong with the
ball, take smart shots and play em down to the end.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: Basically what she's saying is we need to execute our game
plan.  
  
Q. Had you played here before, on the court? Have you tried to tell the guys
about Kansas City? It's a little different place than College Station.  
DANIELLE ADAMS: The only people that haven't been here are the freshmen, they
played here at a Big 12 tournament a couple years back, that they won, but at
the same time I played here in this arena, I have played basically every gym
here except the one that just got built which is the Sprint Center which is
another game to me.  
I've never played here, I've been to many games this is my first time, but I
came to the Big 12 tournament when they won, so this is the first time I've
played here.  
  
Q. Sydney, given the way this series with Texas has gone the last two or
three years do you think you're in their heads a little bit?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think, so the way they feel about playing us is kinda like we
feel about Baylor right now we haven't been able to get a win against them,
and I think it can be really frustrating when you go back and try to play a
team and watch film and practice and prepare for the things they're going to
throw at you since you probably know, and when you go out there it's still
tough toe execute your offence.  
It can get in your head and we don't expect to go out there and beat anybody,
we go out there and play hard every game, they had us tied maybe 1 or 2 at one
point and we knew it was going to be a battle, and we had to pull it out and
try to get this win.  
  
Q. Sydney talk about your energy off the bench, what you were able to do in
the point-guard position and only 3 turnovers.  
SYDNEY COLSON: It's cool for us to score every now and then but we like to set
up our teammates and anytime we can do that we're happy. We love to see the
wings thrive and our post do well in the lane and I think we look to -- which
they started pressing us we tried to get the ball to the point guard and have
us attack the middle of it and try to get it up the court and tried to milk
the clock and bring the time down, and every time I come in I tried to be the
spark off the bench and Syd does the same and that's the mind-set.  
  
Q. Tanisha is that, it was 40-38 Texas and you guys went on a 13-0 run and
you and Tyra got a lot of the points, what were you doing against that zone?  
DANIELLE ADAMS: We tightened up our defense. We had a couple of steals and
looked up in transition and that's basically where our points came from,
transition, knowing where each other was going to be. Tyra is a good shooter
and just finding her, that's it.  
  
Q. Sydney you've had to deal with the stress reaction and limited you a
little bit but you and the other Sydney, you've got such a good relationship
as far as whoever is on the court. There doesn't seem to be much difference
which Sydney it is. How much have you guys worked together on that so there
isn't a drop-off or change no matter who is out there?  
SYDNEY COLSON: I think it's a good thing for our team to have two point guards
to come in and give the energy, whenever Syd used to come off the bench, I
think the thing that helps us the most is we're happy to see each other do
well off the court, and whenever she would come in and I was starting this
year, she would come in and watch to see what I was doing that wasn't working,
and she would come in and she is an excellent defender and a great shooter.  
She would come in and give us instant offense and instant defense and I think
it's fabulous that there is no drop-off and even going to our third-string
point guard, whatever Adrienne gets in, she does the same and it's great to
have that many people on the team who can think on the go, and I think that's
what has helped us be successful so far.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you for your answers, congratulations. We'll see
you tomorrow. Questions for the coach?  
  
Q. You were real gracious when you left Lincoln last month, and I believe
wished Nebraska, an unbeaten season --  
COACH BLAIR: Unbeaten season in Conference play. I said I was hoping we would
get one more chance at 'em.  
  
Q. Can you talk about having that chance?  
COACH BLAIR: Right now it's good for the league. What's going on right now is
Nebraska is the story line and it's good for women's basketball, besides
having just all the Connecticut flavor out there or having the Andrea Riley
stuff or the Brittney Griner stuff, Nebraska is your story line. It is good
for the rest of us. We're staying under the radar, and for once in a my life I
like it.  
I want to stay under the radar, slip in and we're going to see an entertaining
ball game tomorrow because both teams are going to be pressing a lot and it's
going to be a transition game, and Nebraska has a Cinderella season.  
But I believe it would help Nebraska if they would lose one in the Conference
Tournament to take that monkey off their back and then they would be fine, let
them win the National Championship, let me just win this little thing right
here.  
  
Q. Gary, when did you sense it was going to be a big night for the three
Kansas girls?  
COACH BLAIR: When we recruited them. All of 'em are different, different as
night and day and it was very special. Maybe when we ate at Gates BBQ the
other tight, Kansas City has been good to us and I got a verbal commitment
from a granddaughter who is one month old right there she committed to play
for me so I got a commitment and she is adorable.  
  
Q. Texas had 22 or more turnovers all three games against y'all. Do you feel
like their guards panic, and is that a bad sign for them in the NCAA
tournament?  
COACH BLAIR: There is not a lot of people that front the post like we do and
sometimes you're trying -- you're not readin' the help and sometimes the help
is not the girl that's frontin' is not stealing the ball. Our defense is
predicated on ball pressure where you cannot just make that easy lob in, there
is ball pressure and you have to throw more of an umbrella pass.  
I've got the best defensive coordinator in Coach Schaefer, he's outstanding
and I hope some of the A.D.'s around the world will quit recycling, and
realize I've got the best defensive coach in the business right now. Ashley
played a tremendous ball game and she is one of the success stories that
doesn't have McDonald's All-American by her name. She's a kid that Gail and
her staff has made better, very under rated, should have been All Big 12.  
  
Q. Coach you mentioned about the defensive pressure that your team and
particularly your guards can kinda bring. We know about your kids, couple of
kids that can dominate but of course Nebraska has Griffin. What is going to be
necessary to deal with Kelsey as far as controlling her and Yvonne and the
other kids?  
COACH BLAIR: Kansas State was doing a good job having five different people
bring the ball down the court. Turner couldn't guard everybody because she
could. Turner is special, and I like my Carter kid, too, but Turner is
special. You've got to make 'em work and take advantage when they go to their
bench and you've got to be able to score some points when they go to their
bench.  
Griffin could play forty minutes if she wants to, but they've played a nine-
player rotation all season and I don't think they're going to change. Keep
them from scoring the easy baskets, keep Griffin from having "and one's" and
hope like heck the others do not beat you.  
But Kelly played very well today, too. Their guards and my guards, we're going
to have a great match-up and it's going to depend on how many touches Griffin
gets. We've got to limit her touches.  
  
Q. Gary why such a tough match-up are you for Texas now, 10 out of 11, 8
straight, more than one recruiting class, why such a tough match-up?  
COACH BLAIR: Y'all have grown up with this rivalry, you know what it is, a lot
of these out-of-towners don't, it's like Kansas and Kansas State or Kansas and
Missouri, when this thing first started they were more of a rival to us than
we were to them because Baylor and Oklahoma were dominating the conference and
they were trying to catch them.  
All of the sudden we get up, it's just -- our kids have grown up wanting to
play State in Austin, that means a lot, a lot of our kids didn't get to the
state tournament, we play on the same AAU teams, we recruit the same type of
players, she recruits the same type of players that I want at A&M, and
hopefully she wants my type of players.  
We love the challenge and right now I think it's starting to be a pretty good
rivalry. I think they know we're here now, and we're not going to go away.
They're not going away and right now I have a few more guards and my guards
are making very, very good decisions.  
I'm going to keep recruiting 13 or 14 players and those kids that are waitin'
right now, those freshmen they're going to be pretty good, but right now there
is no time for them to play. I'm going to rotate my bench and you're going to
see nine or ten kids in there tomorrow, and Texas will do well in the NCAA
Tournament. Because I promise you whoever they see or any of our seven teams
see in the first two rounds it going to be a whole lot easier than what
they've just faced here in the Big 12.  
The first and second round is not going to compare because this is what it's
all about here. This is why the national media is here this is why the WNBA is
here. This is good basketball. Good basketball and well coached. The best
assistant coaches in America are in this league. Forget all us head coaches.
I'm about to finish because he's kickin' my leg over here. Thank y'all.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck, we'll see ya tomorrow.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas State  59  
Texas Tech - 51

  
COACH PATTERSON: That brought competitive play today from our freshman Taelor
Karr, I thought that was big, great leadership and a presence today out there
from Kari Kincaid and possessions on both ends where we needed these two to
step up and make plays for their basketball team they did.  
We're extremely proud and happy for the victory. Again, I think in a league
where easily eight or nine teams out of our league could compete in the NCAA
Tournament and give any basketball team across the country a great game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, we'll take our student athlete questions first.  
  
Q. A couple of questions for Taelor, you look at the box score you only made
7 out of 24 3's, but could you talk about Taelor and those guys knocking down
3's? They never recovered from that, did they?  
TAELOR KARR: It's always nice to come out and get the game check check check
or me making two and it was nice to get the ball around and give people shots
that they like and rhythm and that set is a good tone for us for the rest was
the game.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KARI KINCAID: Yeah, I was glad we were hitting right off the bat and it gave
me confidence to keep hitting throughout the game and our shots were falling.  
  
Q. Kari, you guys led the whole game, talk about the runs they made at you
and how you guys think you held up.  
KARI KINCAID: Well we've been a team of two halves this year, and we came out
and played really well in the first half and we've grown and learned this year
that you can't get too excited about a first half because you've got another
half to play.  
We came out that second half and we had the lead the whole second half, but I
remember look up and they had cut it to 2 and I think we all just said "enough
is enough" we're not going to let them take our lead from us. I wish we would
have gotten this a couple of months ago, but I think we stepped up and fought
for what he wanted. We won a basketball game and that's what it takes to win.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KARI KINCAID: It might be today, but we stood up for ourselves and said we've
come too far in this game, worked our tails off and a 2-point lead is not
enough and we came in, Taelor made a huge three, Ashley had that "and 1" and
it felt good to get over the hump and say "Oh, no you don't" and I think we
did that tonight.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
TAELOR KARR: Honestly I let the posts do a lot of work they block everybody
out, and they leave it open for me to run in there and grab the ball so I give
credit to them and it was bouncing my way so luckily it happened that way and
it always helps when you get extra possessions and that series we had three or
four shots up, and we finally made one so that always breaks the other team's
back.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
TAELOR KARR: It's going to be a good game. We've played them well the last two
times we've matched up with them, and Kelsey is say great player and we need
to go out and play hard like we did and see what happens.  
KARI KINCAID: Before the game Coach P was saying "we're fighting for our life
here to win the game" and we got another chance. It's going to be the same
thing tomorrow. We're fighting for our basketball life, well my basketball
life for sure. We're going to bring a lot of emotion. No one in the world
thinks we can win except for us, you know, we believe in ourselves and, you
know, we would shock the world if we beat undefeated Nebraska.  
But we're going to go in believing in ourselves and just really try and shock
them -- they're such a great team. We're going to have to play our absolute
best to be in the game with such a high-caliber team they're just great. So
we're excited that we get another chance to play. I'm fightin' for my
basketball life and so is Ashley, so we're going to bring that emotion.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KARI KINCAID: Right. You know, Ashley, out of all people she puts so much on
her shoulders especially with scoring and I know she was really frustrated
throughout the game, you know, when she couldn't get her shots to go in, but
before her "and 1" she had a block and a rebound, too. Those things changed
the game. She probably wouldn't give any credit to herself but those are just
as good as getting 5 points. Any amount of points, making plays like that.
Those were critical plays she made at the end. We always say that's when it
counts. We got a win without her scoring so that's good for us.  
THE MODERATOR: First question for Coach Patterson?  
  
Q. When Texas Tech made a run to cut it to 2 is that the attitude you've
been looking for?  
COACH PATTERSON: Absolutely. We just kept workin' at it, you know? And
everybody understands that that's the way we want to think and compete and
today we were able to follow that up with some big plays. I think what was
really significant was that the point that Kari just made when Ashley wasn't
necessarily scoring, which has happened in some contests. We just really
committed and understood the nature of team and the responsibility we all
have, you know, to compete for one another. You can have a great player on the
floor with you, but to rely on them and to stand back doesn't necessarily get
you wins. You all have your opportunity to impact winning or to impact
competing hard, and I think our team really was committed to that today. I do
believe they've been committed to it throughout the course of conference play.
We just haven't necessarily seen all the dots connect. You know, there's been
minutes in a game where maybe we doubted ourselves or our experience or
maturity bumped us a little bit.  
Today I think we played through mistakes and we played through poor plays that
in other situations might have gotten us down, so as a team I think, you know,
our young people had a grit at this mentality today and that was the
difference.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about second half of the Colorado game, first half of
Nebraska, is this as close as you've seen recently of forty minutes of
complete basketball?  
COACH PATTERSON: Well it's the first time in a long time that we've competed
that hard through the bumps. Through the peaks and the valley of a game and
found a way to get a big, big win, like a season-extending win, obviously.  
I think we played better basketball this year than maybe we played during this
game, but I don't know that we competed with any better mentality over the
course of forty minutes than we did today, even though maybe we played better
basketball for segments earlier this evening than a week or two weeks ago.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, you know, these young people are -- they're just great
young people. They're tough, you know, they're competitive, they love and care
about each other, they want to do well, you know, they walk in every day and
they want to be good and they want to commit to one another. So whether you
have 7 or 12, you know, if you've got that, it gives you a chance, you know,
and obviously individually they have to step up and make plays.  
Again, you just have to credit their focus and their ability to not be
distracted by things that other people might think are good and you've got to
believe in you and they've worked hard to do that. Even though they haven't
been great on any given night they understand that the greater message is you
are and that's why you're here and let's keep slugin' away at it.  
  
Q. Kari talked about this but with Ashley, coming in if we told you Ashley
was only going to have 5 points our offense focuses on her, would you say that
your team had a chance if she was going to finish with 5?  
COACH PATTERSON: I would have thought we had a slim chance, although, you
know, again, we've seen some games where it's been a tough go for her, and,
you know, that's just part of your team growing I think, but to cut to the
chase I think I would have said "man, this is going to be a real rough, rough
road" if we went into the game and you told me ahead of time Ashley was going
to finish with 5 points.  
But we talk all the time about the fact that there are a lot of ways to impact
the game and impact winning and we needed others to step up. It's not just
that Ashley grabs a rebound or a block, those are things you need to do to be
competitive.  
I think it's as much the other young people surrounding her that stepped up
their game and their confidence and their sense of self that is the most
please to me, and the biggest factor in having an opportunity to play another
game.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH PATTERSON: Well, the positive for me is that we get to play again
tomorrow. You know, Nebraska is a tremendous team, and that goes without
saying. They're on an unbelievable terror this year through the season. For me
it's just -- and for our basketball team it really it more about the
challenge, you know? Having an opportunity to step up to the plate with
another challenge before us. I can't say that I relish the opportunity to have
that match-up be Nebraska, you know?  
But we will, I hope, step on the floor and give our very best and bring our
very best game and efforts to the floor and see where that takes us.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, congratulations on today's win, we will look
forward to seeing you tomorrow.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  72  
Colorado - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Kim Mulkey and three of her student
athletes, we have Whitney Zachariason, Kelli Griffin, Morghan Medlock; and
Coach, if you would make a couple of opening comments. No opening comments?
We're going to take questions, then, from the student athletes.  
  
Q. Whitney, you got some big minutes tonight and early in the game I heard
Coach yell from the bench "shoot the ball" and obviously you did that. Talk
about making five 3-pointers.   
WHITNEY ZACHARIASON: Our team got me the ball, and if I go in a game I'm
probably going to go in to shoot and I was impressed with the way our team
came in and played well together.  
  
Q. Whitney, did Coach give you any indication before the game that you were
going to come in so early?  
WHITNEY ZACHARIASON: I think everybody knew we had to step up pause we had a
few people out now and I think everybody on the bench did a great job tonight.  
  
Q. Morghan can you talk about when you have a teammate like Whitney, what it
means to the team?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: Whitney Zachariason's performance was huge tonight. She's
been knocking shots down all week and we expected her to do that tonight and
she did. I can't praise her enough.  
  
Q. Kelli, you guys went to the full-court press which is something you don't
do a lot of but you feel like that was effective in the come-back?  
KELLI GRIFFIN: Coach told us to get in and press and we had to gamble to make
a run and get back into the game quick and get an early lead, and I think we
had a lot of people playing out of position but I think as a team we connected
and we did good as a whole and it helped us.  
  
Q. How big was Jordan's shot there at the end, Kelli?  
KELLI GRIFFIN: I think it was more exciting than anything, I think she was
0-whatever from the 3-point line. Everybody knew she was going to hit one we
just didn't know when. We were excited for her and the team -- it gave us a
lot of energy.  
  
Q. Morghan can you talk about their zone, they stayed in it pretty much the
whole game, and what that did to you guys offensively?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: It forced us to penetrate and be more active, we couldn't
penetrate. Coach told us to post flash, run low passing, X-cut and we did a
great job collectively as a whole in following our game plan.  
  
Q. Whitney, you feel like with the performance like this maybe you're
auditioning for more minutes there?  
WHITNEY ZACHARIASON: No, I think we have a great team, I'm ready to play
whenever I'm needed and I think everybody does a great job off the bench.  
  
Q. Kelli, how big was this game for you guys to get a win without Brittney
Griner?  
KELLI GRIFFIN: Any win is going to be good, it's hard to be without her but
we're not a one-person team, and it will be great to have her back tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kelli, the shooting tonight, does that build confidence for going further
into the tournament and be able to knock down shots?  
KELLI GRIFFIN: Sure it does, a lot of teams are going to play the zone, so
with Whitney knocking down the three's like she did tonight it will open up
things inside.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you go back to the locker room.
Congratulations on your win, and we'll see you tomorrow, and Coach Mulkey will
take questions.  
  
Q. Kim, you said before if you're ever going to use a full-court press you
should do it when the other team doesn't expect it. Did you just need a lift
of some kind?  
COACH MULKEY: I can't speak for Colorado, but we were in a situation where we
were down 8 and we needed to change things and we needed the momentum to swing
in our favor. We are very, very young on the perimeter and I thought turn the
athletes loose and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Whitney's performance tonight? Sometimes in these
tournaments unsung heros come up and she came off the bench and shot all night
long.  
COACH MULKEY: You go with your gut, and Whitney, that's what she does best,
she shoots the perimeter shot. She did what she was recruited to do make open,
3-point shots and I couldn't be happier for a young lady who has sat the
bench, has been the last one to go in ball games the majority of the year and
yet she is just a great kid and she just never, ever pouts, she never thinks
about herself, she thinks about the team, and the article needs to be about
Whitney Zachariason.  
  
Q. I asked her but does she get more minutes after a performance like
that?  
COACH MULKEY: If everybody wants to play us a zone I bet I can find a place
for her.  
  
Q. Coach, was it a game time decision to put her in 3 minutes into the
game?  
COACH MULKEY: Yeah, it was sitin' on that bench and watching us miss shots
from the perimeter and I thought "hell, give her a shot," and that's what I
did.  
  
Q. When Colorado started taking the lead a lot of it was on the second-
chance shots, controlling the rebounds --  
COACH MULKEY: They're bigger than we are, Bryce, and we talked about it at
halftime. We needed to get a body on them they were getting a lot of second-
chance points, and I think it was 10-2 at halftime second-chance points and we
talked about them rebounding at all five positions. We're not big with
Brittney Griner out of lineup and our guards are 6-foot, 6-1, they needed to
help our post players rebound.  
  
Q. Coach, as Kelli said not many had faith in you guys pulling out this win
what does it do for confidence now that you're getting Brittney back
tomorrow?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know who those people are, they really don't matter to
us.  
  
Q. Kim, there was a moment in the game when the shot clock was winding down
and the first person on your bench who jumped up and say yelling is Melissa
Jones. I wonder if you can talk about how much she can do even though she
can't be out on the floor.  
COACH MULKEY: Melissa Jones is an epitome of what a student athlete should be.
She is a great student, she's a Christian, a good athlete and goes to FCA. She
wants to play in the worst way. I've chosen not to play her. There is a bigger
picture called the NCAA and if I can get her leg another week's rest that's
what we're trying to do.  
If we're fortunate enough to play in the championship here that's the
beginning of another week and I maybe can get her minutes on a Sunday, but
right now I just have to think we're going to be better when she does get
healthy at the end of this year and next year because of the minutes these
young people have had to play early in their careers.  
  
Q. Kim, Jordan shot 25 feet from the basket how big was that?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, you're up 3, were we up 3 at that time and the shot clock
was winding down and that was way outside the men's 3-point line and it's one
of those shots where she had to take it. Jordan has done some of that this
year. She might miss four or five that she takes and then shell hit a big shot
for ya. She was left wide open and it was a big shot, and I'm happy for that
kid, she is coming off an MCL sprain and she is an athlete and she was part of
that run. When we were pressing in the back court she knocked the ball away if
a girl when she beat her off the dribble, she was trying to do anything to
help her team win.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think of the students and all the fans who made it out
to Kansas City?  
COACH MULKEY: I thought it was awesome. Our Baylor fans love us, and our men's
game is going on. Can you imagine if they didn't have to split up how many
would have been here tonight? They appreciate the effort that these kids put
on the floor every day and had he love every one of them even when they're at
their lowest moment.  
  
Q. Coach you got to play Oklahoma tomorrow, you've played twice this year
and it's always a good match-up.  
COACH MULKEY: It will be another good match-up and the advantage is they got
to sit today and the disadvantage is we used quite a lot of energy tonight and
it will be another game that I don't anticipate to be any different than the
first two. The only difference is Brittney Griner will be back.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much, congratulations, we'll see you
tomorrow.

### [Ashley Gayle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19498)

### [Gail Goestenkors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14259)

### [Kathleen Nash](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18077)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas Longhorns  64  
Missouri - 59

  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I feel that's what we did today, it was a struggle, I
thought we started off well, got up 10 and then we lost our focus a little bit
and turn the ball over, and gave them new life. I thought they did a
tremendous job, Amanda Hanneman in particular, I had been going through her
stats and she missed her last 253's in away games, and I was hoping she would
feel like this was an away game.  
But she didn't, she felt like it was a home game and she shot the ball well
for them and they kept fightin', and I would expect nothing less of a Cindy
Stein team, she is a tremendous coach, they've lost a lot of tough close games
but she's always had 'em -- they've always fought and as long as your team
gives everything you have you're happy and you've done a great job, and I
think she did a great job.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for your student athletes?  
  
Q. Gail, you touched it on this, this is your worst fear --  
THE MODERATOR: Student athletes first, please.  
  
Q. Was this your guys worst fear that this team would come out here with
nothing to lose, their coach leaving? They played better than the last time
you saw 'em.  
KATHLEEN NASH: We knew they were going to play hard, I would say we didn't
come in here ready enough and we were happy to be away with a win.  
ASHLEY GAYLE: I think we started the game off well and we got a 10-point lead
and they started to come back and kept fighting. We were down halftime and we
knew that we had to come back out and put it all out there because this could
be our last game, too.  
  
Q. Kathleen, is it hard to not look at what you've done against a team like
Mississippi before and bring that into the game tonight? You guys talked about
being comfortable, did that play into knowing that you guys had won
previously?  
KATHLEEN NASH: When we played them at home we didn't handle them that easily,
we played 'em pretty tight during some of the games and we knew we needed to
come out here and play.  
  
Q. Ashley, could you talk about the setting the school block record and the
defense today?  
ASHLEY GAYLE: Well, Coach, before the game started she talked about how
everybody has a role on this team and how playing for this team is made of 10
pieces and everybody has their role and one of my biggest roles on this team
is defense and shot blocking and that was part of my job and I went out there
and tried to go 100%.  
  
Q. Kathleen, when you look at the box score, Brittainey had 11 and then you
have three players with 9, everybody who played scored. Is that when you guys
think you're at your best when you have that kind of attack?  
KATHLEEN NASH: When we move the ball around and everybody gets a chance to
score, for sure. Like you said, we were even in the box score and that shows
we have a lot of talent on our team and it's tough for other teams to guard
that many players when they can't just key on one.  
  
Q. I want to follow up on Michelle's question. Talk about the challenge of
having to play out of day one, the possibility of having four games in four
days and what having that kind of depth gives you an advantage to get through
long weekends if it comes to that.  
KATHLEEN NASH: I think we're lucky on our team because we know that we can go
in there and play hard and we can get a sub, it's not like we're having to
rest ourselves the whole game because we know we're going to be playing forty
minutes, we know there is somebody that can come in and play right behind us.
I think that will definitely help and carry over in the four games.  
ASHLEY GAYLE: In the Virgin Islands we played three games in three days, so
this isn't new to us and I think we're prepared and we've done a tournament
like this before so we know we have to play hard every day and know that we
have enough on the bench to get a breather during the game.  
  
Q. Just about the match-up with Texas A &M, you guys have had tough battles
with them this season.   
KATHLEEN NASH: They're a great program and they have a lot of great players
and every time we play 'em it's a game and it's a rivalry between us. I think
we've started a new season coming to the tournament and we've got to go out
there and play hard.  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to let the student athletes go back to the locker
room and now we'll take questions for Coach Gail Goestenkors.  
  
Q. Gail you're misty eyed, does it have something to do with Cindy?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I have a cold! I feel for Cindy, I really do. Like I said
she's a good friend and a great coach and I know there are good things out
there for her. I hated that this was her last game.  
  
Q. You shut Hanneman down and didn't get her get opportunities, what were
you trying to do?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Shut her down and try not to let her -- (Chuckles.) We had
been switching on screens most of the game and they were doing a great job of
taking advantage of that and we stopped switching and I put Yvonne Anderson on
her, and I said do not let her get anymore three's, there is no excuse.  
So sometimes when you switch it allows players to say I didn't think I had her
but when you know who you've got, and I thought Yvonne Anderson let her get
one three. She got hung up on a screen, but other than that I thought she did
a nice job.  
  
Q. Gail, understanding the situation with Cindy, did you discuss with your
team the emotion they might be feeling?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Yeah, I said they're going to play for their coach and it's
going to be a war, and I wanted my players to understand it wasn't going to be
easy, it was not going to be anything, I didn't think, similar to the game we
had in Austin earlier.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like Texas A &M has been the one team that's been
consistently a challenge for you, other than the fact that they're obviously a
good team is there something about them that's made it particularly difficult?
  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Yeah, I think it's their athleticism and their physical
style of play, they take you out of your sets.  
If you don't handle the physical style of play well, if you get frustrated
then it's to their advantage and in the past we've let it frustrate us and
we've turned the ball over and if you turn it over they're a great transition
team so I think first and foremost you've got to handle their pressure and
their physicality and take care of the ball.  
  
Q. Coach, when you said surpassed a thousand career points today, can you
talk about that?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I've always said Earnesia Williams is our warrior, and she
was again tonight. She hit a big bucket down the stretch and caused a travel
for them when they needed a bucket so two great plays on offense and one on
defense when we needed it. That's what seniors do, especially fifth year
seniors and I'm happy she decided to come back and play because I want her to
end on a great note and she deserves that for everything she's given this
program.  
  
Q. Gail, can you talk about Yvonne's development as a player. You mentioned
how well she did on defense, on Amanda she was penetrating and getting to the
free-throw line and contributing in a lot of ways.  
COACH GOESTENKORS: Yvonne has come so far, she is starting to play her best
basketball for us the last couple of games which is important heading into
tournament time, she gets tough mentality she gets from her dad and she loves
to play defense. We went to the free-throw line one time in the first half,
can to me shows that we're not being aggressive and in the second half she was
determined to be aggressive and she had that attack mind-set we needed and got
to the free-throw line.  
  
Q. On A &M, you talk about their physicalness, I guess the only way deal
with that is to be physical yourself and what are you anticipating for
tomorrow and how annoying is it that they have y'all's number like they have
had?   
COACH GOESTENKORS: We will have to be physical but in the right way, if you're
not used to playing that style and you try to play physical you get called for
fouls because it's not normally what you do. We've got to take the physical
play and get some backdoor penetration and cuts and so forth, and it's
frustrating and to know that these seniors haven't beaten them I want to come
way with a win for those seniors.  
They've given so much to this program and I want them to come away with a win.  
  
Q. Gail, that game in College Station was odd, I don't remember too many
times I've seen a situation in the game where it's stopped and do you think
that disrupted that game and sort of changed the flow of it in a lot of
ways?  
COACH GOESTENKORS: I would like to say that it did, but it didn't. I can't
really say that. We started off really well, I thought we played a nice game
for the most part but down the stretch, they put a little press on us and we
did not respond well to it and turned the ball over. That gave them some
momentum so they had the momentum going into that -- whatever that was, that
call, that play, the delay. That did not really affect us. We had already been
affected.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much, congratulations on the win, we'll
see you tomorrow.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Baylor  72  
Colorado - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now being joined by the Colorado Buffalos, Kathy
McConnell-Miller, the coach and her two students athletes, Alyssa Fressle and
Brittany Spears. Coach?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: You know what I was very, very proud of our team's
effort tonight. I thought they left it on the floor, every bit of it.
Offensively and defensively they understood the game plan and felt good about
it, believed in it, and I thought they executed it.  
The difference from the first half to the second half, if it had stayed a
half-court game probably could have made shots, continued to execute
offensively, but as expected the pressure came in the second half to get a
higher possession game, try to turn us over and just didn't get the looks in
the second half that we needed. We struggled, turned it over a little bit,
couple of forced shots and we got stops and did some good things on the
defensive end but got on our heels as a result of the defense.  
But these two young ladies continuously get better for us and continue to
improve our program. I think Alyssa Fressle is playing the best basketball
she's played in a Colorado uniform, great floor game, good composure and I
think her experience over this past year has really shown in the last couple
weeks of play.  
Brittany Spears continues to be our enforcer and the offensive threat and I'm
just -- I want to see them have success because they work extremely hard at
this game and want Colorado basketball to continue to improve.  
As far as the team I know they're disappointed, but they gave their heart and,
you know, they're a great group of girls, it's been a tough year and we're
going to move forward.  
THE MODERATOR: Student athlete questions first, please.  
  
Q. Alyssa, did their full-court press catch you guys off guard at all late
in the second half?  
ALYSSA FRESSLE: Um, I would say a little bit. We actually talked about it
right before they were about to -- right before they started pressing, Coach
said expect pressure and I just don't think we were really in maybe the right
spots initially, like we didn't have flashers and, yeah I would say.  
  
Q. Brittany, can you talk about the second half, what changed? What was
different? There were some shots at the end maybe some good looks, same layups
that didn't roll for you guys was that painful at the end?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: Yes, the press changed the whole game, I guess.  
  
Q. Alyssa and Brittany can you both talk about Bianca and Courtney and what
they've meant?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: Of course it's sad to see seniors leave especially on a
losing note so it was really sad. That's all I can say.  
ALYSSA FRESSLE: I agree. They're both going to be missed, just their
personalities off the floor, their leadership and, you know, most of all I
would just say their friendships, you know, it's great having them around off
the floor and I'm going to miss 'em and definitely on the floor, too, their
contributions.  
  
Q. Brittany talk about in the first half you guys had 10 second-chance
points going into halftime what were you thinking?  
BRITTANY SPEARS: At halftime we were saying we've got to stay focused, don't
be happy with the lead and come out strong.  
  
Q. Alyssa, some of the shots didn't fall late, layups were short or just
kind of thrown up there. Did their press wear you out to the fact that it
affected the offense, also, as far as what you had shots?  
ALYSSA FRESSLE: I don't know if it wore us out, some of those shots we just
didn't make. I mean a couple rolled around, my layups, a couple by Chucky, she
had a great drive and they just didn't fall. There is not too much else to say
.  
THE MODERATOR: Any further questions for our student athletes?  
  
Q. How close do you guys think you are with the young team you have, and
what needs to change next year to have a winning season?  
ALYSSA FRESSLE: I think we're close, I think we've got a lot of great young
ones, especially with Chucky and Meagan and the experience they're going to
have next year, and I think we need a good "big" and I think the experience we
have coming back with Spears, Chucky, Meagan, me, Julie, Kelli Jo and Chelsea,
that's a good core right there; and bringing along Melissa, too, I think we
have a lot of good things in store for the program. We've got a lot of good
ones coming in so we're excited we're going to get better in the off-season
and look to really improve and get better next year.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you go back to the locker room. Best
of luck to you. Now we'll take coach questions. On the right.  
  
Q. Whitney Zachariason had her break-out night tonight, how big of a
surprise was she?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: When we were in the zone the scoring had to come from
somewhere and we were committed to not allowing the splits and not allowing
the drives and making them shoot over top, that was our focus all week, making
sure that everything they got had to come from over top, and we weren't giving
them open looks.  
But she got a couple early on and gained some confidence, but as soon as they
realized that we were staying in the zone they brought her off the bench fast,
and they knew they needed somebody to spread the offense. They did a great job
with the overload. They put her on the wing and somebody strong on the block,
and typically we're a bump-back type of 2-3 zone, and we tried to rely on our
guards to guard that and the back of the 2-3 to guard the short corner and she
got some looks. She got confident, hit a couple in the first half, and the
scoring was going to come from somewhere, and they knew in the zone that she
was the one they needed to do it.  
  
Q. Kathy, how close is the program to competing with the good teams in the
league?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: You know, it's really been cyclical. When I got to the
program we had some really, really strong bigs, Jackie McFarland, Kara
Richards, the frontline was solid and we had inexperienced back court. To the
point where at times we couldn't even get the ball inside and just had to rely
on Jackie so much when we did get it in, or Kara.  
It's sort of come full circle, the back court is strong and our frontline has
virtually no experience. We have spent the entire season playing with four
players above the free-throw line to try and spread things out, allow for
drives and some perimeter shooting.  
We've had very little inside touches, so for us the missing piece is that
"big" it's an interior player. If I go back and look at statistics, teams that
we've struggled against or in every game, you know, the "bigs" were looking
for 8 for 8, 7 for 9, particularly on the defensive end we have not had that
strong of an interior presence. As far as getting there, when you need in this
league I looked around and it was so important to have a strong back court.  
Every team that was having success in this league had a strong back court, but
had an interior player with some type of presence. That's the piece that our
staff is -- knows that we're missing and that's the piece we need.  
  
Q. Kathy, obviously you're in a tough business. Do you think that you'll be
around to see your program through to the end?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Well, I think it's been asked and answered, but I will
answer that again. I'm confident in my coaching ability and ability to
recruit. We feel like we have a solid foundation. Nobody in the program top to
bottom feels good about the record, but we feel progress continues to be made.
It's a strong foundation, and I can only control what I can control.  
  
Q. Kathy, how much different of a game was this without Brittney Griner?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: It was a very different game, very different game plan
at Baylor if you look at the score and the amount of blocked shots they had a
triple-double on us, and really changed the mind-set of all of our players as
far as any type of drives and really intimidated some of our younger players
and was a challenge for us.  
But we felt like when she was off the floor we did some good things at Baylor,
last 10 minutes of the game we went zone even with her on the floor and knew
at that point we had some success in the zone, fronting her, backing her,
trying to double team from the weak side, but she's a special player.  
She's a difference maker, she's exceptional. There aren't many like her. She's
improving. I think her improvement has come over the year with passing out of
the double team, she wasn't very good at that. If there was a weakness it was
every time she was double teamed she would turn it over or wouldn't find the
open player. She's getting good at passing out of the double team, finding the
weak side post but very, very effective and she is a difference maker.  
  
Q. Kathy, talk about the first half when you guys controlled the tempo of
the game and what you felt like the flow of the game was in the first half.  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: I think anytime you hit shots you can stay in games.
From an offensive standpoint there was patience, execution, players making the
extra pass and that was the difference offensively in the first half from the
second half.  
Didn't have enough time in the second half to really execute and get into the
flow of our offense, but there was a comfort level, they weren't pressing us,
we got the ball up, we were able to alternate between our two-guard set and
our open offense. They never got comfortable guarding one or the other and
just a good feel and a good flow and when they started hitting shots that's
our team.  
Our team has played strong on the road. Clearly the record doesn't reflect it,
but when we've been on the road this team away from home is focused. I saw
that same -- in the first 20 minutes when you saw in the second half at
Oklahoma, what you saw at Missouri, what you saw at K State, there is a
potential on the road, is this the best road team that I've had since I've
been here as far as confidence on the road and playing well on the road.  
  
Q. Kathy, how many of those missed opportunities, the missed chippies at the
end are going to haunt you?  
COACH McCONNELL-MILLER: Haunt me? I feel like they're going to haunt Chucky,
they're going to haunt Alyssa, and it's my job as a coach to have them go into
the off-season and not have them think about those missed layups, I can grow
past that, individually they've had a tough year, Chucky had a strong
nonconference and came to conference and sought athleticism and the size and
the strength of the players in the league and just the mental toughness of it,
that's something that we all need to improve on.  
But it's my job as a coach to focus on what we've done well, what we need to
improve on in the off-season and how they're going to get better. We've all
got to grow, I've got to grow, the staff has to grow, the team's got to grow
and we've got to get better as a result of this season. There are some of
those layups and shots that went in and out and, you know, could make a
difference, but you know what? It didn't. We've got to grow and learn.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

### [Carolyn Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20635)

### [Bonnie Henrickson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13895)

### [Sade Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18926)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  76  
Kansas - 69

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Bonnie Henrickson and her two student
athletes Sade Morris and Carolyn Davis. Coach, opening comment?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I just thought they got us on the offensive glass in the
first half and we cleaned that up and did a much better job in the second half
but when you look at Riley's 20 in the first half, she's got 7 from the free-
throw line, so she goes 7 for 8 from the free-throw line in the first half.
And our last two games she hadn't shot 8 free-throws, we did a much better job
of staying on our feet and building a wall in front of the rim and whoever has
her, whether it's the post that rotates, not foul, make her take a tough 2 and
we didn't -- and we lacked some discipline but we go to the stretch and she
hits the one going into the locker loom and that's a dagger and we tried to
trap her and double her and we foul her.  
But it's Carolyn and similar to our game at our place, Andrea Riley and
Danielle McCray neutralize each other, but we've got to have other kids step
up and score when that happens.  
  
Q. Carolyn can you talk about your day today? You missed just one shot from
the floor and seemed to be in a nice flow. Talk about your day today and this
game.  
CAROLYN DAVIS: I came out excited to play, I didn't get to play in the last
game. It was frustrating, so I came out and gave my all and I knew every time
I got the ball I had to score or try to hit a teammate to score.  
  
Q. Sade what made Andrea Riley so difficult to defend?  
SADE MORRIS: She is quick and able to pop up for a shot before you know it and
she's got the quickness and not only can she shoot the 3, but she has good
passing ability.  
  
Q. Carolyn tell us about your recovery from your concussion.  
CAROLYN DAVIS: I just tried to rest up and not overexert myself. I took a few
shots up there in practice, and I just tried to take it easy until today.  
  
Q. When did you get cleared to play?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: Yesterday? Yesterday, yeah.  
  
Q. Carolyn they were throwing everything at you with their zone defense, how
were you catching the passes and still going up with it?  
CAROLYN DAVIS: I don't know I just jumped in and tried to catch it.  
  
Q. Sade, Carolyn Davis was really shooting, but you guys could not hit an
outside shot tonight, was it their defense or were you guys just having an off
night or what?  
SADE MORRIS: It was just difficult to get 'em to go in and when we finally
calmed down we were able to make some.  
  
Q. Sade, I know this has been a disappointing, tough season for you but when
you see what Carolyn is doing, if you could talk about what these rookies are
doing and what they can mean to KU basketball.  
SADE MORRIS: The Rookies came in and stepped up when we needed 'em, and they
were able to score and defend for us and that's something they can build off
of and have confidence going into next year they can look back on their
freshman year and see how well they played.  
  
Q. Sade, what helped you calm down and how did you adjust your game?  
SADE MORRIS: I had to figure out a way to help my teammates out, whether it
was making a basket or trying to make a good pass or going to the boards.  
  
Q. Sade are you concerned that this might have been your last game?  
SADE MORRIS: Not at all, we have a game coming up next week in the WNIT and I
don't plan on losing out we plan on making it to the championship game and
winning it.  
  
Q. You've been chosen for the WNIT?  
COACH HENRICKSON: I told them they were. We feel that we'll play next week
we've done the paperwork and had communication with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much for your time. We'll look forward
to seeing you down the road.  
Coach, we're going to let you answer questions now.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate more on the WNIT?  
COACH HENRICKSON: We don't know match-ups, we don't know -- we're looking at
working on the opportunity to play at home, cautiously optimistic, I think
there has been enough communication that we feel like we've got a chance to do
that, Larry Keating handles all that, and it feels like based on conversation
we would have an opportunity to possibly play at home next week.  
  
Q. Obviously you're not going into this tournament on a wave of momentum. Is
that a problem?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Well, yeah, I think -- honestly as bad as we've been against
A&M and Baylor, as well as we played at times tonight feels so much better
than how poorly we played in those two losses where we never make it a game
and never challenge and back to where in the Texas game and the Iowa State
game and the Nebraska game we were close and gave ourselves a chance.  
We had gotten to a chance where I was disappointed with our effort and
toughness and felt better in stretches tonight, so even in a loss I think
there are some things that we've been asking these kids to do that we hadn't
done that we did today. Now the single thing that is eating us up is our
inability to get on the offensive glass and convert and keep others off the
offensive glass.  
I think these kids understand -- disappointed that the year finished out like
it did bullet for those of us that were a part of that run last year in the
NIT, it was exciting and our kids I thought played with a lot of pride in the
event and those upper classmen, including myself, can talk about that
opportunity, and being aware that it's a lot of times at NIT it's your mind-
set going into it because if you don't want to be in it you're going to get
beat right away because there are a lot of teams that really want to be in and
look at what institution you have on your shirt and be fired up to play you.  
So we understand that and I thought we handled that well. Last year we felt
like we were a game away from being in the NCAA tournament last year we didn't
help ourselves enough in the last ten days to be in the conversation, but we
can go back and draw on the pride that we played with last year in the NIT.  
  
Q. Bonnie, it seemed like Carolyn was alone on the scoring other than big
shots from Nicollette and Krysten --  
COACH HENRICKSON: Aishah and Monica go 4 for 34.  
  
Q. Why do you think that is?  
COACH HENRICKSON: Air balls, I thought Monica and Sade were undisciplined
about how they shot the ball, Aishah was undisciplined about her footwork into
the shot and if your feet aren't right, you drastically reduce your chances to
make a shot. Monica's didn't look close and those guys have to get back and
own that, and I thought they tried to be aggressive.  
But you've got to be prepared to take a shot to give yourselves a chance to
make one and when we go back and look at it tonight, of the 34, I bet they
shot 6 or 8 probably the way they're supposed to.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about an inability to convert on the offensive glass,
but tonight you had a season high 34 defensive rebounds. Can you talk about
the affect that had on the game?  
COACH HENRICKSON: They had 13 offensive rebounds in the first half and the
Toni Young and Precious Robinson had 6 of those, that's where they killed us
at our place. Andrea Riley goes 3 for 10 in the last ten minutes, and they get
all seven of those misses, and we were going to need to get a rebound and we
don't clean it up like we should. Now we were better in the second half, but
you shouldn't dig yourselves such a big hole in the first place. Our effort
was great to get back, we don't box out, we watch or miss it, watch our
teammates watch her miss it and here they come over the back half.  
  
Q. Bonnie, down the stretch you mentioned Andrea Riley and she missed some,
10 of 30, but down the stretch when they need her most she comes and brings
it. Can you talk about her down the stretch and how she's able to deliver that
way?  
COACH HENRICKSON: She does, she has some moxy and toughness to her and she's a
kid who has gotten better and continues to get better and obviously is the
glue that holds that team together and say the reason they've been successful
but it's a kid who can take tough shots and hit tough shots.  
  
Q. Bonnie, curious why you didn't start Davis.  
COACH HENRICKSON: I talked about I felt like if I started -- I talked to her
today for a while after we shot and after pregame meal because I think she
shot she wasn't going to play, I think she was waiting for the big green
light. I said did you feel like you can play which I knew the answer because
the feedback I got from her shooting today and yesterday she felt good. I want
to hear from her, I said do you feel like you can go. "I can go," right away.
I said let's not start you, let's start Kristin and she's been good, and I
said be ready right away; and I thought she wouldn't feel like she had to do
something right away, the kid hasn't practiced in 5 games.  
So I'm going to have a team full of kids that will think they need to take 5
days off and get 31. And I told her to let me know if she got gassed and she
tugged once, and I told her I feel like if you come off the bench, we will try
to eliminate any pressure you feel to get away but you'll get in right away. I
thought maybe it keeps Krysten in a better place because she has played pretty
well, whatever way we went both kids would contribute and play well, I knew,
and they did. Those two went 15 for 16, between Krysten and Carolyn?  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thanks, Coach, good to see you.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2010

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

### [Kierra Mallard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19472)

### [Ashlee Roberson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20615)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kansas State  59  
Texas Tech - 51

  
COACH CURRY: I think a day like today you have to credit Kansas State, they
made a lot of great plays we had the shot clock down there late and they were
able to finish and they hit big three's at critical plays and credit them.  
THE MODERATOR: We would take our questions for our student athletes first.  
  
Q. Ashlee, can you talk about getting in an early groove to hit the 3's
early in the game?  
ASHLEE ROBERSON: After a couple of those we needed to contain the shooters and
that's their specialty and their strength and they shoot outside and we didn't
do a good job of containing the outside shooters.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
ASHLEE ROBERSON: I feel that overall we did a good job of responding, I don't
know what I can say about the run you've got to give credit to T State, they
hit some big shots.  
  
Q. Kierra, their guards rebound well and Karr in particular had some down
the stretch. Did you feel like that was a big factor in the game? You guys
seemed like you would close them out and then they would get another chance.  
KIERRA MALLARD: The post had their men and you had to try to rebound, I give
it up to Kansas for going in and hitting the boards.  
  
Q. Everybody knows what's been going on in the last couple of weeks with
Brittany and Jordan, how much of a distraction did you guys have to deal
with?  
ASHLEE ROBERSON: We tried to keep the mediation out of it. I don't know what
to say, Coach Curry did a good job of telling us what we needed to do, the
whole situation made us stronger and made us a better team familiwise.  
THE MODERATOR: Anything further? Okay, ladies, we're going to get you all go
back to the locker room.  
  
Q. Kristy, can you talk about the lead that K State gets out to?  
COACH CURRY: I thought their quick start gave them a lot of confidence for the
next 36 minutes and we weren't able to recover from that. So it definitely
gave them confidence, you know, it's amazing when you can force Ashley Sweat
to go 1 for 10 you think you got a chance to win.  
  
Q. (No microphone?)  
COACH CURRY: You know, we wanted to make sure we had a good possession and
missed the layup, we missed a couple of easy looks that either tied up or get
the shots you want and sometimes they don't go down but I thought we made some
plays down the stretch, can't fault our decisions offensively, I thought Mo
got a great look, and sometimes they don't go down, you should have yourself
in that position, that's when things at the beginning of the second half, the
first half starts to catch up with you a little bit.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH CURRY: I thought she didn't look herself today, defensively especially,
I thought she was too passive, we gave them too many looks in the game, but
what she's been through she's got to continue to understand you work your way
back in in practice, yesterday she was 3 out of 4 possessions for 75% of the
time and she's going to continue to work her way back in, once you fall off
the horse you've got to get back on.  
She's got to stay the course and continue to work well and she's just a
sophomore, didn't play particularly well today, we can associate that with
what happened or we can just not. I think that's something you would have to
ask her, I have not had a chance to visit with her about it.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH CURRY: You know, Michelle, I don't make excuses, I always accept full
responsibility, whether it's been the punch, that was obviously an emotional
day, as bad as we felt I felt good for Cindy Stein that day, Cindy alone.
We've had some strange things happen in the last couple of games and it's all
on how you handle the adversity, it's not always how hard you fall it's how
you get up, and at Texas Tech I feel great about the progress we're making and
my administration's support and we're looking forward to the future with 10
freshmen and sophomores, and I had a kid pay her own way today that's sitting
out to watch her team and the future is bright and we're going to get to the
NIT and keep rolling and getting better.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH CURRY: We're going to accept a bid, I hope they ask us, I think we're
probably that 8th spot and if we hadn't messed around we would probably be in
the NCAA tournament and we're going to accept a bid with open arms and
continue to improve.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Christine and what she did? It was like she was trying
to take over the game herself and the way these young girls are playing looks
like they're going to be good in the next coming years.  
COACH CURRY: You know, they are, and they've got to continue to work and I
think Christine has to understand the importance of sprinting from free-throw
line to free-throw line, and playing harder for longer periods so her
conditioning and getting herself in the best shape would be a huge goal for
her in the off season and she will hit a wall at points in the game and she
has to learn to fight through that, Christine, Chynna, Monique, we have a lot
to look forward to.  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, Coach.

## March 11, 2010

  

### [Kurt Budke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14197)

### [Tegan Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20634)

### [Andrea Riley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16924)

  
_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma State  76  
Kansas - 69

  
THE MODERATOR: We're going to let Coach Budke start. If you would, please,
keep your questions to the student athletes first. Congratulations on the win,
Coach.  
COACH BUDKE: Thank you very much. When you get to this tournament as y'all
know it's about surviving and advancing, and that's what we did tonight. I
don't think we played our best basketball tonight, I thought we missed a lot
of layups and free-throws, but we found a way to get it done.  
We have one of the best players in this country sitting over here and she
willed us to a win tonight. I was impressed -- she has been impressive not
only offensively but defensively in the last couple weeks of this season and I
promise you we wouldn't be sitting here happy tonight if she didn't do what
she did.  
You know what, it was a good win, Carolyn Blair-Mobley came in and helped out,
we went down through the bench tonight, everybody got minutes in and I thought
that's what you have to have to win in this tournament, you better go to your
bench often and I thought we did that tonight and found a way to get it done.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Tegan Cunningham is here along with Andrea
Riley. We'll take questions for our student athletes first.  
  
Q. Andrea, career scoring record and you guys needed every one tonight. Talk
about your night and how close of a game this ended up being.  
ANDREA RILEY: The biggest thing that was on my mind tonight was just going out
and playing defense as hard as I can. Coach has been talking about it all the
time, he's always talking about me and Tegan's defense, so we tried to respond
positively and took initiative and played defense really hard and that's how
we had fun tonight.  
  
Q. It seemed like not all your shots were falling tonight, but you kept
shooting where did that come from?  
ANDREA RILEY: Coach always tell me you can't dwell on a miss, you're going to
miss shots you have to continue to stay positive and they'll go in when they
go in, you can't call every shot and he always talks to me and tee began and
says "just keep shootin' to help your team."  
  
Q. Tegan, they kept coming back, they took a lead at one point you guys took
it back but can you talk about the second half and the back and forth?  
TEGAN CUNNINGHAM: KU is a good team we knew they were going to all step up. I
think we just wanted it more. We've been down in situations before we know how
to handle ourselves and we kept attacking the basket and it was one of those
close games, but I'm glad we pulled away with the win.  
  
Q. Tegan, what did Coach Budke say in that time-out after they had taken the
lead.  
TEGAN CUNNINGHAM: Oh, God!  
COACH BUDKE: It was inspirational.  
TEGAN CUNNINGHAM: I think it was really about locking down defense.  
ANDREA RILEY: A motivational speech, we don't say --  
COACH BUDKE: I've got you two for a couple more, so... (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Tegan, talk about the foul trouble you guys got into tonight. Carolyn
Davis is an emerging post player, but talk about the defense and the different
zones you went into to stop that.  
TEGAN CUNNINGHAM: She is a great player. I give her a lot of credit. We just
kept fouling and gave them fouls we didn't need to give and we tried to mix it
up and change out defense as much as possible trying to create threats to her,
but she played a great game.  
  
Q. Andrea, you let the clock tick off, 37 points, was there a thought that
maybe you would put it up?  
ANDREA RILEY: No, I was just ready for the time to be done. That was a fun
game, but it takes energy out of you when you play that hard.  
  
Q. Andrea, what about the match-up tomorrow with Iowa State a team you guys
played not too long ago and beat not too long ago.  
ANDREA RILEY: We're happy that they have Allison Lacey back because they're a
great team. They took us down to the wire when they played at our house, and I
think they're a balanced team. Tomorrow we're going to have to prove ourselves
because -- defensively because they spread you out because they have some
shooters at every position. It's another defensive game which is going to win
the game.  
  
Q. Andrea, do you relish games like this where -- I mean you guys are in a
dog fight and you're going to have the ball in your hands obviously by virtue
of your position. Do you relish games like this and being able to bring your
team to victory like you did?  
ANDREA RILEY: Well, I know my team always has confidence in me and I don't
want to let 'em down, so I just try to show my will to win and the
competitiveness within me. I just like to win.  
  
Q. Andrea, I'm going to make you talk about offense. 37 points tonight that
is the Big 12 single-game scoring record that broke Courtney's record. I
wonder if you could talk about -- you've had to carry a load offensively and
how much it means to you when the numbers pile up you're going to be the Big
12's best scorer in history.  
ANDREA RILEY: What an honor! I mean there is a lot of big names up there,
Courtney Paris is one of the greatest players that came through the Big 12 and
to pass a record like that it's overwhelming. I don't really like to talk
about it.  
COACH BUDKE: Honestly we never talk about it, we've never, ever talked about
the Big 12 record.  
ANDREA RILEY: I didn't even know.  
COACH BUDKE: That's right, all she wants to do is win. Bottom line, we've
never talked about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, congratulations, ladies, we'll see you tomorrow.  
COACH BUDKE: Andrea did take a charge tonight! (Chuckles.)  
THE MODERATOR: First question for Coach?  
  
Q. Kurt, talk about the decision to start Desiree tonight.  
COACH BUDKE: She has been practicing really well and we know when we get in
the tournament Andrea won't be there and we wanted to give her looks in front
of the big lights here and see how she responded to be honest with you. I
thought she did fine, I thought she did fine, I thought she hustled and I
thought she did her part tonight.  
  
Q. Kurt, I don't know how many players you had in uniform, but it looked
like you were going to have to play 'em all tonight. Is it possible that
you're going for four games in four days?  
COACH BUDKE: Absolutely, whether it's for one possession, two possessions,
whether it may be a defensive stop, whatever it may be and it might turn into
more and I thought Carolyn Blair-Mobley was a great example tonight. She
didn't play at all hardly until we needed her at the end and I was going to
throw her in for a couple of possessions and she hits a 3, she picks up
defensively on the full court, did a great job, and I just think where we got
better over the last ten games is the fact that the bench players have
practiced harder and they've gotten better in practice every day and I think
we're going to need 'em all. If you're going to win four games in four days
you're going to need 'em all.  
  
Q. Coach, how much time have you spent thinking about how you will get
through an NCAA game without Andrea on the floor?  
COACH BUDKE: Not at all. I'm sitting at home tonight watching tape and it
crosses my mind, I'm not going to lie to you but it's more about our season
here and advancing and, you know, when that time comes, whenever it is after
this weekend we'll go back, go to work and find a way to get it done.  
  
Q. Coach, despite your zone defense Carolyn Davis was still getting points,
what do you think she was doing to get around that?  
COACH BUDKE: She's an incredible player, and obviously after she scored 20 of
'em, we knew she was in the house! We tried four different looks and we
switched up zones and I don't know if it confused 'em but it stalled 'em for a
little while and gave us a chance once we went down 49-47 we switched up to a
half-court trap and showed a different look. She's going to have a great
career.  
  
Q. Coach, now that Andrea has tied the Big 12 record, how do you find the
balance of honoring that accomplishment and have her appreciate what she's
done?  
COACH BUDKE: That will all come at the end of the year. I'm just glad that the
first points she scores breaks it, tomorrow, is that right? So she doesn't
have to break it, because now she's very aware of it thanks to y'all, and I'm
glad that first point will be done and she can relax and play. We gave her a
really nice trophy at the last home game and left it blank as far as the
number that's at the end of it, and we'll definitely have a celebration when
it's all done.  
  
Q. Coach, Kansas had a season high 34 defensive rebounds tonight. How were
you able to overcome that?  
COACH BUDKE: The rebound finished tied 47-all, and I thought Kansas the last
half of the year really adjusted to Danielle McCray being gone and I think
they've been playing good basketball. You know, look at their scores where
they had Nebraska beat for 38 minutes, had Iowa State beat for 39 minutes,
this has been a team thanks to the freshmen and the others that were left that
has stepped up.  
Normally when we win the rebounding war we win so it was tied tonight and it
was definitely going to be a close game, we just happened to make a few more
shots I thought they played a really great game, give 'em a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Kurt I thought you might have said this the other day, if not I
apologize, but you said something about the fact that Andrea, some of other
biggest points have come at crunch time and that is one of the biggest parts
of her legacy, that happened tonight. Talk about her down the stretch.  
COACH BUDKE: I really, truly said it a lot lately and I mean it, her field
goal percentage goes up the last 3 minutes of a game, she is a lot like Kobe,
he goes out and wins games, and that's Andrea Riley she is going to hit a shot
that y'all think as fans she shouldn't shoot, but it goes in, when it's in her
hands, we feel like we've got a chance to win because a lot of our offense is
created off her penetration.  
I don't know what she had assistwise, tonight, should have about a dozen,
because we missed a lot of wide-open shots tonight that she delivered great
passes. I don't know what her range is, maybe the half-court line. To us she
is the M.V.P. of the conference, there is nobody more valuable to a team.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll see you tomorrow.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Texas Longhorns  64  
Missouri - 59

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Cindy Stein and her two student athletes,
Amanda Hanneman and RaeShara Brown. Coach your comments about this afternoon's
game?  
COACH STEIN: I think that the physicality and size of Texas A&M wore us down,
I thought our kids played a good game, took care of the ball, all those things
you wanted to do, their second-chance points hurt us in the long run and their
size and physicality, they're a terrific team, but their size is a lot to
handle, and I think that was something we couldn't overcome today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student athletes first? Can you guys talk
about emotions today going into the game and finishing the game?  
RAESHARA BROWN: We were excited to get a second chance, Big 12 tournament
everybody is in the same boat, getting a second chance you wanted to take the
first game and go as far as we could and unfortunately we fell short. After
the game a loss is never good, you know, you never want to end a season on
anything like that so I think everybody is taking it hard for our seniors, I
hate it for them and but like I say, even though it's her last game she went
out with a heck of a game and I commend her on that.  
AMANDA HANNEMAN: I agree with Rae, we came off the win and were trying to give
it all we got and we had nothing to lose and we gave it our all and we just
couldn't finish.  
  
Q. Amanda, you were on fire today. Can you talk about when that first one
goes down? Just talk about your day.  
AMANDA HANNEMAN: I don't know, when you're a shooter like me, when the first
one goes down it's always a good thing. I just kept telling myself you're
going to make 'em today. I just got told by the Texas A&M coach that he was 0
for 25 on road games, so today I just wanted it to be like a home game.  
  
Q. It was a home game for ya?  
AMANDA HANNEMAN: Basically, yes.  
  
Q. Amanda, just such a great game but going off the floor, walking off the
final time what are the emotions going through your head? Is it hard to
believe?  
AMANDA HANNEMAN: Walking off the court you can't help but think this is the
last time I'm going to be walking off the basketball court. I wish it would
have been a win at the time, but no regrets, I came out in this game with no
regrets and that's what I wanted to do, just give my all and that's what
happened.  
  
Q. Amanda, I can't think of too many players that have battled back from
every possible physical ailment the way that you have. Can you talk about what
you feel like you've shown to your teammates about being resilient like
that?  
AMANDA HANNEMAN: Resilient is such a good word, me and my mom love that word
and it's being able to bounce back from anything, expect the unexpected, what
Coach Stein has always told me and even my trainers told me "I think you're
going to make it" your body you don't know if you're going to hold up and
sometimes you have to play with pain and it's how bad you want it and I love
this game and I'm going to get through things no matter what is going on with
my body.  
  
Q. Rae, you're going to be in a transition now with the coaching change. I
wanted to know your thoughts on your last game for Coach Stein and how you see
the future and Amanda, reflect on -- I know you guys wanted to play hard
today.  
RAESHARA BROWN: We thank Coach Stein for everything she's done for us, she has
taught us a lot, she has gotten us individuals through our battles. You never
know what to expect when you're going to get a new coach, you've got to go out
in the off season and for myself, improve myself first and in that transition
focus on improving my team, you know?  
It's going to be new but we're going to have to embrace it and hopefully we
come in and we have a great, great year next year.  
AMANDA HANNEMAN: Coach Stein gave us a speech, don't do it for her, and we did
it for her and ourselves at the same time. But it's one of those things like
it's hard when you're losing seniors and a coach at the same time, so I wish
the best of will you be for all the girls next year and I know they will do so
great. Just one of those things.  
  
Q. Amanda, are you excited to get back on the golf course?  
AMANDA HANNEMAN: I'm looking forward to playing golf and it's one of those
things that you can never stop playing. So yes, I will still play, probably
with Coach Stein.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Coach Stein, first question?  
COACH STEIN: I thought I was going to get out easy.  
THE MODERATOR: No, doesn't work that way!  
  
Q. Okay, now, has it sunk in, just your thoughts on walkin' off that
court?  
COACH STEIN: I guess I don't look at it like that. It's hard because I love
'em, but I guess I don't feel like it's something like I'm never going to have
contact with them again. Obviously there is going to be a new coach and you've
got to have your distance, but they know I care about every single one of 'em.
I know our Mississippi staff knows that I care about every single one of 'em
and I don't think it's going to be the last time I talked to them because I
love everybody to death, they're great.  
We've got very good relationships and it's just one of those things. I feel
like sometimes you've got to go on a different journey, but I think our paths
will always cross. I think there are so many tremendous people -- I don't look
at it that all of the sudden it's ending where it's like I don't have any
contact. I know the professional part of you've got to let somebody else have
the team and obviously that will be the hardest part, but at the same time I
want everybody to succeed. And that's my strongest thing is I want them to
succeed. Nothing else really matters from that.  
  
Q. Did this feel like a game that could go either way, did your players kind
of check out early or they could have played inspired and how do you feel it
played out?  
COACH STEIN: I felt like the last couple of days I think have been tough days,
motivating and the internal process of getting everybody ready to go, being
technical and detailed and doing what you need to do. It's easy is not to be
pumped up, it's easy to be down. I think you have a group of people that were
down and it was a mixture and there are all these -- you've got 14 girls, I
mean it's a whole range of emotions. On a different day it could be different
with all of them.  
We've kind of fought through that and really didn't know exactly how we would
respond as a unit but in the last two days we've talked about the things that
it takes to be successful and you've got to stay on the positive side and
you've got to stay together and all those things and sometimes life kicks you
in the teeth and we've got to keep standin' up and going after things and not
giving up.  
I thought they fought extremely hard today. I'm extremely proud of them. I
didn't think we always did everything right but I thought they fought
extremely hard. Texas A&M is a good team, you know? They did all the things
they needed to win. It came down to those last possessions, we've got to
score, we've got to score and we struggled all year on that.  
  
Q. You said a couple weeks ago you had to quit looking at e-mails because of
the well-wishers and all that. In the two weeks in between, did you get back
to that, or did you want to put that off until the season was done?  
COACH STEIN: Well, it's tough because everyone wants to know what you're going
to do and you want to finish out the season. You know what I try to do is
obviously people that send you e-mails you want to respond and say "thank you"
but you don't get wrapped into that emotion because you're still in game mode.
I'm sure this stuff is going to hit me sometime, but the love that I have for
the University of Missouri and those kids outweigh anything, and I still have
that. I may not have this job, but I still have that.  
  
Q. Cindy, there was some certainty about the situations, some of these
situations end up where you don't know the last game of the season what's
going to happen. Do you feel like it ended differently because everybody
knew?  
COACH STEIN: I'm not sure. I don't think there is ever a good time to announce
it. It may have been weighing on everybody's mind because we were losing but
it's the finality of saying it and that's what hits your team. They may have
thought of that but they were having so many people ask them and like I said
before the matter of announcing it at that time was I wanted the kids to hear
it from me. I don't want them to read it in the paper or some reporter to be
the one to break the story. They're going to hear it from me. Nothing against
y'all, but that's the way I wanted it. So it was gettin' too close to that
point, and like I said I wanted to have that communication come from me. At
that time, it was the best time.  
  
Q. Cindy, now I guess can you talk about what you think comes next? Also how
do you feel like you grew and changed as a coach in the decade plus that
you've been at Missouri?  
COACH STEIN: What comes next for myself? Honestly, I don't know. Everyone has
asked me that. I love coaching, you know, and I've talked about maybe it's the
time if I want to go administration wise. I have such a passion for sports and
that's where I go, I have a great passion for sports, I love athletics, so
it's -- I don't know if it's anything I could ever get out of or do something
else but my thought process in this period I'm going to listen, I've had
people make calls and want to know if I would be interested in this or that,
and honestly I've told everybody that I want to take time, see what comes
across, take time and obviously, you know. I feel like I've been so focused on
this year I need to take a step back and see where my next journey needs to
be.  
  
Q. We've talked about all of the struggles that Amanda has gone through, the
physical stuff, the crazy stuff that was going on this season. How good is it
even though it wasn't a victory to see Amanda finish up with a good strong
game scoring points today and hitting her shots?  
COACH STEIN: Well, it's awesome and the thing with Amanda was and I just told
her this week, she's fightin' off a stress fracture, she's been battling that
probably for the last two and a half weeks, and so I've talked to her about
it. She's been hitting, so maybe she plays better hurt, but to see her come
out like that, being from blue springs, especially in Kansas City, and she
brings so much to the team with her energy and positive attitude and she's a
great role model for these guys and when you have a senior go out like that
that's an excellent way to do it.  
  
Q. Cindy, what was the scene afterwards in the locker room? Was it less
emotional than you would have thought, more emotional? And what did you tell
the team, don't cry for me or what did you tell the team? (Laughter.)  
COACH STEIN: No, what I told the team was the fact that I'll always be there
for them, I love 'em to death. It's the end of their season so it's not just
about me, you've got four kids in there that have now played the last of their
collegiate career, but it's more of they know I'll do anything to help them
and we talked about what it takes obviously from here on out for all of them
individually. Just what they've learned from this long season of constant
losses and real close and then close again, sometimes that's life and life
isn't always fair but you've got to keep gettin' up and getting dressed every
day and try and have a positive spirit because negativity is for losers.  
If they want to be successful and offensively them are capable of it, that's
what they've got to do. We try to end on a positive, hugged all of them.
They're going to be heading back to Kansas City. I'm going to go grab a beer
and we'll go from there.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks very much. We appreciate it. Good luck to you.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Connecticut  60  
West Virginia - 32

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open right for questions, please, first for the student
athletes.  
  
Q. This is for Liz. In many ways this game seemed to resemble the first game
you played against Connecticut earlier this year where it seemed like for 15
or 20 minutes, a little longer, you guys were in it and all of a sudden in the
blink of an eye the gad widened. Would you agree with that assessment?  
LIZ REPELLA: Yeah, definitely. I mean, we just had breakdowns on defense,
offense, and you can't have those breakdowns in play with UConn.  
  
Q. Asya, could you just go through the defensive job you had with Tina
Charles and kind of what you felt? You pushed her away from the basket quite a
bit.  
ASYA BUSSIE: Yeah, we played off a little bit, just being a helpful style a
little bit more and just living with that shot that she's going to see.  
  
Q. Liz and Sarah, can you talk about the job that you did on Maya Moore and
Tina Charles for that first 25 minutes at least when they were 4 for 17, 4 for
13? What was it you were doing that was affecting them?  
LIZ REPELLA: We were playing our regular defense, like Asya said, with Tina
Charles. We were backing away from her when she got it on the foul line so she
could help with the cuts and stuff. Defensively we got up the lanes a little
bit and just kept them in front of us and made them shoot tough shots.  
  
Q. This could be for any of you. Did they do anything defensively to shut
down the offense, or what happened that you went from closing the gap to sort
of no offensive production?  
LIZ REPELLA: Yeah, we have had offensive droughts a lot this season, and they
really exposed it tonight. I mean, we weren't picking. We were just stagnant.  
  
Q. Sarah, they have a habit of taking the top scorers of teams out of play.
They did it to Diggins in the second half last night to get to this game, and
your stats seemed to indicate that they had a pretty good time shutting you
down today. Can you just talk about your game and what they did to you? Did
they surprise you, come at you in a different way?  
SARAH MILES: No, I felt I got a lot of good looks, but I just couldn't get
them to fall. I think that had a lot to do with me, I couldn't get my shots to
fall. But I did get a lot of good looks. That's pretty much it.  
  
Q. Obviously, Liz, a difficult loss tonight, but postseason, I mean, really
gets going now. What does this team -- are you confident that this team can
put this behind and look towards a new season really with NCAA starting?  
LIZ REPELLA: Yeah, definitely, I mean, we have to. We're going to have a few
days off, and then we're going to start getting after it in practice. I mean,
we still have a lot of goals to accomplish, and just this one loss isn't going
to -- I mean, we're going to come back out ready to play tournament time, no
doubt about it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. From the 12-minute mark -- I think it was the 12-minute mark until like
24 seconds left or something when you got the lay-up, you guys didn't score,
so it's like 12 minutes you didn't get a basket. Talk about what was going
wrong, and how much of it was what Connecticut was doing and their intensity
and stuff.  
COACH CAREY: Well, all eight of them did a pretty good job on defense, first
of all. You know, like Sarah, a question was asked about Sarah, she got in the
paint at will, just didn't hit her shots. We had some open looks. We just
didn't -- and Liz was right; we were stagnant. We were so stagnant on offense.
And then when we did drive, we just didn't get the call or float it up there
and missed the easy shot. Needless to say, we haven't scored all tournament,
you know what I mean? And give Connecticut credit, too; they played great
defense, great help defense, and big and strong, physical.  
  
Q. It seemed a little different than the last time. They made a run early
and you guys actually answered it and cut it to that five-point margin. Do you
take a positive out of that, that you guys didn't quit once you were down
big?  
COACH CAREY: We cut it to five, and then we had a couple bad shots. They got a
couple offensive rebounds and a three-point play and that type of stuff. Then
the game got very, very physical, and we're not going to win that battle with
them. They're just too big and strong. It just got very, very physical. I'm
just glad nobody got hurt at the end.  
  
Q. Just to reiterate, the strategy with Tina and Maya; what was the overall
plan?  
COACH CAREY: Well, in the high post we were just going to back off her, and
she hit two or three there, because there was a lot of times during the course
of the game she wouldn't take that shot. Even though we just felt they threw
over the top on us and back-doored us so much our first game with them we
thought we would back off and put Bussie in the paint a little bit.  
Even if they used Tina for an on-ball pick, we'd go over the top and Bussie
would be standing there. It worked some of the time. But make no doubt about
it, they're a great team, and they deserve every award and everything they
get. Great team.  
  
Q. What is it going to take to beat this team?  
COACH CAREY: Well, I just think -- we held them to 60 points. You just want to
score with them. If you can hold Connecticut to 60 points with all the players
they have and people that can score and all that, you should be in the game.
We struggled to score, and I just think somebody is going to have to score
with them, I really do.  
  
Q. You've had such a great season, really, except for the two games against
Connecticut. Is it good for the mindset of the team to go into the NCAAs
having played them, or would you have rather not they had the experience
heading into the tournament?  
COACH CAREY: No, I think it's great. We'll have some great practices coming up
after film session. You know, it'll be great practices.  
I said to the team, I said, they exposed every weakness we had. Those are
things we need to work on going into the NCAA Tournament. You know, after you
get beat like this, you have their attention real quick when it comes to
practice, when you come back to practice.  
  
Q. Do you have any idea -- you may not play for another nine days or so, so
just a general idea of what you have planned until then.  
COACH CAREY: I'm giving them three days off. We've got a couple people banged
up and that, and they need it off. They need away from me and I need away from
them, so three days will be good for everybody concerned. Then we've got to
come back and get back to basics and fundamentals and that type of stuff.
We've got a lot to work on. We're going into the postseason. We need to win
some games, so we've got to get prepared and ready.  
Somebody asked the question do we think the girls will come back from it.
Absolutely. We bounced back when Connecticut thumped us last time and came
back and won eight, nine, ten in a row. These girls are hard workers. We'll
learn from this again tonight.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what Kalana Greene brings to this UConn team?
Most people think you stop Charles and stop Moore and you're going to stop
them and then she steps up.  
COACH CAREY: She's been a great player. She's to me always been the blue
collar worker on this team. She did a great job. She gets on the offensive
boards. She played defense. She drives on the floor. She complements the
others very, very well.  
She's just a great player. But she accepts her role, and Geno has got her
accepting her role. When the other two are struggling or other people are
struggling, she steps up, and she has the capability of doing that every
night.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Connecticut  60  
West Virginia - 32

  
THE MODERATOR: Let's start with questions for our players.  
  
Q. Kalana, can you talk about the extra gear you guys seemed to find? There
was like 33-29 or something, and you went on like a 27 to 3 run to end the
game. Talk about that. It seemed like you just picked up the intensity and
everything else. Talk about finding that extra gear there.  
KALANA GREENE: We just wanted to keep playing defense. Our defense was pretty
good the entire game. We were not having a great offensive night, so you know
you can rely on defense. I think we got key stops and dominated the boards
tonight.  
Tina started hitting a lot of big shots at the end, and that's what we need.
She got her confidence back, and people made plays when they needed to make
them.  
  
Q. Kalana, a lot has been made this weekend about the winning streak, but
this is what you really wanted, a championship. Talk about what it means to
get this championship now.  
KALANA GREENE: Yeah, we have a lot of miniature goals during the entire
season, and every championship that's thrown at us, we want to win it. The
streak doesn't really matter to us because we can win, what is it, 71 games
and to not win the Big East Championship and it won't feel like anything.  
Tonight we could have gone -- won 71 games, lose tonight and it wouldn't have
the same feeling, so we wanted to finish off the right way, especially our
last game as seniors in Hartford. I think this is one more step into the main
goal.  
  
Q. Kalana, you've already had a pretty remarkable season, and to top it off
by being the most outstanding player in the Big East Tournament, can you just
talk about how that fits in with everything else that's gone on for you this
year?  
KALANA GREENE: I think this year I brought a different approach in practice,
and it prepared me for games. I mean, tonight in this whole tournament I just
wanted to come in and just help my team win in whichever way possible,
rebound, play defense, and knock in a couple shots. I just wanted to play hard
and just leave it all on the floor and build a lot of momentum going into the
tournament.  
  
Q. Maya, whatever WV cut the deficit at the end of the first half and then
at the beginning of the second half, what were they doing different and what
were some of the emotions running through you guys' heads?  
MAYA MOORE: I think they did a great job of trying to speed us up, trying to
get us out of our rhythm offensively. It took us a little bit to get back in
it. When we made our run, I feel like we were finally playing together,
finding each other, hitting back doors, hustle plays. We have to do a better
job of handling other teams trying to speed us up because I think that is one
area where it can mess up any team if you go too fast and don't handle the
defense.  
  
Q. Tina, you spent a lot of the game it seemed like alone at the top of the
key with the ball in your hand. They were laying off of you and trying to dare
you to shoot or do something with the ball. I don't recall another game where
you were put in that position so often. Did it surprise you, and what did you
-- how do you think you did in that situation?  
TINA CHARLES: It wasn't really surprising because Coach just prepares us for
every situation. He always tells me I'm going to get doubled and triple-teamed
and everything like that, and throughout the whole tournament all I've been
doing is posting up and trying to dominate. So the fact that I was open and
they were giving me the shot, it wasn't surprising. I just had to knock it
down.  
  
Q. Maya, 72 down, six more to go. You had sort of an off-night tonight.
Tina's free-throws were pretty tough tonight. Do you have any concerns going
forward or do you think the defense will be able to carry you all the way?  
MAYA MOORE: I'm not worried. You know, this is a tough part of the year. A Big
East Tournament, you're playing the best teams in the Big East back to back to
back, and it's not necessarily going to be easy. It's going to be hard. I
think we can take away a lot of good things from this tournament, and we found
out some things about ourselves and some things that we need to fine-tune and
work on. We're going to overcome those things just like we have everything
else this year.  
  
Q. For either Tina or Maya, when you were struggling to find your shot and
when Tina is double-teamed down there, how great is it to see Kalana come to
the rescue to keep you guys in front?  
MAYA MOORE: She's great. She's a critical part of our team. She can do a lot
of different things on the court. When she's coming in offensive rebounding
playing tough defense, she's stepping up and being that constant leader for us
by example. Kalana is kind of like our safety net. She sometimes doesn't get
the credit she deserves, and it's just great that she's being recognized for
all the intangibles that she brings to our team.  
  
Q. This is for any of the players. Obviously, you work all year in practice
for conditioning purposes and for everything else. Have any of you ever felt
fatigue in a game? Did you feel it tonight? And do you ever have that
experience where your legs are tired?  
KALANA GREENE: I think you're mostly tired mentally more than anything.
Physically you're always going to be tired. You practice every day, and I
think practices are harder than games for the most part. So playing three
games back to back is not necessarily that hard compared to practice
sometimes. But I think when you get tired mentally, that's when you need your
teammates to help you pick it up and get out of that funk.  
For us, tired is a state of mind. We try never to be tired, keep good body
language, and not show the other team that you're tired because that's when
you see a weakness. When we see other teams are tired, we got at them even
harder when they're tired. You never want to show other teams if you're
fatigued or tired.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the defense. You held them to 32 which I think is
the lowest in a championship game. You guys have been an unbelievable
defensive team. Talk about how that helped carry you through games when
offense isn't there.  
MAYA MOORE: Yeah, our defense has to be there, because as we've seen the past
couple days, we are capable of missing a lot of shots. Hopefully we won't miss
as many as we have the past couple days, but if that happens, we have to be
able to rely on our defense and not let the other team score, and I thought we
did a really great job tonight of communicating, knowing where they wanted to
go with the ball and trying to stop that and playing really good team defense.  
If they got in the lane, Tina was there to block a shot and just carry in the
rebound. And our defense triggers our offense. You know, we can get stops like
that and gives us momentum and it's a big part of us being an offensive team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about what Maya said basically, Kalana as the
safety net? This was her second double-double of the year, but she picked a
heck of a time to come up and play well tonight.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, every game that we go into, we understand how difficult
it's going to be for us to just get Maya and Tina whatever shots they want. I
mean, the better the teams you play against, the more difficult it's going to
be to get your two best players open shots. That's why they're good teams.  
So somebody has to step up and make plays, and I thought all year long Kalana
has been really consistent in providing -- whether it's a defensive spurt or
an offensive spurt or a rebounding spurt, there's been numerous times where
she's provided that whatever it seemed like we needed at that time.  
We really, really harped on the rebounding thing. After yesterday's game that
was a really huge point of emphasis today, and I thought that second half it
seemed like every shot we missed, she was offensive rebounding it.  
I think she's developed into a real trustworthy player, you know, more so than
any other time in her career. And it couldn't happen to a nicer kid at a
better time.  
  
Q. If I can just follow up on the question about fatigue that I asked your
players, have you seen any signs of it in your team here in the 33rd game this
season? Do you sense that they go through spurts where it's a little harder
for them to do things than they might normally be, and when you see that, what
do you try to do about it on the fly?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think if there was any fatigue, it shows up on the defensive
end, you know, and I haven't seen that the last two games. I think Tina --
Kalana was right. I think where it gets you is mentally, the wear and tear of
the games and having to concentrate on the offensive end. That's where it
shows up sometimes mentally. Their legs and their ability to play, I haven't
seen it on the defensive end, and on the offensive end, it can show up.  
At this time of the year I don't know any team that isn't dealing with that,
to be honest with you. I mean, I think every team in the country at this time
of year especially, you know, if you've invested as much time or as much
effort as we have on the defensive end throughout the season, but I didn't see
any signs of it on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Given the premium you place on defense, are you able to appreciate the
way West Virginia plays, their tenacity, and do you feel like they'll be a
tough out for anyone in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. Obviously we know them, they know us, but when they get
in the tournament and you haven't played against them, you're going to be in
for a rough night. They have good defenders at every position, and they're
very physical at every position, and they make it very difficult for you to
get the shots you want. You're going to have to make plays against them.  
You're not going to be able to just run stuff and say, Well, we're going to be
able to score this way. You're going to have to create against them, and if
you can't do that -- you saw what they've done the last three nights. They
took a pretty good offensive team against DePaul. DePaul is a pretty good
offensive team and they shut them down and they shut down Rutgers yesterday
and essentially did the same thing to us in some ways.  
Yeah, I wouldn't want to play them in the NCAA Tournament, no way.  
  
Q. Earlier today you told ESPN that it didn't bother you at all that
Tennessee wasn't one of the 41 teams that was involved in the streak. But
going forward in the NCAA Tournament, would you like to bump into them? Would
you like to get that as part of this whole two years' experience?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't look forward to playing any team or not playing any
team. You know, if they're in our bracket, we'll have to play them hopefully.
If they're not, you know, we're going to start the NCAA Tournament trying to
win the National Championship, and we're going to have to play whoever is in
our way to get there. If it's them, great; if it's not, I'm not going to lose
any sleep over it either way.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the streak of winning three straight here in the Big
East Championship? I mean, that must mean something I would think to you to
win three in a row.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. You know, usually the best team wins this tournament, so
if you've got the best team going in, you'll usually find that they're going
to win the tournament. I think we've had the best team the last couple of
years.  
The players expect to win this tournament, and maybe that's why we've won it
now as many times as we have, because there's no sense ever of not winning it.
It doesn't matter what year, it doesn't matter who's on the team, doesn't
matter where it is.  
I know there's some teams in our league, they bitch and moan with the
tournaments here; it's not at a neutral site. I would hope it would be at a
neutral site some day. I think that would be pretty cool. I think you get more
calls at a neutral site. I don't think you get as many calls when you're at
home. Same with the NCAA Tournament; when you play NCAA Tournament games at
home, you don't get calls. They figure you're already at home; you don't need
any calls.  
So I think our players come here expecting to win the tournament every year.
They expect to be in The Finals. They expect to win it. I think we had a
stretch where I think we won it like eight or nine years in a row or something
like that. But to do it now with the quality of teams that we have in our
league, I mean, we had to beat two top-ten teams. We might not play two teams
as good as Notre Dame and West Virginia in the first two rounds of the -- in
the first four games if we're lucky enough to get that far of the NCAA
Tournament.  
It's always a huge sense of accomplishment when you can win our league,
especially now. Maybe not as much back in the day, but especially now, because
of who's involved, who you have to beat.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

West Virginia  56  
Rutgers - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We will open first with questions for our student athletes,
please.  
  
Q. Chelsey, at the end of the half there you guys had the picked-off
inbounds, pass and everything. How much did that raise the emotions of the
team heading into the locker room, and what happened in the second half that
you guys fell off?  
CHELSEY LEE: It definitely did help the momentum, but coming out second half
we always tell ourselves that the score is 0-0 or we're down by 10 so we come
out with more of a fight. But I think we sort of lost our heads a little bit,
and they made a couple of good runs, and they got hyped and they fed off of
it, and we just couldn't recover.  
  
Q. Late in the second half after West Virginia went on the 12-0 run, you
guys turned around and put on a good press. What was going on there? What was
the main goal of the press and how did it inspire you guys knowing you were
getting closer and closer?  
KHADIJAH RUSHDAN: We always play with fight, you know, and I think that our 55
is what shakes a lot of people up, and we usually go to that when we're down.
I think we did a good job when they broke it a couple times, which killed our
momentum a little bit. But for the most part that 55 really brought us back.  
  
Q. Monique, how do you feel going forward knowing Coach wants to play you in
crunch time this early in the season?  
MONIQUE OLIVER: I'm going out there trying to do the best I can to help the
team. So I'm trying to keep a cool head and knowing I need to help the team.  
  
Q. Di, it looked in the second half like you guys were down a little bit.
Last night you came back. Tonight you guys came up a little short. What do you
think the difference was between last night and tonight?  
KHADIJAH RUSHDAN: We had a couple breakdowns, just last like night. Me made
the runs and Coach always said teams are going to make their runs. As long as
you can make them, I think they went up 10 on us, we came back, they went up
10 again and we came back. We just fell a little short tonight, but I think we
did a good job of fighting.  
  
Q. Khadijah and Chelsey, despite the loss tonight, you have a run here that
probably puts you into the NCAA tournament. Can you talk about how your season
has gone?  
KHADIJAH RUSHDAN: I think we've picked it up, as Coach says, better late than
never, although it took us 31 games to get here. We made a really good run. I
believe a lot of people doubted us and didn't believe that we could actually
get this far.  
So I have faith in my teammates. We're praying and hopeful that we can get
into the NCAA tournament, and when we get back, we're just going to keep
working.  
  
Q. Khadijah, do you think at the end of everything, three nights, the double
overtime game, do you think at the end of the game tonight it just became too
much, that you guys were running low on energy?  
KHADIJAH RUSHDAN: Oh, no. The type of practices that we have, you know what I
mean, prepare us for situations like this, and we practice hard. We practice a
lot. So going into double overtime playing in this game, that's what we do,
and we love this. We love to play like this. We just fell a little short.  
  
Q. Chelsey, is there a sense of accomplishment from this trip?  
CHELSEY LEE: Definitely a lot of people thought we'd be going home after the
very first game, so it's great to see that we've come this far to play up
until now. But I just hope we get promised another 40 minutes. I believe if we
are promised another 40 minutes that we will make the best of it. It'll be in
our hands and our control to make sure we get it though.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Do you think they did anything specific to sort of contain Brittany
throughout the game and give her problems?  
COACH STRINGER: I thought they played as aggressive as they always do. It's an
outstanding team. But I thought that we were just really a little wound too
tight. I think that we all wanted to do better, especially Brittany and April.
But as a result, we were running, it was a lot of wasted energy because the
extra steps that we were talking about, going into the lane and screening and
coming back out, allowed us to calm down a lot more, and it happened the last
couple of minutes, but it was a little too late. We were getting on the lane
and trying to outrun it. You're not going to outrun anybody no matter what.
There were too many times we were on top of each other.  
I know what we need to do. We'll be okay. But Brittany had a tough time, and
she just needs to do a better job of freezing her cuts, and we need to do a
better job of screening. But I think she knows. She's so bright, I'm sure
she'll take the tapes back and look at it and know what she needs to do. But
all credit to West Virginia; they did a great job.  
  
Q. Coach, Mo had I believe 29 in three nights here. How important, I guess,
will her ability just to score off the bench be for you guys if you're in the
tournament, just her efficiency, I guess?  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah, Mo is efficient. She has been offensively efficient. Can
you imagine how much better she's going to be when she knows when she's
supposed to go, because she really doesn't. She knows the vast majority of the
things, but believe me, there's a whole lot of things -- and when we start
looking a little confused, it's because there's a lot of stuff coming at her.  
But I'm extremely proud of her. She rebounds hard. She makes great passes.
She's the best passer on the team. I mean really, when you consider guards or
post, she's an outstanding passer, and she has a high percentage of
conversions. If you foul her and one, she's going to be the person that's
going to get it done. I like her enthusiasm. I'm really high on her. She and
Chelsey are the future of our Scarlet Knight team.  
I'm glad that you made the statement actually that you did, because I don't
know that they understand how significant it is in a game of this magnitude
and to play someone in those last few minutes, then obviously I have a lot of
trust, a lot of trust. So I've got a job to do to make sure she knows all the
things that she's going to know because she's going to be major for us.  
  
Q. How hard is it for your team to win, however, if you don't get more
points out of Brittany, just given how you're made up? I think you did it last
night, but it's got to be tough for you guys.  
COACH STRINGER: Yeah, it's real tough. You know, let me say this, though: It
doesn't just have to come from Brittany. I think it's a bit much, because you
have to consider that Brittany is not a kind of shooter that manufactures her
shots. She's not getting away from anybody. So unless she sets shots up and
screens up -- that's why I said that. Unless she sets screens up better and
unless we screen -- but she's got to do her first part. She knows. She just
got anxious. When that happens -- it's not going to happen. We've got two
parts to this.  
If we can get April to shoot, then that'll take a whole heck of a lot of
pressure off Brittany. If I can get Erica to calm down, because Erica helps
out there on the floor. Brittany, Di, those guys were tired. The point guard,
Miles, that was running that cut, if you consider that we were playing in that
double overtime, that should have never happened. But in order to break that
cut so Miles doesn't get it, you have to have wings on your feet as well.  
And we were a step slow on that, and that's where it showed up. When it kept
coming like that, it wouldn't normally happen. They turned the ball over a
heck of a lot more at West Virginia when we did not play two or three games
back to back. But I think that there are three people more that can make a big
difference, and we're going to do everything that we can to at least get one
of those three to show up in a consistent way. And I think that that'll do a
lot to relieve the pressure from Brittany.  
  
Q. Wherever you find out, wherever you land on selection Monday, I guess,
what have the past three games taught you about this team that I guess you
didn't know before you came up to the tournament?  
COACH STRINGER: I think that I didn't know that it mattered as much as it
does. They're not a very emotional team. I think sometimes when a team has a
lot of talent, I'll tend to be more of a motivator, someone who just gets them
up, especially against the great games, and I say the great games, when you're
going to play the No. 1 or No. 2, and it just takes you to believe that you
have the talents that are there.  
This team, probably top to bottom, doesn't have anywhere near the same level
of talent and experience. But knowing that, what I was much more concerned
about was where our heart was. But they're not as expressive as a lot of
teams. You're not going to see Brittany -- like I was asking her about why she
didn't get the ball as much, and I was saying you're probably in the corner
saying pass me the ball, pass me the ball, really soft, and someone else was
saying -- Mat Matee, she would have been calling for the ball. With that said,
it's just a softer team.  
But I was so proud of the way they stepped up to see how much it meant because
a lesser team would have given up last night. A lesser team would have given
up. But they never stopped, and I hear them saying the words, what it means to
be a Scarlet Knight, and to finally understand. We had a game I guess against
Syracuse and several players that I've coached before had a few choice words
for the players as they watched that game that was beyond what I can even
explain to this day.  
But I think that they understood that, you know what, there's a lot of people
who wear the scarlet and white, and it means a lot to be a fighter, and that's
what we've been. So you can never count us out.  
It's worth its weight in gold to me, because as I was sharing with the team,
for the next four years, Erica is going to remember this and Mo is going to
remember this, so the next time we're having new people coming in, they're
going to know and be able to say with certainty this is what it means to be a
Scarlet Knight. I'm really proud of them, and I just believe that it's a
symptom of a lot of good things to come.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

West Virginia  56  
Rutgers - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please.  
COACH CAREY: Well, I thought, first of all, Rutgers, I thought they'd come out
after playing -- this is their third night in a row, come out and play
extremely hard. As a matter of fact, at the beginning they were beating us up
and down the floor, which was surprising to me, but they came out and played
extremely hard. She had them ready to play and they did a great job.  
I thought Sarah Miles for the whole game did a great game for us, was playing
a speed higher than anybody else. I also thought that Asya Bussie in the
beginning, we were able to take the ball inside a little bit and get some
scores there.  
And in the end, I think when we were pressing, Sarah was breaking it and
making things happen at the other end. I don't know how many. We ended up with
15 -- how many turnovers, 15? Wow, I didn't think we had that many, but we
did.  
But I thought in the end we hit the foul shots we needed to hit and was able
to win the game. I thought we did a great job on Brittany Ray. I think the one
three she hit, we went into a zone and they skipped past and she hit a three,
so I thought we were where she was all night.  
  
Q. Sarah, can you just talk about what you guys did against their press late
after you made that run and then they started pressing and getting back into
it?  
SARAH MILES: We were just trying to get the ball to the middle and break the
press and slow it down and try to set up because we didn't have the lead, so
we weren't trying to speed the game up to their tempo because that's why they
were pressing us to get the game going faster, so we were trying to break it
and slow the game down to our tempo since we had the lead.  
  
Q. Korinne, you guys, it was a close game, and you made like a 10-0 run
maybe at about 15-minute mark. Can you talk about what was going on and how
you were able to do that?  
KORINNE CAMPBELL: Well, Coach said we had to add to our lead, and we all just
went out there and executed on offense and got a few steals on defense and
just pushed it, and that didn't give them enough time to set up in their
press, and that gave us enough time to get shots off that were high-percentage
shots.  
  
Q. Sarah, your thoughts on playing UConn tomorrow? You guys lost on this
court to them in the regular season. What do you have to do to try to make
that championship yours?  
SARAH MILES: My thoughts on playing UConn is just going into this game like
any other game, playing against UConn like any other team. We're not going to
look at them like they're UConn. Yeah, they're undefeated, but it's just
another game.  
  
Q. Liz, how rough was that at the end of the half with the two quick lay-ups
to tie? How tough was that for the team going into the locker room?  
LIZ REPELLA: Yeah, I was dreading going into the locker room. Yeah, we just --
I think that might have gave us a little edge coming into the second half
because we really wanted to get after it after those quick points and we
wanted to come back with a lot more intensity. They played for three nights,
and they were beating us on the floor, and that's no excuse. We just wanted to
run, and I think we did a good job in the second half with that.  
  
Q. Korinne, being a New Jersey native, I know this is the last team that you
wanted to see knock you out of this tournament. How personal was it for you
there in the second half? It seemed like you really picked it up there in
particular.  
KORINNE CAMPBELL: I really didn't take it exactly personal. It was just, we
have to win this game. It adds to our résumé. We need this game. We want a
good seed in the NCAA, and I think that just motivated me and the team to just
score and play defense.  
  
Q. Liz, can you just talk about the challenge tomorrow? I mean, obviously
UConn won by a lot of points in the first meeting, and can you just discuss
what you have to do tomorrow and what your mindset is going in?  
LIZ REPELLA: Yeah. They're a great team, no doubt about it. The first time we
played them, we played them good for 25 minutes, and you can't play good for
25 minutes against UConn and expect to win or even keep it close. So going
into tomorrow we all know we have to play for 40 minutes, and that's what
we're going to concentrate on.  
  
Q. Sarah, midway through the second half you inbounded the ball and you had
this look on your face and you were very determined and your team went on a
12-0 run. What was going through your mind at that point?  
SARAH MILES: No, not that I had to get it done and do it ourselves. I just
knew our shooters was having a tough night, so we had to find points another
way, so I just decided to step up myself and try to get the ball in the hole
tonight, so that's what I did.  
COACH CAREY: Let me just make a statement that when we made that 10-0 run
there, in the second half we made some adjustments and that's why Sarah freed
up so much because we just stuck our people that had the triangle on them out
and let them play three on three and isolate down low and let Sarah have
driving lanes and all that instead of getting them involved in the offense at
that time.  
I think that's when Asya scored a little bit, Korinne drove it, we took Madina
Ali out to give us a little more defense and Sarah was able to drive it
against their triangle two. It worked pretty well to give us that lead there
in the second half.  
  
Q. With this win, do you have any question that you're going to be probably
a three but maybe a two if you win tomorrow night?  
COACH CAREY: Well, we would hope if we finish second in the Big East we would
at least be a two. I would hope with 28 wins going into the championship game
in the Big East, if we're supposed to get the credit we should get and we're
playing in the Big East, we're the No. 2 seed and we're going to be
championship game, we should hopefully be a 2 seed.  
  
Q. But the people above you all won their championships, so that's a big
jump --  
COACH CAREY: Well, I'll still be disappointed if we're not.  
  
Q. You guys obviously have UConn tomorrow, and like she said, you guys
played them well for about 20, 25 minutes, and that's what Notre Dame did
tonight. Talk about the challenge of trying to play them well for 40 minutes
and what it's going to take to beat them.  
COACH CAREY: Well, Notre Dame played 2-3, sagged off on Tina and that worked
for a while. Then all of a sudden they started hitting their shots. Notre Dame
missed some and they started pushing a break and hitting some threes and
getting to the rim. And then Tina Charles, her and Maya are the best players
in the country, and it's going to be a tough challenge.  
Like the girls said, we were down eight at halftime here and cut it to six
during the first media break, then all of a sudden they made about three runs
and we're down 30. That's what UConn does.  
They're a great team. I told the girls after the game, We're going to come
tomorrow night to compete. We're not coming to just show up. As long as our
girls compete and play hard, then I'm going to be satisfied with that, win or
lose.  
Let's face it, nobody else has beat them, either. It's not like we're the only
one that hasn't beat them this year.  
  
Q. Mike, tomorrow against your co-coach of the year, should you end up
winning that game, any thoughts on you demanding that title for yourself?  
COACH CAREY: I win that game, I'm retiring, I think, myself after that game.
(Laughter).  
But they're a great team. Geno does a great job, and they're deserving of
everything they get, believe me. It's extremely hard, even though you have all
that talent, to come out and take everybody's best shot night in and night
out, and they do a great job at it.  
  
Q. Do you care to give us the PG version of what you had to say at the end
of the half when you gave up those two lay-ups?  
COACH CAREY: Well, I just thought we got lackadaisical. We didn't rotate back.
Sarah penetrated, and our two guard didn't rotate and gave up a lay-up and
then take it back and get lackadaisical and a girl up front gets a lay-up. So
we addressed those two plays at halftime.  
I think like Liz said, we did get them a little fired up, a little motivated,
and they were a little hungrier when they came out the second half.  
  
Q. I know we've discussed this probably pretty much all year, but Sarah
Miles, the kind of game-changer that she is, not just offensively but
defensively, sparking this team, and I know you were probably disappointed she
was not a first team all-Big East, but has she really shown some things,
especially coming here to this tournament and playing the way she has?  
COACH CAREY: A lot of people have to understand she was a 2 guard last year.
To convert to the point and do the job she's doing this year is unbelievable,
and we go as Sarah goes. Our girls really count on Sarah. They try to get her
the ball. They look for her to break the press. They look for her to set up
the offense, and they look for her to dictate our defense. She's the main
thing.  
Yesterday in DePaul's game when she got in foul trouble, I thought Akeema
Richards came in and maintained that a little bit, so that was good to see
Akeema come in yesterday and maintain.  
And push for us for a 2 seed, okay?

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

### [Skylar Diggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20547)

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Connecticut  59  
Notre Dame - 44

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement, please.  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I was really happy with our defense. I thought we did what
we needed to do, did what we wanted to do. I thought the second half Greene
hurt us a little bit, and that was kind of our game plan was to see if
somebody else could beat us besides Charles and Moore. We ended up giving her
some easy around-the-basket shots.  
I thought the three-point plays were really what hurt us. The momentum really
shifted. It was a ten-point game, and every time we had the ball, it seemed
like we had a chance to cut it to single digits, and then we weren't able to
score and then go down and have them get an and-one. It really knocked the
wind out of our sails a little bit and I thought really shifted the momentum
of the game.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about the first half against Connecticut, just what
was different for you guys, and particularly with the defensive intensity?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I thought we were really confident coming out. We wanted to
just make sure we came out intense, and we definitely showed our potential on
defense. We wanted to stay together and make sure that we played team defense.
That was a big key to the games today, and just make sure that we stay
together and really make sure that we tried to limit touches to Tina and just
really clog it up in the middle and see who else could go off -- who else
could get some points for them.  
  
Q. How were you able to come out with confidence when you had suffered
25-point and 24-point losses to Connecticut? How were you able to get that
mindset you needed?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Because we know we played God awful in those two games and we
didn't come out and play with the potential that we have. Today we played more
like ourselves. We played with a sense of urgency. We were more tenacious. We
really got in there and banged with them, and we didn't get punked this time.
We really were trying to stay mentally tough and trying to stay together, and
you know, we stuck with them and just -- they went on their run in the second
half, and we couldn't match it.  
  
Q. Ashley, does that give you some confidence knowing that you've played
them three times now and gotten better in a sense each game and you played
them really strong for the first 20 minutes?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: Yeah, like Sky said, we came out and we were intense and we had
confidence. We believed in ourselves, and we still believe in ourselves. We
know that we can come out and play with them, and we showed that today. Like
she said, also, we had a lapse there for just a split second, and that's what
hurt us.  
  
Q. For either one of you, you certainly had a lot of incentives on this
game, beating UConn and the Big East championship, but did the streak play any
motivating part in pregame?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I don't think so. I don't think that was our mindset coming
in. We just knew we got embarrassed the first two games. That was really what
we were looking at, and we wanted to play to our potential today. I think we
stuck around with them for 20 minutes.  
Like Bar said, we had little lapses in there. We know they're a great team. We
knew that they were going to come out in the second half, and we just tried to
stay with them. There were little lapses in between that kind of messed us up,
little turnovers, and then they went on transition and they scored off of them
and we couldn't score offensively for those spurts.  
But besides that I think our mindset was just to come out and just try to play
like it was any other game and just try to really be calm about it and just
play like ourselves and not try to get -- hold on -- try not to get too riled
up about their streak.  
  
Q. Ashley, only 11 turnovers against Connecticut. Can you comment on what
you guys did differently to protect the ball?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: Right, we were focused on running our sets. We were calm with
it. We were confident. We were confident with the ball, and that just helps us
out a lot. We worked on different things of how to get open and how to get
into our sets without -- with there being more than 10, 15 seconds on the
clock.  
So we were just confident in our ball handling and our ability to hang onto
the ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. You guys have one of the best -- I mean, the last 15 years, 10 to 15
years, you guys have been really good. But can you even fathom what 71 wins in
a row is or would be like?  
COACH McGRAW: No, I think it's an amazing accomplishment for them.  
  
Q. Was the difference defensively, was it strategic or was it a mindset on
the part of your team?  
COACH McGRAW: I think it was a little bit of everything. I think the mindset
was that we were trying to control the tempo. You know, we made a couple shots
early. That gave us a little bit of confidence, but I think the biggest thing
we did was we took care of the ball. At halftime -- I thought we only had four
turnovers in the first half, and that was key because they didn't get anything
going in transition.  
  
Q. How important is it that you guys put up a much better effort tonight
than the first three times you played them if you happen to meet them down the
road?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, you know, it was definitely a much different team that we
had in the first half, and I think that we still are not scoring. We still
only scored 44 points, and that still continues to be a problem for us. But
defensively it does give us a little bit of confidence in our defense. I
thought we did a pretty good job, little better job in the first half than the
second.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what you take overall from the tournament? You
had two nice wins and then a strong effort against Connecticut. How can this
springboard into the tournament?  
COACH McGRAW: I think we're starting to peak. I think it's a good thing. I
think we have -- we played really well at a lot of different times. I thought
the first game had a great finish against St. John's, did some great things, a
lot of highlights to take from the tournament.  
I was really pleased. I think we're getting smarter as a team. I think we're
doing some good things. I think our zone was really good. We played a lot of
zone this weekend. We've played a lot of man all year. So I was really happy
with it.  
  
Q. You had sort of referred to this, but there was a sequence in which I
think you were down by 10, Tina blocks a lot, and then it leads to a
transition basket in which she scores and makes a three-point play. You had
done a pretty good job on her the whole game. What's she so capable of doing
to sort of like explode like that?  
COACH McGRAW: I feel like she can do whatever she wants, you know. I think we
had a plan of trying to run down and double-team her, which she did a really
good job facing us, I thought, tonight. She faced up and shot over us, and we
had no plan for that. We had no answer for that. So she really did a good job
in that it got her to turn it over a little bit more. Boy, when she gets it
close to the rim, she's unstoppable.  
I thought they did a better job in the second half of spreading us out and she
was able to duck in and go one-on-one with the center rather than being on the
block and I thought that created some problems for us, too.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Connecticut  59  
Notre Dame - 44

  
THE MODERATOR: We will open the floor for questions first for our student
athletes.  
  
Q. This is for Maya Moore. How does Coach get athletes who are prolific
scorers to buy into defense the way you guys buy into defense because your
streak of holding opponents to less than 50 percent is also stunning?  
MAYA MOORE: Well, I think it starts -- you've got to recruit a certain type of
player. You recruit players that are competitive people, so when you get to
Connecticut, everything is competitive, offense and defense. And I think it's
something that we have bought into. You know, we're still constantly trying to
improve our defense every day. We've by no means made it, but it's something
that has been a staple of our success.  
  
Q. Tina, was this win bigger for you because it got you to The Finals or
because of 71?  
TINA CHARLES: I think this win is big just because this is the second win for
us in the postseason. So I guess I'll say it's neither, but yet we are happy
that we're going to The Finals, of course. But just the way we're playing, you
know, we've been sitting around like coach said, putting an emphasis on, and
just the fact that we're still able to compete, and some of us play longer
minutes and do back to back games, I think that's really good.  
  
Q. Tina, at the half it was 25-22. You guys aren't really used to having
teams compete with you that closely going into halftime. What did you guys
tell each other at halftime? What was the mood like in the locker room?  
TINA CHARLES: We were just missing shots, and Coach said that we're a team
that we're used to making all of our shots, and how are we going to react. We
just went out there, and I think Kalana just bear down, and she started making
her shots?  
  
Q. Maya, whether it's Rutgers or West Virginia in The Finals, what are your
thoughts on just the championship game and what you want to focus on?  
MAYA MOORE: It's going to be another battle. You know, at this point you're
not going to meet a team that's not physical, that's not aggressive. So we're
going to have to definitely come out and have a better first half, take that
mentality that we did in the second half and transfer it over to the first.  
You know, this is postseason, so everybody is going to be coming at you with
everything that they have. So we have to be ready to respond tomorrow more
than anything.  
  
Q. Kalana, just talk about the difference between the first half and second
half tempowise.  
KALANA GREENE: I think we had a lot more pressure on the ball. We got a lot of
defensive rebounds in the second half that led to transition points for us.  
Whenever our defense is great, we create turnovers or limit them to one shot.
We get points in transition. I think that was the big key. Tina blocking a lot
of shots in the lane and Maya tipping passes and getting steals, and that
definitely led us to getting transition buckets.  
  
Q. Maya, Coach has talked often about what it takes to accomplish what you
did tonight as a team with the 71 straight wins about the focus and you never
can have a bad night; the team can't have a bad night collectively; someone
always has to come to work ready to play. What is your perspective about what
has happened in the last two years, why you've been able to do this and what
it takes to do it?  
MAYA MOORE: You have to have great leadership, first of all. It starts with
Coach Auriemma and goes down to our seniors and spreads to the rest of us,
somebody to come every day, like you said, with their hardhat on and really
make sure that they come with that competitiveness that you have to have every
day, and then it spreads down to the rest of us.  
And especially this year, we've had to all, I think, collectively take more of
a responsibility of our team because we don't have as many players, and it's
just what the chemistry this year calls for. Tina has absolutely stepped up
and really come to work every day this year, and I think we definitely feed
off of that, and our seniors play with that sense of urgency. So when you have
that every day in practice and you have that every day in the game, it's hard
not to bring that enthusiasm that you see us play with every day, because we
know how special our team is, and we know what kind of a special thing we've
got going over the past couple years. So we're just trying to go out and play
every game to just make the best of it.  
  
Q. For Tina and Kalana, we know by now how you guys feel about all of this
because you told us all year about how these things really aren't that
important in terms of the streak. But when will you allow yourself to look at
what you've done and feel a sense of pride or at least express how you really
feel about winning 71 straight games? I mean, when are you going to feel
comfortable enough to do that?  
TINA CHARLES: After the season, the last game we play we can look back and see
what we've done. That's always been -- you don't want to sit there and
celebrate about wins when you've still got a long ways to go. We don't play on
our season being over any time soon. We're looking at the next game.  
Right now we're going to take a little bit of time to see what we did wrong
with the game and try and correct it for the next game we have tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Two questions: First off, how is Carolyn after getting hit in the head?
And second, is it some relief now that 71 is over with that the rest of the
games you can sort of put the streak away?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I mean, I can't speak for everybody sitting out there and
everybody else that's anywhere that has a microphone or a pen that's going to
ask me about it, but I'm sure that -- I don't know that 71 changes anything.  
Now, it's -- maybe it is, I don't know. I think the more important number for
us right now, again, is what Kalana just said about winning the Big East
championship. I'm coaching tonight. I'm not thinking about what number this
is. It really is I'm thinking I can't believe that anything is more important
than winning -- than playing in the Big East championship for these kids. I
want to try to keep the focus where it is.  
But Wednesday, Thursday, Friday -- probably until we get together for the NCAA
tournament, you know, there may be a little bit of a looking back for
everybody. But then you've got to get back to focusing on the things that are
important, you know, short-term.  
As far as Caroline is concerned, I couldn't tell whether it was a knee or an
elbow that caught her in the back of the head down low, and they were just
being, I think, cautious. She may have a concussion; we're not sure until they
evaluate her. They're doing that now probably. And obviously if she has a
concussion, she's not playing tomorrow.  
But just by the looks of it, that might be the worst of it. We were worried it
might have been worse, but that's about the worst of it.  
  
Q. One of the things you say all the time is nobody ever knows how fragile
this all can be, and when you see her laying like that, especially after the
way she played, I mean, does that -- do you think about that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, you know what, for me what's fun is when I was in the
locker room at halftime, I was walking out of the locker room, and I said it
maybe four or five times to Jack or whoever we were walking out with, I said,
Come on, it's impossible for us to lose, right? There's no way. We're going to
win 97 in a row. Do you know how easy it is? Do you know? All you have to do
is listen to what everybody says.  
We put up at whopping 25 in the first half. If I would have told you that
before the game and said, Hey, we're going to get 25 at halftime, if I would
have said that, you would have said, He's an idiot.  
We're just looking for things to pick off. We got 25 in the first half. Our
defense was great. We were lousy on the offensive end, and Notre Dame I
thought played great. But they didn't shoot the ball that well, either. So it
was just one of those games where you're going to have to grind it out, and
that's how it is fragile. It's fragile because you can go like Kalana, 7 for
17, and you could have -- go 3 for 10 from the free-throw line.  
There's so many things that could go wrong, and the other team has to take
advantage of it, and you're one injury away from it all falling apart maybe.
That's why, you know, I said all along, I don't care about the streak. It's
going to end. I just want it to end the right way. I don't want it to end
because we got a kid injured. I don't want it to end because somebody got in
foul trouble and fouled out. I want to have our best guys out on the floor,
the last three minutes, and somebody beats us, and I'll be the first to shake
their hand.  
Other than that, I want to play for the Big East championship tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Rutgers  63  
Georgetown -56

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, a brief statement to open, please.  
COACH WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I thought our kids played extremely hard. It was a
tough game. Shots didn't fall like we needed them to fall. I thought Rutgers
hit some big shots, but I'm still very proud of my young ladies. It's a tough
loss. It's an extremely tough loss, but we have to bounce back because we
still have the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Sugar, you guys did a pretty good job shutting down their biggest scorer
in Ray, but then you saw some other people step up. Did you kind of expect
that?  
TA'SHAUNA "SUGAR" RODGERS: No, not really. I mean, they just stepped up.
That's what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to step up. When somebody
isn't hitting shots, then you're supposed to step up.  
  
Q. Monica, why was it so hard to score against Rutgers today?  
MONICA McNUTT: You have nights like that, shots that we usually hit weren't
falling. Rutgers is a slower-paced team. They wanted to slow down the game and
make it a little bit ugly. Tonight they controlled the tempo a little bit
better than we did. It happens.  
  
Q. Monica, you guys held them for four points in the first 12 minutes of the
game but couldn't seem to get going offensively. How big was it that they were
sort of able to hang around when you guys had your defense going early on?  
MONICA McNUTT: Rutgers is an experienced team. Postseason is something that
they're accustomed to and those kids responded well. They stayed in the game.
They continued to fight, and where we struggled, they capitalized.  
You give them credit for their experience. I think that might have been the
difference in the game, that they're a little bit more experienced than we
are. But that's okay, because we're learning. We're going to take this loss
and tighten up the things we need to tighten up and get ready for the NCAA
tournament like coach said.  
  
Q. Latia, can you follow up on what Monica was saying? What do you learn
from it?  
LATIA MAGEE: You just learn that you have to capitalize on everything. Just
like Monica said, where we were lacking, they were starting to pick up. They
went on their runs, and we just didn't capitalize the way we needed to. We're
a fast-break team. We weren't finishing like we needed to. We got out-
rebounded. There was just, like, little things that we needed to do that we
didn't take care of.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Rutgers  63  
Georgetown - 56

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you would start with a brief statement, please.  
COACH STRINGER: That was a gutsy win. I mean, two guards, Nikki and Di, who
had four fouls, and yet we continued to press, and it takes a great deal out
of you, and plus you run the risk of a foul.  
I kept thinking that there was a song that was written when we went to the
Final Four, and it talks about Rutgers from Bruce Springsteen's gritty New
Jersey, you know, and I was really proud. We as a coaching staff couldn't be
more proud. They were just gutty and gritty, and they played in the image of
the Scarlet Knights. When it's championship time, we play, and we don't back
down.  
So I was really proud of all of them; Chelsea Lee, just an incredible desire
to fight. At some point I was going to switch up and go into a break because
the pressure that we were using was really taxing. And Chelsea said, no, let's
stay with the 55 and everybody else concurred, so I was really proud.  
I thought we settled down, handled their press a lot better in the second
half, began to attack on the inside, and was a lot more deliberate with what
we did, and so I'm really happy for these young ladies because it was
important for them to know that they can win and they can have that fight
inside of them. And in particular because all three of these young ladies will
be people that will be coming back, it's an excellent building block for our
future and the attitude that has to be played as a Scarlet Knight.  
  
Q. Nikki, where does that rank in the biggest shots you've made in your
life?  
NIKKI SPEED: I'd say it's the biggest. I wasn't even really thinking about it.
All I know is all of us kept saying we're not going home. We last year played
double overtime, and I remember saying in the huddle, last year we played
double overtime, we lost, and the only thing going through our minds was we
want to win.  
  
Q. Di, what was it like for you having your sidekick on the bench in the
second half?  
KHADIJAH RUSHDAN: It was hard, and we all know that Brittany is our go-to
player. She makes big shots, but I've got to credit the people that were out
there. You've got to work with what you've got, and you know, these two,
everybody that was out there, I mean, we stuck in it, and we played with that
mentality that Coach Stringer always sees in us.  
  
Q. Chelsey, when B-Ray fouled out, did you see yourself stepping up into a
bigger scoring role?  
CHELSEY LEE: I just knew that everyone had to step up. We all had to
contribute. Losing our best player, like everybody else just got to step up.
We can't just die down just because Brittany is gone even though she's our go-
to player, we couldn't just lay down and die. I knew we had to keep fighting.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Connecticut  77  
Syracuse - 41

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement if you wouldn't mind, please.  
COACH HILLSMAN: Sure. Obviously disappointed in the loss. We didn't come here
for any more victories, and we really wanted to come out and compete and win
the basketball game.  
Overall, you've got to give a lot of credit to Connecticut. They have a great
basketball team, great players, a great coach, and I'm happy they're in our
conference, I really am. We have the best conference in the country. We have
the best team in the country, and we have the team that's probably going to
end up winning the national championship.  
So when you look at that overall, you have to be happy to be able to compete
against No. 1 in the country. There's not too much chances or opportunities
you're going to get to compete against such a great team and such great
players. So we relish the opportunity to come in and compete against that kind
of team.  
It's hard to sit up here and really give a basketball opening statement
because I thought that we competed and we played as hard as we could.
Obviously playing three games in three days is tough, and playing three games
in three days and your third game being against UConn is really tough. But
overall I'm really happy for our team, really happy for what we've
accomplished this year, winning 22 games.  
I've got to give all the credit to Connecticut and to their players and
congratulate them for tying the record. They're a great basketball team. We
have great kids. This is the best conference in the country, and it's an honor
and a pleasure to be coaching in this conference at this press conference.
It's a great day for us, and I'm going to take a shower and come back and
watch some great basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, with the win over West Virginia and the win in the first round
with Providence, can you talk about where your season stands now?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I hope so. I hope you're on the committee if you're saying
yes. We know as we say at Syracuse, we're Bowl-eligible, so we know that we're
eligible to play in the postseason at the NCAA tournament. That would be
awesome. If it's the WNIT, that's going to be awesome, also. We just want to
keep playing basketball. We want to get our young kids as encouraged as
possible.  
We want to make sure that if we go on the road that we play hard, and if we
play at home, make sure that our team has a lot of work to do to get our gyms
ready for us to play.  
We're very excited to give our kids a couple days off. We know we're playing
somewhere, so we're looking forward to preparing for that. I don't know. I
think we have a good basketball team, and I think that we are NCAA talent. And
if they vote us into the tournament, we're going to go and play hard. If not,
we're going to play the WNIT, and we're going to play hard there.  
  
Q. Erica, can you discuss the start of the game? I believe it was 17 to 2 at
one point, just kind of your mentality going forward?  
ERICA MORROW: Well, my mentality was to just keep being aggressive, keep being
aggressive, and actually even on offense. You see the scoreboard, but at the
end of the day you can only control what you can control, so we just wanted to
keep being aggressive and just execute our offense and defense.  
  
Q. Erica, I think you had like 42 points the last two games. What were they
able to do to frustrate you today, and how was it different?  
ERICA MORROW: Well, I mean, I'm not sure what they did, but on our end, I kept
being aggressive. I had to look to score the ball and be a threat for my team,
and that's what I tried to do.  
  
Q. Coach, in terms of Tina Charles, it seemed like out there today you'd try
a little bit more with Kayla, Vionca, everybody kind of against you. Just what
was your thought process against a player like Tina?  
COACH HILLSMAN: It's difficult because she's such a great player, and once she
gets in deep post position, she's definitely hard to guard. We were just
trying to get Kayla some good experience against her because eventually we're
going to need Kayla to be that dominant, and we also had to use Troya because
we knew that it was going to be a physical game in the paint.  
We just wanted to come out and do the best we could of trying to take players
away and try to take situations away, and when they started hitting the ball
into the short corner, I knew it that was going to be a long day, because
that's one thing, that you can't get the ball into the high post or to the
short corner if you want to stop deep post position. They got that numerous
times, and that was the biggest key, I think, in Tina getting so many points,
because she stayed right at the blocks in the paint and got the easy baskets.  
  
Q. Erica, the third game in a row for you, first game for Connecticut. Was
fatigue a big factor?  
ERICA MORROW: Definitely. UConn is definitely a great team, and like Coach
said earlier, to play two games, get two tough wins and have to play the No. 1
team in the country, it's tough. But it was a great opportunity, and it was a
great basketball game.  
  
Q. I guess this is for both of you. Do you think early on you rushed shots?
There seemed to be a lot of possessions when you down and the ball went right
up right away without a lot of passes, or was that a situation where that was
going to be the best shot you were going to get on that possession?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I'll take that one. We definitely took some quick ones. We
talked about not going to one-pass to the shot. But when you're in the
situation that you're in with this crowd, with this team that's really
constantly putting pressure on you, you want to take looks when you get them,
and that's one thing that I did say, that if we get an open look we have to
take it, not say, no, no, no, not that one and overlook it.  
It's one of the things where you get into the game emotionally, I think that
at some point I kind of backed off and I relaxed and I let our kids play. But
you try to control every situation, you try to control every call, you try to
control every pass, and finally once you get the game flowing, you can kind of
back off and let things happen. A lot of the early shots, a lot of the
frustration is because of what we talked about; if you get an open look you
have to take it. And a lot of times when we got the first look we got a ball
screen when we turned the corner, and we had to look at the basket but that
definitely hurt, the early shots and leak-outs, but definitely didn't want
that to happen.  
ERICA MORROW: What he said.  
  
Q. Erica, last time-out Maya had obviously a career night, and today Tina
was just off the charts. What's it like playing against a two-headed monster
like that?  
ERICA MORROW: Well, I've played with them before on different levels, and I've
played against them, and they're both two great players. They have great
players and they have a great team, and they just had a great night.  
  
Q. You've done some decent things since becoming the head coach at Syracuse.
I assume it's your goal to win Big East Championship, National Championship at
Syracuse, but you've got to go through UConn at some point to do so. These
losses the past couple weeks, 36 today, how do you try to use these things
going forward to try to reach that level UConn seems to be at?  
COACH HILLSMAN: First of all, we have to just continue to recruit at a high
level and get great players, and we'll definitely do that. One thing that I
know we have on our side, with our chancellor, Dr. Cantor, Dr. Gross and Barb
and all the people that we have as supporters, we have every resource that we
need to win at a high level. We have a great conference; we have everything in
place.  
So we just have to continue just to progress and grow. I always tell my
players, I'm growing up with them right now, so we have slinky, we kind of
started out together, I just coached the best I could and I recruited the best
I could.  
So we're still growing up. So I'm growing this business, and there's a lot of
things that I still have to learn, but there's one thing that I definitely
know is that you have to have great players to win championships.  
So we're going to continue to recruit players. We're going to continue to do
everything we can to make this conference proud of us, to make our University
proud of us, so eventually and hopefully soon we can be at a national level
year in and year out where we're in the same conversation with these top 10,
top 15 teams where we're not sitting here wondering should we have an NCAA
party at my house or should we not. We already know we're going to my house,
we're going to eat and celebrate because we're in.  
So it's tough. But it's a great goal, and when I see 70 wins and when I see
this kind of crowd and I see the trophies and I see these teams and I see Geno
successful and when I see these kinds of players, it is something to strive
for. It is something to look at, and coaching, knowing how tough it is, I
really admire Geno and UConn even more for what they've been able to do
because it's tough. It's definitely tough.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

## March 7, 2010

  

### [Skylar Diggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20547)

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Devereaux Peters](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20548)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame  75  
St. John's - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you couldn't mind an opening statement, and then
we'll take questions.  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I thought Skylar had just a fantastic game. I thought she
really kind of took the game over for a stretch and did some great things,
both ends, offensively, defensively, rebounded, had a blocked shot; took a
charge that I thought was one of the keys to the victory was that charge. I
thought it was a really critical situation, and she was able to step in and
get the charge. So just a great defensive player.  
I thought Devereaux off the bench gave us great minutes. I was disappointed in
the first half the way we came out. We just couldn't get anything going and at
halftime I thought regrouped and played a little more man-to-man, and I
thought that helped us defensively because Smith had a fantastic game. She
really played well. We couldn't stop her in the first half, played a little
better in the second half, but she really played well.  
  
Q. Skylar, Notre Dame trailed I think it was 63-59. You guys went on a 12-0
run starting at about the 5:19 mark. Can you talk about what happened in that
run, how you guys just took charge there?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We definitely wanted to keep our composure. When we were down,
we knew it was inside the last couple minutes of the game, and we wanted to
just take over. We really came together, and were like, We don't want to go
home. We don't want to go home. We want to win. We were very anxious to come
out here and play this team. We didn't get off to a good start, so we wanted
to make sure we finished well. So we definitely all came together, stayed
mentally tough and just decided to go after it.  
They were definitely fighting for a stretch there. They got the 50-50 balls.
They were going after as hard as we were, so we wanted to make sure we
finished the game out strong and stayed together and stayed mentally tough and
just decided to put together a little run.  
  
Q. Devereaux, obviously one of your four losses was to the St. John's team.
Could you talk about the motivation maybe? I mean, your Quarterfinals is one
thing, but also one of four losses, St. John's is getting a chance to play
them again.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Yeah, that was huge. That was one of our first losses
outside of UConn, so it definitely burned and we came out with a chip on our
shoulder and went at it hard and definitely proved that we could play better
than we did when we were there. They're a great team, and they fought and we
fought, and we pulled out the win.  
  
Q. Devereaux, can you talk about your offensive game today and the last few
games? Are you feeling more confident with some of the things you're doing on
the court?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I guess you could say that. I'm just trying to do whatever
the team needs me to do, and if that means score and get on the rebounds,
whatever that is, I'm trying to do. So sure.  
  
Q. And then the rebounding numbers really changed in the second half. What
did Notre Dame do to get an edge there?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Well, St. John's is a great rebounding team, and they all
crashed the boards, even their guards, and I think in the second half we had
more of the guards coming in and helping. Even if they were just getting a
little tip and one then of the bigs getting the rebound. That definitely
helped with everyone crashing the boards instead of just the posts.  
  
Q. Skylar, if it happens to be Connecticut again that you face tomorrow
night, can you talk about playing them a third time and the mindset you guys
will have?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We've definitely got to come out with a sense of urgency,
start off like we did last game. We've got to play a 40-minute game. A game
can seem like 100 years when you play against a team like Connecticut. You
really have to just stay focused and every possession make sure you execute.
On rebound, you know, they have a great transition run, so we've got to make
sure that we try to stop the transition and rebound and execute on offense,
just keep playing hard for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Devereaux, I was wondering, could you talk about getting Lindsay back
after her injury and how much more confident that makes the team when she's on
the floor? She just kind of makes things look easy.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Yeah, Lindsay helped a lot. She's definitely a banger and
real huge for us on the offensive end and on the rebound. So that was really
big for us, and having another body in there that they have to worry about
scoring-wise and rebounding, so she was a huge help because she was just
another person that they had to keep focused on if she got the ball. So I
think she was very big helping us win.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: If I could add to that, she's also one of our captains, so
having another captain out there and a leader to help us out was definitely
good.  
  
Q. In the first half you guys had I believe 13 turnovers, very sloppy, but
it kind of looked like you guys couldn't get control of the ball. What was the
talk like and how did you go about correcting that?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I thought that we had some really uncharacteristically
-- well, bad turnovers. They went to the press. We dribbled over half court.
We picked the ball up, and I think almost three possessions in a row I thought
we over-dribbled a little bit in the traps. We just talked about moving the
ball a little bit and trying to get somebody into the middle of the floor. I
thought that was an area we really wanted to get the ball and didn't have much
success with that in the first half. We did a little better the second half.  
We still were depending on luck to always handle the pressure instead of
attacking. So we talked about having more of an attack mentality and taking
more shots and taking more balls to the basket rather than trying to set it
back up again.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the 12-0 run, that stretch late in the game? Was that
a matter of poise, or was something else a more important factor?  
COACH McGRAW: It was defense. That was the key was the defense. We got some
stops. We got some turnovers. We were able to get going in transition. I think
when you get Skylar the ball on the open floor, something good is going to
happen. She's going to find somebody for a lay-up or she's going to take it in
herself.  
I thought she was the catalyst in that run to really get us going, but really
defensively. I think they only had four offensive rebounds in the second half.
That was huge for us.  
  
Q. Can you also talk about the shooting percentages today? I mean, in an
arena like this, both teams were just doing an exceptional job with the
shooting.  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I think it was good for us to get out there yesterday and
get a feel for things, but our shot selection I thought was very good. We did
not shoot well from the three-point line; they did. We shot well from right
around the basket, and I thought that was -- and even then we missed a bunch
of shots right there.  
So I think our shot selection was better. We rebounded a couple and were able
to put them back in, especially Devereaux right around the basket. You're
going to make a lot more shots the closer you get.  
  
Q. I know there's another game yet to be played today, but can you kind of
put into perspective what UConn has done and how your team might respond to
the challenge of being the team that could stop their streak?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, they've had a great season. They are having a great
season. They're the best team in the country by far. I don't think there's
anybody close to them. We've seen it close up twice and haven't really liked
the view from my seat. They're incredibly hard to guard, but I think what they
do well is play great defense. They're not a team that relies on any
particular offensive person or three-point or whatever because they can score
in so many different ways. So I think as long as they continue to play defense
like they have, they've got a great shot at going undefeated.  
  
Q. And how might your team respond to the challenge of being the team that
could stop UConn's streak?  
COACH McGRAW: Hopefully better than we have the first two times, but I just
wanted to play our game. I want us to take our shots and run our stuff and not
be intimidated. We haven't been able to do that in two tries, so maybe the
third time is a charm and we can come out and execute a little bit better.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2010

  

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

### [Sarah Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20554)

### [Liz Repella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20553)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

West Virginia  47  
DePaul - 41

  
COACH MIKE CAREY: I thought both teams struggled to score to be honest with
you. I thought when Sarah Miles got in foul trouble the first half, Akeema
Richards came in and got us going a little bit really, distributed the ball,
and we started scoring a little bit and that type of stuff. I thought that was
important.  
I thought the second half when we did struggle to score and they were cutting
into the lead, we picked our defense up and made them take some tough shots
and was just able to score enough. They do a great job. Doug does a great job,
and we were able to score enough.  
And then I thought the last three minutes we put a little pressure on them,
and they turned it over in big situations. That really gave us other
opportunities to go to the foul line. If we hit our foul shots at the end, it
wouldn't have been as close as it was, but we didn't. We like to make it
interesting.  
  
Q. Liz, you were 4 of 8 from three-point range in the first half, and I
think you missed your first five in the second half. Were you just getting
tired or what was the difference there?  
LIZ REPELLA: I wasn't noticing getting tired. It was just maybe a matter of
squaring up and maybe getting lower and taking my shots. I knew I was going to
miss some, so I just --  
COACH CAREY: You just hoped not all of them.  
LIZ REPELLA: Exactly, just tried to stay in my shot.  
COACH CAREY: You know, I'll answer that. I tell Liz all the time, if she don't
take that shot, I'll take her out. I don't care if she goes 0 for 8. She's our
three-point shooter and she needs to shoot. If she has the green light, and if
she doesn't shoot, that's when I get mad at her. If she misses eight in a row,
I may say, let's try to hit one once in a while. Let's mix one in, but other
than that, I want her shooting.  
  
Q. Sarah, you were defensive player of the year in the conference, and it
seems like you guys are comfortable playing in these games where it's mostly
all on defense. Can you just talk about what you guys do at practice and how
you've become such a good defensive team?  
SARAH MILES: We work on staying up the lane, and a lot of unballed defense
which we still need a lot of work on. We just work on trying to guard the ball
and staying up the lane, the passing lanes and snapping our head in the back
door?  
  
Q. Are you comfortable playing in these kind of games?  
SARAH MILES: That's what we practice for, for all situations. So I can say
we're pretty comfortable. We try to stay focused.  
COACH CAREY: I can say I'm not.  
  
Q. Liz, whether you get -- end up getting Rutgers or Georgetown, what are
your thoughts on the next game and playing in the semifinals?  
LIZ REPELLA: We're both good teams, and it's tournament time, so they're going
to bring all they got. So we know whoever we play, we're going to have to be
focused and be ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Asya, and maybe this goes for the whole team, did you feel any rust? You
didn't play for almost a week. Do you think that factored into some of the
struggles the team had offensively and defensively?  
ASYA BUSSIE: No, I don't think it was rust. We just came out a little slow,
but it was probably being off for these couple days. We just basically had to
pick it up towards the middle.  
COACH CAREY: My past experience really, I told the team after the game, that
you normally play better the second game. I hope that holds true for the next
one.  
  
Q. Asya, can you guys talk about what you did, especially in the first half
on Quigley? It looked like the idea was just to make someone else bring the
ball up the court. She didn't hit a shot until a minute left in the game?  
SARAH MILES: Definitely. We try to keep the ball out of Quigley's hands
because she is a good point guard. So the idea was to try to get someone else
to bring it up, so we tried to face guard her as much as possible to keep the
ball out of her hands?  
  
Q. Liz, do you guys think you're playing a dangerous game of, you know,
you're not scoring offensively and you're hanging your hat on defense. Do you
think sooner or later it might catch up with you guys?  
LIZ REPELLA: Well, we always say that we're going to bring it every night on
defense. A great offensive team can't control their offense, but you can
control your defense. So we always emphasize if we're not scoring, then we
need to stop the other team from scoring. I mean, we're going to have to pick
up our offensive efforts, yes, I agree, but we're going to -- I mean, we've
really got to play good defense.  
  
Q. Liz, could you comment a little bit on the play of Madina Ali,
particularly in the second half, not just with a few key baskets but there in
the last two minutes, kept the ball alive when you guys had a four-point lead
and you ended up getting a couple foul shots out of that? She made some real
key plays in the second half.  
LIZ REPELLA: Yeah. Madina is always full of hustle. You always know what
you're going to get from her because she's going to hustle. She definitely did
have some key plays at the end of the game. It's just her hustle, and when she
hustles, great things come from it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Mike, could you address Madina's play there in the second half as well,
particularly down the stretch?  
COACH CAREY: Yeah, you know, we felt we had to get some other people scoring,
too, and Madina can score some. She's very aggressive defensively and
offensively. She can hit that set shot right there, which she was able to do,
and then made some hustle plays and got us the ball back and got us a couple
more possessions. So that's what we expect of her, and she usually gives us
100 percent.  
  
Q. Mike, how much pride do you guys take in your defense, and the players?
How much pride do you take in that?  
COACH CAREY: Well, you know, I'll just give you an example. Out of a three-
hour practice, we'll probably practice two hours and 15 minutes on defense. I
mean, it probably shows on offense, though. I probably shouldn't say that. But
my philosophy has always been you win with defense, shot selection and
rebounding. And this team particularly has really bought into our defense
concept and really likes to play defense.  
You know, defense is just a matter of heart and wanting to play it and wanting
to play it a little bit more than the other team, and this team has really
bought into that.  
  
Q. On the flipside of it, Mike, what are you guys going to have to do in
order to get a little better offensively because as you go forward, you're
probably going to need more than 42 points to win some games?  
COACH CAREY: Absolutely. You know, it just seems like we can't get people
clicking at the same time. It really does -- we had opportunities with Sarah
Miles today, and she got inside the paint, and we just weren't able to score
at that time.  
You know, how many lay-ups we missed and how many foul shots we missed and
that type of stuff. At times our ball movement is not really good and our
spacing is not good. So we work on it every day, and we need to continue to do
that.  
Exactly what I told them there, we're not going to win this next game tomorrow
on 47 points. We're going to have to be up in the -- for us defensively we
need to be up around 65 to 70 and then we have a good chance of winning the
ballgame.  
  
Q. Mike, do you think some of the struggles offensively you guys had came
because of the offensive press there or defensive press that they had and you
guys were starting your offense with 15 seconds left on the shot clock?  
COACH CAREY: Yeah, we tried to run some set plays, too, out of that, and we
just didn't get into that quick enough. Because of that, we took a couple bad
shots or we had to have Sarah penetrate the gap, and we didn't score.  
So, yeah, we've got to do a better job. We got lackadaisical against their
press a little bit. But again, I told the team after the game I'm very proud
of them. It was ugly, but if that's the way we've got to win at tournament
time, that's the way we want to win. We'll play better tomorrow, and we've
just got to get prepared.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2010

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Sam Quigley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20555)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

West Virginia  47  
DePaul - 41

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement if you would, please.  
COACH BRUNO: Whenever you don't score baskets, there's two kinds of coaches.
There's coaches that walk in and say, We missed, and there's coaches that
understand that the reason we didn't make baskets is because West Virginia's
defense was as good as it was. They really did a great job.  
I think Coach Carey's defense has gotten better and better as the season has
gone along. It's a great defensive ballclub, and we did not have answers for
them on the offensive side of the ball.  
You have to score the ball in this game to be able to compete and be a top ten
team in the country, and I thought really therein lies the game. At halftime
we had shot 19 percent, I think, and for the game we got up to a whopping
30-something, but I think -- no, 29, sorry, 29.5. We can round it up to 30.  
But at any rate, I'd just like to credit his defense. They just do a great job
of getting in your grill, do a great job of switching. And to counter that,
you have to not just run your stuff. You have to run your stuff with
intelligence and know how to run your stuff with intelligence, and I don't
know that we had a great night of doing that.  
The players, when you come after a game -- come out after a game like this,
there's a double-edged emotion in you, and first of all, coaches want more. We
always want more. And yet I have to really compliment my players on their last
week of the season into last night's Marquette game. They really, really did
have a really tough week and had to really come up big and win five basketball
games in about 12, 14 days, and I'm really proud of them for doing that.  
Turning the page on that, you say thanks to the team. You say you're proud of
them, but then you have to challenge your team to want more than one and out
ball, and this is practice one and out ball for the ultimate one and out ball
that's going to be coming up next week.  
So hopefully we'll take the learning experience from tonight's one and out
pressure ball, and hopefully we'll be better for it if we're fortunate enough
to be selected on March 15th, which I certainly believe we deserve to be
selected on March 15th.  
Sam here has been awesome. It's just -- she's just been a kid that just has
been really, really special to our program this season because of the
adversity we've faced in losing players. And she's really, really -- I mean, a
person's greatest strength is often her greatest weakness, and her guts to put
the team on her back is why she went 1 on 5 in the first half and tried to
score a 14-point basket with one play.  
But that's a tribute to her as a person and as a ball player. I mean, we're
really blessed to have her, and we couldn't be where we are without her. So
I'm proud to be sitting up here with this excellent student athlete next to
me.  
  
Q. Sam, can you just address the defense they put on you? It looked like the
first half their entire game plan was to make somebody else other than you
take the ball up court and then, you know, one for ten shooting and obviously
did a good job there too.  
SAM QUIGLEY: Yeah, they made everything difficult for us. We didn't really get
to run our offense like we like to run it, and that's what a good defensive
team does, I think. I mean, there were times when we did run our offense, and
we just made our stupid mistakes. But a lot of it is due to their defense.  
You know, they were in every passing lane, and it was hard for me to even get
the ball. So I guess that's just something we have to learn from. Those are
the kind of teams we're going to face in postseason tournaments.  
COACH BRUNO: In games like this, we did have some opportunities early, too.
Anna had two or three three-point shots early that were in again, out again,
in again, to quote the great "Red" Rush, they were right there. We had a
couple chippies early. When you get those opportunities, you have to knock
those little ones down, and we had a couple that we didn't get knocked down
early that would have just at least kept us a little bit more in the ballgame.  
  
Q. Sam, maybe you could talk about when you play a team that keeps coming
after you like they did on defense, is there a little bit of a fatigue factor
late in the game? Does it wear on you mentally and physically? Is that kind of
what they're trying to do?  
SAM QUIGLEY: Yeah. I mean, when we do our pressure, that's what we're trying
to do to other teams, so I imagine that's what they were trying to do. I think
that when teams do that, you just have to be smarter than them, and tonight we
really weren't.  
COACH BRUNO: Sam, is the bionic woman. She doesn't wear out. She just keeps
playing her 40 minutes, 40 minutes, 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Doug, you addressed this a little bit and you addressed this yesterday.
Can you talk about your tournament résumé, why you think you guys should be an
NCAA tournament team and how many teams you think this league deserves?  
COACH BRUNO: Well, first of all, I think we are sitting 21 and 11, 9 and 7 in
the Big East, and the Big East is what we believe the best league in the
country. Other leagues will argue that, maybe the Big 12 and other teams will
argue that, but I believe we're the best league in the country. The reason
we're the best league is because we have 16 teams that go deep from top to
bottom. There's no easy game. That's what makes this more difficult than other
leagues.  
That's one reason. The Florida State win was huge. The Illinois State win,
which is doing their job in the valley, was huge. And again, the -- just the
way we finished this down the stretch I think is important, as well.  
The way our league works, also, is when you're home and who you're home
against and who you're away against, and we were on a road schedule this year.
If you look at our schedule, not only did we play less home games than just
about most everybody in America, but in the league we had five of the top
seven of the Big East teams on the road. So that's another factor.  
When you're not playing a double round-robin like all these other leagues are,
it makes that even more difficult when you don't get somebody that you could
beat at home the opportunity to beat them at home. These are all reasons why I
do believe -- one last reason, I think we're pretty good on the Eye Test when
we're playing ball. The other committee talks about the Eye Test. I just do
think when we've got it going and we've had it going some pretty good
possessions here the last -- not tonight necessarily but in the last couple
weeks, I thought -- I think that we do present ourselves as a team that's
deserving of being in the NCAA tournament.  
The league, I really think it's got -- I really believe we should be in for
sure, I really do, but that gets a little difficult because we have some
situations here that I think Syracuse is very talented and a very good team.
Their win over West Virginia -- we were able to beat Syracuse.  
That's the other thing about us is beating teams like Syracuse and Pitt in the
last week, those are good ball teams that don't necessarily have great RPIs.
So the Syracuse factor is going to be huge, and I hope they get recognized for
the positive toughness of the league and not get penalized for their non-
conference schedule.  
And then there's the Rutgers factor, who's out there playing right now, and
Coach Stringer always seems to have a way to fight her way in at this time of
the year, but they did play the No. 1 schedule in the country. You can say
that this has not been one of Rutgers' better teams and they've lost 13 of 14
games, but Coach Stringer, that's hard to go play the people she plays, and
sometimes you're not going to win them all.  
What they call -- they don't even get credit for wins over like Mississippi
State and Florida, people like that. They just kind of take those for granted,
and those are her soft games. And then you look at other people's schedules in
other leagues and how they play these 17 to 19 home games, and that's why, I
believe, we deserve at least seven. That's really how I think about it and
what I believe about it. I really believe it's eight, but it's going to be a
little bit hard that we go 9-7s and we don't have any 8-8s. I think the lack
of 8-8s hurts us, but if other leagues are going to get sub .500 teams in
here, then we certainly deserve to get a sub .500 team in here and you're
hearing some people talk about some sub .500 teams from other BCS conferences.
Well, if they're getting sub .500 teams in their leagues, then we certainly
deserve it in this league, as well.

_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame  75  
St. John's - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, if you couldn't mind an opening statement, and then
we'll take questions.  
COACH McGRAW: Well, I thought Skylar had just a fantastic game. I thought she
really kind of took the game over for a stretch and did some great things,
both ends, offensively, defensively, rebounded, had a blocked shot; took a
charge that I thought was one of the keys to the victory was that charge. I
thought it was a really critical situation, and she was able to step in and
get the charge. So just a great defensive player.  
I thought Devereaux off the bench gave us great minutes. I was disappointed in
the first half the way we came out. We just couldn't get anything going and at
halftime I thought regrouped and played a little more man-to-man, and I
thought that helped us defensively because Smith had a fantastic game. She
really played well. We couldn't stop her in the first half, played a little
better in the second half, but she really played well.  
  
Q. Skylar, Notre Dame trailed I think it was 63-59. You guys went on a 12-0
run starting at about the 5:19 mark. Can you talk about what happened in that
run, how you guys just took charge there?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We definitely wanted to keep our composure. When we were down,
we knew it was inside the last couple minutes of the game, and we wanted to
just take over. We really came together, and were like, We don't want to go
home. We don't want to go home. We want to win. We were very anxious to come
out here and play this team. We didn't get off to a good start, so we wanted
to make sure we finished well. So we definitely all came together, stayed
mentally tough and just decided to go after it.  
They were definitely fighting for a stretch there. They got the 50-50 balls.
They were going after as hard as we were, so we wanted to make sure we
finished the game out strong and stayed together and stayed mentally tough and
just decided to put together a little run.  
  
Q. Devereaux, obviously one of your four losses was to the St. John's team.
Could you talk about the motivation maybe? I mean, your Quarterfinals is one
thing, but also one of four losses, St. John's is getting a chance to play
them again.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Yeah, that was huge. That was one of our first losses
outside of UConn, so it definitely burned and we came out with a chip on our
shoulder and went at it hard and definitely proved that we could play better
than we did when we were there. They're a great team, and they fought and we
fought, and we pulled out the win.  
  
Q. Devereaux, can you talk about your offensive game today and the last few
games? Are you feeling more confident with some of the things you're doing on
the court?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: I guess you could say that. I'm just trying to do whatever
the team needs me to do, and if that means score and get on the rebounds,
whatever that is, I'm trying to do. So sure.  
  
Q. And then the rebounding numbers really changed in the second half. What
did Notre Dame do to get an edge there?  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Well, St. John's is a great rebounding team, and they all
crashed the boards, even their guards, and I think in the second half we had
more of the guards coming in and helping. Even if they were just getting a
little tip and one then of the bigs getting the rebound. That definitely
helped with everyone crashing the boards instead of just the posts.  
  
Q. Skylar, if it happens to be Connecticut again that you face tomorrow
night, can you talk about playing them a third time and the mindset you guys
will have?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: We've definitely got to come out with a sense of urgency,
start off like we did last game. We've got to play a 40-minute game. A game
can seem like 100 years when you play against a team like Connecticut. You
really have to just stay focused and every possession make sure you execute.
On rebound, you know, they have a great transition run, so we've got to make
sure that we try to stop the transition and rebound and execute on offense,
just keep playing hard for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Devereaux, I was wondering, could you talk about getting Lindsay back
after her injury and how much more confident that makes the team when she's on
the floor? She just kind of makes things look easy.  
DEVEREAUX PETERS: Yeah, Lindsay helped a lot. She's definitely a banger and
real huge for us on the offensive end and on the rebound. So that was really
big for us, and having another body in there that they have to worry about
scoring-wise and rebounding, so she was a huge help because she was just
another person that they had to keep focused on if she got the ball. So I
think she was very big helping us win.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: If I could add to that, she's also one of our captains, so
having another captain out there and a leader to help us out was definitely
good.  
  
Q. In the first half you guys had I believe 13 turnovers, very sloppy, but
it kind of looked like you guys couldn't get control of the ball. What was the
talk like and how did you go about correcting that?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I thought that we had some really uncharacteristically
-- well, bad turnovers. They went to the press. We dribbled over half court.
We picked the ball up, and I think almost three possessions in a row I thought
we over-dribbled a little bit in the traps. We just talked about moving the
ball a little bit and trying to get somebody into the middle of the floor. I
thought that was an area we really wanted to get the ball and didn't have much
success with that in the first half. We did a little better the second half.  
We still were depending on luck to always handle the pressure instead of
attacking. So we talked about having more of an attack mentality and taking
more shots and taking more balls to the basket rather than trying to set it
back up again.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the 12-0 run, that stretch late in the game? Was that
a matter of poise, or was something else a more important factor?  
COACH McGRAW: It was defense. That was the key was the defense. We got some
stops. We got some turnovers. We were able to get going in transition. I think
when you get Skylar the ball on the open floor, something good is going to
happen. She's going to find somebody for a lay-up or she's going to take it in
herself.  
I thought she was the catalyst in that run to really get us going, but really
defensively. I think they only had four offensive rebounds in the second half.
That was huge for us.  
  
Q. Can you also talk about the shooting percentages today? I mean, in an
arena like this, both teams were just doing an exceptional job with the
shooting.  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, I think it was good for us to get out there yesterday and
get a feel for things, but our shot selection I thought was very good. We did
not shoot well from the three-point line; they did. We shot well from right
around the basket, and I thought that was -- and even then we missed a bunch
of shots right there.  
So I think our shot selection was better. We rebounded a couple and were able
to put them back in, especially Devereaux right around the basket. You're
going to make a lot more shots the closer you get.  
  
Q. I know there's another game yet to be played today, but can you kind of
put into perspective what UConn has done and how your team might respond to
the challenge of being the team that could stop their streak?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, they've had a great season. They are having a great
season. They're the best team in the country by far. I don't think there's
anybody close to them. We've seen it close up twice and haven't really liked
the view from my seat. They're incredibly hard to guard, but I think what they
do well is play great defense. They're not a team that relies on any
particular offensive person or three-point or whatever because they can score
in so many different ways. So I think as long as they continue to play defense
like they have, they've got a great shot at going undefeated.  
  
Q. And how might your team respond to the challenge of being the team that
could stop UConn's streak?  
COACH McGRAW: Hopefully better than we have the first two times, but I just
wanted to play our game. I want us to take our shots and run our stuff and not
be intimidated. We haven't been able to do that in two tries, so maybe the
third time is a charm and we can come out and execute a little bit better.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2010

  

### [Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20546)

### [Shenneika Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20544)

### [Da'Shena Stevens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20545)

  
_HARTFORD, CONNECTICUT_  
  

Notre Dame  75  
St. John's - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll start with an opening statement, please.  
COACH McGRAW: I thought it was an outstanding basketball game. Both teams
really did a nice job. It's unfortunate for us they came out with a win at the
end, but they're a great program, and I think we had an opportunity today to
showcase ourselves against one of the best teams in the country, and we pretty
much held our own. So I think that says a lot about our young ladies. I was
proud of their effort.  
It came down to the wire. I think it's a great game for the Big East
Conference, and I hope we all continue to do well in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Shenneika, you made your first five shots out of your first ten. What
were you seeing early on in the game that allowed you to make those shots?  
SHENNEIKA SMITH: I thought that the baseline was really opened and they wasn't
really focused on me as much and my point guard was able to find me. So I
thought we should run that play until they stopped it, and it was really easy,
so we just kept going until they stopped it.  
  
Q. Da'Shena, you went down early with it looked like an ankle injury. Could
you kind of go through what happened there and how you're feeling right now? I
saw you limping on the podium.  
DA'SHENA STEVENS: I think I landed on my foot wrong or tripped over somebody's
foot. I don't know what happened, but I just rolled my ankle, and it was
bothering me a little bit, so I taped it up and put my ankle brace on. It's
sore right now, and I'm just going to rest it for the next couple of days.  
  
Q. Kim, you had some tough calls and things go against you late in the game,
and your team is obviously very young. How much was youth a factor in just not
handling that adversity do you think in the last four or five minutes? They
went on like a 12 or 14-2 run there.  
COACH ARICO: Yeah, I think today was probably the first time in some time that
we showed our inexperience and youth down at the end. Our kids got extremely
frustrated by it, and we tried to continue to stay positive, but I think it
really affected us.  
You know, that's why it was a great game for us to play going into the
tournament, and I told them today we're the new kids on the block. Notre Dame
has been here before. They were No. 3 in the country this year. Those things
can happen, and we just have to be able to handle those things and continue to
play.  
So today was a tough one, like you said, down the stretch, and they are young.
But it was a great experience for them leading into the tournament.  
  
Q. Kim, the most wins for this program in over 20 years, almost 30 years.
Does this loss in the quarterfinals diminish things? You'll get obviously at
least one more. Did you expect to go further with this team? How do you just
sum up the way the team has gone up to this point?  
COACH ARICO: We just played the No. 6 team in the country, I think, so it
doesn't take anything away from our program. If we come in here and beat them
today, what does that say about us? We've already beaten them once.  
So I think we gave them a heck of a game, and the ball didn't bounce our way
at the end. We missed a ton of free throws, as well. I felt as if the game
could have gone either way. It shows our kids that we can play with anybody in
the country, and we are for real. Right now we're No. 16, but we're excited
about an opportunity to go to the NCAA tournament and see what we can do.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
SHARON VERSYP: At Purdue right now we're very anxious to get our season going.
With returners coming back and some healthy players as well as two transfer
students in Chantel Poston, and we're real excited to get on the court and
show a different brand of basketball. We've had some great practices, the
intensity, and for three hours have been the best it's ever been since I've
been at Purdue. Just really trying to see what we're all about this year. Just
really unknown.  
  
Q. Could you just talk about how does the conference look to you as a whole?
Ohio State, I think they won or tied for the last six years. Is there anybody
that can challenge them?  
SHARON VERSYP: I think there's -- any school can challenge. They lost people
last year. I think everyone is getting deeper, have more experience, more
skilled players. I think you've had a lot of new coaches that have come in
that have now developed their personnel and more or less their theme with
their teams. And I think the Big Ten is going to be very strong from top to
bottom, and it's not so much about the Big Ten Tournament, it's about the NCAA
and advancing far there. I think that's what we need to do as a conference.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how Drey has looked so far? She's a kid
that you mentioned that transferred that seems like she has maybe the
athleticism that she can really be an impact player for you guys?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, with Drey, her past kind of speaks for itself, being a
McDonald's All-American coming out of high school. She's been able to learn
for a year under the philosophy and the type of hard work and the aggressive
defense that we play. So I think that that year, her transfer year, I thought
has gained her a lot of respect. She was voted captain, and she obviously
hasn't played yet with a Purdue uniform. But I think she's got those
intangibles. She's very athletic, she can score down low, she's very physical,
she's very fast. She's run the court, can shoot the three, is a one-on-one
player down low or from the high post. So I think she's one of those versatile
athletes probably since Lindsay Wisdom-Hylton played for us that gives us a
player that can do a variety of things for their team.  
  
Q. You said in your opening statement you're excited to get on the court and
show a different brand of basketball. Explain specifically what you mean by "a
different brand of basketball" maybe from last year.   
SHARON VERSYP: Well, last year we had to walk the ball up because we only had
five healthy kids. So I feel we have 12 players, we have depth at each spot,
we have experience, we have athleticism and quickness. Our conditioning this
summer was at the top level it's ever been, and we can be very physical. I
just really feel that we can push the ball, we can full-court press like we
want to full-court press, and we're going to have 10 to 12 players on the
court, if they earn that playing time, who are some of the players you're
looking to really lead the team this season.  
Well, I mean, we have eight returners. I think Brittany Rayburn obviously
comes to the forefront. She's been very, very good for us the last couple
years, and now she's surrounded with a lot of talent, so she doesn't have all
the pressure.  
I think you have Drey Mingo, Antoinette Howard who are transfers that are
unknowns, no one knows anything about them in the Big Ten. I think you have
Chantel Poston who's probably the most athletic young lady I've ever coached
in my life that was out with an Achilles tendon and no one has really seen her
play. She played limited minutes her freshman year. And then we have two
freshmen.  
We have so many returners from last year, we're a little bit healthier. I'm
not looking to one kid. I think every player on our team is a threat
offensively, is a threat defensively, and we're hoping to have five, six
players in double-digit scoring. But with the experience, it would be
Brittany, and obviously we're hoping Drey or Antoinette can bring that
experience because they're a little bit older and they're young ladies that
played in different conferences and are coming into the Big Ten.  
  
Q. Kacine Alexander, she's starting to get more and more recognition now. As
an opposing coach, what impresses you about her?  
SHARON VERSYP: Her heart, her passion, never-say-die attitude. If you want
someone to score the ball or make a play for your team, she's a player that's
going to step up and do that for you, and she's proven that, and she can take
over a game. I think that's what separates her.  
  
Q. When you talked about not having just one kid do the scoring, that's
obviously good to have the balance, but if it comes down to crunch time and
you need a go-to player, are you hoping somebody emerges or do you have a
talent right now that could be that person if you needed that?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, I think I have one at each spot. I really feel KK Houser
and Courtney Moses bring different things at the point guard position, and
maybe if it's a free throw at the end of the game, they might be able to do
it. Obviously Brittany obviously is our go-to player. I think you have to have
a couple post players. We're still evolving that, but I think Alex Guyton and
Drey Mingo will probably be those go-to players. And I think if you need a
three player that can create and score or post-up down low and it's very hard
to defend down low would be Antoinette Howard.  
  
Q. From the media side it was Ohio State, Iowa, yourselves and Michigan
State tied for third. Does that seem like -- how do you see it? Do you see it
pretty much that way? And with everybody back, do you feel like your chances
are pretty good at contending for the top echelon right there?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, I hope we're always in the top echelon. Even though we
had a down year last year, we're in the top five, and we were very depleted.
Our goal at Purdue is always to be in the top echelon, to try to win the Big
Ten fTournament and advance as far as the NCAA and get to that Final Four.  
For us, I just don't think anyone really knows about us, and that's perfect
for us. They just think about the team last year. They don't know that there's
five missing pieces and two kids that are healthy now, so there's really seven
new pieces to the puzzle. But we're just determined to be the best that we can
be every single day, and if we're in the top five or top six, voted-wise, I
really don't care about rankings. Even in the top 25 last year there was
probably six or seven teams that are normally in the top 25 and they weren't,
and all of a sudden miraculously they're in the top ten. That does not make
sense to me because they had a recruiting class. But we're ranked sixth as a
recruiting class with our class with Drey and Net and Courtney and Dee Dee.
But rankings mean nothing, you've got to get out there and perform and play
the game.  
  
Q. Playing so many people and maybe a little transition at the point guard
spot, is that the key spot for you guys to get consistency so the whole thing
comes together?  
SHARON VERSYP: Absolutely. I mean, they're the engine that makes us run. We
were fortunate to have Fahkara for four straight years. I think KK Houser was
able to get a lot of experience last year, was able to play through a lot of
mistakes, so I think she has grown in the leadership area. She brings so much
energy. I think Courtney Moses is a talent but she's a freshman until the
lights go on and she can prove herself. She can score and is a very good
passer. But those two are the key, bottom line, and that's where our other
young ladies have to really help them and keep them very, very positive and
upbeat.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Lisa Stone](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16858)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
LISA STONE: Well, I have really, truly enjoyed the preseason with this team.
The early start for us I think was very beneficial, when you have a veteran
team that we can come in and lean on in terms of our defensive abilities and
our identity. Offensively I'm really pleased with our early post production in
practice, and looking forward to building on last year. Our trip to the NCAA
Tournament certainly was something that we'd like to build off of and play
better. We've been motivated throughout the off-season, been a great summer
for our kids, and I really am excited about our seniors. Two are with me
today, Alyssa Karel and Tara Steinbauer, and Lin Zastrow. Those three have
been to postseason for three years, last year being the NCAA Tournament, and
looking forward to an appetite for a little bit more this year, and I couldn't
be happier with our start so far.  
  
Q. You've got so many returning players. I thought you might have been in
the top three of the poll. Do you feel snubbed at not being in the three, and
how do you look at the top contenders this year?  
LISA STONE: First of all, I think our conference could be as strong as it's
ever been. From top to bottom it's outstanding, great coaches, tremendous
players. It's hard to pick the preseason players of the year and top players
in terms of the best because there's so many. Do I feel snubbed? No. We were
picked 10th last year. We utilized our ranking as motivation. It's really not
where you start, it's where you finish. We've said that all along.  
Again, I'm really excited about this team. They have a taste in their mouths
that keeps them motivated and keeps them working hard. Again, our practices
have been very, very good, and the whole thing with everybody in this league
is staying healthy. You're one injury away from a different look of your team.
But I hope that this entire conference stays healthy because my hope is that
there's our largest number of participants in the NCAA Tournament this year
from our league.  
  
Q. Ohio State and Iowa, they were one-two in both polls. Are those the two?
Ohio State is obviously the team to beat, but are those the two --  
LISA STONE: I think without question, there's no doubt about it. Both had
outstanding seasons. What Iowa did last year with a lot of injuries and not a
lot of players, you just look at players like Jantel Lavender, Sammy Prahalis
and Kacine Alexander. They're three of the best. They return everybody and
they have an opportunity to continue to raise the bar for the entire league.  
I think there's a lot of teams. It'll be interesting to see how it all pans
out February 1st, where are the standings at. It's exciting, and that says a
lot about our league.  
  
Q. If there's one key to you guys really achieving and going further, is
there a position or a couple players that have to really bring it more than
maybe they have in the past?  
LISA STONE: Well, first of all, we must carry over and continue to have our
team be one of the top defensive teams in the league. In terms of position, we
have got to get points in the paint. We have capabilities with Zastrow, Tara
Steinbauer, Anya Covington, her last ten games of the last year were
outstanding, really made a difference for us. Ashley Thomas is a junior now,
great defender. Her production inside we're looking forward to, and we've
added 6'5" Cassie Rochel, a freshman. We need to have a presence inside. We've
been very guard heavy in the past. Alyssa Karel speaks for herself. She's a
tremendous player. Jade Davis and Taylor Wurtz, those three all can put up
numbers from outside, but we have got to strike oil inside, and I'm excited
about that.  
They know that's the approach. We've attacked our preseason workouts in terms
of offense from the inside out, and we want to get up and down the floor a
little bit, get a little bit more offense from our defense. I can't handle
turnovers. So we're working hard on taking care of the basketball.  
But bottom line is that ball has got to go inside and we have to have some
production in there.  
  
Q. Ohio State-Wisconsin Football game, and I know your program is close with
the men's program and the football program. What did that kind of experience
mean for you guys in practice?  
LISA STONE: For our entire institution, not just athletically and not just the
victory, but that environment was unbelievable. To be a part of that
environment was absolutely awesome. The coverage we've gotten nationally we've
built on. Certainly our hats off to Brett and his football program. Bo had an
event at the fieldhouse that they covered, and our hockey team was practicing.
They went out and they covered our entire university. You saw our campus. The
weather was beautiful. The goal posts they were trying to take down. The fans
were unbelievable. It was a great day to have recruits on campus. I'm not
going to lie about that. You couldn't have scripted it better.  
But from that game now, I mean, Wisconsin was on the map, but it's a credit to
what that football team did that day to continue the visibility.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
SUZY MERCHANT: Good morning. Well, as everyone I think we're just excited to
get things started and feel good about our team and our program. I certainly
feel good about what we did last year and want to build off of that. I think
we have a good mix of veteran kids coming with some youth that has really
added a different climate. We're ready to step forward and just take the
hardwood and get after it a little bit this year. I don't know if you want me
to go through my players or how you want me to do this. I'll continue a little
bit then and open it up.  
I think when you look at our team, it's always as every team goes, a senior-
laden team and I love our seniors. Kalisha Keane, Brittney Thomas and Cetera
Washington, those three kids have started on and off since they've been
freshmen. They've got a wealth of experience. They really have a tenacity and
understanding of the rigors of the Big Ten and certainly what it takes to
compete at the highest level, and I think when you have that in your senior
leaders, it trickles down to everybody.  
We're excited about what they have to offer. I think Kalisha Keane is one of
the most versatile players that there is in the league and really challenging
to defend face-up four-man. Brittney Thomas has gone back and forth the last
couple years between an off guard and a point guard, and she's just one of the
best defensive players in the conference, and I think it starts there, and
she's really built up her focus to be a better offensive player and more of a
threat from the perimeter.  
And then Cetera Washington. I think every team needs that player that is just
full of heart and soul, that hustles, that has that personality. She's one of
the best leaders in the locker room and really contributes to us in a lot of
ways that don't make stat sheets.  
So those three kids I think, no question, have the wealth of experience that
we need to kind of explain what's about to happen to this new freshman class,
as we have four freshman that are coming in and expect them to see some
playing time certainly.  
Questions?  
  
Q. You have a heralded freshman class. Talk about some of the things that
they bring and how much you think they'll be able to play.  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, I think everyone is certainly talking about Madison
Williams. She's our 6'7" McDonald's All-American, very athletic and plays
close to the rim. Just a very aggressive rebounder. I think you'll see her
biggest contribution early on the defensive end. I think it's going to take
some time to build her into an offensive threat. But she can score, it's just
a matter of working with her to get a little bit stronger. But I really see
her as a tremendous asset. She can run, she catches the ball, she's got great
hands. So that's a starting point.  
And you know, it's nice to have that length because we've had it for four
years, when we graduated Alyssa. So it is nice defensively to just of just be
able to insert that same prototype in some aspects to have an understanding of
what to do and how to use her. And also what teams did to try to take that
length away. So we're excited about Madison.  
Annalise Pickrel is from Grand Rapids Catholic Central, and has really --
every day she just elevates her game more and more. She's a 6'3" one through
five. We started her playing at some four. She can play the three spot. You
can post her. She can face up and shoot it. She's a 6'3" guard that can post.
So we're really excited about what she has to offer and have been very
impressed with her abilities and her work ethic.  
And then we have Klarissa Bell who was Miss Basketball in the state of
Michigan from East Lansing. She fits exactly what we look for in our guard
play. She's got length, she's a bigger guard, she has quickness, has a high
understanding of the game, high IQ.  
The thing that we weren't sure about Klarissa as much that we've been excited
about is her ability to shoot the basketball from the perimeter. We knew she
was a driver, slasher, pull-up jumper but we didn't see her shoot a lot of
three-point shots but she's proven to us that that's this other arsenal.  
And then Bryonna Davis out of Merrillville, Indiana, she's really coming on
strong although she did kind of go down with an injury last week, but we'll
get her back here in the next couple weeks. She's doing a nice job of playing
a two and a one for us.  
  
Q. A couple weeks ago you talked about trying to push the tempo. That was
the plan anyway. How is that going? And is it developing the way you wanted it
to? And have you had to tweak it now that you've seen everybody on the
court?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, I think that has been something that we definitely felt
like we needed to be able to do with our speed at the post position. You know,
we do -- this team can play small ball and really speed things up, and it's a
team that also can play power basketball at the same time.  
How has it gone? Sometimes good, sometimes bad, quite honestly. But the
difference is what we're trying to do is not only run but then try to keep the
pressure on the defense, kind of in a secondary phase with some different
actions that we're trying to do to keep the flowing going before we have to
call a set, where in the past we kind of run, if we didn't get it, we kind of
got into our set offense.  
We're kind of in the in-between stage of giving up on your break prior to
calling a play is what we're targeting. I feel like that's gone extremely
well. I feel like our kids have picked up on that and are excited about
keeping the pressure on the defense in that way.  
  
Q. One of the players that you talked about, you talked about versatility,
you've got a big guard that can shoot, who can play defense and everything. Is
that something that's kind of become the image that you've wanted to get,
where players can go multiple ways to enable you guys to play different
ways?  
SUZY MERCHANT: You know, I've always been a huge fan of big guards and posting
guards. We have Lykendra Johnson who can do that at the three and she can play
some four. My thing is less about playing multiple positions, but I've always
loved to have big guards at the swing positions, at the two and the three. We
have Courtney Schiffauer back who blew her knee out, who was our leader scorer
last year before she went down. She's a six foot guard that we can post, too,
that has some toughness down there. For me it's probably a little bit less
about multiple positions and it's more about what kind of pressure we can put
on people from the guard position to have to defend us on the block, and then
also have the ability to keep them honest on the perimeter, as well.  
I don't always look for that in our fours and fives. I like power basketball,
too. So I guess to answer your question, I don't really look at that as much
in those positions. It's nice if you have it, but I don't really feel like
that's a box I have to check in the recruiting piece. But I do need it in the
guard play. I love big, athletic guards.  
  
Q. What about the poll? Is that something you pay any attention to?
Obviously there's expectations. How do you deal with expectations if you don't
talk about the poll?  
SUZY MERCHANT: I think every year players become accustomed to the polls and
the preseason and the expectation there, and I think it's just really about
managing your own team in your own family and your own program and trying to
keep it as tight knit as you can. No championships are ever won in October or
September, so whether you're in the poll, out of the poll, to me there's
really no emphasis placed on that from my perspective.  
I think maybe the only other issue would be is if you're picked to win it all,
then maybe you need to address things a little bit and focus a little bit. But
other than that, I don't think any coaches put a lot of credence in what
happens in October.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Joe McKeown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19252)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
JOE McKEOWN: Just really excited about our team this year. We have a lot of
experience coming back I think for the first time in a while. I think we spent
the last two years building a foundation of what we feel like it takes to win
in the Big Ten and compete nationally. Hopefully if we can stay healthy, it'll
be a really -- not just a good year but a fun year, because the last two years
have been a lot of challenges for us trying to rebuild this program.  
I just feel like we're on the right track. That's about it.  
  
Q. I just have a question about Meshia Reed one of your seniors. She's been
a spot player the past couple years. Do you see her role increasing at all or
any change during her senior year?  
JOE McKEOWN: Well, I hope so. I asked her last year to come off the bench and
be the best sixth player in the Big Ten, and she kind of embraced that role
and really helped us. I think as a senior you want to reward her for those
type of things, but she's worked really hard in the off-season. I'm kind of
looking forward to seeing how she comes out in November and December.  
  
Q. Last year you lost Kristin Cartwright but you have a couple new freshmen
and transfers. How have they integrated into the team?  
JOE McKEOWN: I think we're still trying to get people to merge into the right
traffic lanes right now, and I think for our freshmen it's been a big change.
We do have a transfer, Tailor Jones, from the University of Florida, who sat
out last year, and the same thing, they haven't played basketball in college
or it's been a while. So I think at the end of the year by the time we get to
March or late February, I think they're all going to have to help us for us to
be good. Mylan Woods is a freshman from Ohio, is really gifted. But trying to
pick up a whole new system, a whole new way of playing basketball. They just
need to get some time.  
But La'Terria Taylor is from Chicago, Von Steuben High School, got hurt the
first day of practice, so she hasn't practiced yet, but I think we'll get her
at some point. And then our other freshman Meghan McKeown has played pretty
well so far for what we've asked her to do. So all those guys I think will
help us down the road.  
  
Q. When you took over this program, it wasn't a winning program. I believe
one Big Ten win the season before you came. What has been the hardest part in
making it to the Women's NIT this year and possibly an NCAA berth this year?  
JOE McKEOWN: Well, I think when you take over a program that had such a poor
history for about a 10, 12-year run, you just try to change the culture of --
you have to start with the players in the locker room, start with the people
in the gym and kind of work your way up, and I think that's what we did, just
really started within and just changed people's attitudes about how to work,
the commitment that needs to be made to play in the Big Ten, from a recruiting
standpoint to really put Northwestern out there as what it is, one of the top
academic schools in the world and an opportunity to play.  
And for us to be out there recruiting against the Stanfords and the Dukes and
the people like that, they're the changes I felt like we had to make. I think
some of these are short-term changes and some are long-term changes. But I
think the thing that helped me more than anything else is having an Amy
Jaeschke in your program when I got there, who's now to me one of the premier
players in the country. It gave us somebody to build around and somebody to
also just give our players some confidence that, hey, we have somebody we can
compete as a teammate, too, if that makes sense.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what Amy has done to improve and where her game is at
right now?  
JOE McKEOWN: I think the biggest thing she's done, she's taken on the
challenges that myself, our coaching staff, has put on her, not to change who
she is personally. She's a terrific kid, in the community. The kids love her
on campus. She's done more or campus than probably 90 percent of the student
body in doing things. She works hard in the community. She's a terrific young
lady. I think where she has really helped herself as a player is learning how
to compete every day, realizing how good she is. Coaches live in cliché
worlds, but one of the things, she's so unselfish that it becomes selfish, and
what I mean by that, she wants to pass -- she wants to get everybody else
involved, and at the end of the day, I told her, you're a role player, and
your role is to be an All-American, your role is to score.  
And sometimes -- so I think now she's starting to embrace, kind of like that
again, where the ball goes through her, and she -- I think it's more those
type of things. The other thing she did last year that was probably a little
bit deceiving because she's challenged a little bit vertically, but she led
the Big Ten in blocked shots in a league with tremendous post players and
size. Some people playing last year are in the NCAA record books. I think
she's really changed the way she plays defense because when we got here she
didn't play defense. It was an upward spiral.  
And then really just her work ethic now, even her -- her understanding of how
good she can be. That's a long answer, but she's so -- she's a really gifted
kid.  
  
Q. As you go into your third season here at Northwestern, what are some of
your realistic expectations going into the season, and as you keep the
rebuilding process going forward, in recruitment and other things?  
JOE McKEOWN: Well, I think last year was a big step for us just because they
hadn't had a winning season since I think 1997 or '96. And we had big mile
markers along the way. We beat DePaul for the first time, we beat Purdue for
the first time since I think '94. When you hear those numbers, you realize
we've got some work to do. But our players that are here now believe that they
can play with anybody, and I think that's the important thing.  
As we go forward, as tough as the league is, it's just convincing our players
you've got to compete every night, and then from a recruiting standpoint to
just let people know. In our sport, in women's basketball, there's a lot of
great players out there that to me would fit the profile of a Northwestern.
When you look at Stanford, back-to-back Final Fours, you look at what Duke is
doing, you look at what a lot of institutions that are similar to us, and I
think we should be in the mix with those schools recruiting. That's our goal.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Felisha Legette-Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16871)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I'm just really excited about our team this year. This
is the first recruiting class that I signed to Indiana when I first got there,
and now they're all seniors. Andrea McGuirt, Whitney Lindsay and Jori Davis.
So this really would be neat for it to be a circular thing where they came in
with their legacies and they go out accomplishing them. I'm excited about our
rookies willing to help and our -- Sasha Chaplin is healthy and excited to be
out there for hopefully a full season.  
Indiana is practicing hard right now. We are excited about where we are and
looking forward to a great year.  
  
Q. When you look over your schedule, can you pinpoint a couple games that
you can already see are kind of going to be critical for your team's success
this season?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Yeah, Alaska-Anchorage, our exhibition game. We don't
look ahead. We're not that in-depth where we can see what game is going to
change our season. We've just never been that kind of a coaching staff or
team. So we're taking it day by day and we're excited about next Tuesday when
we have our first challenge with another opponent. Alaska-Anchorage is an
unbelievable Division II school that won 31 games last year and vying for a
championship again this year. It's going to be a great opportunity for us to
see where we are.  
  
Q. Can you briefly talk about the off-season and additionally what you've
seen so far from the team during the preseason.  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, you know, from what Tom Morris, our strength and
conditioning trainer, has said to us, they came in and they worked really hard
and did some really great things. They challenged themselves for a lot of
things. We've changed. We usually run the mile and a half when we get back
from summer vacation, and we do a lot of distance things. But that seemed to
not work well for us, so we made a major change in our strategy and we took
out all the running and made it more basketball impact. It took us a while to
get caught up because they went and trained for something totally different
than what we began in September. Although we were excited, it did take some
time to catch up with the quickness of the drills that we implemented right
away.  
I like the strength of our young ladies. I think Jori Davis might be the
strongest young lady that I've ever coached. She's really -- you look at her
frame, she doesn't look like she's strong but you challenge her, you might be
in trouble. I think our strength and conditioning guy did a great job of
getting them strong, and I believe that we're going to be okay.  
Now, one kid stayed away from us all summer and we did that calculatedly.
Whitney Lindsay, our point guard, went back home, she went to point guard
camp. She became a coach. She coached an AAU team and she really was on her
own island, and that's what we wanted for her, to understand what it's like to
be a head coach, so hopefully she can be that general for us this year. It
worked out well so far, and I hope that the strategy works during the season.  
  
Q. A lot of your newcomers have more size than you've been able to enjoy in
your tenure at Indiana. You were a post player yourself. Do you feel like
you're going to be able to play a style that you would rather play this year
because you have that size up front?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: I really enjoy having size for a change. Whitney Thomas
is quite jealous right now because she's 5'11", had to go up someone at 6'9"
and a young lady at Michigan that was 6'7", and she would have loved to have
been out on that perimeter and attacking from the perimeter but we had no
size. Now we do have Simone Deloach, Sasha chaplain and Georgie Jones who will
join us in December, and Andujar, all over 6'2".  
The neat thing is we're tall, the uncomfortable thing is that we're not as
fast as I would like us to be. So I have to balance in my head how quick a big
kid is supposed to be because I never had that. We had Sasha a little bit for
two years but not for an entire season. I have to back up a little bit and
allow them to get down the floor, but when they get down the floor I think the
wingspan is going to be quite interesting.  
I like the way we're playing defense this year. We certainly don't know what
we're doing on the defensive end, but for some reason they manage to still get
the deflections, their hand on the ball, the steals, and I think it's because
of the wingspan that we have right now. So it's going to be fun to see, but I
must say I'm cautiously optimistic.  
  
Q. People that see Jori play a lot really appreciate what a great player she
is. Is it frustrating at all to you that sort of on a national basis that if
you said Jori Davis most people around the country wouldn't know who she is?
And is there anything you guys can do to elevate her or is it just the way it
is?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Well, I'm disappointed in a sense. We certainly don't
live on individual accolades, but I thought she did enough work in our
conference to get a little bit of notoriety. But again, it's Indiana. We have
not done much in our conference through the changing of the guard so many
times and now we have a strong foundation, and she's the one that's been
caught in the crossfire, in my opinion. The only way that we can go out there
and show her greatness and her ability is to go out there and compete and not
just compete but to win, and we really need to do that because Jori Davis is
absolutely a special young lady and not too many people can stop that
individual and stop the entire team. That's our challenge, to make the team
more successful and shine the light on somebody that helped get our program
truly out of the basement.  
  
Q. You spoke earlier about it's your first recruiting class and this is all
coming full circle. Had some of those senior leaders communicated to you what
their goals are for this year?  
FELISHA LEGETTE-JACK: Their goals are bigger than basketball, and that's one
reason why I'm excited to have those ladies in our program. They certainly
want to win and they want to win and really bring that great feeling towards
Indiana. But what they want to talk about is what they stand for, the things
that are really bigger than basketball, the challenges they face in their life
that really nobody cares about until you can get that audience to stop and
watch. In order to do that, you have to win a lot of games.  
The first and foremost thing is to win enough basketball games where we can
seize the crowd and allow them to listen and then we want to tell our story,
and our story has never been about basketball. Our story has been about the
microcosm of living and things we want people to know about, but not right now
because there's not enough people to listen, so we've got to do our part. NCAA
is always a goal, and I think that we have said to our team, and I'll share
this with you, that we can't just kind of continue to go on saying, oh, it's
Indiana, we're in the basement, we're coming out of that. We've got to have a
little swagger, a little more confidence about ourselves and we've got to have
a lot more fun, and changing our thought process from the defensive side to
the offensive side. And hopefully through this process our young ladies will
win enough games where they can tell their story.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
JOLETTE LAW: This year we're building off of where we finished last year. Our
kids have been very motivated, highly energized. We lost to Illinois State at
the buzzer last year, and all summer long we've been just building off of
that. It's just fortunate our game opener will be November 12th against
Illinois State, so our kids are focused and they're working extremely hard.  
Karisma Penn, Kersten Magrum and Lydia McCully have really stepped into the
leadership role, and really I feel like this team right now, we might be
lacking height, but the energy and the competitiveness is there. So we're
looking forward to our season.  
  
Q. I know it's your fourth year, but it's really a big transition year
considering who you lost from last year's team. What will your team be about
as far as when we see you guys playing?  
JOLETTE LAW: I know we lost Jenna Smith and Lacey Simpson, and they were key
in our offense last year, but this year we're smaller. We're going to press a
little bit more, do a little bit more things that I was used to doing when I
was at Rutgers. We just have to throw a lot of defensive schemes, probably
play a lot more four guards, one-post offense, and right now I'm just trying
to train everyone to play at all positions. That's the theme right now. We're
not trying to look at what we do. Just right now everybody has to play a
bigger role and step up and do more. It won't be about one person, Karisma
Penn or Lydia McCully but collectively as a team. That's what we've been
preaching all summer long, team chemistry and everyone doing more and taking
on a bigger role.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your freshman class and how they'll transition into
some playing time this season.  
JOLETTE LAW: You know, I'm looking at Centrese McGee is doing a great job
catching on. She has a great basketball IQ. She's been doing extremely well.
Alexis Burke, very, very talented player, just teaching, moving her around.
She's really a perimeter, but she's a bigger, taller-sized guard. But just
putting her in down at the guard position, working her a little bit on the
post.  
And the two freshmen have really come in and really added to my nucleus. I
look forward to seeing -- you'll definitely see a lot of my freshmen making a
big impact this year.  
  
Q. You talked about the smaller team you're going to be putting on the court
this year. What style of play would you like to implement to accommodate
that?  
JOLETTE LAW: I know in the past we were probably more of a man-to-man defense.
Our background has been like man and zone plays. Probably this year you'll see
a lot more different zones, probably a lot of three quarter-court press, so I
can't really full-court press. We're not going to be afraid to do a lot of
different things, but we'll probably throw a lot of different match-ups on and
mix it up a little bit more than we did in the past. And definitely try to
make our defense create our offense. When you have a smaller lineup we can get
after it a little bit more.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
Q. When you look at some games last season like when you were on the road
against Indiana and maybe lost a game that you technically weren't supposed to
lose, what areas are you looking to improve upon for this season?  
JIM FOSTER: Well, I don't necessarily think losses are the only things that
give you an indication as to what you've got to improve on. Depth in the post
and a little more versatility at the guard position, and I think we have a
freshman class that's going to give us depth in the post. Tayler Hill and
Amber Stokes have shown that they can play the point position, which makes us
deep in that area, also.  
  
Q. Sustaining success like you have is pretty rare. What's been the secret
from your end to maintaining the success year after year with all the
expectations that come with it?  
JIM FOSTER: Good players. You know, coaches can't win games without good
players, and I've been fortunate to have some very, very good players in our
tenure at Ohio State. I think that continues to be the case.  
So it makes your job a lot easier when you walk in and you've got those
components and pieces there. Right now Lavender and Prahalis are very, very
competitive players, which makes for great practices.  
  
Q. Players like Jantel and Prahalis who have had so much accomplishment and
they play on national teams, how do they bring that experience back to your
team?  
JIM FOSTER: It's been my experience over the years that players that play in
the framework of USA Basketball come back better because they develop an
understanding that there's another level in them. When you're on one of those
teams -- and it's not so much about the games necessarily as the practices. I
don't think players of that ilk are used to having that kind of competition on
a daily basis, and so you've got -- they may be together ten days, practice
twice a day, and you have to work harder than you've ever worked in your life,
and you find out you can work harder than you've worked in the past. I think
that's what they come back with, a heightened sense of the reality of what you
need to do to be better.  
  
Q. I know one thing you take a lot of pride in every year is your players
get better in something or a couple of things. In Sammy's case, last year she
really got better by leaps and bounds shooting the basketball. What difference
are we going to see in her this year?  
JIM FOSTER: I think a consistency of between the ears and on the floor. I'm
sensing and seeing a great deal of maturity, as it should be. When you come
in, you're an 18 year old with a bunch of high school AAU experiences, and
then you start to get a learning process.  
From a basketball point of view, she's playing at a very high level at a great
tempo, and it doesn't matter what combination we have her playing with at
practice. So I just think she's maturing, as she should, as she enters her
junior year.  
  
Q. In many ways this is a big, big year. Jantel is a senior, sort of
everything -- you've got great sophomores, incoming freshman. What do you
think is -- I know you hate when I ask this question, but what's one or two
things that would take you to that level you want to get to this year?  
JIM FOSTER: I think you have to have good players. I think we have good
players. I think you have to negotiate a difficult schedule, and I think you
have to have a degree of luck.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Pam Borton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14360)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
PAM BORTON: Well, we're really excited to get our season started and excited
about my returning players. I really like this team. In the past couple weeks
of practice, they're a fun team to coach, they work extremely hard. There's a
lot of intensity in practice, and I'm a coach where what you see in practice
is what you're going to see in a game. Just the intensity level, the effort
level, and that's what I've been very, very excited to see, a lot of
improvement.  
We've got three starters returning from last year in China Antoine. She is our
point guard, earned a starting position towards the middle of the season last
year and went down with a knee injury in the middle of January, but she's
healthy and mentally, physically ready to go, which we're excited to have her
back.  
And then Kiara Buford is also -- she was our leading scorer from last year,
returning, as well. Really improved her game, her leadership, and she's
rearing to go.  
And then Jackie Voigt is our other starter, starting at the power forward
position, and we're really excited about the leadership that they bring and
their experience.  
And then with our young freshman class and everyone else that really has a
lack of experience has really improved over the summer and through the
preseason, and we're really excited about this team and what we can accomplish
this season.  
  
Q. After sort of a disappointing finish from last year, do you feel like
you've had to sort of change the culture in any way to get this team back on
the winning track?  
PAM BORTON: Yeah, I felt like we lost a little bit of the culture last year. I
think one out of the many things that I learned last year was how much one
player means to your team, and two years ago we graduated Emmy Fox, and just
her being a playmaker at the point and just really what she brought to the
team and how she made everybody better on the floor, and we didn't have that
kid last year. People say, well, you're only graduating one player, but that
one player really meant a tremendous amount to our team with her being a
playmaker and making everybody better.  
China really turned into that kid during the year, and very, very unexpected
when she went down that we really didn't kind of pick up the slack with some
of the others. But out of many things in a program, there is a lot of changes,
a lot of things need to be made, and you just kind of look at things
differently to kind of get yourselves back on track.  
  
Q. Do you think Kiara Buford can kind of do some of the things that Emily
Fox did? You talked about using her a little bit at point. Can she be that
playmaker for you?  
PAM BORTON: I'm not sure if that's one of Kiara's strengths is being a
playmaker. I think Kiara is a scorer. I think there's a lot of different ways
that Kiara can score maybe a little bit better than Emmy did. But I think
Kiara has matured over the year as far as being a go-to player in certain
situations in a game, consistency, her leadership, just taking responsibility
and accountability. But I think a playmaker is a special type of player that
really can help make others better.  
I think Kiara is, like I said, more of a scorer. But I think a year ago it was
a fine line, as well, where we lost, I think, four games, and we had the game
won and didn't get a defensive stop or a rebound, and those four games put you
in the top four of the Big Ten. So I think it's just a fine line and trying to
figure out a way to finish basketball games, as well.  
  
Q. A couple of transitions in terms of your staff. How has that affected
this team, for that to happen once the season had already started?  
PAM BORTON: Well, I think that position is really replaceable as far as that's
concerned, but losing one of your top assistant coaches right before practice
starts, there's never a good time to lose an assistant, especially a good
assistant, if it's in the summer, spring, whenever it is. But one thing for
our program that has been very consistent and stable has been our players.
It's been practice. It's been what we've been able to accomplish basketball-
wise in the gym, and that's been awesome.  
But I think things happen for a reason, and I think change is always a good
thing, and we're moving forward.  
  
Q. After a couple of weeks of practice, do you have a good sense of what
your rotation is going to look like? Can you talk about some of the new
players that you think will be a part of that?  
PAM BORTON: I think a lot of the young kids are young, they're working hard, I
think they're learning. I think the rotation is becoming a lot clearer every
day. If you asked me four or five days ago I would have said absolutely not.
But there's still a couple positions with people coming off the bench -- I
think this team has a high ceiling, has a lot of room for growth. I thought
last year we were who we were because we were so -- we had such a veteran-
laden team and I just felt like there wasn't a lot of room for growth or
improvement. But the rotation is becoming a lot more clear and there are a
couple spots that are still being observed.  
  
Q. Does anyone stand out among your recruiting classes or a player that
you've seen in practice that has really surprised you and impressed you?  
PAM BORTON: I think the one player that's really come along in the last week
has been a player that finished pretty strong toward the end of the year was
Katie Loberg. She's 6'4", a lot of athleticism, probably one of the fastest
players on our team at 6'4", and I think it's been a breath of fresh air to be
able to watch her grow and do the things that she's been able to do,
especially in the post. We weren't able to get a lot of offense in our post
for the last couple years. That's something that we've been really stressing,
and it's been nice to see her. We've got three out of our four freshmen that
are probably going to help us out right away. We're trying to speed up the
learning curve for them a little bit just because of their versatility and
what they're going to be able to bring us down the road.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Kevin Borseth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18022)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
KEVIN BORSETH: Good morning, everybody. It's my job to make sure these
microphones work so you can hear everybody else afterwards. Anyway, I thought
I was talking for ten minutes, so I was prepared to talk for ten minutes. I
didn't think you were going to ask any questions because we have the round
tables afterwards.  
Excited to get the season started. It's been an interesting preseason. As you
know they've changed the dynamics of preseason practice for women's
basketball. We went from a 40-day window from our first game back to October
3rd, so we've been practicing already for basically three weeks for the most
part, which has been a lot different than what we've had before.  
It's been kind of an interesting change, given us more time to slow down,
construct, probably more than we've done in the past. I think there's been a
sense of urgency with the October 15th start trying to get everything in on
time, and this has been a nice change and a more relaxing change for us in
terms of trying to get our program ready. So that was the change in the
practice schedule. The men didn't have that, the women are the only one that
had it, and I don't know, but it is what it is.  
This year Veronica Hicks is our only senior this year. She's back for her
third starting year. Going to be our leader. Last year did a great job scoring
for us in double figures and she's our defensive stopper. She'll get a chance
to see a little point guard action this year as well so she can relive some of
her high school days. Go back and do that. She's good ball handler so that'll
be a welcomed change from that perspective.  
We have three juniors, Carmen Reynolds, Courtney Boylan, Jamillya Hardley.
Carmen Reynolds started every game last year. Played a little bit the year
before. Very good shooter, look to do some of the same stuff this year.
Courtney Boylan will be our point guard this year at this point as it starts.
Courtney was Miss Basketball in the state of Minnesota her senior year in high
school. Played four years of high school as a starting point guard. Did a real
good job with their program there, so we've got a lot of confidence in
Courtney's ability. Of course she was Miss Basketball in Minnesota her senior
year, as well.  
Our sophomore class is loaded with five players. It was a class that we
recruited that was a top-20 recruiting class when it came in starting with
Jenny Ryan. Jenny is our third starter back from last year. Jenny, very
determined kid. She was Miss Basketball in Michigan her senior year of high
school, and has developed an outside shot now to be able to shoot the ball a
little bit better. Of course very tenacious, very hard working and one of
those kids that's just a natural born leader. Very excited to have her.  
The other four, Nya Jordan is one of our kids that's going to be a pleasant
surprise for us. Extremely athletic, very aggressive. Coachable kid. Another
one of those defensive stopper kids and kids that can create.  
Sam Arnold, 6'4" kid out of Chicago. Sam is a kid that can shoot it. Hasn't
seen a lot of playing time last year but will see it this year.  
Kate Thompson out of Minneapolis, another 6'3" kid, going to get a chance to
see some guard play, big kid.  
And Rachel Sheffer is a kid that we've had from Watervliet, that's going to
get an opportunity to play a little bit down low, as well. So we're kind of
sorting all that out.  
We've got two kids in our freshman year, Val Driscoll and Kendra Seto. Kendra
Seto is a red shirt and Val Driscoll is a big kid we got out of the east
coast, about a 6'4" post kid, kind of our answer to Krista Phillips from last
year, so that's kind of the makeup of this year's squad and we're excited to
get started.  
We're ready to get going. We've got a very difficult schedule this year. We
play the likes -- at our home games we play against Kansas, Xavier, Boston
College, we go out to a Cancun tournament and play Texas A & M. In the ACC
Challenge we play Wake Forest. In the Big 12 Challenge we play Iowa State. So
you can tell our schedule is loaded with very good teams. It's the kind of
thing we like to do to see where we're at in our preseason, and challenge the
kids right off the bat and get ready for the Big Ten season.  
The Big Ten is probably as good a conference top to bottom as any in the
country, as evidenced last year by the fact that every program had a winning
record and everybody had I think 11, 12, 13 wins last year. Pretty remarkable
top to bottom for a conference. Very balanced, very even and very competitive
within. So it's going to be a tough year, but we're looking forward to the
challenge.  
  
Q. Obviously Krista was such a big part of everything that you did because
she had been there a long time and you're so used to her. Do you change the
strategy without her even though you have some size?  
KEVIN BORSETH: Well, that's what we're going to work early a little bit. When
we first came here our first year defensive strategy-wise we used a lot of
things that we've done in the past as a coaching staff. K.P. was one of those
kids that didn't really wanted to do what we wanted her to do defensively in
the post area, so we had to kind of adjust to what she did because she was
good at what she was doing. So the last two years we were a little softer
defensively, we caught a lot more. This year I don't know that we're going to
be able to do that. Val Driscoll is a kid that's got the ability to do that
because of her size. We might modify it and go back to what we did the first
year and be a little bit more aggressive defensively.  
Defending the post is the biggest thing. Of course then high risk/high reward
when you start to gamble in those respects. Makes your kids work harder, they
play better that way and they don't have time to sit around and think whether
they're going to do good or bad. They're too busy running around covering
themselves up. So we have to work. That's a good question, though.  
  
Q. After setting a record wins for a season, what are your goals for the
future?  
KEVIN BORSETH: Well, I think every program in the Big Ten wants to be a
contender for the Big Ten title every year. I think every coach will tell you
that and that's certainly a goal that we have, an opportunity to play in the
NCAA Tournament every year is certainly a goal that we have. I'm sure every
team in the country probably has that game goal and we're certainly no
different. We want to be able to build on last year. Last year was a great
year obviously, and to be able to build on that this year and to be more
successful would be extremely rewarding and a direction we want to head in.  
  
Q. When you advance as far as you did in the tournament, obviously through
the tournament you're talking about the importance of staying alive and
advancing, but do you go back to say, remember the run or say the NCAA is
obviously the goal?  
KEVIN BORSETH: Well, I think everybody in their -- you've got it set to be a
Big Ten contender, get in the NCAA Tournament. That's what you want to be able
to do, get in the Big Dance. Anytime you get an opportunity to play in post
season like we did last year -- it extends your season. It was a lot of fun
for our players. They got some tournament experience. They ran deep into the
WNIT and certainly that was rewarding. So I don't want to shortchange that
because it was certainly a lot of fun and a great opportunity and it certainly
was successful. We don't go back and even talk about that at this point. Our
eyes are forward, we're just trying to proceed with this year and be a little
bit better.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEDIA DAYS
(WOMEN)](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEDIA+DAYS+%28WOMEN%29)

  

## October 28, 2010

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

  
_CHICAGO, ILLINOIS_  
  
LISA BLUDER: I just want to congratulate Kachine for being named to the
preseason team. It's a great recognition for her. With this conference being
such a tremendous conference with so many great players coming back, I just
think it's a tremendous honor for her, and I'm happy for her.  
It's a different situation for us coming in. I don't know that we've ever been
picked to finish second in the Big Ten, and we know obviously it's all
preseason, really garbage and trivia. But at the same time it really has to
change the mentality of our team. Our team is used to kind of sneaking up on
people and kind of people taking us lightly, and now our attitude has got to
change. We worked on that this summer, going from being the hunters to being
the hunted. It's a different attitude that I think an athlete has to have. An
athlete earns that and I think our team earned it last year, but now you have
to live up to it and that's the most difficult part.  
We're excited to begin the year. Here it is Big Ten Media Day. That means it
is right around the corner. I think our team is starting practices earlier
this year, and we're ready to put on the uniform and get ready to go.  
  
Q. When you look at last year, the way you started out both with injuries
and in on-court performance, how were you able to kind of get the team to move
forward, move past those problems, and then have the kind of season that you
had?  
LISA BLUDER: There's a number of things. We started out last place in the Big
Ten. We were 1-6. It was pretty dismal. But at the same time in those six
losses, we were right there. We had an overtime loss, we had several of those
losses on the road by just a couple of points. So we knew we were right there,
and we knew we had a talented group, but we were constantly battling, changing
starting lineups and people -- another person drops and who's going to be it
this week. We had freshmen taking on roles they had never expected that they
were going to be in.  
The beautiful thing is that they grew up earlier than most freshmen grow up,
and it was about a third of the way or midway through the Big Ten season when
the lightbulb kind of came on with them that no, I don't have to be a
freshman, I don't have to be a typical freshman, I can be something special
here and there's no reason for me to wait around for that. I've earned it now.
Really it was an attitude of, okay, I'm willing to step up and be good, and
they gained a lot of confidence, and once that confidence started rolling, it
just kept getting bigger and bigger.  
  
Q. I hate to be Debbie downer, but can you talk about Taylor's injury and
how she's handling it, how you're handling it. Obviously it's tough to go
through three ACL tears in 20 months. And with the injuries to her and Trisha,
just how that changes the makeup of the team right now.  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, you're right. We've had two injuries, significant injuries
already this season. Unfortunately we lost Theairra for the season, and
Theairra was looking so good again. She's such a great athlete, and she's just
never been able to show anybody at Iowa what a great athlete she is. She
hasn't been in the lineup consistently. Last year she fractured the eye
socket, missing some games, and then missed the games with the ACL the rest of
the way. I just feel so bad for Theairra. It is tough to come back after three
ACLs. I don't know how many people have ever done that.  
We haven't even talked about it with Theairra yet. In my mind it's totally her
decision. I'm not going to encourage her to come back, and obviously if that's
what is driving her, we'd love to have her back. But at the same time it's not
something that we're going to push hard for.  
How is she handling it? She's unbelievable. She is so positive, I think her
parents are suffering much more than she is right now. I think they're really
upset. But Theairra is handling it absolutely beautifully. She comes to every
practice. She's smiling, she's enthusiastic, she's encouraging everybody from
the sidelines. So she's doing tremendous, probably better than her coaches are
doing with their.  
Trisha, again, that's a tough loss for us, and we hope we might have Trisha
back for the year. We don't know yet. We really just don't know. We've heard
everything from a couple of months to six months out with this, so we just
don't really know what to expect. But that is definitely a blow because she
was our backup point guard, a very important position for us on the team.  
  
Q. Related to that, how is Hannah Draxten doing? She'll have a more
important role now, and how do you adjust your rotation for when Kamille gets
spelled?  
LISA BLUDER: Hannah Draxten has been great. She had back surgery during the
end of the season last year for a herniated disk, and she is playing pain-
free, and so she's tremendous, and we're very thankful to have her back
because she can really play the two or the three for us. Right now it looks
like she'll be back in at both of those positions for us.  
Our plan right now for spelling Kamille is to go with Jamie Printy. She is a
very good point guard. It's what she played all through high school. It's kind
of what she wanted to play when she came to Iowa, so now she's going to have
an opportunity. It's not the best-case scenario. You don't want to back up a
starter with another starter, but it's a situation that she's the best person
for the job, and so we will be doing that. So we'll probably have to give her
a little more release at the off guard with Hannah, with Kalli Hansen a junior
college transfer that we have from Kirkwood that will play our two, three and
four position for us, as well.  
  
Q. Every year is a new year. How do you capture that spirit that your team
had throughout last year? It never carries over, you have to do it again, and
how do you do it?  
LISA BLUDER: You do have to start it all over again, you're right. You can't
sit back as a coach and think, oh, that magic is going to happen again. Really
with our team, so much with the personalities of the women on our team, and
luckily we have all those personalities back. Unfortunately, like, Trisha
Nesbitt was a big part of that. She's such an enthusiastic and positive human
being, and I hope with her being out we don't lose some of that. I've talked
to her about, even from the sidelines, you mean so much to this basketball
team. I think she understands that.  
And all of us know, our team is not dotted with All-Americans, that's not what
our roster is. We're kind of a blue-collar group that has to work extremely
hard, play great team basketball, have that team chemistry, and they all know
that, they understand that. They understand to be successful we have to
emulate the same things that we did last year and embrace the same enthusiasm
and love of the game and love for each other that we had last year. That's the
only way that our team is going to be successful because our margin for error
isn't great.  
  
Q. Ohio State is a giant road block for everybody. Just looking at them, do
they have weaknesses or are they stronger than ever? How do they appear to
you?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, I haven't really sat around and studied Ohio State a
lot in the last couple of months. They have everybody coming back. They're a
great program, a successful program, Player of the Year on their team. I mean,
it's natural. They're a great basketball program.  
I don't think that everybody is going to lay down to Ohio State. I think
they're going to get everybody's best shot, just like they have in the past.
And so, yes, they're the leader and they deserve to be. They've put together a
program that deserves that type of respect. But we're looking forward to
playing them. We have them twice this year. We didn't have them at home last
year, so I think our team is looking forward to that.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2010

  

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

### [Tayler Hill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20551)

### [Jantel Lavender](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18055)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  66  
Iowa - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: Straight to the student-athletes for questions.  
  
Q. Jantel, what are you thinking right now in terms of you were down so far
in that second half? How did you come back? What enabled you to come back and
what are your feelings right now sitting there with a nut around --  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think we just -- we knew we had to get stops. It was kind
of like a nonconversion or offensive end and they kept scoring. We just had to
buckle down and say we were going to jump to the ball, you know, get defensive
stops. Limit them to one shot.  
And I think once we hit like the four-minute mark everybody bought into that
and started boxing out. We only allowed them one shot. And we played defense
down to the end of the shot clock, and that's when I think the game turned
around for us.  
  
Q. Are you surprised having the nut around your neck?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: No, I know we're a championship-caliber team. I know what we
can accomplish and I know how good this team can be. Even though we were down,
I know we have the ability to come back when we're down in the game. And we
showed that yesterday and we showed that today.  
And we just need to make sure we're not in those positions in other games so
we won't have to come back so far and just start the game up-tempo like we
played in the second half.  
  
Q. Jantel, the final seconds, could you take me through turn, body contact,
shot up, what's going through your mind, whether you hear the whistle first
before the miss or whatever, what do you remember from all that?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: The finish was just running through my mind. I knew I had to
finish. I knew it was biggie, knew the ball was coming to me and I had to be
big for my team. No matter what it took I knew I had to turn extremely strong
either get fouled or -- my intentions were just to score the basket. It wasn't
even to get fouled.  
But I knew -- I just wanted to turn strong and I got fouled. And I went to the
foul line and I just took my time, took deep breaths and did what I did all
night.  
  
Q. When you heard the whistle, was there a second there where you're
thinking shot up, you didn't make it, or maybe you saw it wasn't going in and
then you hear the whistle, that sense of relief when you hear the whistle?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Are you asking me was it a sense of relief when I heard it?  
  
Q. Yes.  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Yes, because it was, what, four or five seconds left on the
clock. I knew something had to happen. I went into the defender extremely
strong, so I knew it was going to be -- I was going to finish or something had
to happen. I just knew it was just going to be a foul or a finish.  
  
Q. Tayler, question for you, just basically, again, you guys are way down.
You're 16 points down early in the second half. What enabled you guys to get
back into this game and to get over the hill one more time?  
TAYLER HILL: Like Jantel said, just us getting stops. We kept our composure.
We knew we had to fight back. Iowa's a great team. And our coaches kept their
composure, too. That kept our main players, our leaders on the floor composed.  
  
Q. Tayler, (indiscernible) eight points in the first half and 27. How much
of a focal point was it for you guys to get the ball to her on the block in
the second half?  
TAYLER HILL: It was a big point. Jantel was working her tail off down there.
She worked hard every time we got the ball down there, either fouled her or
she scored. That's where we were trying to get the ball. That was the main
point.  
  
Q. I don't know, Jantel, whether you know this or not, but you passed 2,000
points in this game for your career. And does that even compare with being a
two-time champion for this thing?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: It's an accomplishment. But I think with my fellow teammates
and having this championship and taking this going into the NCAA tournament is
a great feeling. And I don't think anything can really override that right
now.  
2,000 points is great. But I still want to continue to get championships for
my team. It's not about the points, it's about what I have to do that night
for my team or if it's rebounding, if it's scoring, you know what I mean,
passing under the double-team, no matter what it takes, it's about winning for
my team and playing for my team.  
  
Q. Tayler, what did you learn in your first Big Ten tournament?  
TAYLER HILL: That you gotta stay together as a team. No matter what happens.
No matter if we get down. No matter if we're winning we can't let teams come
back and we've always got to fight back to the very end. Like you said, it
goes to the very last second. They played to the very last second. We had to
play to the very last second.  
So just staying together as a team and playing together as a team. Listen to
our coaches and doing the little things that they ask.  
  
Q. Jantel, your thoughts when you're down 16 points in the second half?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Unbelievable. Unbelievable. I mean, I was looking at the
scoreboard, this is unbelievable. Something has to change. We have to get
tough defensively. We have to get tough offensively. And just start playing.
It was unbelievable for me, really. That was my feeling.  
  
Q. Jantel, you guys really didn't play well in the first half. And what are
your feelings about that, that you got yourself, started to get yourself in a
hole that way?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Just coming out and playing up-tempo from the beginning. I
don't know why we were down or not playing defense or jumping to the ball like
we were supposed to.  
It's definitely a learning experience. I think we'll learn a lot from this and
realize that we can't get down like this in a tournament, because that's
really literally going to be the last game of our season.  
So I think once everybody really truly takes that in and understands that and
we can't play around or not convert on offense and not play defense well, you
just learn a lot in this game.  
I think we'll go into practice and realize that we have to have a defensive
mentality from the beginning and not be offense-minded and think the offense
is going to win this game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Congratulations. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, considering the fact that both of your top players were out for a
fair amount of the first half, towards the end, what were your thoughts on
being down by eight points at that point?  
COACH FOSTER: I was surprised that it was eight points. I thought it would be
a little more significant than that. We could not have played more poorly than
we did. And even some of the kids coming in off the bench instead of sort of
helping were sort of throwing gasoline on the fire.  
But games today are a lot different. With all the stoppages of play and
there's an opportunity to sit down and talk a fair amount of time and
continuing to address what needed to be addressed. And if you're coaching the
right kind of kids, eventually they're going to start to listen and get it
figured out or attempt to.  
And I think that's what we did. We preach all year long about certain aspects
of the game. And there's certain things we work on every day that we just
weren't doing in the first half.  
And the last 12 minutes of the game or so we did every possession, we sort of
went from looks like the first day of practice when you're still teaching to
the finished product and what you hope it's going to be. And I thought the
last 12 minutes we were down in stances and we were communicating and we were
rotating and we were taking personal responsibility.  
We started to take it personally that we were getting torched.  
  
Q. Jantel, in this particular game, she had an advantage inside. And how
happy were you with the way your kids kept finding her and giving her the
ball?  
COACH FOSTER: I think it was Chuck Daly, if the 2-play works, keep calling it.
And we're going to the well. And when she's playing like that, you know, it's
a big ladle that keeps coming out of the well. You get rewarded for it.  
  
Q. She tied for the most points anybody's scored in a Big Ten tournament
game. Considering the stage and the circumstances, would you say that this is
her best game?  
COACH FOSTER: I think it's one of them. People tend -- yeah, because it's a
championship game. But we had to win a game at Penn State her freshman year to
win the regular season Big Ten title, and she decided we were going to win
that game. So it's not that she hasn't done it before.  
I think what separates it today in my opinion is we did it against a well-
coached, highly motivated, hungry basketball team. And in the not too distant
future that's all that's going to be left playing.  
So I think this tournament has been good for us in terms of what we emphasized
last week with no game. We had the bye, was defense. We were in the gym really
working on defense, because I think that's the only thing you can improve at
this time of year. You can tweak something. You're not going to change
somebody's shot. You're not going to -- but defense, you can get better. You
can get better today and we'll get better Tuesday, because now they understand
what I was talking about. I'll have a more captive audience.  
  
Q. Coach, your thoughts on your last possession, the foul at 1.9, Jantel's
turn. How did you see it? Good call? What did you think?  
COACH FOSTER: You know, yeah, because you've got to allow the player the
opportunity to get the shot off. And the contact appeared to be significant.
But I'm not going to evaluate that until I look at the tape. There's several
things I would like to see on the tape. It was just interesting. But it's that
time of year.  
And I thought in the first half we were not mature in how we were dealing with
that, and we were complaining. And it's something that's not even in your
control. And you gotta get that out of your head. And you gotta grind.  
And that's what I like best about us in the second half. We put that aside. We
took what was turning into an excuse and made it disappear.  
  
Q. On that last play, Coach, was it designed to go to Jantel all along or
did you give Samantha the option to take that shot?  
COACH FOSTER: No, it was going into Lavender. Now, if there was someone around
her, like three people and we couldn't get it, obviously we're going to have
to make a decision. But I didn't have the stat sheet at the time. But I had a
pretty good idea that her numbers were significant. And they were struggling
to guard her.  
So, yeah, if you've got a First Team All-American, you throw them the ball. If
you're lucid.  
(Laughter)  
  
Q. Once she was out and calmed down a little bit, you got your come back
started without Sammy, but she was a part of the comeback, she didn't back
down, close plays, the drive to tie it at 60. Were you confident she would
rein herself in there?  
COACH FOSTER: I'm happy that after that third foul that she -- I had to take
her out because she wasn't -- she was trying very hard to get her fourth, and
it was a race to the scorer's table. But once we got her back on the bench and
brought her back to reality, I think that was a big spurt of growth for her
going back out there.  
When you're a really good player, you've got really good skills, you learn
lessons at different times in your career. And hopefully she learned a couple
of things today: You can't be that demonstrative with the referees. They're
human beings. And you have to control your emotions if you expect to lead a
team.  
And I think that last blip of time, I think she was doing all that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2010

  

### [Kachine Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19288)

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Kamille Wahlin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19309)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  66  
Iowa - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with opening comments from Coach Bluder, then we'll
go to the student-athletes. Coach.  
COACH BLUDER: Congratulate Ohio State on their victory today. Great team.
Jantel Lavender is the Player of the Year for a reason, and she showed it
tonight with her excellent play, and I feel bad for my team.  
I feel like we played hard. We didn't get the victory and it hurts right now,
but I think we'll bounce back and be ready for the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kamille, what did they change defensively, especially after the half?  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: You know, Ohio State just has really good defense. I think
Shavelle Little has outstanding ball pressure. And they just got in the
passing lanes, and they picked up their intensity on D.  
  
Q. Kachine, at the beginning of the game seemed like things kind of started
off better for you guys. Can you just talk about I guess your feelings at the
beginning of the game, the way it started off?  
KACHINE ALEXANDER: The beginning of the game I think we were playing team
basketball. We were kind of just hitting most of our shots, making smart
shots, getting in the paint, getting easy layups and things like that. I think
that contributed to a lot of our easy buckets.  
  
Q. Kachine, after your fourth foul, did you have to alter your game the way
you wanted to play?  
KACHINE ALEXANDER: I don't know about alter but being smarter with my
selections. I think I just had to be a little bit smarter.  
  
Q. Kachine, you guys aren't the biggest team in the world. How difficult was
Lavender to contain inside?  
KACHINE ALEXANDER: Like Coach said, she's a Big Ten Player of the Year. She's
a great player. Like I said, she's pretty big. But we tried to keep the ball
out of her hands as much as possible, but she got really good position
tonight.  
  
Q. Kamille, on that last shot, it's obviously hard to get a shot 1.9 seconds
left, but what were your thoughts about the shot you ended up getting?  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: I thought I had a pretty good look. I thought Kelly threw the
ball in perfect position. I turned around, I was probably pretty far out on
that. Didn't work to my advantage. But I just tried to get a good look and let
it go in. Unfortunately it didn't go in.  
  
Q. Did it feel good going off your hands?  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: It felt good, but when I saw it in the air, I knew it was off
to the right.  
  
Q. For either player, are you surprised that the foul was called with 1.9
seconds to go?  
KACHINE ALEXANDER: In those type of situations it's where the whistle is going
to blow, sometimes they're not. I wasn't really surprised, neither one,
because they were calling it tight throughout the whole game. So it's just the
way the whistle blows.  
  
Q. Kamille, you guys feel like your body of work is good enough that the
NCAA has to take you guys?  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: Yeah, I think so. From what I hear from other people, you
know, that we do have a good chance of getting in. So hopefully we proved
ourselves in the tournament that we are capable of playing in the NCAA
tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach Bluder.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked them that because we're so used to NCAA tournaments here
with the guys. And towards the end, especially it's let them play. I'm just
wondering if you thought maybe they should let them play at the end there.  
COACH BLUDER: Obviously I wish she wouldn't have made the call. I think it
would have been a great overtime. And it seemed like after that game the way
it was going it should have went into overtime.  
But, again, we knew it was going to Jantel. Everybody in the place knew it was
going there.  
So it is what it is.  
  
Q. Coach, you had to feel good getting Prahalis and Lavender both into foul
trouble in the first half. What were your thoughts on that?  
COACH BLUDER: That was to our advantage. But I don't think we built enough of
a lead at halftime, quite honestly. I think we have should have a bigger lead
with their two guns on the bench.  
  
Q. You came to town with doubts about where you would go after you leave.
You leave pretty much assured that you're going to go to the tournament, yet
you feel, you sound like, a little unfulfilled?  
COACH BLUDER: Just disappointing. You're in this game. You have a 14-point
lead in the second half. I think it was -- 16. And you just feel like -- I
feel bad for my kids. I feel like they really deserve this.  
And I'm not saying Ohio State didn't deserve it. They certainly did. And
they're having that opportunity right now. But it just would have been really,
really neat to see our players have this opportunity.  
So, yeah, I think we played well here. I think we played well against one of
the top teams in the country.  
  
Q. Coach, you just commented about not building up a big enough lead. Had an
11-point lead, then Hill hit a 3, that cut it to 8 before halftime. Your
thoughts on that 3-pointer. But also came out and went on an 8-0 run yourself,
built up that 16-point lead, but still a lot of time in the game?  
COACH BLUDER: There was a lot of time left in the game at that point. We built
a 16-point lead when their guns were in. I feel like there was so much time in
the first half that we didn't convert on opportunities I thought we could have
converted with those two on the bench.  
  
Q. Seemed like early you were able to get a lot of good looks, especially
Kelly there with ten quick points. What was working for you guys there?  
COACH BLUDER: I thought we executed our offense very well to begin this game.
And then the second half I don't think we looked for our pitch opportunities,
our penetrate and pitch enough. I thought we were trying to get to the rim a
little bit too much.  
We weren't getting calls. Sometimes you can draw a foul there, and that wasn't
happening. We kept trying to force the issue instead of really trying to hit
our outside shooters a little bit better. I think we could have done that
better in the second half.  
  
Q. Considering how young your team is, how important is it for you guys to
get to this point, played through this, and what will it mean to your team in
terms of further post-season play and the future?  
COACH BLUDER: We are young. You're right. I don't feel like we're young
anymore, because I feel like we played so much this year. But certainly
they've not been through this experience. This is the first time most of them
have played in a Big Ten tournament. The first time any of them have played in
a Big Ten championship.  
So it's going to do us a world of wonder for the future. It's just going to do
nothing but help us. So if we can get some games in the post-season, that
would be even better.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the play of Kelly Krei, not only today but all
weekend?  
COACH BLUDER: Kelly had a nice weekend for us. And we pride ourselves on being
a very, very balanced team, and I thought Kelly just had a little bit
different gleam in her eye as far as offense for this weekend.  
And that was really nice to see, because I feel like she's so capable and
sometimes she just defers to other people because of her personality. That's
her nature is that don't bring attention to me.  
But this weekend I thought she did a really nice job of trying to set herself
for shots and not hesitating to shoot those shots.  
  
Q. And also it seemed like Kamille seemed to hit a big shot whenever you
guys needed it. Can you talk about her ability to hit those clutch shots all
weekend?  
COACH BLUDER: Big 3 again tonight for us. Hits two clutch free throws towards
the end for us. Kamille is just an incredibly heady player. Very confident. I
feel so confident with her out on the floor with the ball in her hands.  
But I think Shavelle Little did a nice job on her. I think anytime Shavelle
plays that many minutes defensively, you know that there's a lot of respect
for that player she's on.  
  
Q. There were two bang-bang plays early in the second half with the two top
point guards, a scramble, fourth foul on Samantha right in front of you, and
then she takes a charge on Aleksandra Dobranic right after that. Not to
critique the plays, but the swing of which guard ended up with four fouls was
pretty big.  
COACH BLUDER: It was big. I agree with you. And we were pretty happy with it.
We thought it was going to go our way. So it was kind of a little bit of a
shock when it went the other way.  
  
Q. Do you take any consolation getting three players in the All-Tournament
Team when you haven't done that since '01, had any players on?  
COACH BLUDER: I didn't even know that. Yeah, that's tremendous. And I'm happy
for all three of those players. I think they're very deserving of it.
Actually, that's pretty amazing that we have three on there.  
  
Q. I asked your kids, but are you pretty confident four from the conference
will be in the NCAA tournament, Wisconsin and you guys and --  
COACH BLUDER: I feel so. I think we'll have four teams in the NCAA tournament.
I feel confident that we belong there. It's an obvious that Ohio State is
going to be there and Michigan State and Wisconsin having such great RPIs and
being in the top 4 in this conference, I think we'll get four in.  
  
Q. What's it like seeing all the good young players? I think all ten players
that started tonight will be back next year. A lot of good young players
throughout the Big Ten we saw here. Do you feel good about the future of the
league?  
COACH BLUDER: I think that's spectacular. I wish a couple of Ohio State ones
would graduate. That's spectacular and bodes well for our conference.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the perimeter defense overall. Lavender goes 14
for 25. But the rest of their team goes 11 for 37. If you could talk about
that and just how that kept you in the game?  
COACH BLUDER: We should have spent a little more time around Lavender, huh?
She's special. 35 points. We thought we were -- at halftime we had a pretty
good game plan to hold her a little bit. And I think even the beginning of the
second half we still did a good job.  
But you can tell, that's why she's such a great player. When the game's on the
line she's going to perform for you. And that's what makes her so special.
She's so strong. She's so talented.  
She's got beautiful hands. She's just -- in transition they've got some great
transition baskets to bring the score close. And you've got a player like
Jantel Lavender running the floor like that, that's a special player.  
  
Q. I think the first time, when you played before, Hill was just sort of
kind of coming into her own, she has 14 tonight. Does she make them different
to defend when she's contributing?  
COACH BLUDER: She certainly hurt us in the first half with her 3s and we said
the second 3 she made right before halftime was a good momentum for Ohio
State, I thought, going into the locker room.  
But, yeah, when you add that extra person, I think it makes Ohio State so much
more difficult to defend, because you know it's the big 2. But if you can add
that third offensive player. I think that's what makes our team good because
we don't just rely on two people. If I had two to rely on like that I probably
would to do.  
  
Q. You had the timeout with 46 to play and fresh clock, was the intent to go
2 for 1 at that point or just play for the shot?  
COACH BLUDER: We thought if we got a quick good shot off the inbound play, we
were going to try to get the 2 for 1. But if we didn't get a good shot, we
said, Okay, let's run our offense. We actually ran a play at that point to try
to get a good shot. Obviously we turned the ball over and didn't get that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2010

  

### [Aisha Jefferson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16887)

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

### [Brittney Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14521)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Iowa  59  
Michigan State - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening comment from Coach Merchant, then
we'll go to the student-athletes.  
COACH MERCHANT: I thought it was a hard-fought game. It could have gone either
way. I think certainly the difference for us was their rebounding. They scored
19 points off of offensive rebounding situations, and we didn't put ourselves
in position on our end. I think that's the first time that we've had spells
during games where maybe we haven't rebounded that well.  
But that was an entire game where I felt like we just could not get a
defensive rebound for whatever reason. And you have to give Iowa credit for
really hustling after them and taking advantage of maybe us not doing the job
and chasing down opportunities and then taking advantage and scoring, 19-4
there. And I feel if we had cut that down in half we would have won by five or
six. They did a really good job of rebounding it.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Aisha, what is it with Iowa that's given you such problems these last two
games?  
AISHA JEFFERSON: Well, the first game it was basically just fouling them,
getting them to the line. I think we did a good job today containing them on
defense.  
But a big part of our offense is creating offense from our defense. And we
weren't really defensive rebounding, and they scored about 19 second-chance
points from rebounds.  
So that wasn't a good thing for us this second game, but I think it was
definitely two different things from each game.  
  
Q. Aisha, could you talk about your offensive performance today? This was
your season high?  
AISHA JEFFERSON: I think it was mainly because they were playing the 2-3 zone
and the middle wasn't really guarding much and I felt like it was a good
chance for me to just be aggressive there and also help my teammates get
involved, because it was really hard to guard the middle when you're playing a
2-3 and you've got great post players down low and good shooters on the
outside.  
But it's still disappointing, because I didn't do a total job today.  
  
Q. Brittney, what do you guys talk about after the game and what's the team
feeling like right now?  
BRITTNEY THOMAS: I mean, we're definitely disappointed. We came in here with a
goal of taking the whole thing. To be one game away it's frustrating. And just
everything that Coach and Aisha said, it really came down to rebounding. I
think we did a good job defensively to keep it a low-scoring game.  
Iowa is known to -- they're going to score; you've got to answer them. That
was the type of game it was. The score seemed like it was the game that we
wanted, but they started getting the O board at the right time and putting
buckets in.  
  
Q. Brittney, there were just a ton of turnovers today on both sides. What
led to that?  
BRITTNEY THOMAS: I think a bunch of them were in a lot in the first ten
minutes of the first half. And I think both teams were trying to go really
hard and both teams were getting a lot of deflection. I think it kind of
washed out because both teams were turning it over a lot.  
I think it was just the energy and it's live and survive and you've got to
win. I think once both teams settled down, the turnovers settled down as well.  
  
Q. Aisha, if somebody told you coming in you would hold them to 59 points,
would you think you had a pretty good chance of winning the game?  
AISHA JEFFERSON: Our team goal every game is holding opponents to 54, and
confidence with our defense as the backbone. That was one of our biggest keys.
Iowa can score six points in 30 seconds, and holding them to 59 points is
great, but most of those points came off of some rebounding.  
But it wasn't good enough. And we got outrebounded and that's the game right
there.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You guys seemed to struggle offensively a lot. Was that their zone?  
COACH MERCHANT: No, I actually was glad -- I mean, zone we were kind of
slicing and dieing there, I thought the last ten minutes of the first half,
you know, then they obviously didn't play it again.  
So they have been relying on a 2-3 zone 80 percent of the time that they play
for obvious reasons. And I thought we did a really good job of attacking it.
We just didn't have that good of a shooting night. Kal was really off.
Lykendra didn't give us her offensive rebound putbacks like she can. Jas, as
good as she was yesterday, didn't put the ball in the basket.  
Normally we have three, four scorers, and today we just really had one. It's
hard to win when you just have one kid feeling good on the offensive end.  
I look at that a little bit, and I thought we had good opportunities that just
didn't fall with the right people taking shots.  
  
Q. Suzy, did you have a feeling about Aisha before the game? Was she showing
anything that she might have a breakout game, and can you talk about her
performance?  
COACH MERCHANT: I thought obviously it came at the right time. We were
struggling offensively and she kept us in it, from the arc, from the inside,
high post area, scoring on the block. I think she was just really feeling it.  
We wanted to make sure we kept her in as long as we could. I mean, she's kind
of tough to manage sometimes with her situation with her injuries and whatnot.
But I thought she played her heart out.  
I thought she did a really good job on No. 22. That kid was 5-for-6 yesterday,
and we had some pretty grave concerns about her shooting the basketball
against our 4s.  
So I thought it was a really -- I thought she played both -- the rebounding
piece, everybody could have been better.  
  
Q. What do you think about the NCAA tournament at this point, seeds?  
COACH MERCHANT: I guess probably a lot is going to depend on how the other
conference tournaments play out. I feel good about where we're at. I think
certainly we wanted to get to the finals and have a shot at winning this
thing, which maybe could have improved our seed. But I still feel like we
should be a very good high seed.  
Our record against top 50 teams and certainly the way we finished was very,
very strong. We gotta get Al back healthy and we'll have time to do that in
the next couple of weeks.  
  
Q. Did you get more or less than you expected out of Allyssa tonight?  
COACH MERCHANT: You know, it's hard to gauge. I mean, she played. So that was
more than I thought. I really didn't think we were going to be able to play
her.  
She couldn't get through a shoot-around. I didn't think we were going to play
her. But she kind of fought through. The problem is it probably limited her
ability to do some things out there. But having her presence at times was
good.  
We just really came down to defensive rebounding there. And I thought having
her in there would help us.  
But I just look at Morgan Johnson as someone that really -- I mean, she got
five offensive rebounds and they had three team defensive rebounds, all three
of those, if you look at the tape, were probably her keeping it alive. And I
don't think our 5s did as good a job as we could have on keeping her off the
boards.  
I was proud she played and fought through some things. But I think we got more
out of her than we felt we could.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  82  
Wisconsin - 73

  
THE MODERATOR: And we will begin with comments from Coach Stone, then we'll go
to the student-athletes.  
COACH STONE: I couldn't be prouder of my basketball team. They left it on the
court. Played their hearts out. Season low of seven turnovers. This game was
an Elite Eight game. Two very, very good teams going back and forth the entire
game.  
And I am proud of my entire team. The stat sheet shows some tremendous
performances, but a tremendous team effort. We played solid defense. We got
back. We rebounded the basketball. We got really good shots. Shot the ball
well. We would have liked a few more trips to the free throw line.  
But the bottom line is this Ohio State is a very good team. Their record
speaks for itself. But our basketball team should be in that same
conversation, because this is a very fine Wisconsin women's basketball team,
and I couldn't be prouder of our players.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alyssa, seems like I see you once a year here and you're always playing
like that. Just talk about your game. I know you'd trade career high, I guess,
congratulations, for a win?  
ALYSSA KAREL: Thank you. First of all, sometimes the ball drops and sometimes
it doesn't. Tonight I guess it was dropping for me. But I give a ton of credit
to my team. They were giving me the ball when I was open.  
But, again, like you said, I would give it all back for a win tonight. But we
put up a good effort, team effort, and I'm proud of my team.  
  
Q. We asked the Ohio State people to tell us what they did differently,
trying to deny you more. Did you feel a little more defensive change against
you in the last three, four, five minutes?  
ALYSSA KAREL: They were playing tough D. I felt in the last four, five minutes
of the game I was running off a lot of screens, trying to get open, but they
were just kind of face guarding me, playing really great D. Keeping on tight
on me. So they made it tough for me.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the 1-2 punch that Ohio State has with Jantel and
Prahalis? Obviously 29-27, how tough is it when you have a 1-2 punch? You
can't necessarily concentrate on just one person.  
LIN ZASTROW: For me personally I'm usually post guarding Jantel. She's a very
physical and very good post player, knows how to use her body. When you have
someone who can get her the ball, that makes it even harder. But they're a
great all-around team and they have weapons from all over.  
Like Alyssa and Coach said, it was a great team effort and it just didn't go
our way.  
  
Q. Coach Foster spoke about how much fun this game was to watch in terms of
just the style of play, back and forth. You dictated a lot to them for, what,
30 minutes. Could you speak to how much fun it was? It seemed like it was blow
after blow, back and forth and high paced and not a lot of turnovers, a lot of
trading shots.  
TEAH GANT: Yeah, we had our season low of turnovers, which I think is great
for our team. And we really wanted to focus on ourselves and make them play
our game. That's really what helps us stay in games.  
So unfortunately we didn't get this one this time but it was really fun to be
able to play them again and just compete with them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. It seems like people know about Lavender and Prahalis, but Hill was
really big for them tonight, giving them another look, someone else who can
take some pressure off of them. How much different does that make them, or
does it?  
COACH STONE: Certainly, Sam is great. Jantel is great. And Tayler Hill, don't
forget about Brittany Johnson and Sarah Schultz and the five more off the
bench. They're pretty good. They're deep. Got shooters. Drivers. Tayler Hill,
a freshman, I think is playing at a very high level. She's one of the best in
the league.  
I mentioned last night, after the game, this conference should gain a ton of
respect, because of the youth movement. If you look at the freshmen in this
league, sophomores, and you bottle that up, our conference, the parity speaks
for itself this year with our results. It's fun to watch those young kids
play.  
And we've got Taylor Wurtz out there, knocked down two 3s yesterday. That's
great, in her first Big Ten tournament.  
Tayler Hill had a really good game tonight. A very good player. Minnesota Miss
Basketball, great defender. I think certainly Tayler Hill puts up big numbers,
but she's a really, really good defender. With Shavelle Little graduating,
they've got another really good defender on the ball.  
So they're solid. They're very well coached. We made adjustment defensively on
how to guard Lavender. Jim, that's how talented he is. He's a great coach. He
adjusted to it right away. H recognized it right away. I have the utmost
respect for them. But I also think we earned their respect today as well
because our kids played their tails off.  
  
Q. Lisa, you're in a new position. You're sitting here now. You know you're
going to the NCAA tournament. What do you do for the next week or two until
it's announced?  
COACH STONE: I wish the conference tournament was a different time. But the
fact that we have an opportunity to get healed a little bit. We'll take a few
days off. And our players are such tremendous students.  
I'm sharing that yesterday we had a long day, had to play until 8:30. We had a
few that studied for five hours straight. That concerned me. That's a lot of
time to sit and study. But they have a lot on their plate. I credit them. It
had no effect on their game. They played really well.  
It's a big time right now with tests. We'll take some time off, come back,
practice, probably Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Maybe Saturday morning. Take
the weekend off. Come back, practice Monday and watch the show and get ready
for our next opponent. But I think it's really important right now to
celebrate the end of the conference season and the Big Ten tournament season
and prepare them for the next stage.  
  
Q. Coach, could you gush about Alyssa for us. We don't see her all the time.
But against a really, really good team, and shot after shot, just impressed
the heck out of us.  
COACH STONE: Coach Foster just saw her out in the hallway. He teases the team,
if you can't guard her, maybe I will. But he goes I couldn't get you either.  
So certainly it was really very nice out here in the back room to wish her
well. And our entire team as well. But Alyssa has a very, very strong pull-up
jump shot. It's one of the best I've seen.  
Her 3 was flying pretty well today as well. I thought she got to the basket,
made her free throws. Her defense has improved immensely, which allows her to
stay certainly on the floor out of foul trouble. But she's a player that is a
part of our offense. And the fact she got 31 today came within the conference
of the offense. We weren't running sets for her. It just got to her.  
I thought Lin Zastrow, two games in a row right now. This is good right now
going into the post-season because she's a very fine post player.  
Teah Gant hit some big shots. People haven't respected Teah's outside shot.
She's been working on it all the time and that's coming along. Goes on and on.  
Tara Steinbauer, the fact is that we're a team that plays team defense, and we
play team offense. You saw that tonight with nice balanced scoring. Alyssa has
a career, but she credits her teammates because that all came within the
offense, not a set for Alyssa.  
  
Q. The last few times that Ohio State has played you, Coach Foster has said
he liked the style of play. I mean, from your perspective, what's your take on
that? What would you say your style of play is?  
COACH STONE: We're a defensive team. We want to play solid defense and play
defense without fouling. We want to play defense, rebound, limit them to one
shot. But I think the reason Coach Foster likes the game and I do, too, it's
just a competitive slug-fest. And it's great for the fans and great for our
conference to see the athleticism and the style of play.  
Maybe two contrasting styles, really slugging it out. And I thought it was a
very positive comment when we played at our place. It was a fun game for the
fans to watch.  
He wants to score a lot of points, and we want to hold teams to a low amount
(indiscernible). The fact we found some opportunities offensively to score.
And I'm pleased with that. Again, I wish them well. They're a very, very fine
team. And the Badgers are excited about the next step for us as well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  82  
Wisconsin - 73

  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Coach Foster will go first, and then we'll have
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jantel, I know you've been in a lot of big games, but it seemed like a
tug-of-war with Wisconsin today. Alyssa was hotter than hot, and yet both of
you were hot. Can you talk about the back and forth and the ebb and flow of
your emotions in a game like that?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think Wisconsin came out to play extremely hard. They were
executing extremely well in the first half. Alyssa was hot, as you said. We
had to figure out a way to stop that down the stretch. And I think once we
switched up what we were doing defensively, that kind of slowed down as we got
one-minute mark. And we pulled through.  
  
Q. What did you change up defensively?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: We just did a couple of things on the screen, setting a lot
of screens. And the guards wasn't quite getting there in time, and just they
drove us a lot off the dribble. So we wanted to take -- stay down on them and
get a little more help off the screens a little bit.  
But in the end we got the stops we needed and came out with the win.  
  
Q. Jantel, could you talk about just you sat out some time in the first half
with the foul trouble, and I think you (indiscernible) 3 of 9. Could you talk
about what you were able to get going, especially in the second half?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I was trying to slow down and get lower on my post moves. And
I think Wisconsin plays extremely hard and they're going to do extremely well
in the NCAA tournament. They were just playing extremely hard. And I think the
fact that I wasn't getting low, I just had to make some adjustments.  
I talked to Coach Foster, just get lower in the post. And it started working
to our advantage in the second half and I started getting fouls.  
  
Q. Sam, can you speak to the emotion of the team over the last like seven or
eight minutes of this game, and has it been this high in a game this year?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: We just needed to get stopped. Every time we met in the
huddle we gotta get stops. It must have been said a thousand times tonight.
They played great. They played great on offense. They drove us. Hitting shots.
Wisconsin played really good. So we really just needed to grind it out.  
  
Q. Jantel, what does it say for you guys that you were able to grind it out
the way you ground it out?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think it just shows the greatness that our team has and the
potential that we have to be an extremely great team. We pulled through the
game. And I think the fact we dug deep as a team shows our poise and shows how
tough our team is.  
And I'm happy we won this game because Wisconsin, like she said, played an
extremely great game.  
  
Q. How nice is it to have a third option with Tayler kind of continually
going to the rim and drawing fouls, somebody that can handle the ball and do
things for you?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Tayler does great. She does a great job (indiscernible)
kick. She draws contact really well. I think she always gives energy, and I
think tonight I think everything she did she really stepped up for us.  
  
Q. At what point, Sam, did you guys realize you had to attack the basket and
get the contact you were getting?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Taylor did a great job of that the whole game. I thought
she did a great job of that and nailing her foul shots. For me I think it was
in the second half when I realized they were kind of staying with me. So I
just had to take it and to see what that brought me and it brought some fouls.  
  
Q. Jantel, I know Ohio State has had the bull's eye on and you take
everybody's best shot. But there's something about the tournament, wouldn't
you agree, that things seemed to go up a little more? People seem to play a
little higher and they demand more of you, do you feel that coming into a game
like this?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: Most definitely. I think this tournament buys you an
automatic bid in the NCAA tournament. It just brings out the best in all
players. And I think Wisconsin has been a good team this whole year even in
conference play. And we just knew they were going to bring their A game.
Everybody we played. Iowa tomorrow we know everybody is going to play
extremely hard and we have to come in and match the intensity.  
  
Q. Right before the game started, you bring them together, you say
something, your face couldn't be more serious. I'm wondering if you would let
us know what that was?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I emphasized we have to get stops. We have to come out and
match intensity because we know Alyssa Karel and Rae Lin, she's a senior. She
doesn't want to go home they're going to play extremely hard and we have to
match the intensity and get stops and play defense, because when we played at
Wisconsin I think we got beat off the dribble a lot.  
We just wanted to change that. I think that was the point that needed to be
made at the beginning of the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Nothing unexpected, but to have a 1-2 punch like that, what does it mean
when they're both clicking offensively?  
COACH FOSTER: Makes it a hard team to guard. I think one of the things that
this team has done all season long, we really get to the foul line. We've
taken a huge number of -- we've made a huge number more foul shots than our
opponents have attempted. And it's a very, very significant number. It's
always something that we strive for.  
And add Tayler to the mix. But the ability to take the ball to the basket, get
fouled. To be strong in the post. Get fouled. It's something that we preach
and we have a bunch of players who are able to do that.  
  
Q. I asked Sammy about the emotion on the floor. Does this team have a lot
of that this year more so than maybe some of your former teams have had?  
COACH FOSTER: Not even close. Yeah, a lot more. Yeah, a lot more passion. A
lot more fire. A lot more juice. A lot more fun. We'll get both.  
  
Q. And, again, you can feel that yourself. So are you always thinking the
comeback is coming?  
COACH FOSTER: If you play hard and get stops, you're going to win games and
make foul shots. I think it's an ingredient or combination of ingredients
we've had all along this year.  
When we reverse the ball and move the ball. And sometimes we guard ourselves.
Sometimes we quick shoot. We'll take any transition baskets but tonight they
were getting back. And I've said before what I really like about this
Wisconsin team and this program is the fact that they are willing to get after
it and go up and down the floor and it's just a much more entertaining style
of basketball.  
And a lot of teams in this league are playing it at the moment. It's getting
up and down. And it seems to be what the rest of the world is doing. And I'm
glad to see that we have a dance partner. Guess what, we have another one
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. How this thing turned at the end, Alyssa just didn't get good looks at
least --  
COACH FOSTER: We started trapping the screen and roll pretty hard. And
rotating defensively pretty hard. In the first half, they were beating us off
the dribble. And we just -- I think it became more personal.  
And we stopped reaching. We have some pretty quick feet. But when you start to
reach for the ball and trying to make plays, at this stage of the season, you
know, a good solid team like that, the second you reach, it's over. They're
just going by you.  
If there's one thing kids know how to do today is to attack the basket. Put
the ball on the floor.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the Iowa game? I believe you guys beat them in a
pretty close matchup in the regular season. Talk about what you're expecting
tomorrow.  
COACH FOSTER: We won't play zone. They move it and shoot it too well. We've
got to make them earn their points, and we can't wait until halftime tomorrow.  
  
Q. Seemed like again Brittany had some good minutes for you without scoring.
Was she the one on Karel towards the end of the game, too?  
COACH FOSTER: Actually, I think Taylor might have been there a fair amount,
Shavelle was there. And there were occasions when Brittany switched onto her.
Yeah. But she was much better defensively in the second half.  
And I think it's a valid observation. It's nice to see her when she's not
making shots come up with some plays. She also got a key rebound and went to
the foul line because she went to the glass.  
  
Q. Coach, did this team find something about winning both titles last year
that it really liked?  
COACH FOSTER: That's a question for tomorrow. I can't answer it right now.  
  
Q. Jim, just a comment. With a physical game like you said it was up and
down. There was only a total of 14 turnovers in the game. What does that speak
to?  
COACH FOSTER: That means we didn't pass much. When you're taking it to the
basket as aggressively as both teams were, there's not as much passing. And
when you have kids that can finish and kids that have to be fouled to stop
them getting to the basket, a lot of times that turns into a low-turnover
game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2010

  

### [Kachine Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19288)

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Kamille Wahlin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19309)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Iowa  59  
Michigan State - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening comment from Coach Bluder, then
we'll take questions from the student-athletes.  
COACH BLUDER: I'm extremely proud of our women, as I am almost every single
day. I thought they just continued to battle. They kept their focus when
things got rough in there.  
You know, Kamille, she just comes up with big 3s for us all the time. She does
it tonight. Kachine makes her free throws at crunch time. She does that again
tonight.  
But I'm probably most proud of our defense and rebounding tonight, because for
us I don't know for certain, but I think this might be one of our lowest-
scoring wins of the season.  
And that makes me feel good about our defense. Everybody talks about our
offense. We feel good about our offense. But it's kind of nice to win a low-
scoring game where maybe our offense wasn't there all the way.  
So I'm happy with that. I'm also extremely happy with the rebounding. We
outrebounded them by seven. I looked at second-chance points where we got so
many opportunities off of second chances to score, and to me that's a lot of
heart, and I'm really proud of the women for that.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kamille, could you talk about that last 3-pointer and -- so your team had
struggled a lot behind the line, and obviously you didn't hesitate. Your
thinking behind that?  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: I mean, the play call for me was to either get a 3-point off
or get a ball screen. So I just tried to -- when it comes down to crunch time,
you just forget about all the other shots you miss and you just try to step up
and knock it down for your teammates. I was thankful it went in. My thinking
was just to be confident and be ready to shoot it.  
  
Q. Kachine, not to sound too gross, but did you have a mouthful of blood on
those last two free throws?  
KACHINE ALEXANDER: I was swallowing a lot of blood. The ref saw it get on my
hand and he said, We've got blood. I had to hold it in and try to not let them
see I was really bleeding. I don't even know what to say about that.  
  
Q. Kamille, your teammate sits next to you with a bloody lip, could you talk
about her play down the stretch, grabbing clutch rebounds and knocking down
free throws at the end?  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: I mean, Kach, game in and game out, we know she's going to be
tough. Anything that happens where she can get knocked down ten times in a
game she's going to get back up. She's just got that mentality of being tough.
And she's not going to walk off the court with a bloody lip. We always know
she's going to get back up and she's so tough that it just rubs off on all of
us.  
  
Q. Kamille, can you talk about how physical it was, because it looked
physical. How was it from your perspective?  
KAMILLE WAHLIN: It definitely was a very physical game. But Michigan State, we
kind of expected that.  
They're a lot bigger than us. And so we just, in our minds, before our game,
we were getting ready for a physical game. When games are close like that and
you're in the Big Ten tournament, both teams want to win, you've got to expect
that.  
And we just gotta have the mentality of never backing down. And I think we did
a good job of not backing down this their physicality.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Coach, what did Trisha's performance mean today, especially with Jamie
sitting most of the first half?  
COACH BLUDER: As I was sitting here I realized I forgot to mention that in my
opening statement. Trisha Nesbitt was a warrior in the first half. She goes
in, plays 16 minutes for us in the first half, she has her career high, 10
points. She misses her first 3.  
Kids in that situation wouldn't shoot again. And they haven't been doing a lot
of that all through the year. She just stepped up. I was happy for Trisha.
Defensively she's held her own all year. It was nice to see her contributing
offensively like that and knowing just that I think this gives her a lot of
confidence going into the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. One win we thought in this Big Ten tournament we thought would be enough
to get into the NCAA too. Do you feel safe at this point?  
COACH BLUDER: I never feel safe. Right now we're going to the championship
game. And we have an opportunity to get the automatic bid and just why not go
for that? Why not, at this juncture, in our season, why would we settle for
second? Let's go for first and let's try to get that automatic bid.  
  
Q. Morgan didn't have a lot of points but she seemed to keep battling all
game down low. Can you talk about that?  
COACH BLUDER: I thought her defense was really good especially the beginning
of the game. She had a number of blocked shots in a row. She had some really
good rebounds for us. Morgan is a freshman and just battling against those
upperclassmen and gives up so much height at times.  
But I thought she did a really nice job inside defensively for us tonight and
had some key offensive rebounds and put-backs as well.  
  
Q. I think you called a timeout after they went on that run. What did you
talk about with the team at that point?  
COACH BLUDER: I just talked about that we had to change the way we were
playing. They got kind of mad and they were taking it out on us. They were
being a lot more aggressive and we had to change the way we were playing. We
knew we could get back into it.  
But we talked again about defensive and rebounding, because I just feel like
if you focus on the offense too much at that point, it kind of freezes them
sometimes.  
So we really focused more on the defense and the rebounding. We talked about
possessions, how we needed every possession and we can control that with
taking care of the ball and rebounding.  
  
Q. Coach, once again, only one missed free throw. Could you talk about the
clutch free throw shooting down the stretch?  
COACH BLUDER: Second game in a row we haven't missed in the second half.
That's nice to see. We're a good free throw shooting team. And we have the
right people taking them as well. So that's also nice. But we are pretty good
in the clutch free throw shooting, and, once again, we did it tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you beat Michigan State in the regular season. Very close.
Did you consider this an upset at all or did you know coming in you had a
pretty good chance of winning this game?  
COACH BLUDER: I think it's an upset because we're the second seed and we're
the third seed. In my mind it was in that way. But obviously we beat them on
our home court now playing on a neutral court tonight. This is an important
win for us. They're top 25 wins. So for us it's very important for the NCAA
selection committee, this is a good win for us.  
  
Q. What does it mean to your program, I think it's been since 2001 since
you've been in the tournament finals. What does this mean to your program?  
COACH BLUDER: I hadn't thought about that. I guess I didn't realize that.
Well, we won it that year, so that was kind of nice. I remember that. But for
our program, you know, for us to come this far in seven weeks, you know, to
come from last place in the Big Ten to playing in the championship game in the
Big Ten tournament, I think that kind of speaks for itself.  
Again, it goes to the qualities of the women and their perseverance and just
their ability to battle and confidence. I continue to be amazed by them.
They're just incredible women.  
  
Q. I know you kind of touched on it briefly, but it was your first win when
you scored less than 60 points. What does that mean to kind of get a defensive
win like that?  
COACH BLUDER: I think it's good for us. At this point of the year it's good
for us to know that we can win a game with our defense and with our rebounding
instead of our offense. I think that's really good, important lesson for us to
learn this time of year. Probably have to fall back on it again.  
  
Q. Gabby played like nine minutes. Only scored one basket. You seemed to get
some quality time from her in there.  
COACH BLUDER: Again, I think she played great yesterday. She's a freshman. And
she's kind of typical freshman and up and down. And I thought Morgan was
playing a little bit better today.  
But I have great confidence in both of those women. And sometimes Gabby
provides us a little more bulk than Morgan does, and that was good for us at
times in this game to have that.  
Well, against any of them, actually. Because Morgan is slight. And it's nice
to have a little bulk we can go to off the bench.  
  
Q. Coach, the same story, different player, with Jamie today picking up two
quick fouls. Can you talk about your team's ability to kind of pick up the
slack. You had players like Trisha step up and pick up the scoring?  
COACH BLUDER: Trisha I thought was outstanding the first half. And I thought
it kept us in that first half as far as being able to hit some really key
shots for us.  
Jamie goes out with two fouls, and, you know, again you kind of play with the
idea, go back and forth. If we can stay close, I just believe in letting her
sit and letting other players take advantage of that opportunity. I thought
Trisha took advantage of it tonight.  
  
Q. Lisa, you played eight players all year. That's all you've got. This will
be the third game in three days. Is fatigue an issue at all?  
COACH BLUDER: You know, I don't think you can even think about it at this
point. We'll be getting ice tubs ready for them tonight. Try to rehab them as
quickly as we can. And, yeah, I mean, it's something that comes into your
mind. But they're 18 to 20 years old. I don't know if we remember what it's
like to be 18 to 20 years old.  
But they've got a lot of energy at that point. At this point you're playing
the championship. So much adrenalin has got to be kicking in for you at this
point.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2010

  

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

### [Lacey Simpson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18034)

### [Jenna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18033)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  66  
Illinois - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement from Coach Law, then
we'll take questions from the student-athletes.  
COACH LAW: I think in the first half we dug a hole. We didn't play very
confident in the first half. But once we settled down, we started executing
and doing the little things.  
And I give a lot of credit to Ohio State. There were those loose balls that we
should have gotten that we didn't get. And some of those are turnovers and
those were one of those things we kept turning the ball over and they
capitalized on those turnovers.  
You look at those stats, that's what sticks out most in my mind. They
capitalized 18 points off of our turnovers.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Jenna, talk about that run from like nine minutes to four minutes, and I
guess how hard is it to sustain a run against a team like Ohio State and what
were you thinking during that run? Were you really feeling like momentum?  
JENNA SMITH: We all just stayed positive. We knew that we could score easily,
just move the ball and play team ball.  
We had all the confidence in the world in each other. Then all of our
teammates -- we were positive and we knew that we could get some balls to get
us back in the game.  
  
Q. Jenna, it's been a quest especially among the seniors to get this program
to the NCAA tournament. Has the realization had it you yet and can you
verbalize how it feels to not be able to get to that what you guys have worked
so hard?  
JENNA SMITH: I can't describe how it feels. It just hurts to know that we
haven't been there. But we did what we could all four years.  
  
Q. Lacey, talk about those last couple of minutes. You guys looked like you
were ready to make a run yet you had a couple of shots to cut it to four
points. Talk about just those last couple of minutes and I guess what went
on?  
LACEY SIMPSON: Honestly, I am proud of that last part we were in there. We
didn't give up. We kept pushing and pushing and swinging. Somebody gets up on
you like that you can automatically give in and not do anything.  
But we kept fighting and kept fighting. Unfortunately, we got the loss. But it
eases my mind to know that we went out fighting.  
  
Q. Lacey, on that subject, do you feel like you guys have set an example for
the younger ones going forward the way you guys have played, particularly in
these Big Ten tournaments, the way you guys have fought?  
LACEY SIMPSON: I truly hope so. I truly hope that I've set the example, not
just in games, but practice. Where it matters the most. I always try to lead
by example. Try to work hard. Hopefully -- I think it has paid off, especially
these last couple of practices. They're getting there.  
So I'm pretty sure Coach Law and this team will be successful in the years to
come. I just know they will.  
  
Q. Lacey, talk about how different this team is to this time last year. You
came out against Ohio State and you guys got blown out. Can you just talk
about how that last little fight, did that show something different about this
team from the last season?  
LACEY SIMPSON: I said it before. Since Coach Law's come here, I definitely
think this program is on the rise. This year all this talent, our season
doesn't predict how the future is going to be.  
This is definitely an up-and-coming program. Illini will be an elite program.
Coach Law and the recruiting class that's coming in, I truly believe it's
going to be a good program.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Ohio State with the zone defense, was that kind of a change-up for you
guys? How did you feel you handled the zone they played?  
COACH LAW: Not at all. They played zone against us the last two times. They
just extended it. They didn't do the tandem 2-3 and try to do the 2-2-1, and
back into the 2-3. Actually I was like, wow, my guards can be settled.  
The last two games we won we played Indiana they played a zone. We played
Purdue, they played the zone. Northwestern, they played the zone. I was like,
wow, they're actually sitting back and they're not extending it.  
So we worked on the extended part of it most of the last couple of days. But
it's just that right now the first half I was like, okay, we know what we're
looking for. We know what we've got to do. I think we were sort of unsure, a
little timid, and I just, I don't know -- we were talking about it at half.
And once we settled down, the second half you start seeing us execute and get
the shots we knew we wanted to get in the first half.  
I was a little surprised that he went back in just a regular 2-3.  
  
Q. Coach, aside from Jantel and it looks like Brittany Johnson, they didn't
really shoot the ball all that well, if you look at their numbers. Your
thoughts on your defense today in terms of keeping you in the game?  
COACH LAW: That was one of the things that did keep us in the game. I think
for the first half, if we would have dictated it a little more, we wouldn't
have dug a hole. We went in the half down 12, something like that.  
We made some changes. We knew the key people that -- we knew Jantel was going
to get her points, but we just wanted to limit her touches.  
And then we went into a little match-up zone and tried a 1-2. We threw some
things at them. Our defense, it was sound, but it was like in the first half
we didn't look to attack and we didn't look to get to the free throw line.
That's what I stressed to my team.  
When we're getting to the free throw line more than our opponents, we win.
When we're settling for 3-point shots, we're not a very good team, because
we're not a 3-point shooting team.  
But defensively I thought we were sound. And especially in the second half.  
  
Q. Talk about a couple of those turnovers down the stretch. Shavelle Little
had a couple of steals, talk about her?  
COACH LAW: Shavelle Little is -- I've said it before, the first they played
us, she had eight steals. She was a one-woman press. But I think knowing she's
a great defender, I think in the back of our minds some of my guards start
thinking about it too much.  
She got that crucial right at the half, and it was unfortunate. And when I
look at the turnovers, that's been the main thing I've been stressing to my
team for the last month is that we gotta take better care of the ball on
forced turnovers. And those were forced. She forced those in the end.  
But we had a lot of unforced turnovers. And that's where you see 18 points
from Ohio State. So those are the things that we just need to work on, getting
better at taking care of the basketball.  
  
Q. Could you just put into perspective what Jenna Smith has meant to your
program?  
COACH LAW: A blessing. She's a phenomenal player. But most importantly she's a
phenomenal person. I know that she's going to be extremely successful in the
years to come. Every day I keep seeing her grow in different areas, on the
basketball court, off the court.  
What she's done -- the first time I came in here she bought into all my
philosophies and what I was looking for from her. It's a lot to ask someone
their freshman year. She don't get many touches. She gets them off of
offensive rebounding. Now I want you to go into scoring double-doubles,
getting double-doubles, and you being the centerpiece of the program. She
embraced it.  
And I thank God daily I had an opportunity to coach Jenna as well as Lacey.
And she's definitely been just a blessing to have.  
  
Q. How has Karisma Penn developed over the years?  
COACH LAW: She's come into her own. I think as a freshman she plays extremely
well. She's still growing and has a lot of growing to do. But I think one
thing I can say about Karisma Penn is she has no fear. She may make a mistake,
but she'll come back on the defensive end and either get a blocked shot or a
steal.  
I think she's developing under Jenna. She's been paying attention to a lot of
things that Jenna has been teaching her. I think in the future she'll be
pretty good.  
  
Q. Can we safely assume that you would accept a WNIT bid?  
COACH LAW: If I get invited, yes. I think for -- I don't think my team is
ready to stop. We don't want to end on a note like this. And personally for
me, you know, it's not about me, it's about my young people that I have coming
back. Also about getting some more experience. And just continuing to compete.  
So if the opportunity comes, we'll probably take it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  61  
Michigan - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. We'll begin with an opening comment from Coach Merchant.  
COACH MERCHANT: I thought after a slow defensive start for us, I thought
Michigan did a really good job of coming out with a lot of energy and
enthusiasm on the offensive end. I think we just kind of caught us off guard.
Maybe that extra day of prep, I don't know, we weren't used to the rhythm of
it.  
To their credit, I thought they really gave it to us out of the gates. And
really liked our composure. I didn't feel we were in a good offensive flow at
all ever in the first half.  
And so to our credit, we found a way to come out on top at halftime, and
mostly it was because of our defense.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll take questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Aisha, is this one of those games you're just happy to come out with a
win, not sort of how you played but happy to get the first game over with?  
AISHA JEFFERSON: No, this is a ugly game, and all year we've been finding ways
to make it work and dealing with the situations with Allyssa not being in
there. We had a couple of situations where I was guarding the 5 and Kalisha
was guarding the 5. We've never been in a situation like that.  
I give us credit for us figuring it out. We always find a way. Not the most
ideal way to win the game, but a W is a W. And we're not satisfied, but we
definitely are happy that we won.  
  
Q. Kalisha, could you sense them getting frustrated with your defense in the
second half?  
KALISHA KEANE: I don't really feel like they're a team that gets too
frustrated. I think they really have a good concept of their motion, cutting,
and they do a good job of shooting the basketball also.  
So I think it just came down to our team focusing on defensive rebounding and
really getting after it on the boards because we were down in the first half,
and we came out on top in the second half.  
  
Q. Kalisha, what was it like not playing with Allyssa in there, and also
with Brittney being out in foul trouble? How did that affect the team's
rhythm?  
KALISHA KEANE: I think it really showed our poise offensively, and defensively
I think Lauren Aitch came in and had great minutes for us, playing really hard
defense, showed we can play multiple positions at all levels.  
And I think Brittney also being in foul trouble we had the opportunity for
other people to step up, like Jasmine Thomas hit some big shots for us down
the stretch. It shows the depth we have offensively and defensively, and hats
off to them.  
  
Q. Aisha, with all of your ailments, how do you get ready to play a game
back-to-back?  
AISHA JEFFERSON: Just all year we've been doing a good job. Coach Merchant has
been doing a good job of just keeping things in moderation for me.  
I mean, I know pretty much the Big Ten pretty well since I've been here for
five years. So the physical play isn't as important as getting ready mentally.  
But a lot of rest and ice and prayer.  
KALISHA KEANE: And drugs.  
(Laughter)  
  
Q. Kalisha, you scored your 1000th career point tonight. What does that mean
to you?  
KALISHA KEANE: Wow, no, I had no idea. That's exciting, I guess. It's a great
milestone to overcome. I'm just glad we won, to be honest. If I didn't score
the 1,000 today but we got the W, I'd be as smiley as I am right now.  
That's sweet, but I'd rather have the W anyway.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach Merchant.  
  
Q. In terms of the lineups you had to play, is this one of the more weirder
games you've coached here?  
COACH MERCHANT: Yes, but I think that's where our depth came in. It wasn't
like Lauren never played out there. The difference was she had to play a
little longer.  
What I felt good about is even with Allyssa being out of the mix at that
point, nobody played over 30 minutes today. So I still was a little conscious
of that with Brittney getting in foul trouble, Jasmine having to play a little
bit more. She played well offensively, had a couple of turnovers and got
rattled a little bit, as freshmen can. She scored the ball well for us and
rebounded it and played good defense. I thought she got some good experience
for us.  
But it's definitely different not to have our normal rotations out there. But
to the kids' credit, I thought they didn't allow that to get out of whack in
terms of their composure.  
  
Q. Are you going to have Allyssa tomorrow yet? Do you know yet?  
COACH MERCHANT: We don't know yet. We're going to wait and see. Good thing is
we have over 24 hours to get her back. We don't play until tomorrow at 5:00.
She had a back spasm. It started Wednesday, and so she did practice, but
tonight when Krista Phillips made a move and kind of hooked her a little bit,
it obviously ignited that a little bit. But she was feeling pretty good, and
then it just got a little flared up on her.  
  
Q. Will it change your preparation any or your game planning?  
COACH MERCHANT: You know, we're just going to -- we have to see who we're
going to play, certainly. And we just gotta find a way to get it done. We do
have a lot of kids with experience. And Lauren Aitch is one of them. She's
been tremendous for us all year. She brings a lot of passion and enthusiasm
and offensive rebounding.  
So I feel confident about our ability no matter what the situation is.  
  
Q. This seemed a little bit like the game at Michigan the second half where
they didn't score much. What was it about your defense in the second half?  
COACH MERCHANT: We played it. I mean, I just -- to me, I think our field goal
percent defense is really good. We really get after people. We challenge
shots. I was disappointed in the first half how many easy looks they got.  
Then when we decided to get the job done and turn it up, we communicated
better. We evaded screens. We jumped to the ball. Reynolds right out of the
gate had six quick points. I was like, You gotta be kidding me.  
Then we tightened up and that was pretty much that, she hit one more after
that. I thought our perimeter defense and the ability to contain one-on-one
was really big.  
Couple that with it was pretty much even at halftime. I think we were up 1 on
rebounding and ended up really getting after them on the boards. I thought
that was big. I think that was something that they couldn't -- they just
couldn't match. So we kept harping on that. I knew that was a big focus for
them. He called a couple of timeouts just because we got an offensive rebound.
I knew that was big at both ends for us. I thought we did a nice job.  
  
Q. Suzy, the one possession Cetara had, two offensive rebounds and then had
the putback on the second one and defensive rebound on the other end, did you
think that was kind of a game-changing series for both teams?  
COACH MERCHANT: It was a backbreaker for sure. They needed possession of the
ball. We were able to run some clock off, certainly. And one thing that Cetera
has is -- early in the year when we were struggling a little bit -- Lykendra
is a very good rebounder, everybody knows that, but she doesn't always go.  
I can tell you Cetera a couple times on the bench is like, Why isn't she
rebounding? I'm like, You know how you remedy that? You rebound it. Seems like
ever since I've said that to her, and I know Coach Shane said that to her on
the bench, she's been a terror on the boards, really fighting to get offensive
rebounds.  
So when we do bring Lykendra out, we're not losing anything. And if we play
them together, now you have options in different ways.  
Cetara has been nothing but tremendous for us in terms of her hustle plays,
defensively she's really -- she loves to play that end of the floor. And
that's what we needed is to defend and rebound.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2010

  

### [Jodie Howell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19710)

### [Fahkara Malone](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18050)

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Wisconsin  73  
Purdue - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: And we will begin by opening comments from Coach Versyp.  
COACH VERSYP: I think Wisconsin obviously is one of the top three or four
teams in the Big Ten. They've showed that they can defend. They can score.  
For them to get in the NCAA and Lisa to be Coach of the Year, I think it's
just fantastic. She's just an amazing job with the group and we wish them the
best of luck obviously.  
As for us, we didn't have it. They had it all and we haven't had it. And
obviously we'll miss our three seniors dearly. And obviously I have two of
them with me tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. FahKara, why were they so successful getting on top of you so early?  
FAHKARA MALONE: Well, they just get it knocking down open shots and we were
giving them open shots. We didn't disrupt their offense early or late in the
game. They were getting whatever they wanted. So that is the biggest thing
about them jumping on us early.  
  
Q. FahKara, they talked a lot about trying to slow you guys down in
transition. Did you feel like they were able to do a pretty good job of
slowing down you guys on the break a little bit, and then you had trouble
getting them in the half court?  
FAHKARA MALONE: It's not hard to stop transition if you're getting all the
rebounds. And that's what they did. They controlled the rebounding the ball so
we couldn't push it as much as we wanted to. The few times we did push it we
were successful. But we didn't do it enough.  
  
Q. Your program has won so much, and it's hard to say good-bye. How much do
you hope you still play? I guess there's a chance you could still play in the
WNIT?  
FAHKARA MALONE: I mean, as seniors we don't want it to be over. WNIT or
anything, it's about going home, basically. We want to keep playing with this
group as long as we possibly can.  
  
Q. Jodi, Purdue's had such a history in this building, and you've had it,
too. Is there any point in this game where you guys thought there was an
opportunity to get back in the game?  
JODI HOWELL: You think that throughout the game. You never give up. You keep
fighting for it, and I think we went on a couple of runs there. But in the end
we just gave up too much too early and they just picked us apart on defense.  
  
Q. The fact that they shot so well just put a lot of pressure on you guys
when you were on offense. Every time they go down, they take their 3s?  
JODI HOWELL: Yeah, I mean, looking at the stat shot they shot 52 percent from
the field and 48 percent for the second half. We just didn't hit our shots.
And sometimes that's how the ball bounces. But nothing we can do about it now.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. The fact that they were able to get in the lane, how much did that hurt
you, hurt defensively?  
COACH VERSYP: They got in the lane. They got down low. They just knocked down
shots. I mean, they're playing great basketball. That's what you want to be
doing right now.  
I watched some of the games earlier. People weren't knocking down shots. And
Wisconsin's in a rhythm. They're confident. All the players can put it on the
floor and shoot.  
Obviously, when you hit shots early, it's just contagious. But they were able
to get inside/outside. And obviously anytime a team gets to the paint, it's
going to hurt you.  
  
Q. This would be an improper way to send these seniors out, and how much are
you looking forward to perhaps getting a chance to continue playing this
year?  
COACH VERSYP: You know, I discussed in the locker room about the tradition and
the pride of Purdue, and that these three have been a part of something very
special, two Big Ten tournament championships, two Elite Eights. We've done
some great things with them. You want to continue to play if you can. I think
it's good for them.  
And whether it's an NIT or not, if it can be, then you always can still have
one team standing. Even though it's not the NCAA, I think it's a great
tournament if you can get in there. And because of our youth, I think it's
very important.  
  
Q. Just how difficult was it to try and mount any kind of comeback getting
behind like that, considering they were able to hit pretty much anything out
there that they took, whenever you guys would pull it within 14 or 15?  
COACH VERSYP: I mean, it's difficult. In tournament, it's very hard to get in
a hole and try to pull it back. I think you saw that earlier, I think, with
the Michigan/Northwestern game. Michigan came out was just lights out. They
end up losing by 13 or 15.  
It's difficult. But our kids kept trying. They kept -- they never gave up.
Those are the big signs. But we couldn't put the ball in the basket. That's
been our problem all year. And we don't have certain people shooting the
basketball well. We're always going to struggle. We've got to get our legs
back, hopefully, and see what happens in about eight days.  
  
Q. I guess just kind of the way that Wisconsin rebounded in the first half
and then you guys kind of made a comeback in the second half, felt like you
guys won the second half, regardless of the score; is that a fair statement?  
COACH VERSYP: Yeah, but we pretty much didn't do much in the first half. So at
this stage you can't worry about winning halves. You've got to worry about
winning the game. You've got to play a good 36 minutes. You can't just have
one half or the other half. Again, I think their experience was huge. I think
they stepped up and they've got some seniors and some great juniors. And I
think they stepped up and nailed shots and they've been in tournament before.
And they did some really good things.  
  
Q. Do you think the youth showed at all in the first half when they came out
and jumped off to a 15-2 run?  
COACH VERSYP: No. We just didn't knock down shots. I mean, they were knocking
down shots. We didn't get the ball to fall early, and I think that's been our
story all year. So it wasn't any different today.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2010

  

### [Jim Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16894)

### [Jantel Lavender](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18055)

### [Samantha Prahalis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19286)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Ohio State  66  
Illinois - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go straight to the student-athletes for questions,
please. Raise your hands and we'll get a microphone to you.  
  
Q. Jantel, it seems like every time you play Illinois it's a really
physical-type game. Was this just a typical Ohio State-Illinois basketball
game, and how did you guys wind up winning it?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think in the beginning, in the first half, I think we were
rushing a little bit, as far as me in the post, and I think I wasn't getting
as deep as I should have.  
And it was physical. And once we made the adjustment with me getting lower and
getting deeper in the lane, I think that it turned around a little bit.  
  
Q. Sam, there was a point when you guys were up by 15. I think somebody had
a 3-pointer, I think, then they came back with a real significant run and cut
it under 10 finally. How did you guys respond to that? What enabled you to
respond to that and ultimately --  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: Just stayed poised. We got the ball inside that one time
when Jantel had a good steal. I think just stay poised and stay calm, and I
just think like it's going to be running, we have to contain them. It's about
us containing them and staying poised.  
  
Q. Again, Jantel, the tournament is basically -- I mean, you want to get to
the next tournament. But I think you said you wanted to step it up in this
tournament defensively. How do you think your defense played in this
particular game?  
JANTEL LAVENDER: I think our defense was really good. I think our zone was
tight. I think everybody was rotating well. I think Shavy came in, played
ferocious defense and gave us a spark on defense.  
Basically was on the same page, we were moving. Everybody was finding the open
spots. There was maybe a couple of breakdowns and I think for the most part
tonight this is the tone we need to set for defense and we can get better for
the next game.  
  
Q. Were you ever worried in this game when they were making their comeback
and why wouldn't you have been if you weren't worried?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: I mean, I don't really think like -- I wasn't worried. I
just go play. Like I said, it was just about staying calm and just getting the
win any way possible.  
  
Q. It seems like deja vu too with Shavy at the end of the game when she made
the steal at the end that basically sealed the game, put the game away. But
could you see that setting up? Could you see what was about to happen?  
SAMANTHA PRAHALIS: We went to man, so I kind of figured like if the girls were
going to cross in front of her she was going to get it. I'm real confident
with her whenever we go man. Even in the zone, her pressure when she stays
down and just stays in front of her, pressure is really good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach Foster.  
  
Q. Overall, it was a solid defensive game, don't you think?  
COACH FOSTER: Yes.  
  
Q. But overall how would you say things went?  
COACH FOSTER: I think Sam said it; it's a game of runs. When they made that
last run and they were coming at us, and I think when we switched out of zone
and went man, we did it very, very aggressively and soundly.  
And I think that's what you're looking for at this time of the season. I
thought the zone did some really good stuff for us. I don't think they were
expecting us to play it. And it sort of disrupted their continuity. And when
we went man, we were in great position, great communication, and did the right
things.  
And then offensively, the games are some days you're going to make a lot of
shots, some days you're not. And you know they're very good defensive team.
They're a very good basketball team.  
You've got a First Team All Big Ten player, and you've got an All Defensive
First Team Player, and you've got a player on the Freshman All Five Rookie
Team. Come on, they've got players. They're good.  
  
Q. You touched on it a little bit, but could you talk about your use of the
zone and why you felt like that was an effective strategy to use today?  
COACH FOSTER: Well, I learned that in the SEC when I was at Vanderbilt and I
didn't have a very quick team. I found that it to be to our advantage if
athletes were standing still.  
  
Q. With Jantel, you took her out a little here and there in the first half.
Was that a physical thing or just another slowdown?  
COACH FOSTER: No, no, just get a little rest. I did it around the timeouts, so
you sit her down a little bit, and then you know that the timeout is going to
be two minutes. She might get a five-minute blow by doing it that way. And
that was all I was doing was buying her some time.  
  
Q. What was your strategy defensively against Jenna Smith? Looked like they
had maybe just a little trouble getting the ball to her today than they did
yesterday?  
COACH FOSTER: Don't let her breathe. I mean, she's very talented. She's got --
she's got a -- like a 15 over league game. It looks -- you're just always
surprised. She's always coming at you with something else, looks like she's
played the Game 100 years.  
  
Q. You mentioned it, but athletically where is Illinois? Are they one of the
better athletic teams?  
COACH FOSTER: I think defensively they can move their feet. They get out after
you. I mean, Simpson, Simpson's terrific. Jenna is Jenna, and the people they
have in the wings. They're long and they're quick, and I think our kids do a
pretty good job not turning the ball over. You look down, a ten turnover game,
this stage of the season, you'll take that. It means you're getting shots.  
  
Q. Seemed like Brittany had good energy at both ends, kept shooting, stayed
aggressive. Did you like what you saw from her today?  
COACH FOSTER: What I liked from Brittany in the first half was her weak side
rebounding. Thought she did a great job sealing off. Sometimes you worry about
rebounding in the zone. But I thought she did a great job.  
  
Q. There came a point in the game when they weren't making the run. You
brought in Andrea and Shavy and Maria, your seniors. I think Andrea --  
COACH FOSTER: Andrea scored.  
  
Q. And Shavy --  
COACH FOSTER: Shavy made me nervous. And the one time she started to penetrate
the zone, I sat her down, calmed her down and put her back in. And I think she
did a great job.  
Maria is steady.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2010

  

### [Rae Lin D'Alie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19251)

### [Alyssa Karel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19250)

### [Lisa Stone](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16858)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Wisconsin  73  
Purdue - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with opening comments from Coach Stone and then
take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH STONE: I'm very proud of this basketball team. They have an
understanding of who we are. And we are a very, very strong defensive team
that is committed to serving one another.  
We love each other, and we do. We just do. That's how we play. We care a lot
about each other. We're there for each other and I thought we made a statement
defensively.  
We wanted to make sure that Purdue played against a set defense every single
time down the floor, and our players did a great job of executing that.  
I also thought we did a really good job of limiting them to one shot.
Rebounding was very, very good in the first half. They're a very good
offensive rebounding team. And we did a nice job.  
There's a little stretch in the second half -- I believe radio guy told me
they were on a mini run, a 7-0 run. I remember at that time three offensive
rebounds and one possession.  
Outside of that, our players executed well together. They executed the game
plan. My coaching staff did a great job on the scout.  
And now it's time for us to rest and prepare for a very good Ohio State team
tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alyssa, Coach talked about how well you did defensively, but can you
speak offensively and how you were able to get Purdue out of position to get
the shots you guys got?  
ALYSSA KAREL: Yeah, you know, I think the good thing about our offense, it's
all about reading your defense, reading your cuts, reading what the defense is
doing. I think that really keeps Purdue and any team we're playing on their
toes when we're able to read our cuts well.  
I think today we were flowing really well together. We were reading our
teammates. We were reading our defense well. I think it just keeps teams
guessing.  
  
Q. Either one of the players, does it mean something extra to beat Purdue
because of what Purdue has done for this tournament?  
RAE LIN D'ALIE: I mean, no, they're just a team that we happened to get
matched up in the first round. I thought we did a great job adjusting from the
last time we played them.  
Something that really sticks out here is zero transition baskets. That was
huge and that was something that when we went there they got a lot of 3s and a
lot of looks in the open court that really hurt us. We just got back and set
our D, and I think that was definitely the game-changer for us.  
  
Q. Alyssa, there in the second half some big shots by many players,
yourself, you had a few. Jamie off the bench, she knocked down a couple 3s at
opportune times, kept the momentum going?  
ALYSSA KAREL: I think you're talking about Taylor Wurtz. Taylor has -- she's
been a tremendous offensive and defensive player for us this year coming in as
a freshman.  
And she has so much confidence in her shot and we have confidence in her.
Whenever she gets an open shot we know she's going to take a good shot and
knock it down. We're very confident in her.  
  
Q. Rae Lin, how important do you think the start was in taking Purdue out of
really anything they wanted to do and make them have to work from so far
behind?  
RAE LIN D'ALIE: The start, I think that was really important for us,
especially. And we talk a lot about what we can do as a team.  
And I'm just going to go back to transition D. For them not to be able to get
in the open court, I felt that they were a little uncomfortable and our scout
was amazing. We knew everything they were going to be running.  
One of our assistants did an awesome job. And we understood that if we set our
D it was going to be a different ball game from the last time we saw them.  
As far as the offensive start goes, like Alyssa says, we were flowing.
Everybody was sharing the ball. Everybody was touching the ball. We were just
shooting with confidence.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You talked about the defensive identity and that's been the case for two
years, but over the last six games or so I think you're averaging more than 70
points. Do you think there's just a comfort zone with the new offense, or what
do you attribute?  
COACH STONE: I think what's happening, it's less about the offense, more about
our players. You heard Alyssa, reading each other. I recall saying one time
during a timeout that as an offensive player you're responsible for your
defender. So if you're responsible for your defender and Purdue switched on on
screens and you saw KK Houser guarding Lin Zastrow down the block and I have
the ball and I can't see because Chelsea Jones is in my face, I have to find a
way as an offensive player to get the ball to my teammate.  
Then they brought the double. It sped us up. Disrupted us a little bit. But
our players right now are flowing freely in a motion offense.  
It's very hard to scout because it's not set. They're reading each other. And
it goes back to my opening statement on how close this team is. It's on the
court, off the court. They play team defense. They play team offense. You can
look at -- I think a lot of people, and yourselves included, want to look at
like your leading scorers, but I thought Lin Zastrow played some unbelievable
moves today and big-time moves on the baseline.  
A couple she missed. I thought Teah Gant was remarkable handling the
basketball when Rae Lin was in foul trouble. And Rae Lin's foul trouble might
help us now because it cut her minutes down to 24. And then I just thought
Jade Davis had a big day for us. And Taylor Wurtz comes to the Big Ten, gets
two big 3s. And everybody got to play today. That collective unit transcends
into offense.  
But you're right, what's happening right now, we're getting high-percentage
shots. We're getting action toward the basket, whether it's off penetration or
post touches. And we're taking pretty good care of the ball.  
So I think it's a collective unit of one affecting the other in a positive
way.  
  
Q. I guess you kind of make it a point to kind of jam it into the post today
on offense, with all the -- you guys have 34 points in the paint, 11 offensive
rebounds.  
COACH STONE: Definitely was part of the game plan. Get the ball inside. Their
guard sped us up and turned us over the last time we played them there, and we
wanted to make sure we were very tough with the basketball and we got the ball
inside.  
Our post players, and particularly Tara Steinbauer and Lin Zastrow, last year
here in the Big Ten tournament, were very, very effective, whether it's
against the Purdue zone or half-court trap. We were able to work the short
corner, high post and run some ball screen roll and high-low looks, and it was
very effective for us.  
But definite emphasis was to get the ball inside.  
  
Q. Just talk about how well you guys shot today. I know Versyp all week has
talked about shooting well in the neutral court, talked about shooting over 50
percent?  
COACH STONE: You've got to keep your team loose this time of year. You can
overstress it. And all coaches, we cringe when there's a turnover, maybe a bad
shot to lead the transition. Everybody on the floor needs to understand
they're a threat and play with poise and confidence, and we talked about
intensity, concentration and execution. Spells ICE. That was the word of the
day.  
And I thought we did that. We maintained our intensity from start to finish.
We concentrated fairly well and we executed both offensively and defensively.
That then helps relax. You're not going for eight, nine minutes without a
basket. We got good shots. Shot selection was decent. The players understand
they're all a threat and it just good defense turns to good offense.  
  
Q. With the balance of the Big Ten with the record wins by many teams and
all that, a comment on the seeds 1, 2, 3, 4, moving on?  
COACH STONE: I don't know how you do seeding with as tight as this conference
was this year. You would be second, third, maybe fourth in the league, and if
you lost maybe five, six games ago you would be down to ninth. That's how
tight it was. I think it says a lot about our conference.  
There's great coaches. There's tremendous players, if you look at the All-
Freshman Team and freshmen in this league, this conference is on its way to
great things, and I'm talking about this year and beyond. It's really, really
exciting to be a part of this conference, because of who we are. The youth
movement and the parity that has really started to be very, very visible.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2010

  

### [Kevin Borseth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18022)

### [Krista Phillips](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18023)

### [Carmen Reynolds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20521)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan State  61  
Michigan - 50

  
MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening comment from Coach Borseth.  
COACH BORSETH: I'd like to begin by saying the beginning of the year they
picked us to finish 11th in the conference. Last. We didn't. We finished tied
for sixth, which was pretty good. In our eyes obviously we'd like to finish a
little bit better.  
I thought overall our kids played better today. We stole the ball ten times.
We only allowed them six assists. Turned them over 17 times. Unfortunately, we
weren't able to stay with them on the glass. I think that was probably the
story. The tale of the tape. But it certainly wasn't lack of effort on our
kids' part. I'm very proud of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We'll take questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Carmen, they seemed to contest every shot and make it tough for you guys
to get open. Did you see it that way too?  
CARMEN REYNOLDS: I mean, yeah, they're a good defensive team and they're
always contesting shots. And me in particular being a shooter, like everyone
knows that.  
But I don't think it was any different from any other game.  
  
Q. KP, even without Allyssa out there in the second half, how were they able
to dominate the boards? Especially offensively.  
KRISTA PHILLIPS: I think they're just a good rebounding team in general. I
think that was kind of one of the things we wanted to do well. I think in the
second half we didn't do as good a job as taking care of the rebounds. And I
think that's -- I think you can tell from the session, I think that's part of
the reason why we kind of lost hold of it in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kevin, you guys didn't shoot well again in the second half. Is it their
defense or just missing shots?  
COACH BORSETH: Well, I gotta go back and look. I looked at the last game. We
got a lot better shots in that game. We didn't play very well I thought. We
got some really good looks. We got some good looks down around the basket.
It's critical to score on that basket. We had some good opportunities down
there to score it. We just never made any of them.  
I think you have to be able to make some of those. It's a little tougher to
get to the rim obviously because they really got the gaps shrunk and they're a
lot bigger than we are, a lot more physical. They played good defense but
they're physical. You try to get open and they bump.  
They're in you the whole while. It's body to body. It's a very physical game
in the Big Ten. I think that's probably got a lot to do with it. Modify some
of our movement, perhaps. But they're a pretty strong team. Physical.  
  
Q. Kevin, did you change your offensive strategy at all when DeHaan was
out?  
COACH BORSETH: I don't know. Again, I go back to that first game and I looked
at the shots that we're capable of getting. Kalisha Keane is a heck of a
difference. Let's face it. It's 10-2 and they insert her in the game and it
turns the game around.  
She's a pretty good player in this league. Very good player in this league.
I'm surprised that she's not in the first five personally. She's one of my
kids, I thought one of the best players. But that was really their answer for
us is her. She's a really good player.  
We moved the ball freely. We got the shots we wanted to get until she got in
here, then she tightened things up physically on us.  
I don't know that we were really, you go back and watch videotape, the way we
watch it and you look at it, you'd be surprised sometimes the really good
looks you get. And I think sometimes you get frustrated and you want to get
better looks than the good looks you're getting. Does that make sense? Because
you're not making the ones you got. So I think it's a combination of two
things.  
Again, it's down low. We didn't get it down low enough. We didn't score it
down low enough, certainly. And I think that was something we want to be able
to do.  
So we didn't change a lot. We tried a couple ball screen things. We tried a
couple double-screen things that we thought was effective. And we didn't hit
any shots on them.  
  
Q. Is that a matter of confidence that your players lacked?  
COACH BORSETH: No, they're a pretty good team. You've got to give them credit.  
  
Q. But when you said you get a good shot, you're looking for a better one,
is that confidence?  
COACH BORSETH: You know what, we took a couple of shots in the first half
really early that we shouldn't have taken. We took some really quick shots.
Probably five or six shots that we took really early in transition that we
probably shouldn't have taken. We make them, we look good. But we just took
them a little too early.  
Those five shots are ten points. We come away with nothing. So you gotta give
kids freedom to do things. I don't know if it was a confidence thing. Some of
it is because the defense was pretty good. Some of it is because you just
don't get enough of them. Some of them because it's not in rhythm, it's a
whole combination of things. But they're a pretty good team.  
  
Q. What do you think now about your post-season chances, NCAA, WNIT?  
COACH BORSETH: I don't know that NCAA is an option. Obviously we'd like to be
able to do that. I think I'd really like to play somebody outside our
conference. I think anybody in our conference would like to.  
I think we're realistic to look at a WNIT bid, obviously. Post-season play is
pretty critical as we build our program. I think our two programs are in
different stages. And we're trying to get our program to get us to the middle
of the pack, and then just be that one player away from vaulting ourselves to
the top, because Larry, Michael, Magic, LeBron, you get one of those kids in
your program and all of a sudden you've got a good, solid base of kids around
that. You can vault.  
We think we've got the right kids in. We've got kids that want to be at our
university. We think we've got kids that can make things happen in the
meantime. And chances of playing the post-season for us I'm hoping are good.
We want a chance to play. Two teams, we told our kids at the end of the year
only two teams get to finish their last game of the win.  
If they let us in the NCAA we'd like to be able to do that. Realistically
being able to do it, you know, I'm an optimist, but I'm a realist at the same
time. But going the other direction, I think we've got as good a chance as
anybody. I think our kids are well schooled and I think they're hungry, and
I'm very proud of them.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Iowa  82  
Penn State - 75

  
THE MODERATOR: We've been joined by the University of Iowa. And, Coach, we
will go to you for an opening statement, then we'll take questions for the
student-athletes.  
COACH BLUDER: This is an important win for us. You know, Penn State had swept
us during the year, and we really felt we were playing a much better brand of
basketball now than we were six, seven weeks ago.  
We had to play them within a two-week span. And so we thought we had an
opportunity coming into this game, that we were playing better. And we've
earned it in the last 12 games. And it was probably one of the more unusual
games I've been a part of with Kachine Alexander getting into foul trouble so
early. She hasn't fouled out in over a year. For her to foul out was pretty
significant for our team.  
But you know what, it's a good thing it happened and we won, because it showed
our team we can win without her, and we can win without her rebounding, even
outrebounded Penn State without our best rebounder.  
Kelly Krei, I thought, did a tremendous job especially in the first half
hitting those 3s. Obviously our balanced scoring was tremendous. Tyra Grant is
an absolutely amazing player. She's just an incredibly tough player to defend.
I don't know if you would call that we defended her, but we tried. And I'm
proud of our team effort. We have five people in double figures. That's harder
to stop.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jamie, as a freshman coming in, first of all did the veteran players talk
to the freshmen about what it's like to play here? And, secondly, was it more
nervous for you than a regular game?  
JAIME PRINTY: Yeah, they talked to us a lot about it, actually, just explained
that it's so much fun. It's just a different environment. But I don't think us
freshmen were nervous at all. We were just more excited to get here and get
going.  
  
Q. Kelly, when you saw Kachine go to the bench, did you know you had
(indiscernible) you just take advantage of your opportunity?  
KELLY KREI: I saw her go to the bench and I thought, well, I'll take a couple
of shots for her, and it worked out.  
  
Q. Along those lines, Kelly, was it tough before the game? I think you were
misidentified coming out of the announcements. Did you feel kind of Rodney
Dangerfield-like?  
KELLY KREI: It was just something that happened there. I'm not quite sure. It
was funny. I got introduced twice. But, I mean, you've got to put those things
behind you, and I think we did a nice job of that.  
  
Q. Kelly, so they introduced you twice, you go out for a career high. This
is pretty good.  
KELLY KREI: Yeah.  
  
Q. Get something in for having to introduce you twice next game, too, I
guess?  
KELLY KREI: I'll just have to carry that confidence into the next game.
They're probably not going to do that again. I'm just going to have to pretend
like they did, go out there and play.  
  
Q. Jaime, playing your first Big Ten game and seeing all those fans behind
you, helped motivate you throughout the game and just the fan support, how did
the fan support kind of help you, I guess?  
JAIME PRINTY: I absolutely love our fans. They help us so much. When we go on
a run they're right there cheering. When the other team goes on a run they're
cheering for us. So I think they're a lot of help.  
  
Q. Jamie, what did you guys talk about at halftime and what did you guys do
differently coming out of the half?  
JAIME PRINTY: Actually, Kachine came in and was a great leader like usual and
got us to huddle up. We talked about how we didn't play the best basketball in
the first half but we were still only down by 2.  
We just needed to come out the second half and play as a team and play
stronger and get that energy back. And I think that's what we did.  
  
Q. Was Kachine irritable at all at halftime?  
JAIME PRINTY: No, she was really positive and ready to go and play. She was
excited to go back out there.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, looking at Kelly's numbers, 40 percent shooting from the 3-point
range but averages eight points a game. So a career high 20. I mean, she can
shoot, I just take it it was the way the team goes, it's not that she's called
upon to do it as much.  
COACH BLUDER: She's a phenomenal shooter I think from 3-point range. It's
effortless for her. She's just not greedy enough. You know, we've got a lot of
good shooters on our team. Kelly has the personality she'll defer to somebody
else unless called upon.  
And I think she recognized that she was called upon in the first half, and she
just took advantage that they weren't really playing her that hard.  
  
Q. Let's go back to halftime again with Alexander on the bench, you were
only down by 2. Talk about your mindset coming out there, and the team's,
because at one point -- all these kids are pretty young. Talk about how you
had to do the confidence and get your team back into this?  
COACH BLUDER: We had all freshmen and sophomores on the floor for the majority
of that first half. But we went into the halftime and we were excited. We were
like -- we felt like we'd won that first half because without our best
rebounder, without our best defensive player we're only down two points.  
I thought Jaime Printy's 3 going into halftime was big, a nice momentum boost
for us. But we were feeling very good where we were sitting without having
Kachine.  
  
Q. I know how you feel about free throws, can you talk about going 21, 22 at
the line?  
COACH BLUDER: I loved that we put the free throws down. We shot the ball as a
whole much better in the second half. In the first half without Kachine we
were a bit out of sync, didn't run our offense as crisply in the first half.
In the second half we got nice cuts and back doors and we shot the ball better
in the second half, especially free throw line, obviously 14 for 14.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the difference, not only the scoring that Kach brought
being back on the floor in the second half, but it seemed to change the
attitude and the mood of the team, can you talk about that?  
COACH BLUDER: She's the heart, the soul of our basketball team. And she leads
with such emotion. And a couple times the officials had to calm her down.
That's all right. That's Kachine. That's the way she's played all year. It's
not just for that minute. That's the way she is all the time. She's trying to
get her teammates excited and get them pumped.  
And it's genuine. And it's just that she has so much love for the game. So I
love that emotion. And we didn't tell her to back off either.  
  
Q. You took her out with four minutes into the game, were you tempted to
bring her back in or did you decide then that she was going to probably fit
until half?  
COACH BLUDER: We talked about it as a staff, if we can hang in there without
her, let's not put her in there. We put five, six points in our minds and they
did get up five, but it was so close at that time to the halftime, if they
would have gotten up much more we would have put her back in.  
  
Q. Doesn't get a lot of minutes, but Gabby Machado doesn't seem like the
same player she was earlier in the year. Could you talk about how much you
think she's developed?  
COACH BLUDER: There's no doubt she played very well tonight. She had double
figures. I think it might be a career high for her. I'm not 100 percent sure
on that.  
But I thought she had great moves on the basket today. She's quicker. She's
deceiving quick with her first step. And she's just -- I think she's really
playing a lot more confident right now.  
And I heard her -- she even went over to our gym, our fieldhouse that's close
to where the kids live, and got some extra work in during the week. It's
pretty neat when you've got a freshman taking the effort to go to another gym
to get some extra work on during the week.  
I agree, I think she's playing much calmer. Not so much in a rush but taking
her time. She had a lot of trouble with turnovers earlier in the year because
she was rushing things. She's worked hard with Coach Jensen on her footwork.  
  
Q. Coach, on the conference call you said you thought you might need one to
get in, get into the NCAAs. You got one?  
COACH BLUDER: We need one more.  
  
Q. How much would two cement that to get to maybe 19 wins?  
COACH BLUDER: You know, I think that this was an important victory for us to
get into the NCAA tournament. But I'm not -- I don't want to leave it to
somebody else's hands if it can be in our hands. So why not just go ahead and
win another one.  
And that will be our philosophy going into this game is just one at a time and
try to get as many as we can to make a good statement to the NCAA selection
committee.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

## March 5, 2010

  

### [Alex Bentley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20493)

### [Tyra Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18020)

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Iowa  82  
Penn State - 75

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go directly to questions for the student-athletes. So
raise your hand and we'll get a microphone to you.  
  
Q. Tyra, how is this Iowa team different than the one you played back in
January?  
TYRA GRANT: They're a very competitive team. They had a bye. So they had
fresher legs than we were able to have. They hit some open 3s. We just didn't
execute our defensive game plan as well as we should have coming into the
second half.  
But I think we played fairly well against them in the first half. Just maybe
the fatigue took a to on us, our legs going into the second half.  
  
Q. Alex, you played in here the state finals a few times in your life.
Coming in here you had to have a good sense of the facility and how to shoot.
Did it help your confidence? Because you had a pretty good shooting day.  
ALEX BENTLEY: I think it did help my confidence a little bit being familiar
with the court and familiar with the rims. So I think it was an advantage.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions now for Coach Washington.  
  
Q. Coach, you just seem like you were looking for a third shooter all day.
And it never happened. You had a lot of people shooting the ball. Talk about
how important it was in the sense of this game to have had that third shooter
and how that affected the outcome of this game?  
COACH WASHINGTON: I think it's always better when you're a little more
balanced in your offensive attack. We certainly were yesterday a little bit
more balanced than we were today. And certainly I think that would have helped
our fortunes had we had a third scorer out there.  
But I think, I mean, we scored 75 points. It's not so much what we did or did
not do offensively as we just gave them too many points. We didn't defend as
well as the second half as we did the first half. We gave them too many open
3s. And put them to the free throw line too much.  
So I think it's more a function of us not executing defensively more so than
offensively.  
  
Q. Coach, when Iowa has a number of different scorers, how hard is it to
keep track of a player like Kelly Krei?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, you know, Iowa's a tough team. They've got shooters
that can also put the ball on the floor and get to the basket. That's what
makes them really, really tough is you have to get out and guard them and then
they'll put the ball on the floor and go by you. And they did that to
perfection the second half. We struggled to guard them in either man or zone.  
And I think they got into a rhythm. They got into a flow offensively. Their
confidence was high. And when your confidence gets high, everybody can make
shots. Everybody can make plays. And it kind of had that effect for them. They
had their key people, Wahlin and Printy made some plays and Alexander made
some plays, and I think that gave their entire team confidence offensively
that they could make plays.  
  
Q. Tyra Grant, best I've seen her play in two years was today. Talk about
how her on the floor talking to her teammates, keeping her everybody involved,
the best defense I've seen her play in a long time today, talk about how
important she has been to this program and has been for the last four years?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Her compassion and her competitiveness have been top-notch.
And she did her best to will us to victory today. She would not go down
quietly, and she constantly tried to pull her teammates along with us or with
her, I should say.  
Her impact on this program is incredible. She's going to go down in history as
one of the statistically one of the top five players to ever wear a Lady Lion
uniform. That's saying a lot because there's been a lot of great players that
have come through this program.  
So I'm just really thrilled that I've had the opportunity to coach her and I'm
not surprised that she would have one of her best performances ever when the
stakes were highest for her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2010

  

### [Jolette Law](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18032)

### [Lacey Simpson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18034)

### [Jenna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18033)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  59  
Indiana - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll have an opening statement from the Illinois coach, and
then we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
Coach, we'll start with you. Some general comments about the game.  
COACH LAW: Give a lot of credit to my team. They found a way to get it done.
Got a little scary at the end, but we didn't get rattled. We took care of the
basketball, got some crucial plays, Lacey and Lydia down the stretch. And we
converted on our free throws and found a way to get a win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Jenna, is it the right hamstring?  
JENNA SMITH: My left.  
  
Q. And you've had knee trouble before, too?  
JENNA SMITH: Yeah, I have tendonitis.  
  
Q. The reason I ask is how much in pain are you and maybe you just built up
a tolerance for little wincing pain, you can fight through it for games like
today?  
JENNA SMITH: I do treatment like two, three times a day. If I start struggling
and my leg starts hurting, I tell my teammates, I'll tell Lacey, please help
me a little more.  
You have to push through for your teammates. This is Big Ten tournament.
Single elimination, you have to push through all the pain and everything that
you're feeling, if you're tired or if you're anything, you have to push
through it.  
But there's some days it hurts more than anything, but there's some days I'm
great. Just day-by-day.  
  
Q. Lacey, I guess is there a way Coach Law gets you up for big games? You
guys always seem to perform in some big times?  
LACEY SIMPSON: I just -- Coach don't need -- she does a great job of
motivating us, but it's Big Ten. You win. You play another game. That's my
motivation right there. So at the end of the day that's what I keep thinking
about. You live to fight another day. That's what she's been saying. You live
to fight another day. We took care of business today. So get ready for
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jenna, is it hard not to think about what you guys did two years ago in
this tournament when it's basically -- it's Indiana and then here comes top
seed Ohio State again?  
JENNA SMITH: We think about it. She was mentioning it to our seniors this
year, it's our last one, we want to make another run like that. But we can't
think about the past. We're in it now with new teammates and a lot of energy
and lot of talent, and we have to make the best out of the opportunity now.  
  
Q. Jenna, talk about I guess you guys got the rebounding Big Ten record
today. Comments on that?  
JENNA SMITH: I mean, it's nothing big. I'm here just to play the game with my
teammates, try to get a championship. I'm grateful. I give it all to my
coaches and my family and my teammates. But we're just ready for the next
game.  
  
Q. Were you in pain at all today?  
JENNA SMITH: Not really until the end. I think we had like a long time on and
a couple of my teammates had to help me out. They called me grandma. I felt a
little old at the end. But, no, I wasn't in a lot of pain today.  
  
Q. Lacey, you know you had the motivation coming into today, but do you have
the confidence because of what you guys have done here in the past? Do you go
into the game with more confidence?  
LACEY SIMPSON: Yes, I'm very confident. I don't know what happens to me when
it comes to this tournament. I'm ready to go. I've been ready to go since that
horn hit at the Northwestern game. I've been ready.  
So tonight I'm just going to eat my Wheaties and go to sleep and get ready for
tomorrow.  
  
Q. This was not a very good day, Jenna, for the teams that were 2-0 against
-- everybody who was 2-0 lost today in the third game. So Ohio State won a
couple of games against you guys this year. What do you need to do -- couple
things you need to do to reverse that?  
JENNA SMITH: I think we just need to come off on the jump and play aggressive.
We start off slow sometimes. If we come out and play the defense we know how,
play like we did today, share the ball and help each other on defense, it will
be a good game and we can hang with Ohio State.  
We have all the confidence in the world. We're all on a high where we won
three games in a row. We just have to have confidence and come out and play
the way we can.  
  
Q. Jenna, what did you see from your teammates today? Because against
Northwestern you didn't go very far into the bench. It looked like it was
going to be more of the same today but more people got in here, hit some
shots. What did you see from your teammates?  
JENNA SMITH: I think everybody played with confidence. When you play with
confidence it makes the game slow. You know somebody's playing outside defense
and they've got your back, or if everybody's clapping, being positive and just
helping each other out, I think everybody has confidence.  
If somebody makes a mistake you just gotta keep playing the 40 minutes, make
it up. If we all just stick together and have confidence in yourself and your
teammates, our bench is amazing.  
  
Q. I'm dying to know what Grandma thinks of facing Lavender again?  
JENNA SMITH: She's a great post. It's fun to play against her. We're both
aggressive and strong. Usually I come out and play 40 minutes. It's going to
be aggressive. I know we're going to work hard to battle each other, but it's
going to be a good game and you gotta come out and play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What's been the biggest difference in your team in the last three games
since the Michigan State game?  
COACH LAW: Just we had to do some soul searching and I relieved my seniors
from a lot of pressure, because I put a lot of pressure on them to be leaders
and to take care of the freshmen.  
And my coaching staff and I, we started doing some other duties just to
relieve them. We just started like thinking about where we want to be, how we
want to end the season.  
And it's still not over and we just talk, had a very good talk and a lot of
people regrouping themselves and my team, we started everybody, not just
Jenna, not just my seniors, not Whitney too. Everybody, all 13. We just say
I'm going to give what I can give, I'm going to bring my personal best. When
we do that play and are playing together, we got three wins.  
  
Q. I feel like I'm having a deja vu movement. Does Illinois always have to
do things the hard way? I think I've asked you that question a couple times.  
COACH LAW: With me, I just think I praise the Lord every day I continue and
can't get down, find ways, go through a little stumbling block. We've lost
some games, but as a coach you just gotta continue to motivate them, continue
to teach, prepare them.  
And right now we're trying to do it the hard way, and now there's energy. Our
team now is so energized. They think we make this magical run, but whatever I
can do to keep them motivated and confident and keep them prepared. Hopefully
we'll get it done.  
  
Q. Indiana had 73 shots. You only made 20 of them. How much of that was your
defense and what did you do?  
COACH LAW: We just started being a little more aggressive. I think the first
two times we played them we were a little more passive. We weren't talking.  
We were playing sort of safe. I just think that tonight we sort of dictated.
We knew Jamie Braun was a great player and Jori Davis. First half we slowed
Jori down and Vaughn got hot, and in the second half Jori Davis must have went
in the locker room and had some Wheaties, and she came out playing extremely
well.  
We started dictating, giving them different looks. We threw a couple different
defensive schemes at them just to keep them off balance.  
I think it had to do with our defense, but they were hustling for every loose
ball. They were really aggressive in the second half.  
  
Q. We're not making too much out of Jenna here, are we, or should we, in
terms of what we perceive to be a heroic effort playing in pain? It is that.
She's had to go through an awful lot.  
COACH LAW: I have utmost respect for Jenna Smith. I think she's one of the top
players in the country. I've always said it. My first year I got here, people
were trying to say, What? I said, This kid is special.  
And the most humbling thing about it is that she would rather the team win
than to get all these accolades. But every time you look at the stat sheet,
she's in pain. She's constantly double-double or finding ways to get her
teammates open.  
If I challenge her to come out on the perimeter, Okay, Coach, I'll work on
that. Everything I've asked of Jenna Smith she's responded, and I'm so
thankful. I thank God daily that I had the opportunity to coach her.  
  
Q. What happened on that play near the end of the game where they went to
the television and...  
COACH LAW: Well, let me see, I can be politically correct with this one. They
said that Karisma pushed her out of bounds. And one official called a travel
and the other official said it was a foul.  
So they went to the table to see what actually happened. They said that
Karisma Penn sort of pushed her out of bounds.  
  
Q. Coach, it's been a while since I've seen you guys, but do you have more
tools now than you had when you played Ohio State the last time in terms of
what you can do?  
COACH LAW: Yes. I think the last time we played Ohio State Jenna was on one
leg, barely hobbling down the court. Whitney Toone played extremely well,
Fabiola Josil didn't play then, but she's playing with a great deal of
confidence now. Kersten Magrum didn't get in the game much the first time but
she's starting to play well.  
So I just think collectively as a whole we have more offensive threats and
defensive threats. Adrienne GodBold is playing better on defense. I think
right at this time my freshmen are starting to feel comfortable playing and
playing through their mistakes than we did early on when we played Ohio State
early on.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  67  
Northwestern - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: Joined by Coach McKeown and the Northwestern student-athletes.
Coach McKeown, we'll begin with you having an opening statement, and then
we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
COACH MCKEOWN: You know, we just got off to such a bad start. Michigan took
advantage of that and they shot the ball first half. They just seemed like
they made everything under the shot clock, open shots. We opened them up a
little bit. You have to give them credit.  
And second half I thought we came back with a lot of intensity and I thought
we made it a great game for a while and just can't spot a team in a conference
tournament, 22 points in the first half. We just couldn't dig out of that.
That's basically what happened.  
I will say this: Without getting on the soap box, these guys had a great year.
We've had a tremendous year as a team. When you look at the turnaround we've
had from the last couple of years, these guys deserve a lot of credit. They've
bought into what we do from the first day of practice. For seniors, like
Kristin Cartwright, a fifth-year senior, didn't have to, came back and played
and just had a great year. I think to me I'm going to really look at the big
picture this year when it's all said and done.  
Last thing I will say is hopefully we'll still be playing. Hopefully we'll get
a chance to play in the NIT in the post-season, I think we've earned that
right. We'll see what happens. But I feel like these guys deserve that
opportunity.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. Question for Amy. Amy, a lot of times during the season you have, and
Northwestern has the advantage inside with your height, how do you have to
change your game when you're going against Krista Phillips or Allyssa DeHaan,
a couple of centers that are bigger than you?  
AMY JAESCHKE: Every night it's different when you go up against Big Ten post
players. You just have to change your game up a little bit. You still have to
keep the mentality of having to attack the post players on defense and try to
just get them in foul trouble and rely on your guards a lot to have a big
night.  
  
Q. Kristin, best record in 13 years, Coach, right? I think you said best
record in 13 years. It's worth coming back for, regardless of how the
tournament ends, it's worth coming back for, to be a part of that, I take
it?  
KRISTIN CARTWRIGHT: Yes, like Coach said, it's been a great year. We've made a
lot of -- we've achieved a lot of records from like ten years back or so. So
that was great to be a part of. And obviously we want to do a lot better here.  
But I think we're all proud of each other for the success that we've had this
year.  
  
Q. Kendall, how frustrating was it when Michigan was going on their 12-0
run, stuff like that in the first half when they were pulling off offensive
boards and banking in 3-pointers at the buzzer, stuff like that?  
KENDALL HACKNEY: I give Michigan credit. They were playing hard the first
half. We weren't playing as hard as we could. We let them have a lot of
second-chance opportunities, which we've been working on, and they're very
good at crashing the boards. So we didn't do a great job of boxing out. And
they scored a lot of their points off of second chance.  
And it was really frustrating. But, you know, we just gotta -- we couldn't let
it kill us. We just had to keep coming back in the second half. We really
fought back and showed a lot of heart, I think, especially in the second half.  
So they knocked their shots down. Their shots were falling, every single one,
no matter what they threw up. And we did our best to contest, but a lot of
times we just mixed some boxouts here and there. It hurt us and we dug that
hole in.  
I thought we did a great job coming back and fighting back in the second half.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a lot about changing the culture of winning and the
culture of women's basketball at Northwestern. Where does this season end that
journey and what's the next step?  
COACH MCKEOWN: That's a great question. Not because he's sitting here but Jim
Phillips, to me, has a great vision for Northwestern athletics, not just
basketball. I think it's a great time to be part of it now.  
You saw what football did. You see what Coach Carmody is doing with his
program. So many of our sports are national powers across the board. I think
it's a great time, I think, to be part of Northwestern. And it's frustrating
for me because I'm used to playing in the championship game, playing in the
NCAA tournament.  
So I've got to find a better way to deal with that. I struggle with that right
now. But, more importantly, when you look at our team, it's just been one of
those years, so many great things happen.  
We hit a shot to beat Purdue, it was so long ago and it was last year,
December, but winning out in Michigan and coming back and beating Minnesota
with two seconds left on an inbounds play, hitting the shot, the game we did
at home defeat Michigan. Those were plays and games, beat DePaul for the first
time since DePaul was a Protestant school, I don't know. It's been a while.  
Those games, Beth Marshall hitting eight 3s against Arkansas and just sending
them home in a game that I thought we were in trouble and really they were in
trouble. You're going to remember those things when it's all said and done.  
Today is a bump in the road. But the big picture of this program, I think
we're on the right track.  
  
Q. You're bringing back so many of your rotation players next year, losing
Kristin, how important is that for this experience, for the expression that
they're coming in with a winning season rather than the past class that
started losing right away?  
COACH MCKEOWN: No question, just the atmosphere when we come into our locker
room, you come to practice, you're part of something rather than being in a
situation where a lot of times it's been when is the last game. Now, they're
setting goals higher. And I think Kendall and Dannielle had a great year.
Inesha Hale has been hurt a lot. We have to get her going.  
I think the players we signed, they're all -- we have a young lady sitting
out, Tailor Jones, that played for the University of Florida, played in the
NCAA tournament. She energizes practice, and I think she'll be a big piece of
what we do next year.  
  
Q. This is kind of a follow-up, but if you had to say one thing that you
want to see improve between now and the start of next Big Ten season, what
would that be?  
COACH MCKEOWN: That's a good question. I think where we broke down as a team,
when you really just get technical and just talk about pure basketball and we
watch film all night, you're like I can't believe we didn't screen here or do
that.  
I think offensively we were just limited this year. We have to develop
offensively a little bit. We've got to develop more weapons besides Amy. And
that caught up with us a little bit down the stretch this year.  
I think the biggest thing for us, believe it or not, I've always had a lot of
success as the defensive coach, is that we have to get better offensively, as
a team, passing, shooting.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Illinois  59  
Indiana - 53

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll begin with an opening statement with Coach Jack and then
we'll go to the student-athletes.  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: We wanted that game so bad. We really, really wanted to
win that game. I thought we had a great game plan. I thought we had the right
karma. I just thought that we had the right thought process as far as what we
were going to do to offset their tenacious defense.  
We got opening shots. Just the stars wasn't lined up. It didn't seem to fall
in our court. I'll tell you what, it's 11 teams in this conference. The locker
room that I'm very proud to be in is Indiana women's basketball room, because
at the end of the day as a coach you really have to win. You really want the
win.  
But more important than that, being a mother and a wife, I really want to grow
young women. And I have some character kids on my team. I have some
unbelievable students on my team.  
I have people on my team that's going to be CFOs and CEOs of organizations.
They're going to be working for one of you guys. You're going to be working
for one of them, I should say, one day soon because they are really honorable
young women.  
At the end of the day basketball has to prevail and we have to continue to
grow our basketball side of it. And at the end of the day I'm just really
grateful that my coaches go out and bring in some unbelievable student-
athletes. We'll get better.  
We'll continue to work hard for our Hoosier Nation. The season seems to be up
and down. They seem to be all about the teaching and the moments and the
learning. But we'll keep getting better. We're not going anywhere until we add
to those five championships that our men put up there in that beautiful hall.  
Our goals are big, our dreams are high. We're going to go out there and attain
them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Jori, how are you feeling after a tough game like that?  
JORI DAVIS: Just we really wanted the game. We really had our hopes high going
into the game, and, you know, we fought hard. We left it all out there on the
court. And it's even more disappointing that we have to end this season for
one of our seniors that we all played for this whole season. She's finished
now and that's what hurts most is that we couldn't get this win so we could
keep going on further into the post-season.  
  
Q. Jamie, can you -- the first half there you guys seemed like you had about
ten chances to take the lead and couldn't ever quite get over that hump. Can
you kind of talk about that?  
JAMIE BRAUN: Illinois played really good defense. We weren't hitting some
layups we should have been hitting and they weren't giving us a lot of second-
chance opportunities.  
So they just played really tough D and we just weren't hitting some shots. So
we kept it close but we obviously never got over that hump.  
  
Q. Jamie, I take it you've probably seen enough of Jenna Smith in your
career now. Thoughts on her game now?  
JAMIE BRAUN: She's an amazing player. We all knew it. I knew it since I came
to IU. She's a great player. You can only do so much to contain her.  
We've done it in the past. We just didn't do it today. She played great and
she did what she had to do to help her team win the game.  
  
Q. What do you walk away thinking, Jamie? What do you take away from all
this? Your ride? Talked about it being over, what do you take away from it?  
JAMIE BRAUN: Just all the learning and growing I've had in the past four
years. I grew tremendously from coming out of high school and all that. Take
away a lot of friends from the team, from everyone that's come on the team and
left the team already. And I've taken away good friendships with the coaches.  
I'm only taking the positives out of this. We may not have hung up a banner or
made the NCAA tournament, but we worked hard every day to do what we needed to
do and just fell short.  
  
Q. Jori, down the stretch there in the second half seemed like you guys were
really struggling finally that last four or five minutes something kind of
clicked in. What was the difference to making that last push at the end of the
game?  
JORI DAVIS: I don't know. The time was against us, and we really needed to
take it to another level and that's basically what we did. We just continued
to push through and take it to another level. Unfortunately, we didn't take it
to that other level earlier in the game.  
But our backs were against the wall so that's the only thing I can say really
made us push forward more.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach Jack.  
  
Q. Coach, you beat Illinois twice in the regular season. What was different
about them or you against them this time in the Big Ten tournament?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: The shots didn't go down. We had wide open shots. We had
wonderful plays. We've done the right thing. We got them to turn the ball over
25 times. We got 21 offensive rebounds against an amazing defensive team. At
the end of the day, you've got to put the ball in the hole. And we just didn't
do that in the first half.  
And then we started really pushing and trying and the wrong kids started
shooting the ball, panicking, it's a young team growing up. But at the end of
the day the shots just gotta go in the hole. And they just didn't fall for us
today. Nothing different.  
  
Q. As you look back on this season, you have a number of sophomores and
freshmen and juniors. What do you want them to take away from this season and
what you learned?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: The hunger. I think the locker room today, they finally
woke up and realized, wow, every possession counts. Every situation matters.
And I think the light came on. And you can't let the light come on until you
actually get it. We've been having a young team for so long. One senior
returned last year.  
It was very hard to adjust to a point guard leaving in the middle of the year
like that. We adjusted, and we adjusted. But I think they realized: Wait a
minute, what we have is all we have and what we have should be enough.  
And the desire was there. I think it was suppressed. And it came out in the
last four or five minutes in the game. They said let's give it and see what
happens. And all we're going to do is do it from the beginning. So it's a
learning curve. Learning curve.  
  
Q. What do you want to happen between now and next December when the Big Ten
season starts? What's the major thing or two that you want your team to -- you
need to build on or you need to improve in?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: We've got to remember this moment. We've got to remember
this moment. This is the same team for two more players that beat the No. 4
team in the country. This is the same team that played West Virginia at West
Virginia last year and beat the 13th best team in the country.  
What we have to do is believe that that's supposed to be us. Indiana has been
in a situation for a long time for women's basketball where the belief has
been minimum. Now we have to be consistent.  
We know we can do it. Now the consistency has to be there. How do you do it?
Continue doing what they do. They need to continue to stay in the gym and
continue to work hard and our local talent need to stay home.  
Our local talent stay here. We can get a lot better a lot quicker. But at the
end of the day, what we have is enough. We just gotta continue to believe in
ourselves and believe that we can string a couple games together.  
Whitney Thomas, she showed what could happen if a local decides to stay home.
Our hope is more make that decision to join the Hoosier family.  
  
Q. Coach, Jamie had a big first half. And Jori had a big second half. But it
looked like you struggled to get the two of them together as well as the
supporting cast involved?  
COACH LEGETTE-JACK: I know. Can you believe that? Try standing in my position.
I just think that we kept fighting. I just don't know -- I'm a firm believer.
I just know that we tried to come. And they really wanted to come. And when
they do come together, we are really talented.  
But supporting casts, they continue their support. They did what they did all
season. But when Jamie and Jori is on the same page, greatness seems to
happen. Not just goodness. And we really tried to make it happen. We just fell
short.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

### [Courtney Boylan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20480)

### [Jenny Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20479)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Michigan  67  
Northwestern - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Michigan. Coach, please begin
by making an opening statement. We'll take questions from the student
athletes.  
COACH BORSETH: We're excited to be moving on to the Big Ten tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jenny, can you talk about the game today and your role especially
starting off so well?  
JENNY RYAN: I think that, you know, the game was -- I mean, it was a tale of
two halves, but it was the first time all season that we've actually put a
good half and went into the locker room with a significant lead. We're used to
balling from behind. In the beginning I happened to be in the right place at
the right time. I trusted that everyone else started hitting their shots
eventually. It was a complete team effort.  
You knew Northwestern wasn't going to roll over and die on us. They came back,
had their run. We went through a lot. Were able to stick it out and pull it
out in the end.  
  
Q. Courtney, because of what happened the regular season you knew it wasn't
the same old Northwestern. How much, if at all, do you think about being swept
by them as a motivator for this game?  
COURTNEY BOYLAN: I think that was a big motivator for us. Not just
Northwestern, but being swept by anybody in the Big Ten during the regular
season is a big motivating factor. And they -- definitely at the start of the
season I want to say that they were towards the top of the Big Ten. You knew
they were definitely a good -- they're obviously a good team contender. We
wanted to come out and definitely prove ourselves against them and not let
them sweep us the three games this year.  
  
Q. Jenny, how much did the early offensive rebounds help you guys get going
building momentum?  
JENNY RYAN: Anytime you get offensive rebound it gives you both an extra
possession and takes away a little bit of the other team's momentum and we get
extra shots that maybe we wouldn't have been able to get and just was part of
the big first half run that we had.  
  
Q. Talking about being swept, now you have to play Michigan State. What's
your recollection of those two games?  
COURTNEY BOYLAN: You know, I don't know, to be honest. Right now we're happy
to be playing them moving on. We have another shot at them.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the great start in the first half and then what
happened in the second half?  
COACH BORSETH: You know, we haven't really put together a first half in a long
time, and today we did obviously. I thought that really helped us. We had
three straight turnovers. I think that really set off that bad run in the
second half. You know what, it just gets to you. I think it gets to anybody,
get too big of a lead the other team makes some shots and all of a sudden the
collar starts to tighten.  
I don't think they were any different than any other team would handle it.
Courtney's charge stopped that bleeding and we got back into it. It was a long
stretch, agonizing for anybody. At least it was for me.  
  
Q. Were you pleased with the balance on your offense tonight? I think it was
five players in double figures just being able to spread it around couldn't
focus --  
COACH BORSETH: That's the goal. We've got a no -- we've got an offense that
relies on all five people being able to score. They kept telling me they're
face guarding Carmen, they're face guarding Carmen. Well, let them face guard
Carmen. There's four other guards that have to be able to produce. They did.
Jenny had a couple of put-backs, KP had a couple, Roni had a couple, Courtney
had a couple.  
So balance is key. We don't have any All-Conference players. We've got to rely
on the teamwork to do that. I thought the kids did a good job tonight.  
  
Q. Kevin, looked like Amy Jaeschke was having a lot of trouble with the
physical play, with Courtney Phillips' physical play. Did you do anything
different this time against her?  
COACH BORSETH: Against Amy Jaeschke? She's a good player. She's so efficient
down around that basket and they use her the way anybody would want to use
her. They give her the ball quite a bit.  
We tried not to help as much this time around. I know last time we helped
quite a bit off of her. They pitched it out, hit a bunch of 3s. We tried to
let KP do more so, handle herself this time.  
And I think both those big kids guarding each other get frustrated, because
they have big bodies leading on them all game long. I didn't really look at
Jaeschke's stats, 6 for 14. Obviously we did a pretty good job on her. She's
still at 17.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Jenny's play? I think she had a hand in your first 15
points?  
COACH BORSETH: Yeah, you know what, she had two down the stretch in that
stretch where we weren't making baskets. She had two wide-open shots that she
missed. Down the road Jenny's going to make those shots. We had some shots in
that stretch, the three turnovers when we didn't score, you asked me that
question, those were killers. We came back, had two open shots. Jenny had two
of them.  
She's one of those kids that really doesn't have any fear at all. I think you
watched her play in the state tournament game when she was a junior and kid
comes out on fire and she plays with a lot of confidence, and obviously we
feed off of that. She played 40 minutes. I don't think we even took her out of
the game.  
  
Q. Free throws down the stretch at Northwestern killed you guys. Today
obviously was a completely different story. Talk about that?  
COACH BORSETH: Courtney was 7 for 7. That had a lot to do with it. I think we
did a lot of substituting to favor that because we knew they were going to
follow us. We only had four fouls at one stretch. Joe was telling them to
foul. And I figured, oh, boy, here we go. If we're not careful, they'll knock
it out of our hands.  
We got Courtney in at the right time, of her and Day switching. Although Day
shoots good free throws, Courtney does a good job at it. But free throws are
key, especially when you've got leads in the game. If you make them, you can
maintain your lead. If you don't, you let the other team back in.  
But today we made them.  
  
Q. Kevin, you've got Michigan State, how do you approach that and what do
you remember about the two games against them?  
COACH BORSETH: How can you forget. They're really good. They're one of those
teams that plays really well at the end of the year, and I think they
demonstrated that the last two years. So they're probably playing their best
basketball right now and they're certainly a handful for anybody. And they're
really a handful for us. But right now we just want to get through that
Northwestern game and we're glad to be able to move on.  
So have to go back, watch a little videotape, but we're going to have to play
really well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Alex Bentley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20493)

### [Tyra Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18020)

### [Julia Trogele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20494)

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  63  
Minnesota - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go directly to questions for the student-athletes. After
we're done with that we'll stay with Coach Washington.  
  
Q. Alex, is that what you expected, coming back home, playing here?  
ALEX BENTLEY: What I expected? To win? Of course it is. It was nice to be back
in my hometown and get back in the hometown feel and having my family and
everybody here. It was a nice win.  
  
Q. Julia, how good does it feel to come out and win the first round here?  
JULIA TROGELE: I think it was really exciting for us. The past two years that
I've been here, you know, we unfortunately haven't been able to get past the
first round. We struggled a little bit.  
But coming out as strong as we did and knowing that they had beat us twice,
and then beating them was really amazing for us. It just gives us a lot of
confidence going into the rest of it.  
TYRA GRANT: Basically saying what Julia has already said. It gives us a lot of
confidence going into the second game. But also I feel like a lot of this came
from the second half of the Indiana game during the regular -- well, Big Ten
regular season.  
But it's exciting. It's exciting to be able to do something like this. And we
hopefully can continue progressing forward into the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
Questions for Coach Washington.  
  
Q. You play Iowa tomorrow. And they stand out there and shoot 3s and shoot
3s and shoot 3s. How do you defend them?  
COACH WASHINGTON: With much difficulty, because they also -- Kachine Alexander
and Kamille Wahlin and Jaime Printy are also very good at driving the ball and
trying to get the ball into the paint. You've got to be on your Ps and Qs and
we've got to have good ball containment defense.  
We've got to make sure that we get up on them, guard them, and, quite simply,
you just have to make them take tough shots, make them take contested shots
and rebound when they miss.  
But they're tough match-ups.  
  
Q. There was a period of time in the first half when you had four freshmen
on the floor. I don't know if that was intentional or not. But what do you see
out of that unit? How do you see them progressing over the next few years?  
COACH WASHINGTON: Well, I hope they progress a lot. I think they all have --
one thing they all have in common is they're fighters and they're competitors.
I knew coming into this game that we had some depth, and I was going to use
it.  
We used it and we needed to rest our starters some. I thought Julia Trogele
played a tremendous game. Part of that is because she got quite a few breaks.
Tyra was able to come back the second half. She sat some the first half.  
We didn't miss a beat. So I'm really confident in our freshmen.  
I think they at different times really give us a lot. Nikki, a stretch there
in the second half, I think she got every offensive rebound and put-back and
they were all big. Marisa Wolfe comes in and gives us some good rebounding,
gets to the free throw line, and Gizelle makes a play, and Alex Bentley is our
starter.  
They all contribute in different ways. I'm hoping they just get confidence and
get better and over the next three years that they're here we can continue to
have days like this.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 4, 2010

  

### [China Antoine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20495)

### [Pam Borton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14360)

### [Brittany McCoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19290)

  
_INDIANAPOLIS, INDIANA_  
  

Penn State  63  
Minnesota - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from Coach Borton, then go to
the student-athletes for questions.  
COACH BORTON: Obviously we're very disappointed with the second half that we
had defensively and offensively. I think shooting 20 percent doesn't help you
win basketball games.  
And I thought a lot of things broke down defensively in the second half with a
lot of penetration, and offensive boards. You know, having 22 turnovers didn't
help. I thought Penn State did a great job and wish them good luck for the
rest of the tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for China, please.  
  
Q. You came in and you sparked them a little bit with some 3-pointers and
then after that really didn't get a spark from any other player. Was it the
turnover that hurt your offensive verve?  
CHINA ANTOINE: Yeah, I think we just had a rut where we didn't score and that
caused us a little bit of problems. But after we tried to regroup and tried to
focus in on what we had to do and came back and went on a run ourselves. But
unfortunately we couldn't finish the game out.  
  
Q. Brittany, obviously coming into the tournament, you guys knew what you
had to do to make a run, to have a chance at the post-season. Can you talk
about the mindset coming into this game, just having to think about making a
run?  
BRITTANY MCCOY: I think we had a positive mindset. We knew this was something
we could do, make a run at this tournament. Take it one at a time and look at
the bigger picture, know we had a pretty good draw and we had a good
opportunity to win it all.  
I think people's minds are in the right place, and unfortunately we just
didn't get the win today.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what you'll learn from this year? I know it's been a
rough year in the Big Ten play especially.  
CHINA ANTOINE: Absolutely. I think the seniors this year showed us a lot. They
showed us how to stay as a team and they kept us as a team, even though we
were struggling. So I learned a lot from the seniors and their leadership that
they brought to us as the younger players and as the future of the team.  
So I'm proud to have played with them and they've helped me and helped the
rest of the team get through this. And I think that's the main thing we
learned from this.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll continue with Coach Borton.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you do as a coach, just talking to your team about coming
to the tournament when you know you have to make a run otherwise the season is
over? How do you get them prepared for that?  
COACH BORTON: You talk about this is a new season. The Big Ten has been tough
this year from No. 1 to No. 11. I think it's the first time in a long time
that every team has won six games in the Big Ten, and I think it really
depends on your match-ups. And it was a new season. We knew we had to win four
games in a row, but just coming in with a positive mindset and trying to get
everybody to play on the same night.  
That's been our issue all night, just getting everybody to show up on the same
night and have a little bit of consistency. So we knew it was going to be one
and done. And we came in and we were going to go out fighting.  
  
Q. What did you tell the team afterward? I know you've been having a lot of
speeches after games, trying to keep the morale up and trying to keep them
from totally breaking down. But this is it. What was the kind of final words
for the team?  
COACH BORTON: I think, you know, this isn't how we wanted to end the year.
We've had a tough season. It's been a disappointing season.  
But for the seniors just mention that they've had a great four years with
memories and three post-seasons, and the friendships and they've given a lot
to this program and for everybody that's coming back, we've got a lot of work
to do.  
We've got a lot of work to do to right the ship. It's going to take a whole
lot of hard work, but hopefully we've learned a lot about ourselves throughout
the course of the year and -- to fix things for next year.  
  
Q. You mentioned the 20 percent shooting. Did you feel you got the looks you
wanted, or do you think they took you away from some of the good shots you had
in the first half?  
COACH BORTON: I think about all the layups we missed. I thought we had some
wide-open outside shots that normally go down. I thought we got some looks. I
thought there was very few bad shots that we took throughout the course of the
second half. And we have struggled shooting the ball.  
And you've got to be able to make layups. You've got to be able to go to a
post player inside to score pretty easily. We've really depended on making a
lot of outside shots this year and just being able to finish in the lane has
been an issue.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2010

  

### [Elaine Elliott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15524)

### [Kalee Whipple](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16974)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  70  
Utah  60  
(OT)

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah head Coach Elliott and student-athletes.
Coach, if we could start with you with comments on today's game and the
tournament overall.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, first, you know, congratulations to San Diego State. I
thought they obviously put together two extremely good back-to-back games for
their tournament to get the win.  
You know, congratulations go to them. A great shooting night. Again, we really
weren't able to keep the shooting percentage down. We out-rebounded them, but
they got really important -- they got rebounds at the wrong time in terms of
later in the game. So the credit certainly goes to them. They'll do, I hope,
exceptionally well in the NCAAs.  
You know, our kids, I couldn't be more proud. Our seniors have an amazing
career to brag about in terms of their championships over the course of their
four years, their success in the NCAA tournament. The young players that we
have on our team have just come miles and will be something to seriously be
reckoned with as they grow older.  
So, you know, all is good, I think, at Utah. So I'm real proud of the kids.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. At this time we'll open it up for questions
for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you tell us what happened, you didn't score a field goal the last
five minutes of regulation or in the overtime. Anything in particular that
went wrong there?  
KALEE WHIPPLE: I think, just like what coach said, they got rebounds at the
wrong time. They got their shots, and that led to us just kind of getting
frustrated, I think, at times. We still fought hard. We just didn't hit a
shot.  
  
Q. Kalee, the first half you had a huge first half, but in the second half
it kind of tailed off. Did they tighten up the defense on you?  
KALEE WHIPPLE: Well, they're a great defensive team. So, I mean, I feel like
it was the same the first half as it was the second half. Jené guarded me most
of the game. She did a great job. I had shots. Some fall; some don't.  
  
Q. Kalee, can you talk about the year, how far your team came, how well you
did when you weren't maybe picked that high to begin with?  
KALEE WHIPPLE: Yeah, I'm very proud of our team. We came a long ways. We were
talking in the locker room just before we came here. It's amazing how far
we've come.  
We have a lot of freshmen coming in taking on big roles, and they've accepted
those roles now and they've played them just fantastic. Obviously I'm
disappointed that we couldn't get a win tonight. San Diego State,
congratulations to them. But I'm very proud of our team and how far we've come
and how well we've done in this tournament.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. We'll continue
with questions for Coach Elliott.  
  
Q. You were up 56-50, had a long pass, looked like a clear layup that was
missed. Do you feel that pretty much was the turning point?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Yeah. That was the buster. Put the word in front of that you
want. Yeah, that was it. No doubt about it. 'Cause not only did we miss that,
then I think they got the long pass. They laid it up right after that
themselves. So that was the one key problem that obviously kind of set the
tone the rest of the way.  
  
Q. In overtime they had six points before you could get a shot off. A lot of
turnovers. Any reasons?  
COACH ELLIOTT: No, I mean, you know, that's not sort of something that's never
happened. So as much as we talk about being, you know, we've improved a lot,
but we're still -- we're not, you know, yet some completely different team
that isn't prone to many of the same problems that, you know, kind of show up
through the process of growing.  
I mean, it's a tight game. It's a huge game. And obviously turning the ball
over, you know, kills you. So, I mean, there's nothing more to say than that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about any post-season possibilities if you take a bid to the
WNIT?  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, my own feeling is this is a team that would benefit from
that. I mean, I think each year it's something that should be determined by
your own team and program. We don't just go because it goes on your résumé.
This is a team, I think, that would benefit from that.  
I think next year we'll be the youngest team in this country. So the more
chance we give the kids coming back, you know, experience and new
opportunities, sort of the excitement and enthusiasm of moving on, I think
that's in the best interest of the growth of this team, you know, over the
next couple of years.  
I also take into account whether or not the team believes that. I will never
take a team who doesn't want to keep playing for whatever reason. There are
oftentimes I think that happens. I know what I believe and they know what I
believe. I'll get feedback from them on what they want. If they match, we
would love to move on.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  70  
Utah  60  
(OT)

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State head Coach Burns and student-
athletes. Coach, if we could start with you, comments on today's game.  
COACH BURNS: Well, very first we need to and would like to congratulate Utah,
who I think was the hottest team in our league coming into this tournament. I
think Coach Elliott did as remarkable a job as she tends to usually do with a
group of two really special veteran kids and integrating the freshmen into
their system.  
Again, I thought they were the hottest team coming in and I wasn't surprised
they made it out of the backside of the bracket.  
With that, you know, as a group, as a team, as a program, we couldn't be more
excited and proud than to be able to cut down the nets as Mountain West
Conference tournament champions. We've had a lot, a lot of growth. I've got a
great university president who says athletics has the most growth and
development of any area of the university because everything is so hands on
and emotions get so high.  
I think we've had such great growth. We had great senior leadership that
really helped us raise the whole team to understand the sense of urgency and
focus that's needed when we all do something together.  
But I think we played at a very high level all week long. I mean, we came in
with the eye of the tiger, and I'm thrilled with the outcome, but I'm not
surprised at the outcome.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jené, those last three seconds you had a fast break to the basket, pulled
up. What were your emotions at that time?  
JENÉ MORRIS: At that point I wanted the clock to run out because after an
overtime game, we were tired. We just wanted the clock to run out. We didn't
want to be in the game any longer.  
I was excited. Pure bliss. I mean, it's nice for the first time not to be up
here crying because we lost. We made it to the championship two years in a row
and lost. So just the fact we worked so hard, battled through an overtime game
against Utah who I believe won three overtimes against TCU. We knew they were
a great team and could come back at any time. The fact we stuck together was
amazing.  
  
Q. The last 10:29 you held them without a field goal. Did you do anything
differently?  
QUENESE DAVIS: I wouldn't say we did anything differently besides kept them
off the O glass. Coach pointed out to us at the timeout if we keep them off
the O glass, we'll be successful, and we were.  
  
Q. The last couple of years you've had some pretty nerve-wracking Selection
Sundays. What are you doing tomorrow?  
JENÉ MORRIS: I don't know. Probably be sleeping.  
COACH BURNS: I knew the answer (smiling).  
PARIS JOHNSON: Probably getting some treatment. Our bodies are beat. We played
three games, tough games. For me personally, I'm in the paint all the time
going up against strong bodies. I'm pretty beat. So I'll probably be resting
my body, get some ice baths, just relax.  
  
Q. Ms. Davis, down eight with four minutes to go, what are you thinking
then?  
QUENESE DAVIS: Got to step it up. I knew I huddled my team up at one point and
was, We got this. We just got to stay together, get some big stops, make some
big plays on the other end.  
  
Q. Jené, so many expectations on this team this year coming in as the pre-
season favorites. Up-and-down games. Do you feel this sort of validates you,
that you knew all along you could be the team everyone thought you should be
or were?  
JENÉ MORRIS: Definitely. That was our goal coming into the tournament. We
weren't really happy with the way we played during regular season. This was
our time to show how good we actually can be.  
Like I said, these last three games have been amazing. We stuck together, it
was balanced. We all played our hearts out. Now we're excited to take it to a
national level to see how we compete.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue
with questions for Coach Burns.  
  
Q. When Quenese picked up her fourth foul, did you think about taking her
out then?  
COACH BURNS: No. She played a fabulous game. She had a fabulous week. If we
were gonna go down, we were gonna go down guns blazing. We were in a situation
that she really is the only one who has the experience to do the things you
have to do so quickly on the fly when you can't use a timeout. You have to be
able to verbally communicate, know she can do things on the floor. Obviously
we had a Plan B so we would be ready in case it was. We always had her on the
softest of their three perimeter defenders. They always have one great shooter
out on the floor.  
The challenge was, and what I'm most pleased with with our team, we were able
to do the things we needed to do to make up a deficit, and she couldn't really
be involved in it because of that. I wouldn't have wanted to see what would
have happened if she fouled out. I didn't even consider it. She earned the
right to finish that game.  
  
Q. Did it seem to you your energy level kind of dropped after the fast
start?  
COACH BURNS: Well, and I think that, you know, that's with our team, at
halftime, we shot nearly 70%. I mean, we've played at such a high level. I
kind of reminded them of our men's game from last night, where they played so
well in that first half, and then I think somebody made a shot and they end up
going in down one. Look at the shot Whipple makes right before the half.
Again, I think for us psychologically it's a point, it's a game.  
So, yes, I agree with you. But the things that we felt we could do to Utah
energy-wise, foul-wise, we were gonna try to hold off until about a seven- or
eight-minute mark, then the game dictated we had to do some things
differently. But we did.  
A lot of that is Allison Duffy. She is really versatile. She's really a
catalyst on the floor. She's naturally going to speed the game up because of
her speed.  
  
Q. Also seemed like you picked up your interior defense in the game.  
COACH BURNS: Right. She's a very good player. Not excited she's a freshman,
not excited at all. What a year she has had. I think we kind of tag teamed. I
think Jessika Bradley is a very good interior defender. Really for us it's
more ball pressure. We need ball pressure. We need to make those 20-foot
passes instead of 15-feet passes. People get tired, relax a little bit on the
perimeter, gave her too many easy touches.  
When it was winning time, money time, they understood how to dig deep and do
what we needed to do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH BURNS: It's wonderful when a team reaches its potential, isn't it?

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  69  
TCU - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by TCU head Coach Mittie and student-athletes.
We'll start with an opening comment about the game from Coach Mittie.  
COACH MITTIE: Well, I think first off, congratulations to Utah. I thought they
played outstanding. You know, they ended the year, I thought, playing very
good basketball. We had one of the great games in college basketball all year
long against them at their place. Sawyer had a great game today. Rodrigues
gave them a big lift.  
We looked uncertain early. You know, we just never really got in a flow. I
think that's a credit to Utah. I think you'd like to see us as the game went
on play better, but we just -- they never allowed us to get many easy looks,
and consequently we didn't play very well most of the day.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it up for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Was there anything they were doing defensively that you hadn't seen
before?  
T.K. LaFLEUR: No. I mean, we've seen just about every defense by this time of
the year. I just feel that we just didn't execute on offense. We just kind of
went into like a relax mode, like it was just going to happen. We never had a
sense of urgency to come out and make it happen.  
I think that showed. I mean, they played really good defense. They played a
really good game tonight. I just feel that we just kind of let it happen to us
instead of making it happen.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. We'll continue
with questions for Coach Mittie.  
  
Q. What do you attribute the poor shooting?  
COACH MITTIE: Well, I think Utah's defense played excellent, you know. You
know, we missed some shots early, so it looked like we tightened up a little
bit. Ice had a tough night. That's the first time I've seen Carter have that
tough a night. I think T.K. said it pretty well. Early, the first couple, two,
three minutes, we looked aggressive. We didn't get some shots to go, we
stopped being aggressive. We stopped playing together. Then we forced some
things.  
A little bit of both. I think Utah's defense was excellent. I thought our
execution was poor most of the day. That combination leads to a pretty tough
day.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the idea of the fact that they played two games the
last couple days and you sat around. Was that any disadvantage?  
COACH MITTIE: No. I was glad to be sitting around. It means you won the
league.  
The thing that was a little challenging for us was we didn't get as much
practice times as I would have liked this week. Different things,
circumstances. But I thought we kind of survived that. I thought we had a good
workout yesterday.  
You know, you can go on and on about those things, explanations. I tell the
team all the time, I don't want to hear explanations, I don't want to hear
excuses. You guys always want explanations. I try to stay away from those
things.  
I think Utah played excellent. I think they deserve all the credit in the
world. I won't judge my team off of one game because I've got a great group.
They have worked hard all year long. I don't know if you were at the four-
overtime game in Salt Lake. That was a great matchup between two pretty even
teams. Utah deserves a lot of credit today.  
I've got a good group that didn't play very well. You know, I'm kind of
hurting for them right now because they wanted to challenge themselves to see
if they could get another championship here, and that's not easy in a good
league.  
  
Q. You talked about rebounding was important, you wanted to stay even.
You're a smaller team. They had a 15-rebound advantage. Talk about that.  
COACH MITTIE: Yeah, you know, let me look at the numbers here. You know, we're
even on the offensive glass with 'em, but we miss 41 shots. They only miss 19
shots. And they're still even on the offensive glass.  
So we didn't chase the ball very well today. A lot of that was that a lot of
our shots were not coming where everybody knew. When offense is clicking, you
can see where the shots are coming from, you become a better offensive
rebounding team. We didn't have offensive flow all day.  
To their credit, they kept us off the glass. If you have better offensive
flow, you're going to have more rebounds come your way.  
  
Q. Toward the end of the game, they got flustered. Could you have done that
longer in the game, looking back?  
COACH MITTIE: We were supposed to. That's part of my frustration with how we
just weren't aggressive early in the game because we were supposed to be in
the press. You saw at the end of the game on every dead ball situation and
every free throw, we were supposed to be that aggressive because we did think
we had some advantages there.  
Obviously, you asked the question about them playing games. We wanted to turn
this into a 40-minute game because maybe their fatigue level. We just never
got the game into that style early enough until the very, very end.  
I thought at the end of the first half, she was able to rest a few players,
Taryn had two fouls, they got her on the bench. She played with a group of
subs and still went into halftime up five.  
No, we never were able to play with the energy in the first half that we
wanted to. We had designed going into the game to say, Okay, not just on free
throws, because tournament time you don't get as many free throw opportunities
usually, although there were quite a few shot today. We wanted to go on all
the dead ball situations as well and we just never had the energy that we
needed to have.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH MITTIE: If the ball goes in the basket, you get to set your defense. If
you're missing shots, you're constantly on your heels. Yeah, we just never got
the game in the style we needed.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH MITTIE: Thanks.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  77  
BYU - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by BYU Coach Judkins and student-athletes. We'll
start with an opening comment about the game by Coach Judkins.  
COACH JUDKINS: Well, I'm not real happy. This wasn't the kind of game I wanted
to have our team play tonight. You got to give San Diego State a lot of
credit. I think they came out very aggressive defensively, and kind of set up
our offense, did a good job of getting turnovers to make easy baskets. We just
didn't really execute the way we should have early in the game.  
We kind of downed 11 and had a three-pointer right there. If Cori could have
hit that, we could have got down to single digits. I think it would have
really helped us.  
The second half, we came out the same way. They just took it to us. They
probably played the best I've seen them. But got to give them a lot of credit.
Beth did a great job of preparing for the game.  
I'm proud of this team. We're better than this. I think they know it. But it's
something we're going to learn as a team and hopefully next season, even the
remainder of this season, learn from it and get better.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Coming into this game having a great week last week, how was your
confidence level and what do you think you could have done to try to stay in
this ballgame?  
JAZMINE FOREMAN: I think our confidence was great. I think we came, you know,
knowing that we're good enough, we're talented enough to play with the best of
'em.  
But, uhm, you know, it seemed like we kind of got punched first and we didn't
react the way we wanted to. It might have shook us up a little bit.  
But as far as like last week, I mean, I think we proved a lot by how we played
last week. We just got to work more on being consistent.  
  
Q. San Diego State already had a game out here, then had a day off, then
played you today. Is there any advantage to that as far as momentum?  
CORIANN WOOD: I think there's a little advantage to that. You know, they just
barely played. They kind of had their rhythm and their groove. Us sitting out,
we had momentum coming off those two great wins. I know we were ready to play.
Like Jaz said, they punched first and we didn't react like we normally do and
like we can. I think they did have a little advantage, but that wasn't it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time and continue
with questions for Coach Judkins.  
  
Q. Coach, how big was it when you cut it down to 10 with 15 seconds to go in
the half, they scored 5 in those final seconds? How big of a momentum killer
was that for you guys?  
COACH JUDKINS: I think that really hurt us. I think it's kind of like climbing
up a hill, you get almost to the top of the hill, you're going to grab the
last ledge, you slip and fall down 10 ledges. I told them the first half, If
we can cut this to 10 points or less going into halftime, we can come back.  
I think when Cori had that open three and then we come back and we foul 'em,
give another three-pointer, you just can't do those kind of things when you're
trying to fight back.  
You know, I think sometimes you try so hard as a team, like both mentioned,
they felt like they got punched in the face early. I think that kind of
bothered them and they kind of lost the mental part of the game. We made more
defensive mistakes tonight guarding them than we did the two previous games we
played 'em.  
So I think that is just mental. That's just mental not thinking what you need
to do and how you need to do it. You know, San Diego State has been here.
They've been in the finals now the last three years. These guys have been in
this tournament. I think experience in those situations can help you be ready
to play and really do that.  
I know tonight if San Diego would have played the way they played against
Wyoming, we would have beat them. But they didn't. They came, played a lot
better. Just that experience, I think, really helped them.  
  
Q. Having been on both sides of this tournament format, what is your opinion
now of how it should be and how much do you feel like not playing for six days
hurt your team?  
COACH JUDKINS: Well, I think it hurt both us and TCU. Both of us lost. So
we're going to consider as coaches, see what we think is really the best for
our conference.  
The main reason we did this is we wanted No. 1 and 2 seed to have the best
opportunity to really win the tournament. I think the negative part of it is
we practice 55 minutes in the arena. I mean, that's all we had, 55 minutes to
shoot in that arena, which we don't play during the season, so it's not like
we can come practice here during the year.  
I think it affects you. I don't care what anybody says. That's no excuse
tonight. I mean, we shot the ball all right. We just didn't defend, no matter
if we were playing on a different court, we just didn't defend like we
normally do.  
  
Q. Coach, you still got a lot of young players that will come back next
year. I know it's early, but what do you see as this group's future? What do
you need to do going into next year? Were you pleased with the progress this
year?  
COACH JUDKINS: Well, I think if they come back, improve as much as they
improved this year for next season, we will be a contender. If we don't win
the league, I think my team would be disappointed.  
We have everybody back. We're going to be able to go to Europe this year as a
team, which will give us some experience to play some other teams. I think
we've got a lot of young kids that I sat out that were redshirted that will be
ready to go. Hopefully we've learned from some of these things. We've played
very well this year. We've played three games where we just got outplayed
completely. That's kind of what I told my team after the game. I said, You
know, we can't play three games like this. A game like this should be once in
your career, where you get blown out, you're not mentally into the game. We
had it happen to us. We got to do a better job of that. We got to figure out
what causes that.  
I really know these guys want to win, and they're willing to work hard this
off-season. They'll work hard again to try to improve so we can have a great
season next year.  
  
Q. If the opportunity comes up, would you consider going to the WNIT this
year?  
COACH JUDKINS: Yes, yes. Yeah, this team needs to go to a post-season
tournament and really feel the excitement, the joy of going to a post-season
tournament. Sometimes you take a lot of things for granted as players, as
coaches. I think post-season, a lot of coaches really don't appreciate that as
much.  
This team needs that. We need to go on and play well in post-season. If we do
take the NIT, go, play really well, have a chance of representing our
conference, our university well.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH JUDKINS: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  69  
TCU - 57

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah head Coach Elliott and student-athletes.
We'll start by taking an opening comment about the game from Coach Elliott.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, obviously very encouraged and happy that the kids came
out and really competed just from the start. Played very good defense. We had
kids, you know, stepping up, chipping in from different places. I mean, I
think that we're really -- you know, as we hoped with this team, that we would
become better, that we would, you know, learn more, that our young kids would
step up and begin to contribute and chip in and we'd have the leadership that
we needed from the older kids. That's really what we saw tonight, was just a
combination of those things.  
You know, good fortune for us. TCU is just unbelievably talented. They earned
a regular-season championship for a reason. They absolutely are going to be a
great representative to the NCAAs for this league. We'll just, you know, try
our hardest to try to be another one.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your defense on No. 4, what you were trying to do?  
HALIE SAWYER: Well, we knew Sverrisdottir was going to come at us. She's a
great player. I knew that if I could contain her as much as I could, that my
team would help me, and they sure did.  
As for rebounding and scoring, I think just went my way tonight. I, you know,
just felt good in warmups. Went throughout the game. Just happy about that, I
guess.  
  
Q. Kalee, can you talk about the team, how they're playing right now.  
KALEE WHIPPLE: Yeah, I think it's all about like what coach said, that we had
people contribute, and that's what a team is all about. That if we have more
than just two players contributing at times, if we can have all five people
when they're out on the court coming in and contributing, that we can be a
really good team.  
We're excited to be here. I know we don't want to be done playing. So we're
going to keep playing as hard as we can each game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time and continue
with questions for Coach Elliott.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Halie's overall plays, most offensively and
defensively how she did tonight.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, we've kind of been waiting for this. Halie has the
capabilities. The way people choose to defend us, because of Taryn's presence,
is not to defend Halie. That's where the double-teams come from.  
It's really, kids, can they make people pay. She absolutely did so tonight.
She knows that she can. The shots she took, she's a very nice shooter. She
took advantage of those opportunities.  
The other thing it opens us is the opportunity to get the ball. We told her
that was what she needed to get done. She could go have a career high on the
offensive end of boards if she goes because there's nobody between her and the
basket when the shot goes up.  
You know, it's one thing talking about or understanding. That's the easy part,
sort of what you need to do. Then it's completely a function of whether a
player can do it and does do it. That's exactly what she did tonight. That's
to her credit.  
  
Q. What happened to Taryn with the injury and was there a discussion about a
possible flagrant foul on that?  
COACH ELLIOTT: I'm not really sure, to tell you. I mean, it was about -- they
were trying to decide if, after the foul, then there was an action of a
flagrant face hit, I guess is what you call it. Sort of that was after the
foul. So their determination was it was all one play, and so there was no more
action on that play.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, you know, our concern, we wouldn't let her come back
because she had a headache. It's a concussion problem. You don't know the
severity of that. The determination of that is not ours to make, it's the
doctor's to make. I hope it's one of those scenarios where they weren't going
to let her go back because that is the smart thing to do. Our hope is it's not
a graded concussion of some sort so we can have her. That's obviously our
hope, but we don't have that answer.  
  
Q. Halfway through the season you were struggling to stay around .500. How
surprised are you with where you sit right now?  
COACH ELLIOTT: I'm not surprised. You know, we really believed that we would
continue to get better. That's what this team, you know, really was about. We
weren't made up of juniors and seniors coming back from, you know, a campaign
that said you were going to start strong and rip through. We had so many
players that are used in our rotation that didn't know what their capabilities
would be at this level.  
We believe they'll be very good at some point in their career, but the
expectation that's going to happen as freshmen and sophomores is not a normal
one to have at this level.  
You know, even in our league, the whole league scenario, I mean, our first
games in league were road games against TCU and San Diego State, who ended up
first and third in the league on the road. So we played them first. So we were
0-2. Everybody else played them late and they went 0-2. It doesn't matter.
Nobody played the same schedule at the same time. It only matters when you're
done.  
  
Q. Rodrigues had an outstanding game tonight. Talk about her play.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Yeah, that's the kind of chipping in mentality that we've
talked about through this tournament, that everybody's just got to chip in. We
believe she's a very talented young freshman player, who is very inconsistent,
who is better at some things than others, has many things to learn.  
But certain games especially, any I guess you could call them more athletic
games, she's somebody we know we have to use because she's really got a
beautiful athleticism to her game.  
She did better defensively. That's really what keeps her from playing
consistently for us, isn't her offensive potential, it's the difficulties that
you have in teaching kids their responsibilities defensively. That's coming
along. She's really going to be somebody people will know about before her
career is over.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  77  
BYU - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State head Coach Burns and student-
athletes. We'll start by taking an opening comment on the game from Coach
Burns.  
COACH BURNS: Well, obviously we're really excited about the position that
we're in, which is 40 minutes away from the ultimate goal, which is to play in
the NCAA tournament.  
You know, I think since we've been here, it feels like a very long time. The
quarterfinal games and the first-round games were so competitive, at first
blush today was almost stunning on both sides. I think in this game it was
more the experience of our team, the game was called a little bit differently,
called a little bit tighter. We got into some early foul trouble in the post.
They got into some early foul trouble. I think we were able to adjust to that.  
Whereas when these guys were sophomores, they would have kept reaching, making
faces, being mad they were blowing whistles. I think we kind of adjusted to
the way the game was called.  
But BYU and San Diego State like to pressure. Pressure is risk/reward. When
you're making steals and everything is good, it's good. The risk is obviously
either fouls or baskets. I couldn't be prouder of how I felt we kind of took a
step back and really executed as well in the halfcourt as we have through the
balance of the season.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it up to questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Jené, the first game they win by 10, the second game you win by 2. What
do you account for such a lopsided score this time around?  
JENÉ MORRIS: I think hunger. You know, we came in as the third seed and we had
to play more games than we did last year. We know we needed to make it to the
championship. We made it two years in a row and came back empty-handed. We
wanted to use this time to show how good we can be. I would say that hunger
definitely attributed to that.  
  
Q. What about you personally to have the kind of game you had today?  
JENÉ MORRIS: I think we prepared pretty well. You know, we prepared all day
yesterday. The coaches did a very fantastic job of letting us know what to
expect in the game tonight. So I think it was definitely due to our coaches,
them preparing us for this game.  
  
Q. Jené, when your coach was talking about pulling faces, how come you were
pulling a face?  
JENÉ MORRIS: I agreed with what she was saying. Two years ago I am pretty sure
we would have been upset at the refs, making faces, stomping our feet. We've
matured. A couple years ago we were the youngest team in the conference, now
we're one of the oldest teams.  
I agreed with what she said (smiling).  
  
Q. Do you think it was an advantage this is the third game you played this
woke?  
QUENESE DAVIS: We talked about this earlier.  
COACH BURNS: This is the second game. I know I'm getting old, but I think we
only played two.  
QUENESE DAVIS: It's going to be harder for the higher seeds to come in. It's
their first game back. They don't have all their kinks out. We got into a
rhythm playing those two games we already played, or the first game we already
played, then playing this game, we were ready to go.  
  
Q. Explain your defensive performance. Was there something you saw?  
JENÉ MORRIS: No. It was attributed to our team. We're a pressure style type
team. We have great bigs who are pressuring inside. We have great ball stops.
The team helped me get steals. I was able to make reads off their great
defensive pressure as well.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time. We'll continue
with questions for Coach Burns.  
  
Q. Do you feel you had an advantage that you had a warmup game?  
COACH BURNS: You know, I have no earthly idea. I was one -- I voted against
it, you know. Coach Flanagan and I were the ones, I don't mind saying Coach
Flanagan and I, because he said it to anybody that would listen, I voted
against it only because I think our league is so good that I worry about our
three, four, five seeds that I think are good enough to go to the tournament,
and it puts them at a challenge. I don't like having to start on a Tuesday.  
With that said, until we have a separate tournament, it doesn't make sense to
me to have a -- to me the three is the best normal spot because you have an
off day. You know, if we had to play on Thursday after we had to play the game
we played against Wyoming on Wednesday night, without question, BYU's
advantage. To be able to play a game, have an off day of preparation, play
another game, is the normal, I think, rhythm of our season and it's not
challenging on anybody physically.  
I also think you got to be willing to change and try some new things. We
wanted to protect our top seeds. I still don't think that's important. We just
have to sit down in the spring and tweak it a little bit. I still think we
want to protect other seeds, but I don't think anybody is real comfortable
with the way things are laid out.  
  
Q. I would think this had to be a good day to be a coach because so much of
what you tried to do worked.  
COACH BURNS: Yeah. Well, and I thanked Q as we came off the floor. I said, Q,
I appreciate you kind of letting me take it easy today. And I think it really
had to do with our level of experience coming in. I heard Jené say, If you
have good preparation and you're experienced, then you can make reads, then
things start going your way. I think the team that's a little bit older is
advantaged. They've been in that situation before.  
  
Q. I know you were kind of wracking your brain trying to figure out what was
going wrong. Why the surge all of a sudden do you think?  
COACH BURNS: Well, I think that we can't put, "we" being coaches, we can't put
a sense of urgency into somebody until they kind -- they had to figure it out.
This team had to figure it out. We've always had good parts, but they are
different parts than a year ago. We're a totally different team. We have a
totally different dynamic.  
I think as our bench has developed, I mean, think if it was two months ago and
we got in that kind of early foul trouble, our bench developed, got more
comfortable, and we've developed balance. I think that's been the biggest
difference.  
As to the whys, if I'd have known, I would have fixed it. We had a little
hiccup right in the middle. We had a tough week, the New Mexico, Wyoming week.
The best news, we rebounded, are on an upswing, we're confident. The sense of
urgency is you better win tomorrow to know you can go in the front door of
this tournament.  
  
Q. You have a rematch against Utah. What do you need to get done in that
game tomorrow?  
COACH BURNS: We were having such a good time here. We were reflecting back.
You're going to make us shift to the next step (smiling).  
You have a Hall of Fame coach and you have, I think, the most storied program
in our league since we've been here. I think we both split. We played real
well when we played them in San Diego. They played well in Utah. We both
obviously played really well today. So I think the challenge is that March is
about making plays. You know, we're not going to do anything different.
They're not going to do anything different. They know what we're going to run.
They're not going to let us get a thing in the paint. They're going to want to
punch you in the mouth, slow, tempo paint points. We're going to get up and
down the floor a bit. It's going to be a tempo game. I think it's going to be
a great game.  
  
Q. Do you think you have to win tomorrow to make it?  
COACH BURNS: I sure do. I sure do. You know, I thought for sure we had to get
to tomorrow, and then I didn't know whether from a standpoint of a loss to
TCU, which is a higher RPI team, who knows what's important. Utah you could
argue was the hottest team in our league coming into the tournament. I think
they'd won 8 out of 10 coming in. So there's no surprise to me.  
But without question, I think it's important for us to win tomorrow. Now, I'd
like to think that -- I think this is our 20th win, the NIT format has changed
a couple times since I played in it. I would like to think that is secure. I
don't think there's security for Utah or San Diego State. It depends. A lot of
basketball yet to be played. As long as there's no upsets. Everybody cheer for
high seeds. We all cheer for 1 seeds to win their conference tournaments. I
think we have a chance. Our Wake Forest win was good, our Auburn win was good.
We had a loss to Las Vegas that might have hurt us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.  
COACH BURNS: Thanks, everybody.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  51  
New Mexico - 45

(OT)  

THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah head Coach Elliott and student-athletes.
We'll start with an opening comment about the game from Coach Elliott.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, I just thought another really great matchup, you know,
between us and New Mexico. There's such a history of those kinds of games.
It's pretty amazing.  
You know, I want to say that, you know, I know that it's really hard for any
seniors to be done with that last chance to be in the NCAAs. I thought -- I
just give a lot of credit, I have a lot of respect for Amy Beggin. I want to
be sure, you know, everybody understands the kind of career she's had and how
hard we know it is to go out.  
As far as our kids and this team, I am so proud of who they are, really. It
was a grind-it game again. It's so hard for either one of us to score against
the other one. And, you know, you just have to sort of make the grind-it,
gutty, ugly plays sometimes. Obviously an example is the shooting struggles of
Whipple. What does she do, has a career-high rebounding night.  
That's how you show your character. That's how you show your competitiveness,
is you find other ways. They defended well, which kept it close. In the end,
you know, just a play or two for us, and we go home happy.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kalee, what happened tonight in terms of your offense? Why did you
struggle? Talk about the big three, obviously.  
KALEE WHIPPLE: I mean, they had great defense. But I think part of it was I
felt good. My shot felt fine. I just couldn't get it to go in the basket.  
But, like I said, New Mexico played great defense. They were covering me all
night. The big shot, just felt like one was bound to fall. I was 0-11. I came
off that screen and felt open, so just let it go and it went in.  
  
Q. Kalee, can you run me through the last play before the end of regulation
where you got the rebound, kicked it out to the corner, set up your teammate
for that three-pointer.  
KALEE WHIPPLE: Yeah, I think just like coach said, it comes down to hustle
plays. Obviously I wasn't hitting a lot of shots. I knew when that shot went
in, we needed a rebound. We were down three. If we don't get a three, we have
to make stops.  
Just got the rebound, was falling out of bounds, saw Janita open at the three,
had all the faith in the world she'd hit that shot and she did.  
  
Q. Taryn, can you talk about the overtime. Talk about scoring and the inside
play, how rough it was.  
TARYN WICIJOWSKI: Uhm, I think that in overtime I just got some great passes
from my teammates, places where I couldn't get double-teamed. So that
definitely, I think, was how I was open so often in overtime.  
And then in the rest of the game, at the beginning, it was just -- I don't
know, I just feel really confident with how I'm playing right now, getting up
against contact. At the beginning, they weren't falling. Just stayed with it
and ended up falling a lot for me.  
And then, yeah, that's about it.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time and open it for
questions for Coach Elliott.  
  
Q. Coach, you are 8-0, all of them pretty close games. How much do you think
it has become a case of mentality on both sides, your girls feeling like they
can't lose to New Mexico and New Mexico feeling like they can't get over the
hump?  
COACH ELLIOTT: You know, there's obviously a mental part to that. I mean, I
remember when the tables were turned. I mean, they've had their runs over us.
I mean, you know, Kim and Shona, Kim Smith, Shona Thorburn, we had such a good
team and so did they. They, you know, kept putting it on us for a couple,
three years. Kim and Shona never won at the Pit, that kind of thing.  
These kind of things can be cyclical. I remember when it was the other way
around. I knew it was completely mental (laughter). You know, one game, one
day, we had them at our place, and they beat us at least three or four in a
row. You just knew there was that kind of, you know, stress thing, that worry
thing.  
We didn't practice the day before, we played whiffle ball. There wasn't
anything to practice. It was about getting into a different frame of mind.
Actually we won that next game.  
Who knows. It's a crazy sport.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your defense. You held them to 27%. Wasn't falling for
you, but the defense made a difference.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, there's no doubt that was the only possibility for the
win, was defending well. You know, we weren't giving any kind of perimeter
support to our paint game, I mean, by quite a bit.  
You know, the kids got to keep knowing that the shots have to be taken. You
know, they did that. A couple of big ones at the end fell. I mean, 8 for 11 as
far as New Mexico goes, there's a lot about that that you think you shouldn't
survive that game. But we did because it was low scoring. We did because,
though we couldn't hit, we got just enough.  
  
Q. Talk about the defense of Badon on Amy Beggin.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, you know, Janita is young. Actually, her biggest problems
defensively are off ball. She's a better on-ball defender. Sometimes there's a
little bit better matchups for her even against somebody's best player if it's
a lot of one-on-one defense sometimes. Janita is very quick. She's not big.
But if she really concentrates on keeping people in front of her, it's not
easy to get past her. So it has been a pretty decent matchup for her. On the
last play, their sideouts, when they kicked us so bad on the sideouts, we
switched Kalee onto her. You know, we didn't get it done, so... I know, it
didn't go to her, but she was the screener.  
I was really proud of Janita, obviously, because Amy is their heart and soul.
She's the kind of player that Kalee is. If she's not their leading scorer,
she's their leading leader. The bottom line is everything is going to happen
because of her.  
  
Q. Talk about TCU, playing them.  
COACH ELLIOTT: You know, I haven't thought about it yet. I'd like to just take
that day tomorrow and concern myself with it then. Just want to enjoy the
moment, let the kids enjoy the moment. Nice to have that day in between. So I
don't have anything to say yet (laughter).  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Elliott.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  60  
Wyoming - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Wyoming head coach Legerski and student-athletes. We'll
start by taking an opening comment from Coach Legerski about the game tonight.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Well, I think what we witnessed tonight was a tremendous
basketball game. Both teams came out and competed for 40 minutes. Every
possession mattered. I thought at times San Diego State stepped up probably in
the last three and a half minutes, made some big stops. We had our chances.  
With the experience of competing against San Diego State, I think it's a
basketball game we'll learn from. It felt like playing the No. 1 seed out
there. I think San Diego State creates so many problems for you on the
perimeter, on the inside. I'm just so proud of my team that, you know, we got
off to a shaky start and then we came back and closed down the half down, too,
still had a chance with a possession about three and a half minutes to go.  
I thought Hillary Carlson was just huge tonight. Literally kept us in the
basketball game. Had 17 at half, 25 total, 8 offensive rebounds, played 39
minutes. I tried to give her a break. But yet when she's carrying the load
tonight, it was very important to keep her in the basketball game.  
I thought the heart showed tonight, Aubrey Vandiver had eight rebounds
offensively. It gave us an opportunity when you're shooting 22%, a credit to
San Diego State's defense, yet we just kept fighting and finding ways to just
stay in the basketball game.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Hillary, what was in your mind the last stretch? You took the lead, then
couldn't score till the final seconds. Did they do anything in particular?  
HILLARY CARLSON: I don't know. Around that time I think we had our
opportunities. I had a couple free throws ahead of me. They didn't go in.
Kristen had an open three that just didn't go in. Uhm, I don't know. The
defense, you know, they always make it tough. Those were the shots that we
needed to, uhm, you know, make the play, stay in the game. They just didn't go
in for us.  
Credit to San Diego State for playing good D.  
  
Q. Aubrey, Hillary shouldered most of the load tonight. Was it just a case
where the shots weren't falling for some of you other guys out there?  
AUBREY VANDIVER: Yeah. But they weren't falling. I think we got good looks at
the basket. For me and Emma, a couple of other people, our shots just weren't
falling. I don't think we took bad shots necessarily. They weren't going in.
Hill stepped in and helped out a lot.  
  
Q. Such a big game like this. You want to win. What does that say to you,
what you were able to do? This was one of your biggest games on a big stage.
Does that mean anything to you at this point?  
HILLARY CARLSON: Uhm, it does mean a lot. But at the end we still lost the
game. That means more, you know. Uhm, I guess I just know in the future I can
try to step up in a similar situation and, you know, play as good, make the
plays.  
But, uhm, we still lost. So I wish we would have won, you know, but...  
  
Q. The résumé looks a little bit better than last year. What do you do
between now and Monday to make sure you're not a nervous wreck?  
COACH LEGERSKI: You know, I'll answer that one.  
I talked to this group. I think they're deserving of a post-season bid. But
we're not on the committee to make that decision. Résumé at 19-11, as I told
them, I've been doing this a very short time frame, seven years, and this is
one of the best groups I've been associated with. They put up big numbers; 19
wins is an amazing season.  
So hopefully we have a chance still to play. But I'm not gonna lose sleep over
it or worry about it. That decision will be made by somebody else. As I tell
them, we only worry about what we can control, and that was competing tonight,
and I thought we did a great job with that.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue with questions
for Coach Legerski.  
  
Q. You've seen Hillary put up big numbers before. How big was it for her to
do it on a stage like this?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Well, we talked that it always is, you know, a team effort.
But without Hillary tonight, this game, we don't have a chance in the last
three minutes. I thought she just shouldered this group, not only scoring-wise
but also with her ability to go give second chances. You look at these
numbers, 25, 18, 39 minutes for a post player to play in a very physical
contest. She really demonstrated the caliber of player that she is and that's
she's only getting better.  
I'm happy I have her back for another season. But it was just an individually
tremendous effort by a young person.  
  
Q. Could a game like this be a springboard to bigger things for her as post-
season comes along?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I think what this game does is, you heard Hillary, she's
disappointed. I think she'd trade up quite a few of those points for a
victory. That is probably what makes her such a tremendous player. She's a
team player.  
Hopefully she understands that she can go out and make a game of this each and
every night, and just put everything on the line. But yet I'm gonna keep
Hillary Carlson.  
  
Q. Does this feel a little bit like déjà vu, close games where you needed
somebody to step up at the end, the supporting cast, the shots weren't
falling? Talk about the looks. Aubrey said you feel they got good looks.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Yeah, I take a look at it. We talked coming into this. Post-
season play, Mountain West Conference tournament, everybody has to step up.
Everybody has to make big plays. You know, unfortunately we did not have shots
go down at times from players that baskets have been going.  
But I take a look at it. We get 23 offensive rebounds. They were working at
it. They were working extremely hard to stay into this basketball game.  
I still give a great deal of credit to San Diego State. Very talented, very
experienced. It was a contest all the way to the end.  
  
Q. And do you feel like your team should be in. Do you think it will be in
the WNIT?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I have no idea to be honest with you. We can only do the
amount on the court. Yesterday's victory was big to get us to 19. We just keep
trying to plug away. There's so many good teams out there. I feel like this
team is probably one of the best, 128 in the country. That's how many teams
are going to be in post-season play.  
But yet we're going to go home and take a few days off and get back into
school, then we wait and see what happens. And if it does, we'll get right
back after it and be ready to play.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Appreciate it. Thank everybody for the whole season.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

San Diego State  60  
Wyoming - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State head Coach Burns and student-
athletes. We'll start by taking an opening comment about the game from Coach
Burns.  
COACH BURNS: Well, I think first and most importantly in March it's about, you
know, checking off the box and surviving and advance. So we're thrilled to be
in this position. Wyoming is a very good team. They obviously -- they have
five three-point shooters on the floor at all times, run great offense. I
think that going into the game that's your biggest concern, you expend an
awful lot of energy. As you saw, they have a couple of people who do a great
job on the O glass, which we didn't get figured out much till about the last
10 minutes of game.  
Anytime we value our possessions and keep our turnovers low, I think we have
pretty good weapons and we can be successful. I think that was the key to
tonight's game. When we took our opportunities, we were able to score. It was
a funny game in that we were able to maintain the lead, albeit by one or two
points, the majority of the game. It was just a back and forth kind of battle
that I think you expect in March.  
I'm thrilled our entire team was able to contribute and gain confidence as we
head forward toward BYU.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jessika, were you seeing anything different from Carlson? I know you had
trouble with her the first couple of games. Were you trying to do anything
different this time or letting her get her points and stop everybody else?  
JESSIKA BRADLEY: Uhm, I think that our outlook was just change our feet a
little bit. We wanted to limit her touches. Personally, I just took it
personal to make sure that I did whatever I could to get around, do whatever I
can to eliminate her from the offense. Keep her out, because I know she's a
big role in what they do.  
So if I can keep her from touching the basketball, she facilitates, she
finishes well around the basket, that we had a chance, so...  
  
Q. You've been here before. How much does that weigh into March when you've
done it before?  
QUENESE DAVIS: It's kind of like muscle memory. We know we've been here. We
know that we have one goal in mind, that's to cut down the nets at the end of
this tournament. If we keep sticking to our game plan, doing what we do, we'll
be successful.  
JESSIKA BRADLEY: What Q said (laughter). I haven't really been here before.
But the older players, Jené and Q, I kind of have a little spot in my heart
for them because I know they want to get this tournament before they leave.
For my team, especially my team, Q, Spin and Kim, so...  
  
Q. Jessika, a little bit more about your matchup with Hillary Carlson. I
know you faced a number of bigs down low. Where does she compare to the other
opponents you've seen in this league that you faced up against?  
JESSIKA BRADLEY: She's a really great player. She is deceptively strong. She
has a thin frame, but she's really strong. She steals really well. Like I
said, she's a finesse player, so she finishes really well around the basket.
You can knock her off the block, but she still finds a way to finish. Those
head fakes, man. She's a really good player. She's probably one of the best
that I've guarded in this league so far, so...  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes. We'll open it up to
questions for Coach Burns.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think it's good to start a tournament like this with a
really tough game?  
COACH BURNS: I thought you were going to say, Start with a win. I was
definitely going to agree with you that starting with a win is the best way to
start a tournament.  
  
Q. But a real close game, especially when you're going up against BYU and
possibly TCU.  
COACH BURNS: I said to our team in the locker room, if you saw any of the game
in front of ours, this is a pretty good quarterfinal day when you look at
Utah, New Mexico, San Diego State and Wyoming. I thought anybody that played
today can win the tournament. I mean, this was no -- you know, it's a 3-6, a
one-game differential and everyone is split with each other. We knew it was a
huge game.  
Does that advantage or disadvantage? I don't know. I've only done this format
one time. I sat where BYU sat. And it was strange. It was like, Hey, they
started, we're still in San Diego. It's a different kind of deal.  
With our day off, it makes it not that big of a deal. We're off tomorrow. We
prepare. We get ready for BYU on Friday afternoon.  
  
Q. Do you coach any different in March than you do the rest of the year?  
COACH BURNS: Yeah, I think so. Because you're done. You know, if you're not
successful, you've got to use everything, try everything, do everything. I
would kind of echo talking about what J.B. did with Hillary Carlson. Our game
plan going in was one way, but I thought our pressure was so good that we
decided to use her more as a helper. Like if four people couldn't score and we
could get her off the glass, and that was just an example of I don't know that
I would do that during the season, but just the way the game was going, it was
like J.B., deny touches strong side, but then don't let anybody else get to
the rim. I thought she did a good job adjusting to that.  
It's like any coaching job, you have to feel what you're doing. You know, I do
think you coach a little bit different.  
  
Q. About the rebounding, are you concerned about your offensive
rebounding?  
COACH BURNS: I was concerned October 15th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th. I could
tell you I hope we rebound. I learned a long time ago that hope is not a
strategy. So we are what we are. I think that it's something, trust me, I bet
you believe we've worked on it some, talked about it a tad, watched a film on
it.  
Credit to them for going at it and getting after the basketball. I think some
of it might come from we have a tighter rotation, our minutes are a little bit
limited, it's that much more energy after you guard. But that's an excuse.  
Could I be concerned? Yeah, but all we can do is do our best. At this point in
time, you just got to do the best you can.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH BURNS: Thanks, everybody.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  51  
New Mexico  45  
(OT)

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico head Coach Flanagan and student-
athletes. We'll start with an opening comment about the game from Coach
Flanagan.  
COACH FLANAGAN: First of all, congratulations to Utah. Played a very fine
game. Really it was a very competitive, hard-fought game. I thought
defensively we did an excellent job. We gave up a few too many offensive
rebounds and we got beat on a play that we had defended all game long.  
But it's not one play that wins or loses a game. And I thought we had
opportunities. Our poor shooting, shooting 22% the second half, we can't shoot
in the 20s and beat people. Defensively I thought we played about as good as
we could play. I like what we did defensively. We got over screens, and they
set a ton of 'em. We defended just about everybody. I thought we did a great
job on Whipple. She's 1 of 12. That's about as good as it gets. Then she hits
the final three.  
We had defended that particular play several times throughout the game. But
overall when you look back at the game, it appears to me that shooting is the
key and the reason why we didn't win that game.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Amy, I see you got a bruise. Seemed to me it was a very physical kind of
game. Is that the impression you had of it, too?  
AMY BEGGIN: Well, I think anytime we play Utah, it's a pretty rough game. I
mean, they set a lot of screens, so we have to fight over a lot of screens
every single time down.  
I think both ways it's pretty physical.  
  
Q. Amy, obviously you guys are 0-8 against them, all of them close. How much
do you think might be mental at this point?  
AMY BEGGIN: I don't think that was a factor at all today. I mean, we had a lot
of confidence. If we would have come up with that rebound, we had a chance to
win. I think it's just a bounce that's gone their way every time we played
them.  
If we could pinpoint one thing, I don't think we'd be sitting here right now.
I don't think that was going through any of our minds in the game today. I
know it wasn't for me.  
  
Q. Eileen, can you talk a little bit about how it seemed to be so rough
inside for most of the night, how much harder that made it to score.  
EILEEN WEISSMANN: It was really hard. When you don't get the calls. We work on
it every day in practice, if the refs don't give us the calls, go up strong.
Coach always tells us to jump into Utah power backs, jump into the players,
make contact. Even though we weren't getting the calls for how physical a game
it was, we should have been finishing our layups because we work on that every
day in practice.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time and open it up
for questions for Coach Flanagan.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel that was a loosely officiated game?  
COACH FLANAGAN: I really can't comment on officiating. That's something that
they don't allow us to do.  
One of the things about officials is they're part of the game. You have to
make adjustments to the part of the game. You really don't have control over
that part of the game, other than understanding the way they're calling.  
That's something that the players adjust to throughout the game, and that's
what they have to do is adjust to that. Sometimes it seems like you're not
getting the calls. To me a lot of times when I'm looking at it, of course, I'm
looking at it -- I'm not very objective when I'm looking at the game.  
So obviously it was a game where we knew that there was gonna be a lot of
contact.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Flanagan.  
COACH FLANAGAN: Thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  60  
UNLV - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV coach Olivier and student-athletes. Coach,
if we could start with some general comments about tonight's game.  
COACH OLIVIER: All right. Uhm, well, first of all, I want to say Wyoming
played a great basketball game. We just got through playing them the end of
conference. They had to play really, really well at their place to beat us.  
And then we opened up against them. I thought they played a tremendous,
tremendous basketball game. I'm a little disappointed just because I'm
disappointed that it's over. I really enjoy coaching this team. My staff has
done a great job. I think the team has done a great job. We're young. We have
good energy. We fought the whole game. I'm just bummed that it's over because
this is the time where it's fun.  
I think as a coach, I have to do a better job earlier in the season to make
sure we were ready like we were now. I felt like we were very, very ready to
play this game. Like I said, our team never gave up. So I'm very, very proud
of our basketball team.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. If you got the lead down the stretch, do you think maybe that would have
carried you on to victory?  
JAMIE SMITH: I think that probably would have done so. I mean, we were getting
on a roll in the end. Once we got on that roll, you couldn't stop us. I think
we started to play together like in the end. But we need to do that early on.  
I think if we would have got that lead a little later on in the second half,
it would have kind of continued. It kind of didn't go our way with some calls
and shots we took, but it was fine.  
MARKIELL STYLES: If we would have stayed on the road we were on, I think it
would have led us to victory. Like Jamie said, we got some calls that didn't
go our way and didn't get some stops. That's what led us to lose.  
  
Q. The rebounding, you out-rebounded them. What did you feel was the key to
doing that? Down the stretch, did you feel like they were finally starting to
get up against you during the rebounding battle?  
MARKIELL STYLES: I felt that we emphasized rebounding through practice leading
up to this game. We knew we had to box players out to get them from getting
second shots and that's how we were going to win the game. So that's what we
focused on.  
JAMIE SMITH: I would just say that rebounding is like hustle. I think our team
definitely had that hustle. We fought till the end. The game just didn't fall
in our pocket, I guess.  
But just the out-rebounding them by however much you said, it shows we're a
team that can fight and we're ready to come back next year.  
  
Q. To out-rebound them like you did, for them to shoot free throws poorly,
do you feel this is a game that got away from you?  
MARKIELL STYLES: It was a tough loss. But we're gonna come back and not let
this bring us down. We're going to work hard in the off-season. We're about
the future.  
JAMIE SMITH: We lose two really good players. But we basically have the same
team next year. You know, just showing in the tournament that we can rebound
like we did, we can hit free throws in the end. It's something that we can
take on to the next season, motivation that we got kicked out so early on and
also motivation that we did do some good things in the tournament, as well.  
  
Q. Jamie, compared to last year, what did you try to take into this game and
this tournament that you learned from last year's tournament?  
JAMIE SMITH: Well, uhm, last year's tournament, you know, we came and we
fought hard. Coming into this tournament, you know, it's a completely
different team, a younger team. I knew we couldn't relax and think the same
thing was going to happen last year happen this year. It was a different
mentality. We have a really young team. Actually, three of our starters have
never played in this type of, you know, situation and stuff.  
All I can say is that we're just a really young team and we have some big
things to do in the future.  
  
Q. Jamie, I know it's not much consolation, but you set a conference
tournament record with 18 rebounds. What does that mean to you down the
road?  
JAMIE SMITH: I'm just gonna keep on doing what I'm doing. I know that my role
on this team is to get rebounds, try to be a lead on the floor. I'm just going
to kind of continue to do that. I don't really care about the records. I
really care about the wins. So going into next year, I just want to hopefully
-- hopefully those rebounds will just help us win. That's all I can say.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. We'll open it
up for questions for the coach.  
  
Q. It seemed like you were much quicker than Wyoming, especially off the
dribble. Towards the end it seems like the guards finally started taking
advantage of that. How important do you think it was that the guards would get
so deep into the paint after taking somebody off the dribble and choose to
kick it out instead of going for the layup until the last three minutes of the
game?  
COACH OLIVIER: Wyoming does a great job defensively. Their positioning is
very, very good. 41, Carlson, has great defensive position. When we were
taking it early in the game, we were getting everything blocked. We have great
quickness, like you said. But, again, their positioning is tremendous. We
started penetrating, making that extra pass to our post player. Markiell did a
great job with that extra pass. We did that because of their defensive
positioning.  
When we played them at their place, they did the same thing, got so deep, they
blocked shots. We talked about making that extra pass, that extra-extra pass.
When we did that, we couldn't hit our outside shots. That hurt us. That
allowed them to really clog up the paint.  
I look at the stats and I kick myself. I say we beat 'em in every area, every
category. We got to the free throw, made our free throws, shot over 80%; we
out-rebounded them by 19 rebounds. We beat 'em in every category except for
the threes, and that really hurt us.  
  
Q. Looking towards the future, how important would getting the guards to
establish their midrange game, free-throw line, so when they face those
obstacles they can pull up?  
COACH OLIVIER: Right. We were definitely talking about that as a staff. It's
something we're going to focus on on the offseason. It's more individual work.
Again, the game at Wyoming, we had a lot of midrange shots. I mean, Erica was
excellent, Erica Helms did a great job at Wyoming; 10-, 15-foot range did a
great job. Kelli, I think, can be awesome at that. She can shoot the three,
penetrate. And Mia Bell. I think those three are tremendous at that. And then
India. India pulls up a lot and can shoot a little 10-, 15-footer. That's her
shot. Those are things we'll definitely work on in the off-season and
something definitely we can get better at.  
  
Q. You beat them at home this year. They beat you at their place. I thought
you might have an advantage with the home court. Was it their fans that made
that big of a difference tonight?  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, you know, I was thinking like you were thinking, our
staff was thinking like that. A split game. They beat us at home. They had to
beat us really, really well to beat us in Wyoming. I was feeling good about
this game.  
I thought their fans were great. They had a lot of support. I thought, you
know, again, I love playing at home. I love playing at Thomas & Mack. I'm not
going to sit here and tell you we have 5,000 fans because we're not there yet.
We're a staff that's rebuilding. We just need to continue to take care of our
business and people will come.  
I thought the band was awesome. The band was loud. They were awesome. That's
really not our focus. I hear what you're saying. I would love to see more
people out for our games because our players play hard. They're young,
exciting. We have quickness on the perimeter. We talked about that. I just
think we have a bright, bright future. I know that people will come out.  
When I was a player here, we were successful, people came out. So we got to
take care of our end and I know people will come and support us. We've gotten
a lot of phone calls and encouragement from the community. We need to do a
better job of taking care of business early in the season.  
  
Q. When Wyoming hit key shots down the stretch, Kennedy stepped up. Did that
surprise your team that it was someone like her?  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, she hit some big shots at Wyoming. They do a really good
job of moving the ball. They play team basketball. I think Joe does a great
job of coaching them to their strengths. And we talked about this as a staff.
She just kind of slits that opening. We were working our butts off. I thought
we had some great stops. Like you said earlier, Jamie was getting every
rebound. They have had to really work the ball around and go to one of their
last options, and their last option hit the shots. So you got to give it to
them. I don't think we necessarily lost. I think they beat us.  
I don't sit here and say that very often because I'll be the first one to say
there's things we could have done better. I thought our team played a very
good basketball game. I thought we could have had a little more defensive
energy in the first half. Otherwise, they went to their second and third
option. Kennedy stepped up and hit those shots down the stretch.  
  
Q. With all the younger players with only two seniors on your team, what did
you think of how the younger players performed during the game tonight and
what do you think they learned in these close losses they can take with them
next season?  
COACH OLIVIER: We don't consider them younger players anymore. I hear you. I
know they're freshmen. It's their first tournament experience. We put together
a great Christmas tournament that was against top, top teams in the country.
We put together a great Thanksgiving tournament that we had top teams in the
country. Our non-conference schedule I truly believe prepared us for this
conference. This conference is good. I think, if anything, we learned we have
to come out and play and give that hundred percent intensity, that hundred
percent focus every game. The conference is too good. There's too many good
teams.  
But I think Mia Bell plays with so much passion and she plays with a lot of
experience. She made great decisions down the stretch. She played with great
energy. She was the leader. I'm not considering Mia Bell a freshman anymore.
She was excellent. I thought Kelli Thompson, another freshman, was
outstanding, did some great things. Super active defensively. She's been
coming up with rebounds for us. She hit huge threes, got to the basket, you
know, made her free throws down the stretch. Those girls are playing like with
much more experience than any freshmen.  
Again, we have another non-conference schedule that's going to prepare us. We
just have to do a better job early. Our staff and me, I have to do a better
job of preparing them early for this. We cannot wait to have this kind of
intensity and enthusiasm at practice to be ready to go like we were today.
Because we were ready to go. If we play like we did today, we're going to beat
a lot of teams in the country.  
Again, this team has a great future. Our team's going to continue to battle
and work hard in the summer and improve. That's going to be our focus.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

### [Jade Kennedy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20586)

### [Joe Legerski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13841)

### [Aubrey Vandiver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20587)

  
_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Wyoming  60  
UNLV - 55

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Wyoming. Coach, we can start
with some general comments from you about the game.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Well, we always talk about it being a 40-minute basketball
game. We played UNLV the last game of the season, and it came down to the last
minute of the basketball game, just like it did today.  
Two players I brought with us I thought were huge for us. Aubrey really
carried this team for about 34 minutes. And during one timeout I talked about
that other people needed to step up because we started standing around
watching Aubrey trying to do everything. I thought Jade had a big three, came
back, and hit a nice two-point shot that really gave us a lift and took a
little bit of the pressure off Aubrey to be able to do what she does so well,
is carry this group.  
You know, we'd make it definitely easier on the head coach by making some free
throws, and that was apparent. But we made big plays by grabbing offensive
rebounds and coming up with the play, none bigger than what Aubrey grabbed to
force another jump ball. We now had the basketball again, got the ball in and
was back at the free-throw line.  
THE MODERATOR: We will take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jade, you scored nine points in the final six and a half minutes. Can you
talk about what you were feeling down the stretch, the confidence you had in
your shot.  
JADE KENNEDY: Yeah, well, I shot a couple of shots early in the first half.
They felt good, but they weren't dropping. So coach just told me to keep
shooting, get my feet set. Once one dropped, I felt confident in shooting the
other two.  
  
Q. There was also one you missed where coach yelled at you. The whole gym
heard it. Told you to extend your arm.  
JADE KENNEDY: Yeah, I was like quick handing it, not holding my followthrough.
Once I focused on that, things started to drop. So thanks, coach (laughter).  
COACH LEGERSKI: I think everybody can always hear me in the gym (smiling).  
  
Q. You grabbed some offensive rebounds all night long. What did you do to
make sure they didn't score on those second chances?  
AUBREY VANDIVER: Uhm, we were just being big and not trying to foul them and
reach in. We were letting them get too many offensive boards. The goal was
once they get the offensive board was be bigger, force the jump ball, so...  
  
Q. Aubrey, late in the game, UNLV tied it up three times but never actually
took the lead. How important is that possession right after they tied the
game?  
AUBREY VANDIVER: Right after that is when Jade hit her three. It was just
really big for us to regain the lead. I think we wouldn't have been completely
defeated if they would have taken the lead, but it was important for us to
regain the lead and regain momentum. So when she hit that throw it was really
huge for our team.  
  
Q. How important was this where you had chances to win but came up short,
but you made the plays, how big was this for your confidence to do it in a
game like this, to finish a game like you needed to?  
JADE KENNEDY: Yeah, it's huge for our confidence on the team. Like especially
going into the tournament, this gives us a lot of confidence for San Diego.
Yeah, we're really ready for that, so yeah.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes at this time and take
questions for coach Legerski.  
  
Q. You had trouble finishing a few games down the stretch, but finished this
one. How big was it to do it in this setting with this group?  
COACH LEGERSKI: One of the things we talked about all season long was winning
four-minute segments. At the last media timeout, we talked about this is what
we prepare for. Some nights the ball bounces your way, some nights the ball
doesn't bounce your way. Yet I want to be in the game in the last four
minutes.  
We have won games this year. Even in defeat, we were in those ballgames, and
you always learn what it's like to execute at the end. I thought it was big
for Jade to hit the three because not only did it allow us to be up three
points, but we knew defensively we were still going to be up because we were
going to take away the three-point shot. That just gives so much confidence
from this group.  
We need to shoot the ball better from the free-throw line. That's a part that
definitely is something about playing in a tournament with a young team.
Disappointed about giving up 24 offensive rebounds, and yet we played hard. We
tried to compete. More importantly we did not want to get them to the foul
line on second attempts, and I thought we were able to do that.  
  
Q. It's been a while since you have been able to get a win here at the
conference tournament. Can you talk about how you're feeling, satisfaction?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I talked to the team as they were celebrating in the locker
room because I think it's important to celebrate your victories. When I ended
up getting this job in 2003/'4 season, Wyoming had not won a game in the
Mountain West Conference or the Western Athletic Conference. We talked about
when we won that first year what it was like and we need to continue to find
ways to win.  
Now, it's a challenge because it depends where you're seeded. It's a difficult
league. Teams are very talented. So we're going to enjoy this win for tonight
and we'll get started in the morning with San Diego State.  
  
Q. Playing UNLV in Vegas, it's essentially a road game. If you wouldn't have
known we were in Vegas, you couldn't have told by the crowd. How big was the
crowd in this win?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Wyoming fans are tremendous. They follow their basketball
teams. They follow all their athletic teams and support them tremendously. I
think that gave us a big lift down the stretch, to know we had so many fans
behind us cheering us on and giving us the energy we needed.  
That's what's happened at home over the last few seasons, turning out in
numbers 3,500 a game. It gives our team energy. I felt that today. Even though
we were on the road, it felt like a home game for Wyoming.  
  
Q. Coach, I saw your game at Utah when you lost at home. The players were
visibly upset after the game. I've sensed a difference in your team since
then. Is that true?  
COACH LEGERSKI: When you lose close ballgames at the end, you need to learn. I
also believe you need to hurt. And if you don't find a way to hurt, it doesn't
matter enough to you. And I thought that now we'd gone back to back in games
that were down to the last minute with BYU and Utah, both defeats. And I
started seeing a change in the team where we talked about somebody needs to
step up, somebody needs to grab the next rebound, maybe make the next shot.
But we're not going to sign it.  
I think Aubrey has really stepped up to make plays down the stretch. With our
last game at UNLV, Aubrey came up with a big offensive rebound off a missed
free throw.  
The scenario was exactly the same. The possession there of Wyoming, we get the
ball back in and we end up being fouled and make two free throws. Tonight was
the same situation. Missed free throw, Aubrey ties it up, possession Wyoming,
we get the ball in and get more free throws.  
It's important for them to learn, but more important somebody is stepping up
for this group, and it's been Aubrey Vandiver.  
  
Q. You play San Diego State tomorrow. You're 1-1 with them. Talk about that
matchup and your concerns.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Well, first of all, San Diego State is very talented, well-
coached. It's going to be a very difficult basketball game. Their experience,
they've been to post-season play, they've been to NCAA play, they've won at
the NCAA level. Jené Morris is a very difficult matchup for us. They're big on
the inside. Once again, the offensive rebounds are going to be an issue we're
going to have to address.  
Those are things our players will worry about tomorrow. As a coaching staff,
we'll go to work tonight right when we get back, enjoy this victory, do the
best we can tomorrow.  
  
Q. Is it possible to fix those rebounding issues so late in the season or
are these teams that have specific matchup advantages, size-wise inside?  
COACH LEGERSKI: Well, one of the things that you take a look at, and tonight
UNLV shot 30% from the field. There's so many rebound attempts there to gain.
They're gonna have higher numbers.  
But we have to do a better job of trying to get what I call a person on a
person, we have to be more aggressive going to grab every rebound. We were
lucky tonight to survive 24 offensive rebounds and the way we shot free
throws. We have to do a better job tomorrow to cut those down. Hopefully we
get them somewhere between 12 and 15 because you cannot continue to survive
that.  
There were several opportunities tonight. We have not been a great rebounding
team, but we have to do better than what we did this evening.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH LEGERSKI: Thank you.

### [Kim Mestdagh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19428)

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  67  
Colorado State - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Coach Holt and student-athletes. Coach, if you could
start off with your general comments object today's game.  
COACH HOLT: Well, first of all, I want to say that I'm really proud of our
team and how we improved this year. I think these two right here to my left
are great examples. I was just telling them last year at this time, Kim was
averaging seven and a half points a game and Chatilla was averaging three or
four a game. Now for them to -- Kim is a second team all conference player,
and Chatilla very well could have made it at some point. She's 11 points a
game. Just really proud of the team and the mentality. It's changed on our
team.  
Yeah, I thought today's game, New Mexico is a very good team. We hung in
there, but we just made mistakes and couldn't hit shots at key times there in
the second half late. We just kind of ran out of gas.  
Give them all the credit, though. They made plays. They hit some threes that
we didn't expect them to do. They're a good team.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kim, when you got hurt early, did it take you a long time to recover?  
KIM MESTDAGH: Yeah, I got hit pretty hard in the head, was kind of out of it.
But I didn't really feel like -- it's not because I wasn't scoring, I was out
of it.  
But, I mean, I just tried to focus and forget the pain in my head (laughter).
I mean, when I'm playing, most of the time, it's not hard to focus for me,
so...  
  
Q. Do you look at this as a transition year? Coach just mentioned a change
in mentality, really coming in and challenging a year from now.  
KIM MESTDAGH: I don't really want to look at it as a transition year. I mean,
every year you got to go full out, like win whatever you can.  
But if you look in the end I feel like it might have been a transition year,
we changed a lot, our mentality changed. I mean, we did a lot of great things
this year.  
So in the beginning I didn't look at it as a transition year, but then in the
end you had to conclude that it was kind of.  
  
Q. Kim, what makes Amy Beggin so difficult to stop?  
KIM MESTDAGH: Oh, wow. She's a great player. She can shoot. She has range. She
can go to the basket. She has that pull-up jumper. She's fast. She gets
assists. I mean, she's an all-around player. That's always hard to guard.  
  
Q. Why didn't you necessarily key on her in the end? When New Mexico is
flailing, they're going to Amy in that type of situation.  
KIM MESTDAGH: I think we knew they would go to her, but she just makes the
play and she finishes it, so... She's a good player.  
  
Q. Chatilla, when they brought in Kast there at the end of the first half,
she gets those blocks, almost standing in place kind of layups because she's
so much bigger. How frustrating was that at the end of the half and how much
steam did that take away from you?  
CHATILLA VAN GRINSVEN: I mean, of course it's kind of hard. But we have other
sides to attack. When she's inside, we have to play outside. We just have to
attack her if she's going outside and guard her, otherwise we can take our
shots. Otherwise we make her move and pass it outside for a three-point shoot
like Kim or Bonnie. We have other ways to attack her.  
It was a little bit frustrating, but we can learn from it.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes and continue
with questions for Coach Holt.  
  
Q. Coach, everybody knows that Amy is going to take over in that situation.
Is there anything retrospectively coaching-wise you can do to get the ball out
of her hands or is she just that good?  
COACH HOLT: Well, I mean, she is a good player and she makes things happen.
Obviously she's important to their team 'cause she played for 40 minutes.  
I think what happened is we knew she's a key. We know in those situations it's
going to her. I think the game at our place was indicative that we switched on
everything. She tried to draw a foul on us at home and we were able to keep
her from doing that.  
I don't think it was we didn't know that and key on that. The problem is,
there were so many other kids contributing for them. We got to cover 20. I
think that kind of got in our kids' heads as far as, who are we going to stop?
I think that may have contributed why we didn't lock down on her.  
We tried. It wasn't a case of where we forgot about her. She's not a player
that you can forget (smiling).  
  
Q. You talked about running out of gas. It seems like with only nine
players, that's something that's happened to you the second half of the
season. You get within two and don't score again the rest of the game. If you
have two or three more players on your bench, does that maybe not happen,
or...  
COACH HOLT: You know, I feel like throughout the season we've played with
nine, eight, seven players all year. I don't know if it wore on us more
towards the end. Let's face it, we faced some really good teams at the end of
our conference season. It wasn't like we were playing any teams at the bottom
of the league.  
I just think that our opponents made plays; we didn't. I think that certainly
asking Kim and Chatilla to play hard, hard minutes that they have certainly
takes it out of 'em. Then we missed some easy shots. So we had some good
looks; didn't put 'em in.  
You know, I think that probably we didn't -- especially towards the end of the
season, in the tournament here, I didn't feel like our bench gave us a lot of
points, they didn't give us some key things defensively, and it required us to
keep six players basically in the game for most of the minutes.  
I think that certainly probably wore on us a little bit.  
  
Q. There were a lot of missed layups at the end. Is that a sign of
fatigue?  
COACH HOLT: I mean, I think probably that does contribute. I felt like our
kids seemed very hired. It was a tournament game. There's a lot of emotion.
That certainly drains you. They gave everything they had.  
I was really proud of our effort. I thought the latter half of our season, I
couldn't complain about the effort our kids gave. That's something I've been
preaching on all year. I knew if we didn't give effort, we weren't going to
win many ballgames.  
Like I told the players in the locker room at the end of the game, we've got
to be efficient, we've got to be able to produce, we've got to be able to hit
shots like that. I think just the progress we've made, we're going to progress
right into doing that, as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned earlier the mentality change. Do you see this as the year
you kind of like maybe a big breakthrough and next year come in and you're
going to be competing for the top half of the standings?  
COACH HOLT: I know we took a step forward. I think probably not only did our
record improve, but I think certainly our attitude, our toughness, our
mentality of coming out and giving it everything they have. I think we finally
have reached that. And I think that's the one major thing we accomplished this
year.  
And now we've made that foundation, I think we're adding some really good
talent. Hopefully we can take that next step. You know, certainly we were at
the bottom of the conference now. The next step we hope would be somewhere in
the middle of the conference. If we could jump to the top, this is a great,
great conference, and it's not going to be that easy.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  63  
Air Force - 40

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah. We'll start with a general comment from
Coach Elliott.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, we were pleased to win the game, obviously, with I think
a very competitive Air Force team. They do a lot of things well. They really
come at you.  
I think that the, you know, their record this year I don't think indicates the
progress they've made or even the abilities they have, meaning in the future
look out. They have some nice young players.  
Our kids, you know, competed hard and kind of took that, weathered things
early, gutted through things, stretched it to a comfortable margin. You know,
that's good.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Taryn, you really had your way in the low post. Can you talk about what
you were trying to do, what was working for you?  
TARYN WICIJOWSKI: I think there was a lot of gaps in their matchup zone. Just
kind of found those gaps where people couldn't find me or double-team me at
least. That's just kind of how it all happened.  
  
Q. Kalee, you won eight of your last 10. Do you feel like you're playing
your best basketball at the right time?  
KALEE WHIPPLE: Absolutely. I think this is the best time you want to peak.
This is when you want to be your best. We've had some struggles in the
beginning. We're here now and we're ready to play. I think we're peaking at
the right time.  
  
Q. Kalee, coach mentioned about how you weather the storm early in the game.
Maybe earlier this season you might not have weathered it so well. You have
grown up. Can you talk about that and the change in your team over the last 10
games.  
KALEE WHIPPLE: Yeah, we, like you said, struggled at times at the beginning.
We've started freshmen a lot. We lost a lot of people, so we're putting
freshmen in positions where they have to step up and play big roles on our
team.  
At the beginning we struggled at times. We got nervous. We made little
mistakes. But, like you said, we've gotten better. Our freshmen, like Taryn,
she had her way, did her thing. You know, we're just weathering it, what she
said.  
  
Q. Taryn, I think the thing that's been impressive about you is how patient
you are. Do you attribute that to anything as far as growing up, how you
played growing up?  
TARYN WICIJOWSKI: I think that, uhm, my play internationally definitely helped
me because it's a lot of pressure and a lot of big bodies everywhere. So I
think that just helped me with my patience because you can't force anything at
the international level, so...  
  
Q. Kalee, do you ever get tired out there at all?  
KALEE WHIPPLE: Never (laughter).  
  
Q. You play every minute.  
KALEE WHIPPLE: No, no, never get tired. Can't tell?  
  
Q. No.  
KALEE WHIPPLE: That's what I'm going for. Never let the opponent know you're
tired.  
  
Q. Talk about your rebounding. How did that go tonight?  
KALEE WHIPPLE: Yeah, I don't know. I think I crashed more than I usually do,
which I feel like I continue or I need to continue to do. I think coach is
always on me to try to get more rebounds. So I think that's something that I
need to do.  
Yeah, they were there. Just when it comes down to post-season, I think it
comes down to hustle plays, and we got some of those tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll dismiss the student-athletes. We'll open it
up for questions for Coach Elliott.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about Janita's development. Even though
she makes mistakes, is a great player for you at the point guard.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, she has improved tremendously. Granted, you know, she's
still a sophomore and does make a lot of mistakes. But she also makes fewer
and fewer. She also learns and learns and will continue to make fewer and
fewer.  
When that happens, she's going to be pretty darn complete. You know, there are
certainly special freshmen, Kim Smith, Shona Thorburn, Julie Krommenhoek, who
over the years, were winning championships as freshmen. But that is, as I
said, only special players. Most kids are going to come in at this level. If
you know that you've got a good group, you're doing well, you know, you just
are kind of waiting for the freshmen to be upperclassmen, at that point in
time winning championships of their own.  
We were a couple plays away from what you can say in any given year, away from
a championship itself, even in the regular season. That says a lot of good
things about what our young kids are doing, obviously Janita being one of
them, and an enthusiasm for what we think they'll be able to do as they grow.  
  
Q. Can you talk more about Taryn's game today and just where her game is at
this point.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, you know, she is certainly poised as far as not a lot of
things rattle her. She has already, as a freshman, seen everything thrown at
her. She's put up the numbers that she's had, double-teamed 50% to 75% of the
time.  
So, again, as she gets really good at playing out of that, which takes time,
'cause she does good things and she makes mistakes, that will be very scary
for people because she'll get to that point in her career where she's one of
those post kids that as long as we provide the proper kids around her, uhm, it
will be a very difficult combination.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the format of the tournament. You've seen it from both
sides now. You're barely getting into this. A little different than last year
when you had a few days to wait.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Yeah, it's fair. You know, we didn't win the league. We didn't
get second in the league. That's fine. I never have been a believer that you
just should, you know, play two and a half months of gut ball and then like,
you know, you're supposed to start over and everybody gets exactly the same
chance. I don't believe in that.  
So, you know, we're where we should be. That's where we ended up. I'm proud
our kids were third in the league, tying with San Diego State. Being in the
upper echelon, like I said, a couple plays away from the very top. You
couldn't have thought that about this team early in the season.  
So, you know, we're fine. We know coming in exactly what you're left with. It
wasn't a surprise. So you come in, you do the job that you're given to do.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously tomorrow you turn around and play. Is there a matchup
that you would prefer to see? How do you get your kids prepared so quickly
with that turnaround?  
COACH ELLIOTT: At this time of the year, with this kind of a tournament, with
having to, in our case, play in four games if you're going to get a
championship, is not -- I mean, there's not the prep you normally would put
in. There isn't physical prep. There is just remembering, if you know what I
mean. There is reviewing what we already had decided a particular matchup
leaves us with from the two prior times.  
Don't forget what we believe we need to do. So it really is just mental. There
is a physical component certainly to playing a lot of games - less so for
teams that have much depth, more so for teams that don't.  
We don't pretend to be a team that plays a lot of kids a lot of minutes or
goes 10 deep. We have gotten into a pretty good eight-player rotation, to be
honest with us, that's pretty much what everybody's got. So it's not quite --
might look like that's a little bit more of a disadvantage, but we don't look
at it that way.  
You just need to go get it for your hour and 45 minutes, then you got a lot of
rest time. So we'll rest a lot. We're not going to worry about practicing on
the floor. We're just going to worry about getting our heads to whatever's
next and trying to remember what we want to do to be successful in whatever's
next.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Kalee. She also had a career high in her assists. Talk
about her game tonight.  
COACH ELLIOTT: Well, I mean, you get a senior coming down to the end of it
all, and that's what you hope exists within a kid like that. Usually it does
because that's why they're at where they're at. That's where they're getting
first team all conference, and their performances are amazing, because it
matters to them. They have what's inside, they have what it takes to compete.  
Now it just gets down the stretch. Kids in that situation, and a kid like
Kalee, there's no surprise that that's a part of what I think you'll see, is
just a real determination just to do the best she can.  
Nobody always plays perfectly. Nobody will always do everything right. But,
you know, Kalee will try. Kalee won't back down from trying. You know, there's
no better chance to be good than if you can accomplish that.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

New Mexico  67  
Colorado State - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico. We'll start with an opening
statement from Coach Flanagan.  
COACH FLANAGAN: First of all, I thought CSU played a very fine game. They're
difficult to defend. They have a lot of taller-version guards that can shoot
the three. Their inside play is very strong. We knew that.  
Normally they turn it over a little bit. And I didn't think we took full
advantage of that. They didn't turn it over nearly as much. I thought they
played a really fine game.  
Got inside opportunities. We defended, I thought, pretty well getting up on
Kim Mestdagh. She's very difficult to defend. Their inside kid was hurting us
for a period of time.  
I thought the key to the game probably was the first four minutes of the
second half. We came out, played well, shot well, and then the momentum
changed somewhere around 10 minutes to go. They're very difficult to defend.
They push the ball down the floor with good quickness at the little guards and
good shooters at the big guards.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll open it up for questions for the student-
athletes.  
  
Q. Amy, you were fading a little bit in the second half, then had seven
straight points. Do you know when to be assertive and when to take over
games?  
AMY BEGGIN: I think those points I got were a credit to my teammates. They did
a great job of setting me up and making it pretty easy for me to get some
baskets. I do like to maybe make something happen when things aren't going
right. I think that was a case of my teammates setting something up and making
something happen for me.  
  
Q. Amy, they get within two points of you guys and then you don't let them
score again. What does that say about your team?  
AMY BEGGIN: I think defense is something that has been consistent for us all
year long. Some games we haven't shot very well. Our offense has been a little
stagnant. Defensively we've been a pretty strong team all year long. I think
that's something we need to continue to do in the tournament if we want to
stay in games and something we need to do to be successful.  
  
Q. Sara, in the first half, we talked about Amy being aggressive, in the
first half it looked like you were being aggressive. Describe what you were
doing.  
SARA HALASZ: Just going in and working hard. Scoring, defense, everything. I
couldn't have done it without my teammates, really. Just going in, working
hard, not letting my opponent score on me, which she did (smiling). They're a
good team. You just got to come back and fight. No matter if they hit shots or
not, you've got to come back and play hard.  
  
Q. Sara, what did coach say to you at halftime?  
SARA HALASZ: Coach just came in saying keep the momentum up, keep working
hard, keep pushing and keep attacking them, don't let them get easy
opportunities, just keep pushing at them.  
  
Q. You seemed to thrive in Vegas in the tournament. You came out in the
second half again big. Talk about that a little bit.  
AMY BEGGIN: I think Coach Flanagan does a great job of preparing us for this
tournament. This is the third time we're seeing these teams. So, I mean,
really just going into practice we kind of know. We do a good job of preparing
ourselves and know what they're going to run.  
I think once we have a little bit of success in these tournaments, it gives us
a little bit of confidence knowing we've done it before. Hopefully we can
continue to do that and play a couple more games in the tournament.  
  
Q. Amy, at this point you can look forward to playing Utah again. Talk about
that matchup a little bit.  
AMY BEGGIN: Well, I mean, I think everybody on our team remembers what
happened last year when we played them here. We haven't beat them in a long
time. I think we're looking forward to that matchup. If somebody on our team
can't get fired up -- we're really fired up for this game. I think it will be
a good matchup and hopefully we can just kind of break through that barrier
and get a win this time.  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll let the student-athletes go and open it up
for questions for Coach Flanagan.  
  
Q. What is it like as a coach to be able to have a player like Amy to rely
upon down the stretch?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, it's been four years. I've enjoyed that opportunity to
coach her for four years.  
But the thing I admire most about her is that she works just as hard in
practice as she does in a game. I've never seen her take a day off. She's
always enthusiastic. In fact, she actually wants to work harder sometimes than
our practice is.  
So she's great to be around. Unusually active. I'm not saying she's hyper
anymore, but she really enjoys the game of basketball. She's a true
competitor, and she's an excellent leader and a terrific student.  
  
Q. Amy will never really take credit, but does she know when to take over
games and be assertive?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, you know, sometimes I think she dribbles a little bit
too much late in the game and takes it on herself a little bit too much.  
But, you know, she's been injured for a good portion of this year. I think
right now she's probably more enthusiastic, more driven than anybody else on
the team, and she really wants to make it happen.  
Who am I to say, Don't do it, Amy. She's done it for years. She's played big
minutes for us for years. So I kind of step back and let her -- unless I think
that she's just dribbling a little bit too much.  
But late in the game, we want to put it in her hands and get a ball screen and
see if we couldn't get it inside or get a pretty good shot off of that.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH FLANAGAN: You'd have to ask her that. She's always been a player that's
been extremely enthusiastic about competition. You know, it's fun to coach
people like that. For us to have an opportunity to coach players that are
equally as enthusiastic as we are, because we're not the ones that are doing
all the hard work, they are. And she certainly is extremely motivated to play
and play well.  
  
Q. With Utah kind of skating through the first round, it was close
throughout, you pulled ahead at the end, are you concerned that you wore
yourselves out in the first game?  
COACH FLANAGAN: Well, right now I think that everybody's in pretty good
physical condition. Now, we had a couple -- two of my players bumped heads in
the game, so we got a few bumps and bruises. Other than that, physically I
think we're ready.  
At this point in the year, you got to go for it. I mean, you got to be in
great shape and you got to play hard all the time that you get your minutes.  
So I don't think that's going to be a factor. You know, one of the things, we
had an advantage this week because we had our last game last Tuesday and we
had an advantage of getting prepared. This game, this next game, nobody has a
big advantage of being prepared because we don't have any preparation time -
or very little.  
  
Q. Kast got two big blocks and an easy layup before the half. How important
was that little run right before halftime going into the locker room?  
COACH FLANAGAN: A lot of times when things happen good for your team late in
the half, it gives you momentum, it gives you a feeling at halftime that
things are going pretty well. Even if you just came back and tied the score,
you know, some positive things at the end of the half.  
I don't like to go into halftime, with me personally, us not playing well or,
you know, not defending the three-point shot that they knocked down. So I
think it's important that we go into halftime with a positive.  
And I thought Val's block was a positive, got the crowd in it. That's one
thing I want to say. We have terrific fan support and it was obvious today.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about your post play. You used a lot of
different rotations today. As well, talk about Kielpinski and the mask and how
she looked to you.  
COACH FLANAGAN: With Kielpinski, I'll answer that one first. She looked a
little bit tentative to me. And I don't think she's got full vision. That's
something that, you know, a mask readjusts as you're playing. And you can
practice with it all day long, but you get in a game and somebody bumps into
you and knocks it, you have to readjust it. A lot of time it takes you away
from the focus of your game.  
Now, I thought she played pretty well. I thought defensively she played pretty
well. But I didn't think she was much of a factor offensively. So I'm hoping
either she takes the mask off, of course I'm not going to advise her to do
that, or she makes an adjustment to the mask.  
I thought Val playing some positive minutes really helped us. Then we had a
little lineup in there that we pressed with. I thought that was good for a
period of time, until they started going inside and whooping us inside.  
But I thought Porche Torrance gave us some positive minutes. Eileen didn't
shoot well the first half, but got herself in foul trouble the second half,
but then started shooting better.  
Everybody contributed. We don't have a lot of post players. We're kind of
short in that position. We have more guards than post players. Anything that
we can get, I even had a guard in there guarding their post player for a
period of time, anything that we can get for positive minutes with an
undersized player, we're going to get - we're going to try to get.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

_LAS VEGAS, NEVADA_  
  

Utah  63  
Air Force - 40

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force Academy Coach McInelly. Coach, if we
could start off with some general comments on the game today.  
COACH McINELLY: You know what, I think our players certainly played a good
first half. I thought that, you know, towards the second half we pulled within
seven points with 12 minutes left to go, and then I felt like they came down,
they hit some big shots, we didn't get a defensive stop, we came down, and
obviously we didn't hit shots, then that kind of just catapulted it from a
seven-point game to the next thing you know it's 18 points.  
You know, I was talking to Raimee and Kat. They said we have to do a better
job of knocking down shots at critical times. I think this team understands
that. I think they certainly give it their best effort.  
But we're young. We need some players to step it up at critical times, and
that didn't happen. When you play a team like Utah or any team in our
conference, you know, you got to be able to be more consistent than we were or
that we have been all season.  
But I will tell you that, you know, with our youth and what we have, if we can
put together a 40-minute game, we really believe we will stay with people. We
were right there with seven points to go.  
I do want to say I'm very proud of what Kathleen has done over her four years.
She didn't play as a freshman. She didn't play as a sophomore. She played
very, very little as a junior. And this year she played, she started, she's
just an incredible young lady. She weighs about 120 pounds. She's being
guarded, has to guard someone who weighs 170, 180. She really stepped up and
gave us a great senior year.  
We're just all so very thankful that we have Raimee back for another year if
we can just keep her healthy.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. How difficult a matchup was Taryn for your team?  
KATHLEEN SCHJODT: She was a difficult matchup. We were outsized. She's a very
strong player, very skilled inside. It was tough to defend her. She provided a
challenge for us.  
RAIMEE BECK: Definitely. Like coach Ardie was taking, Kat weighs about a buck
20. I'm sure Taryn weighs a little more. So it's hard to have a matchup like
that when we're so undersized. It's something that hopefully we can, you know,
get -- get better height next year and see if we can handle her next year,
so...  
  
Q. Raimee, for next year, are you confident that things can be different for
you next year?  
RAIMEE BECK: Yes. This year, I mean, as you all know, we all had quite a few
freshmen that played. We're pretty young. We're very small, too. Hopefully
next year we have a few girls that are about 6'3" coming in. With the
experience our freshmen had this year, hopefully that can boost their
confidence level for next year and we can come out and we've got to work
really hard in the summertime.  
I think we can make some improvement definitely over the summertime and come
out with a better, successful season next year.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll dismiss the student-athletes. We'll open it up for
questions for coach.  
  
Q. You play against Utah, who is a team very good at both ends of the floor.
Can you just talk a little bit about why it's so difficult to play against
them and the things that you've tried against them that have worked and that
have been gone so well tactically.  
COACH McINELLY: Well, I think, you know, one thing that Utah does very well is
they play great team defense. You know, they mixed up how they played defense
today versus the other two times. Their ball screen, they played that much
different today. Our players had to adjust to that.  
Our baseline screens, they flattened out their post player. They still chased
us on every screen. But they made some adjustments. Our players, I think that
they need to do a better job of reading quicker, you know. And they will.  
But with youth comes experience. And even though Kat was a senior, she didn't
have game experience. Like I said, she didn't really play much basketball for
three years. So, you know, we had two, three people that had game experience,
being able to make decisions.  
You know, you were a great player, athlete yourself. You have to be able to
make that possession by possession, not just a certain game plan, because
they're going to mix things up.  
I don't know if I really answered your question. I started kind of just
talking.  
  
Q. We give the teams that are at the top of the conference a chance to
answer this a lot, but we rarely ask you this. How do you like the bracket and
how has it changed how the conference is for you guys?  
COACH McINELLY: We are. But I watch a lot of basketball on TV. I see there are
men's conferences out there that do it, there are women's conferences that do
it, whether we're talking about the Big 12, Big East. Some people don't play
for three days. That's what women's basketball coaches have decided. Let's
protect the top three seeds and see if we can get the top three seeds into the
NCAA tournament, maybe even four seeds, and do it for the conference itself.
So I understand that and buy into it.  
I don't have a problem with, you know, the nine-team plan, the four-team. The
other way it's eight, nine, but that way the winner has to play one.  
So from my standpoint, no matter what you do, you want to protect the best
people, the best teams in your conference, and, number two, everybody better
be able to play every single day because who knows who is going to win or
lose. If we would have played the whole game like we did the first half, it
would have been a different game.  
I just believe that what we do on the women's side here in the Mountain West
Conference, I do like it. I don't have a problem with it. So, you know,
hopefully it will stay that way.  
  
Q. You talked the other day about some of the recruits, a couple 6'2 "
girls, a couple 6'4". How much would that have helped today, given the matchup
you had inside?   
COACH McINELLY: Well, one young lady from Texas that is 6'4", she outweighs
the young lady that we played today. So at least it gives us a little bit more
stability, gives us a little bit more depth on the inside. There's a young
lady named Diana Rolniak. She had three blocked shots today. We actually got
her teammate from Regis High School right there out of Denver, and she's 6'2",
6'3", and she's like a Rolniak. She's very athletic. She's very long.  
So we believe with some of the bulk, some of the height, some of the higher-
skilled players that we have recruited, we believe that's going to help us,
combined with the freshmen we have right now, some of our upperclassmen,
obviously Raimee Beck, Anna Gault, Liz Dunsworth, that's really going to help
us. I'm just hoping that we have that opportunity to watch these young people
develop. I believe in them. I believe that a lot of people are going to be
surprised next year, pleasantly surprised.  
  
Q. The freshmen that you had, the minutes that they played was the majority
of the minutes. How much did that help them, despite the fact they didn't
experience any wins in conference?  
COACH McINELLY: Well, I think it helps a lot because you can have a good group
of freshmen that never get on the court and they have no experience, or you
can have a group of freshmen that get to play and maybe don't win a lot of
games but there's nothing to replace game-like experience.  
I think they've learned a lot. I believe that Chelsea Berger, Alicia
Leipprandt, Des Wilson, Dymond James, it's just a great group of young players
that that's an invaluable gift that they've had.  
Now, the hard part is we didn't win a lot of games, but we know that help's on
the way. Again, we try to stay patient, we stay positive. My coaching staff
continually teaches every single day, teaches the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  

Connecticut  53  
Stanford - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome up to the dais Stanford head coach Tara
VanDerveer, as well as student-athletes Nneka Ogwumike and Kayla Pedersen.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I want to congratulate UConn on a national championship, and
a great second half. Their players really stepped up big. They were physical
the whole game, then they knocked down some shots in the second half.  
And then, secondly, I'd like to compliment Stanford, our team, and the players
up here, Nneka and Kayla, who really battled for us. We just -- we came up
short. We did not score as we needed to score.  
But I'm really proud of them. And I thought that they really worked very hard
for our team. Not just tonight, but all year.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kayla, you guys said yesterday you couldn't let them go on a run, and
that's what they started the second half with. Could you talk about this for a
few minutes?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Going into halftime, we all told everybody that we know
they're going to make their run. You know, we have to keep playing our
lockdown defense. 12 points in the first half was extremely helpful for us.
But we weren't able to capitalize and come back from that.  
And I think we kept fighting, kept fighting, but things weren't falling. And
we got a little bit extended on defense more so than we should have. They
started rebounding a little bit better. And, I don't know, we needed to make
our own run, and we didn't really do that.  
  
Q. Nneka, could you just talk about the second half? It seemed like they
really locked down on you and tried to do whatever they could to take you out
of it.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, yeah, they were sagging in. And it was as if every
time I went into the block and tried to make a move, there was always someone
there waiting for me. They were sagging off our other posts and there was a
lot of help-side. It wasn't really easy to score. And usually I would get
passes off of them helping up. And I was able to finish when my teammate would
pass it to me when they helped off the weak side.  
But it was definitely congested. But in the second half we were definitely
stagnant in the -- I wouldn't say the first ten minutes, we didn't score for a
while, and they were scoring. I think we played pretty good defense. We just
couldn't respond on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Both you girls, the first half they could throw it in the ocean. You all
weren't a heck of a lot better. Was it just the dome, the spaciousness, the
stage? What do you think was going on?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: No, I don't think it was the dome. I don't think it was the
floor. I think both teams were just playing very good defense. Taking away
everybody's strengths. Both teams stuck to their game plan in the first half.
But, I mean, we were taking good shots. They just didn't fall.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, in the first half, I think it was just -- we played
exceptionally good defense in the first half. I think that was great. We held
them to 12 points.  
I mean, I don't know how it was for them, but I just don't think we were
concentrating enough on our shots. I know I wasn't. I could have made a lot of
shots in the first half. But it was just kind of -- I think we were either
over- or underfocusing. It was one of the two.  
And it was causing us to miss shots that we make every day.  
  
Q. Nneka, Maya Moore had as much trouble as everyone else on her team in the
first half, but then she was the catalyst in the second half. Did you fear it
was just a matter of time before she got off?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I wasn't fearing anything. I was trying my hardest on
defense. My coaches told me I did a good job defensively the first half. The
second half I was getting screened more.  
And they were screening each other more. So it caused a lot of kind of
franticness because we were switching. And so I think that's kind of how she
kind of got off.  
But I can't say that I was fearing that she was going to get going. The goal
is to stop her from get going. And I think we did a pretty good job of that in
the first half.  
  
Q. Nneka, just a little bit more on Maya Moore. Did she do anything that you
hadn't expected? You had seen a tape of her for quite a while now. Can you
comment about what it was like to play against her and just how good she
really was?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, this is the third time that I've guarded her. She
didn't do -- I wouldn't say she did anything different. She's a good player.
She works hard on trying to get open and works hard on hitting down her shots.  
And, I mean, she's a hard person to guard. I had a hard time guarding her all
three times. I tried my best each time. I think I did a little bit better
today.  
But I wouldn't say that she did anything different.  
  
Q. I have two questions. One is with respect to your other post, Jayne
Appel. She appeared to be visibly in pain for good portions of the game. Could
you talk at all about how that was for her, if you know? The second is: You
seem to be playing a little bit further from the hoop than is often the case.
Was that something they were doing to you on defense, or was that part of your
game strategy?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: With regard to Jayne, honestly, I didn't see what had
happened. I saw she was in pain, but that's the extent of my knowledge about
that. It's always tough to go down in a game as big as this. But honestly, I
mean, I know right now she's probably hurting more from the loss than whatever
injury it is or even if it is an injury.  
And me being away from the basket today, I think we didn't want to -- I didn't
want -- Tara told us she didn't want us to congest the paint any more than it
was. We tried our best to spread things out. I mean, that's pretty much the
extent of that.  
  
Q. Kayla, can you talk a little bit about Jayne's struggle tonight? The
0-for-12 was kind of a big number sticking out on that box score, but how did
that impact what you guys do offensively?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I mean, I think Jayne gave it her all. She's probably upset
about that. But, I mean, she's the force of our team. We're not going to stop
going to her. She kept battling through.  
One of the great things about her is she's very unselfish. If she's not
scoring, she's going to dish out the ball to other players that are wide open,
because Jayne demands attention.  
So, I mean, no, I'm just very proud of her for fighting through all the pain.
She never let any of us know what was going on, because she didn't want that
on her mind. So I'm just very proud of her today.  
  
Q. Both players, could you talk about what was the mood and the thinking at
halftime? You've only given up 12 points but you're only up by 8?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I'd say we were focused. We weren't all high from being up,
because we were up at halftime in December and we know what happened after
that.  
But we were just very focused, and just kept telling each other, 20 more
minutes and keep doing what we're doing. But unfortunately that didn't happen.  
  
Q. Nneka or Kayla, whoever wants to answer, sort of in the same vein, after
halftime, you know, you guys missed some easy shots. So probably wish you'd
been up a little bit more. You knew UConn was going to make a run, because
they always do. Still, when they made their run, at the end you guys didn't
give up. And I'm wondering if you're going to be able to take anything from
the way you were resilient at the very end of the game into the rest of your
careers?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, absolutely. You learn from every game. We knew that
they were going to come out on a run, because we kind of locked them down
defensively in the first half. But at the same time, like you said, we could
have made easier shots that could have created a larger lead.  
I think what we learned most about this game is how poised we stayed, and also
how hard we want to continue to work to be able to get to where we want to go.  
  
Q. Does this hurt a little bit more because you realize if you had played
better tonight, it was there for the taking?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Definitely. Yeah, I think our whole team is hurting right now
to be that close. You know, to be winning at halftime and to make our run at
the very end. It hurts to lose. But, I mean, quite frankly, I'm just angry. I
don't want to be that LSU team that never wins a national championship. So I
think that's what the players that are returning are thinking right now. And I
know Nneka and I were talking, we're just so ready to go.  
And for the players that aren't returning, I mean, I'm just so proud of them
and this whole entire team. This is probably my favorite team that I've played
on all three years, and I'm glad I'm losing with them.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: And I think that's why it hurts the most, too, also,
because I've only been here for two years, and this team -- I mean, it's more
special than any team I've ever been on, AAU, high school, middle school,
anything. I think that's why it hurts the most, because we wanted to win it
with this group of people. But life moves on. You keep working.  
  
Q. Nneka, can you talk about UConn's defense? What did they do in the second
half that maybe they weren't doing in the first?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I think they just kind of amped it up like they did when we
played them December 23rd. They weren't -- I wouldn't say -- they kind of
pressed us a little bit more. They were trying to pressure us, and also sag
in.  
And so they were leaving people, and they were flying out on some people. And
the people that they were leaving, for example, me, I mean, I could have hit
some shots, and, quite frankly, that's all I'm thinking about right now, just
going back and improving.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk about the first half versus the second half, the
difference between the two and the struggles you guys just had trying to
score?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't know that it was an extreme difference. I think we
wasted a lot of opportunities in both halves. And I think that it's -- Jayne
being healthy and just playing a regular game, in all four years, you could
correct me if I'm wrong, but I've never seen her go O-fer.  
She had some really nice shots early. I thought people were rushing shots. I
think she wanted to play well. Very badly. She's playing against Tina Charles
since she was 11 years old.  
And she really battled. And she was in a lot of pain. And just kept going at
it. But the ball was not dropping for her. So without getting any low block
scoring from Jayne, and I think that -- I thought they did a good job.  
But you have to know that Nneka coming off of 38 points, this was -- it was
very physical. And, you know, Nneka just -- is going to have to really learn
from this. And we needed to have some kind of go-to playing. And we didn't
have that.  
I thought Kayla stepped up for us. We had some inopportune turnovers. They did
go on that big run. Defensively, I thought we worked very hard and did a great
job in the first half. I can't even imagine them only scoring 12 points. That
is really just -- it was just an incredible job defensively and focused.  
But offensively, we -- besides Kayla, basically we didn't have anyone show up
that was making shots for us or -- it was a struggle.  
But I guess our defense was awesome. And I thought, you know, you look at
statistically, the field goals attempted, pretty much the same. 3s are pretty
much the same. They got a lot more free throws than we did.  
Just offensive boards. We worked hard to keep them off the offensive boards.
They're similar, although maybe not -- they blocked more shots than we did.
But our fouling, I mean, that's not -- some of it I think was at the end also
fouling, wanted to try to get the ball.  
I think someone already said it was there for the taking.  
  
Q. I think it was yesterday, one of the days, you said that you thought
realistically they may have to have an off game for you all to win. Well, you
know, your defense had something to do with that. But they also had that off
game. Yet you weren't able to win the game. How frustrating and disappointing
is that? You got what you wanted, but still weren't able to get over the
top.  
COACH VANDERVEER: It's very disappointing. And it's very frustrating. I think
what's the hardest is Jayne having such a great career at Stanford and I just
-- I'm really sad for her to go out on this kind of game when last year, even
though we lost, last year she had 25.  
She just was not able to push off her ankle, and her foot's bothering her. And
I'm more sad for her than anything else.  
But as other people said, it just -- you know, Connecticut is -- they're
beating these people by 30 and 40 points. And we had a chance. And I just feel
like we wasted some opportunities.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your strategy against Maya and what worked in the
first half and what wasn't working in the second half?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, in the second half I don't think we switched quick
enough on her. We were really looking to switch on her. And Tina started
setting more screens on her and harder screens. And for Nneka, especially, I
think she usually probably plays against a post player. They have four
perimeter players. She sometimes plays against perimeter players.  
But I thought our team -- you know, Maya Moore was the difference, you know?
If she's on our team, we win. She really stepped up and made big plays for
them.  
Tina Charles made a couple of plays down the stretch. But, really, she's a
great player and she made big plays.  
We weren't doing anything differently in the second half, but we weren't doing
things as well in the second half. I think the fact that we couldn't score
just -- it discourages you, too.  
  
Q. Why exactly did you take Rosalyn out and why did she play so little?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think Ros for us does a great job if she is what
I call a lockdown defender. And in this game we were switching a lot. And it
was harder for her to maybe to get that concept and help more.  
And the way they were playing Ros, they were off of her. They were sagging in
off of her. And I didn't feel like she was recognizing when she was open and
what shots to take.  
And I thought in the beginning of the game she was dribbling too much. Of
course, no one really came in and hit perimeter shots any more than she did.
But we needed perimeter shooting.  
And I thought -- I mean, JJ hit one. But she was like, what, 1-for-9. Kayla
was hitting for us. Jeanette was hitting a little bit. We needed that kind of
third person. And I kind of tried to look at it -- I also thought Mel helped
us run our offense a little bit.  
  
Q. This is your third consecutive Final Four. But this finish was not like
the last two that we saw. I wonder if you could just reflect a little bit
about it. I know it's really tough because you lost again. But this was so
much different than the Tennessee and then Connecticut last year.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I mean, these are -- I really feel like our team came
in playing with confidence, and just we have more pieces. But at the same
time, just you can feel sometimes so close and at the same time feel so far
away.  
We just -- I think we really had a great year. Our coaches and players worked
very hard. And I'm not -- I'm not saying -- I'm very proud of what we've
accomplished. But when you -- we did come much closer. I think we really
learned a lot from that Tennessee game. And we learned that it was going to be
very physical.  
What you see all year is not what you see in the championship game. And our
team was ready for that. And it was very physical. And we have to be more
physical. Last year against Connecticut we were outplayed and we got down
early. But we didn't take advantage of opportunities, from my estimation.  
I mean, whether it was really some inopportune turnovers, really point-blank
shots, not getting to the free throw line, we never got out in transition. And
just some people that, you know, this is -- there was more in this game than
what maybe some people understood.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that first-half defense and just what was it that went
right, other than I guess everything?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think we switched well. We were out on people. We
didn't leave people wide open for shots. And we protected the baskets and
didn't give them second shots for the most part. That was our game plan. I
thought we came in and executed it very well. And to hold Connecticut to 53
points, you know, maybe they didn't shoot well.  
But some of that is related to people playing good defense and not giving them
a lot of second shots. Unfortunately, we sent them to the free-throw line too
many times.  
But our inability to score really hurt us.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit more about what your game plan was coming
into the game and what parts of it succeeded, what parts didn't?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think defensively we played -- we had -- we were
switching on their perimeter people. We wanted to box out. We wanted to get
back and not let them get easy run-outs. We wanted to take care of the ball.
Offensively, we wanted to go inside to Nneka. We wanted to go inside to Jayne.
And then that would open up things for our perimeter people.  
Kayla, I thought, had a great game. She knocked down perimeter shots. Jeanette
hit some perimeter shots for us. Jeanette getting into foul trouble hurt us.  
But besides that, we turned it over, and we didn't get the production we need
from our post player, Nneka and Jayne. That's what our game is: Go inside. And
when that -- when we struggle with that, we struggled.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Some of that was not by design. She had to battle in there
and be more aggressive against Maya Moore. And Maya Moore is a terrific
player. She's probably got, I don't know, 10 or 15 pounds on Nneka, and it was
really battling for position.  
That wasn't, you know -- that wasn't by design. But Nneka is a young player.
And she will learn from this and watch it and say, hey, this is what I need to
be doing.  
  
Q. I realized you just walked off the court, but I wonder if -- does tonight
tell us that the gap between you and them and maybe them and some other top
teams has narrowed a little bit?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I wish I was in the second press conference and then I could
say yes. But maybe they had a bad night. We were in the game and then we just
-- we didn't sustain what we needed to for 40 minutes. I don't think there's
-- I mean, for us we have played competitively with them for the most part I
think every time. And now they'll be coming out to Stanford. And that will be
a good thing for our team, I think.  
Let's see about it. I guess I'll leave that -- they've gone two straight
seasons undefeated. I think they deserve a tremendous amount of credit. And
let's take care -- we have to -- we can't talk about it. We have to beat them
to close the gap.  
  
Q. I know this stings, but is there still a positive here in terms of
maintaining Stanford's position and going forward with the team you have for
the next year or so?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Definitely. You know, for years and years and years, the
only matchup that people wanted to see was Tennessee and Connecticut. And I
think that we have -- I think we're establishing a great East Coast/West Coast
rivalry, Stanford and UConn.  
As you heard the young players that are returning, we came into the game and
we're very disappointed we didn't win a national championship and that we
didn't win the game. But to be in three Final Fours, two national championship
games in three years, you've got to knock on the door.  
And, I mean, I just know -- just listening, as an example, to Mike Krzyzewski,
they won four national championships. Been in the championship game eight
times. This is one, two -- we've won two out of four times. So we need to work
hard and get back.  
And we need this to be motivating and inspiring for our team. And we need it
to be extremely painful. The fact that it is painful and we're not just saying
we're happy to be here is a good thing for us at Stanford.  
  
Q. I hate to end on this note, but offensively, starting with the Xavier
game, and then these last three games, you had a big game from Nneka against
Oklahoma and you needed it, because offensively everybody else didn't have a
great night. This was not a great night. I have to ask, what happened to the
offense the last three games, in your mind?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think a lot of it, you know, we have -- we've gotten
here with the great play of Jayne. And again she has battled. But she is hurt.
And we needed her in there defensively, just with her size and her rebounding,
and she did a great job rebounding for us. But offensively she really
struggled.  
On top of that, then we did have good shooting and good perimeter scoring from
Kayla and Jeanette tonight. But in the Xavier game and in the Oklahoma game,
we really struggled with our perimeter shooting.  
I mean, you can have maybe a bad night, but I think it's clear, to me anyways,
what we need our team doing. And I think that this will only motivate people
more to understand, you know, we need people in the gym, improving our
perimeter shooting, and there are a lot of things we can do and take -- take a
lot of positives from this experience with our team.  
So I'm disappointed. I know our team is hurting. But I feel very encouraged
with how hard people played and all the great things that will come out of
this for our program.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  

Connecticut  53  
Stanford - 47

  
THE MODERATOR: For our final press conference of the Final Four, I'm pleased
to introduce Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma, as well as student-athletes
Tina Charles, Maya Moore and Kalana Greene.  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's hard to put it all into words and in perspective. Just
the feeling of helplessness we felt in the first half and going into our
locker room at halftime and not knowing what we had left in us and what they
were thinking, and to come out in the second half and make some of the plays
that we made and have Maya make some of the shots that she made. It was a real
testament to these kids and how strong they are and how tough they are and how
resilient they are.  
I'm really thrilled for them. And I'm really thrilled to be their coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our three student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maya, can you talk about the first half and the mood at halftime, what
you guys were thinking? Coach said he didn't know what you were thinking. What
were you thinking?  
MAYA MOORE: As far as our motivation, I mean, we knew what we had to do. It
was a new half. We had to just keep playing hard and executing what we didn't
execute in the first half. Sometimes it's just that simple. You just have to
focus in on the little things that we've been working on all year and things
start clicking.  
And we knew we weren't going to finish the game the way we started. And once
we just kind of locked in on setting up our screens, rebounding, guarding the
3-point line a little better, and our defense was outstanding in the second
half. And that's what really sparked it. Tina Charles in the lane, blocking
shots left and right, and we never looked back from there.  
  
Q. For all of you, could you just talk about the journey from day one and
the things you had to deal with to accomplish this, another perfect season?  
KALANA GREENE: I think the journey started in Tampa, when we lost to Stanford.
And that was definitely like the trigger right there. We just wanted to come
back and win a national championship. We were so close. And I think we knew
what we had to do to get it.  
And our motivation last year was to -- this year was to show everyone we had a
lot of doubts at the guard position, what could we do without Renee
Montgomery, and Tiffany and Caroline came in this year and did whatever we had
to do to win.  
And it's been great. It's just fun, and we're undefeated.  
TINA CHARLES: I'll just go for what she said.  
  
Q. Maya, could you talk about what Stanford was doing to you defensively in
the first half and what changed in the second half? And, also, did you feel
pressure, personally, that you needed to kind of take over things in the
second half?  
MAYA MOORE: I thought Stanford did a great job in the first half just being
physical, trying to jam up our cuts, not letting us kind of move where we
wanted to. And it forced us to have to work harder off the ball to get open
and just being tougher with the basketball.  
The second half, you can't really have any fear, any doubts. We all recognized
that we weren't ourselves and we just had to leave it in the locker room, and
that's what we did, and come out and be in the attack mode.  
After we started executing our offense a little better and got our flow back,
we started looking like ourselves again.  
But I'm absolutely always trying to be on the attack, and that's what our team
was in the second half.  
  
Q. Maya, in that second half, it seemed like when you got your groove back
was when you rose up and knocked down that 3-pointer that put the team ahead,
to stay, as it turned out. I notice that you had this look of determination
that you were going to knock that shot down no matter what. When it left your
hands and you saw it go down, did you feel like, okay, we're on a roll now?  
MAYA MOORE: That was a big momentum pusher. I remember just coming off of a
screen from the opposite side. And I think it was you that kicked it out to
me. And there was a defender right in my face, running to contest it. And I
just didn't think about it; I just rose up and shot it and it went in and
everybody had a little bounce to them.  
I think when Kalana got that and one, too, was a big spark for us. Those
3-point plays sparked our line. And that's why we're champions. We rise to the
occasion. And we love big-time games and big-time shots.  
  
Q. Tina, Kalana, you pretty much only have about 24 hours to celebrate this
before you get on with the next part of your life. Going to be in New York
getting ready to be drafted by the WNBA. How do you both feel about that quick
transition, and are you ready to move on?  
TINA CHARLES: I haven't even thought about it. I'm sitting here fighting back
tears because I'm going to miss this team and miss Coach. I'm grateful for
everything he's done for me. I'm going to miss just everything about this
program. Rosemary Ragle and the rehab I had with her, my shoulder, just all
the little things that I'm just sitting here thinking about. That's far off my
mind.  
KALANA GREENE: Just going to celebrate as long as I can. That's it.  
  
Q. Maya, this wasn't the typical UConn win, but you won 78 in a row, back-
to-back undefeated seasons, two straight national championships. What are your
emotions right now? What are you feeling?  
MAYA MOORE: Kind of an awkward stage right now, because you go through the
whole season always working for something, always working for something, and
you finally get it and it's like: What now?  
So I know all of us are just drained, I think, emotionally from the high and
low of just that game alone. But there's a huge sense of satisfaction and
knowing that we went out the way we wanted to and the way we did it, I think,
and the way we believed and trusted in what Coach was telling us. And we
bought into it. And it worked.  
So we're just on cloud nine right now, and I don't see myself going to sleep
anytime soon.  
  
Q. Tina, Jayne went O-fer. Could you sense that she was struggling
physically a little bit?  
TINA CHARLES: Yeah, you know, just seeing the way her coach was subbing her in
and out with No. 44. I know she was giving everything she had out there. I
know this is her last go-around, both our last game. So we both gave our all
out there. But we just came out and we fought harder.  
  
Q. Maya, what's life going to be like without the women sitting next to you
from the left to the right?  
MAYA MOORE: It's going to be sad. I mean, I'm going to miss them. They have, I
think, been the most improved players, just seeing Tina's growth from freshman
year to now, and Kalana's growth from last year to now. They're leaders for
our team, and we're going to absolutely miss that.  
But I'm just going to take everything that they've taught me and everything
that they've been -- they've been an example for me and I won't let them down
and I'll take how hard they work and how they approach their senior year and
I'm going to do the same next year.  
But I'm always going to be in contact with them. We're family forever. And I
don't think we'll ever forget this night.  
  
Q. Tina and Kalana, every kid that goes to college basketball dreams of
senior year, celebrating on the court a national championship. Could you put
into words what that's like, knowing your last game and then you're national
champions and you're leaving UConn as a national champion?  
TINA CHARLES: I think you have to experience it to know the feeling. I could
say a bunch of words, but I think the feeling, you have to really experience
it.  
And I think that's the best thing about this whole thing because we were able
to experience this two times and just the hard work that we put into it and
just the support we had from just everybody from the fans, from our student
body back at school, just everything, I think this is for everybody and how
special it is.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
KALANA GREENE: I just remember last year remembering how I felt. It was like I
gotta get back here again. And I think that's what every senior wants, is to
go out with a bang. And we did.  
  
Q. Kalana and Tina, wanted to get your thoughts on winning the final 78
games of your career, two national championships, now walking away. What kind
of legacy do you think you're leaving behind?  
TINA CHARLES: I think we definitely set the stakes high. Coach did it. He set
the stakes high for the people coming into Connecticut, because I know when I
came in, we didn't win for a year, for like a long time. So the guys coming in
now, the guys who is here next year, Maya, Tiffany, Caroline, they just gotta
keep winning, because that's what Connecticut does.  
  
Q. Maybe for Tina, if you could just reflect on the supreme satisfaction
that you're feeling right now just because the fact that so many people maybe
coronated you as champions well before this night, but tonight you guys showed
what you had in terms of battling back, not only tonight but battling against
Baylor as well. Is that where you derive your sense of satisfaction walking
away? Not just from having won 78 in a row, but winning the 78th in the way
that you did?  
TINA CHARLES: Definitely. I think that's where we give our praises to our
practice players and just how hard they always came out to practice and came
out against us. There will be times when we'll be down and we fought through
it. Coach wouldn't let us get off the court until we overcame that.  
I think that's why we're able to do that when Baylor cut the lead down to 3
and when we're coming out of halftime and being down by 8.  
So I think that's just the best satisfaction. And I know our practice players
are just really happy for us, especially.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. In the first half, I was wondering, did you wonder whether either team
was going to be able to get to 20 points? I've never seen a half like that. I
wonder if you have.  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, no, I've never seen anything like it. Ever. There was a
point in time where it looked like we may never score again. And that's what I
felt like. I remember turning around one time and just staring at the bench
and looking at the other coaches and just shaking my head, and this feeling of
we're not going to score any more points.  
And I looked at the scoreboard, and I realized they were in the same situation
we were in. And here I thought defensively we weren't playing well. We had to
turn up the defense. Turn up the defense.  
And it's 20 to 12 and didn't feel so bad. As bad as we played, it wasn't as
bad as it could have been. And there was hope. There was hope for us. I didn't
know what kind of hope. But there was hope.  
  
Q. I know this might be too early for you to reflect upon this, but now that
you have won seven of these and you've done it four times with an undefeated
team, with what this team accomplished, as I said to Tina, winning 78 in a
row, but 78th, is it supremely gratifying for you as a coach? And is this the
greatest team, the championship team, you've had? Does it supplant the 2002
team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know what to think of that. I don't know where I would
put it in the context of who is better or who is not. I think looking back now
at what we've done, if you make me look back at what we've done, I'm almost
incredulous that it actually happened, because I can't imagine having done it.  
It's almost like it never happened. You know, it's something that's there, and
I know we did it. And I know it's in the record books. But I am so astounded
that it's happened. When you make comments like that, you know, four
undefeated teams, it's just too hard to comprehend. You know, it really is. It
really, really is.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Maya's game tonight. You've seen her do a lot of
things, but did you get a sense from her at halftime that she was ready to
take over? And what were they doing to contain her in the first half?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I was worried all year long that what exactly happened
in the first half was going to happen. And I would always say to people, you
know, we come out there and we don't make any shots, we're going to lose. And
we kept scoring 90 points. 90 points. And it's like, well, that's never going
to happen. So all of a sudden when nobody can make a shot, then all of a
sudden we have kids on the team who didn't want to shoot.  
And Stanford knows that. And they're going to guard Maya really hard. And
they're daring everybody else to make shots. And we felt, I think, the
defensive pressure that Stanford put on us. And I think for the first time all
season, I think we felt the game pressure and the Final Four pressure and the
national championship pressure.  
That's the only thing -- that's the only way I can explain it, what happened.
Stanford's defense was great. And we finally felt that pressure that comes
from doing what we've been doing and being where we are. And to be honest with
you, for Caroline to make those shots she made, that's just an incredible
toughness on that kid's part, because she hasn't made a shot since Brian was a
senator (laughter).  
  
Q. Well played.  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's why he came to say hi to us. He said: I remember you
making a shot when I was senator.  
  
Q. Maya, did you feel like she was capable of going off?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I wasn't sure. I wasn't sure. Maya operates on two levels: one
where she's in a complete zone and everything she touches goes in and you
can't keep her from scoring, then Maya gets in another zone where she wants to
win so bad or she wants to get it done so bad that she almost is her own worst
enemy.  
And that's, I think, one of the things that was happening in the first half.
And I didn't know if we could get her out of it. That's why I said we need
some other people to make some plays, to let Maya know, hey, I'm not out here
by myself. And in the second half she was a little more patient. Moved a
little bit better without the ball and just made some incredibly difficult
shots.  
And that's why she's a special player, I think.  
  
Q. Did you think that Stanford's offense struggled as Jayne struggled?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, they're difficult to guard offensively. And we were
determined not to double team Jayne and let Tina play against her one-on-one.
Because it seemed like every time we did do anything that resembled a double
team or helped, they were able to get off a couple of shots.  
We knew we had an impossible matchup with Nneka and Jayne. Jayne we felt like
Tina could handle. I just didn't think we had a matchup for Nneka. But we were
able to move Tina over and we took our chances. And Tina was just incredible
defensively.  
But, remember, I think I said yesterday that the first team to 50 wins, right?
Who knew, right? Who knew.  
  
Q. In the second half, did you guys do anything drastically different
defensively?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, because we scored we were able to kind of set our
defense a little bit better and apply the pressure where we wanted to apply
it. And when you're not scoring and you're constantly running back, you're
thinking about we didn't score, oh, my God, we didn't score again. We didn't
score again. That weighs on your mind and then you make mistake defensively.  
So because we were able to score points, we ran back with a clear head and we
were organized. Put a little more pressure on the ball. Took away a lot of the
outside shots, which is basically what we tried to do.  
They didn't make as many outside shots until the end. Then I thought that they
were going to win anyway, they were just going to keep making shots, make you
bank one, and I was ready to kill myself.  
  
Q. That six-minute stretch, the stretch at the start of the second half that
Maya had, you've coached a lot of really good players, including Diana and
whoever. Did you ever see one like that where she's hitting everything
everywhere?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Diana was the only one that resembled that at all. And I've
seen her do it -- it is what great players do. And they do it at the most
pressure-packed times. And that's what makes them who they are. That's what
makes them great. Maya is a great scorer. And you get that reputation by
scoring points under pressure. And she certainly did that.  
  
Q. When is the last time that you looked at the Wooden book you've been
carrying around? And I ask this tongue in cheek, but is there a chapter about
what to do when your team shoots 15 percent in the first half?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Geez, no. That's funny. I should have never mentioned that.
But I happened to have that book in my briefcase because I went on a trip in
September and I just have it in there. There's interesting scenarios in that
book of how to attack certain things, and his philosophy on attacking a
certain kind of defense or a certain kind of pressure.  
But there's absolutely no chapters and no pages on here's how you can win a
game if you shoot 15 percent in the first half (laughter). Maybe because this
team's never shot 15 percent in the first half. So I should write that
chapter.  
  
Q. Now that you're free of the tunnel vision of one game at a time, will
there be moments now that you'll have a chance to ponder what 78 in a row
means and will there be a moment or two where you idly think of how close you
are to 88 and UCLA?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'll probably think about the 78 and how it became a reality.
And I'll just stare up into space like I always do and say I can't believe it.
There's so many things that could go wrong along the way, and it's just
unexplainable that that many things could go that right for 78 straight games
and you would win.  
But I don't think about 88. I don't think about any of that. I don't ever
think about down the road, if we do this, this will happen.  
I'm not looking at it as a goal. I'm not looking at it as something that I
want to accomplish. If we're fortunate and it ever happens, I'll be astounded
again like I am right now.  
But I don't -- I would like to win another national championship next year,
and I'll probably say the same thing I said before this year's team: I don't
care if we have no losses or ten losses. I don't care. That's probably how I'm
going to be thinking.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Tina Charles's four years at UConn?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think it's all been said by a lot of people and by Tina
herself, about how much she's grown and how much she's changed and how much
she's elevated her game and how many different things she does well now,
relative to before.  
And as a person, she's a better person. She's grown up. She's a lot more
mature now than she was then. And as you would expect someone to be after four
years in college.  
And Tina's Tina. Tina didn't want to sit up here today right now and talk
about the game and the championship or the streak or any of those things. Tina
just wants to sit in the locker room right now and kind of hold on to that
moment and that feeling for another four years. She's not prepared to leave.  
  
Q. You mentioned you won't be thinking about 88. But last year, after your
win, people speculated about Maya maybe getting three in a row. There will be
expectations on her next year. Could you talk about that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, that just comes with the territory, you know? Maya is
unbelievable in what she can do and how she can do it. I think Maya's greatest
challenge next year is going to be that for the first time in her college
career she will be the older leader and not have a lot of help, and that's
going to really take its toll on Maya next year. I've told her that. We've
talked about it. And that's my job to get her ready for it.  
But, you know, people are going to expect us to win a national championship
because we've got Maya Moore. And I would say: Good. So do I.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously the 12 points the first half was part of the game plan,
but, apart from that, can you talk about what was your game plan coming in;
what ways you succeeded in executing that and which ways you didn't?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I felt coming in we were going to have a real hard time
stopping them from scoring. And I thought it was going to be difficult for
them to try to stop every one of us. I didn't count on what happened in that
first half.  
I didn't think we'd be able to hold them to 20. And I never imagined that we
would get 12. The way we guarded them is exactly the way I wanted to guard
them. We played defense exactly the way I wanted to play it. You hold a team
to 20 points, you're doing something special.  
So that was the game plan going in. I didn't have any problem with the
defense. The offensive game plan is the same as it's always been. And we kind
of strayed away from it too quickly.  
Tina didn't touch the ball. We didn't attack them at all. We just stood around
on the perimeter. There was very little movement. And in the second half, all
that changed. Our defense stayed solid. We got Tina a couple more touches in
the lane, and got better movement. And as a result, more people touched the
ball.  
And then because of that, we were able to feel comfortable. We never felt
comfortable in that first half. Never. It wasn't until I think maybe when Maya
made that 3 to put us up that there was a certain comfort level; that, hey, we
can come down and score now on three or four possessions in a row.  
I think one time we got it to, what, 15? The lead was 15, I think. 16. 16. And
I thought, okay, now we're comfortable. Then I look up and it's like six. It's
not supposed to be easy, right?  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: It is my pleasure to welcome to the podium Connecticut head
coach Geno Auriemma, as well as student-athletes Kalana Greene, Caroline Doty,
Tiffany Hayes Tina Charles, and Maya Moore.  
Coach, when you're ready.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Hard to imagine that we're back here now 364 days from last
season. It seems like just yesterday that we were playing and winning a
national championship. And what's gone into coming back here has been so
incredible and so amazing, what these particular kids have been through and
what we've done and how we've done it.  
I think it's right and it's just that we're playing tomorrow night. No one's
guaranteed to win tomorrow night. Stanford doesn't deserve to win, Coach
Auriemma and his players and Connecticut don't deserve to win, but I think
both teams deserve to be playing tomorrow night.  
I know I speak for everybody else that we're pretty excited about playing
tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kalana, your experience playing Stanford for the first time, what do you
guys get from that experience and what do you apply tomorrow night?  
KALANA GREENE: I think the first time we played Stanford we knew it was going
to be tough. And you have a lot of weapons. I think it's going to be the same
thing tomorrow night. We just have to grind it out and fight hard and pay
attention to the scouting report and do everything we've been doing the entire
year to try to get the win.  
  
Q. Yesterday was a pretty physical and intense game. I want to know how your
bodies are today. Do you feel more tired than normal? Business as usual? Or
did yesterday take a little bit more out of you than normal?  
MAYA MOORE: Yeah, it was definitely a physical game, as it should be. And I
think both teams came out of it feeling like they exerted a lot of energy. But
I think one of the benefits of our schedule this season is we had a lot of --
a couple of Saturday-Monday games. So I think our bodies know how to react,
and we know how to kind of take care of ourselves in that quick turnaround and
take the necessary treatments we need. So that won't be an excuse tomorrow.  
TINA CHARLES: I would just say I think that's just the best part of this whole
thing; that at the end of the year you have to see which team is just going to
fight through everything, fight through all of the excuses as to why maybe we
couldn't play hard.  
But I think at the end of the day, when it all comes together, either team,
whoever wins the national championship, I think that's why you get happy,
because you fought through all the little things.  
  
Q. Caroline and Kalana, I think the two teams shot something like 4 for 32
from 3s yesterday. And your first games, not good outside shooting. Is there a
reason for that? And how big a part do you think the perimeter scoring is
going to play tomorrow?  
KALANA GREENE: I think with our team we don't really rely on just outside
shooting or rely just on the inside game. I think we have a good balance.  
So when we're not hitting a lot of outside shots -- I mean, it's nice to hit
them but when we're not hitting them, we find other ways, whether it's in
transition or forcing turnovers and Tina working down low.  
So I think for us we always find a way to score, even if we're shooting well
or not.  
CAROLINE DOTY: I agree with Kalana. Shots aren't going to fall. You're going
to have nights where shots aren't going to fall, and we're going to rely on
our defense and transition game and trying to work the ball around and trying
to get baskets different ways. We've been working on our shots. Putting up
plenty of baskets the last couple of days. We feel confident with it. It will
come.  
  
Q. Tiffany and Caroline, it was a rough shooting night yesterday, I think 1
for 14 combined. Can you talk about rebounding from that and what's it going
to take to make sure you have more contributions in the championship game?  
CAROLINE DOTY: You can't dwell on it. You just gotta know -- you know what
shots are open and when to take them, and if you think about it, then you're
never going to get out of that little slump. But it's a new game, new day, and
we're going to keep shooting and taking what the defense gives us.  
  
Q. Tina, two years ago you guys played Stanford early in the season in the
tournament, then they came back and beat you in the semifinals in that second
game of the season. You guys are in a bit of the same spot this year. What is
the difference this year in this situation in your mind?  
TINA CHARLES: Different players. Players improved. I know me personally, I
improved my style of play. I'm not the same player that I was two years ago.
We got new faces. Everybody's on the same page. And we all have one goal.  
  
Q. Maya, Tina, you've all had opportunities to play with the Stanford
players on international teams for a few years. When you're in that
environment as teammates, do you ever think about the days when you're going
to have to play them for school in terms of not showing off too much or giving
them an inside look as to what you can do or what you like to do? Do you ever
think about that? I mean, when you're with Nneka or with Jayne about showing
them too much about what your skill level is or what your strengths are?  
TINA CHARLES: I think that's the best part, because then you get to see if you
can stop that. I take pride in if I'm able to block one of Jayne's shots or if
I'm able to rotate right on defense and just try to stop their move. And I
think that's the best part of seeing what they can do, because you're able to
see what you are made of on the defensive side.  
MAYA MOORE: I don't change my game at all. We all put aside our college
differences for a little while when we're playing together. And you're just
competing. You're not thinking about the college season, necessarily. We're
always competitive and stuff like that. But I don't think we hold back, if
that's what you're asking.  
  
Q. Tina, can you talk a little bit about the matchup with Jayne Appel and
how that will be different than your matchup with Brittney Griner. What
exactly are you going to have to do against Jayne in this game?  
TINA CHARLES: Just I know it's going to be a battle, just physically on both
of our ends. Just having my hands up on defense. Just trying to stop her from
going to the middle. She can use both of her hands real well. Just those
intangibles that a post player has.  
  
Q. Maya, I wonder if you could tell me, when you look at Nneka, watch her
play, what you see, describe her as a basketball player?  
MAYA MOORE: She's very aggressive. I think she's playing with a lot of
confidence right now. She can do a lot of things on the basketball court. She
knows what she's good at. She knows her strengths and she goes to them. Very
athletic. She can rebound. She can score for them. She runs the floor. And is
very active.  
I think she -- if she puts her mind to it, it is absolutely a leader for that
team, just as far as what she can physically do on the basketball court.  
  
Q. Maya and Tina, have you had a chance to think about what's before you,
the history you may be about to make going back to back undefeated national
champions?  
TINA CHARLES: No, I don't think that will come into play, only if everything
goes well. Right now we're focusing in on Stanford and what we have to do to
win a national championship, all those little things will come afterwards.  
MAYA MOORE: That's not something we're focusing on right now. If you get too
ahead of yourself or start taking your eyes off what's right in front of us,
that's when you get beat.  
So right now we're looking forward to tomorrow and preparing for that and
going through our daily routine and keeping our same schedule and going out
and having fun tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kalana and Tina, you guys knew this day was coming, obviously. You're
seniors and this is going to be it. But I'm wondering what you both think
about doing everything for the last time -- last practice, last shoot-around,
last game -- what tomorrow's going to be like for you knowing that one way or
another you move on in life after tomorrow?  
KALANA GREENE: We're in the position that every senior that plays college
basketball wants to be in. We tried our best to get ourselves in this position
and in the right way, and I think it's up to our team to get the win for us
tomorrow.  
But I think we're just going to try to focus everyone up because these are the
last couple of moments as a team. And we're enjoying it. I know I am. I'm
pretty sure Tina is, and, like I said, this is the position we wanted to be in
ever since last year.  
  
Q. Maya, I know the coaching staff's really good at breaking down tape and
making you guys look like you lost the game by 50 points after you played
them. What did you guys -- after you watched the Stanford tape from before,
assuming you have, what did you take from that game; what do you guys look to
improve on?  
MAYA MOORE: I know we didn't come out the way we wanted to in that first half.
Just not really on the same page. We're one of those teams, one of the
positive things we can take from it is we're always looking for that next run.
And we always have to have confidence that another run is coming, that's what
we ended up doing in the first half of that game. So we're definitely going to
study it some more.  
But always be confident, I think, in knowing that our team is about to be on
another run.  
  
Q. Maya, maybe a follow-up on that. Yesterday when Baylor pulled within 3,
we saw how you responded to that. Coach Auriemma remarked yesterday how it was
good for everyone to see that you guys responded in that way. When you were
down at the half against Stanford and you're sitting in that locker room,
could you take us back and what did you see in your teammates' eyes that made
you believe that the next run was coming?  
MAYA MOORE: You know, we weren't satisfied at all with how we were playing. We
knew we hadn't played our best basketball at all. So I don't think there was
ever a doubt in our minds that we could win. It was just a matter of putting
it together and really locking in and focusing on the things that we needed to
do at the time to get it back.  
So it's kind of unfortunate that people on the outside don't get to sometimes
watch our practices, because we're put in those tough situations all the time
by Coach Auriemma where we have to fight back and battle. By the time the
game's come, we feel super confident and really prepared to combat anything
that the other team throws at us.  
  
Q. Kalana, do you have a favorite Geno story? And after five years, you've
seen him now for five years, what do you think it is about him that has made
him a coach that has won six and now potentially seven national
championships?  
KALANA GREENE: He's never complacent. He's never satisfied. He's a competitor.
A lot of people may pat us on the back and say that was good, and he looks at
us and says that's not good enough. He's always looking for the perfect game.  
And he knows it's impossible to become perfect. But every day he strives
towards that. So seeing that every day and everybody thinks you look at the
big picture but he looks at all the small things that make the big picture.
And that's what I think makes him so successful in his profession.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Geno, if you go back to '95, it didn't seem like you and Tara had the
warmest relationship then; there were different things that happened and
Nykesha Sales' remark and everything. But over the years she's spoken very
appreciatively about the way you coach, your style; you've said the same
thing. Could you talk about the evolution of your relationship and also the
fact she was an Olympic coach, you're going to be doing that. Is that also
another way you guys have -- I don't want to necessarily say bonded, but
another thing you can relate about together?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, it's just a matter of people getting older and,
you know, a lot of water passes under the bridge, I guess they say.  
And I think Tara VanDerveer was in somewhat of a difficult situation coaching
the Olympic team. The comment about Nykesha Sales was our first really -- I
mean, the first big-time All-American other than Rebecca. And at the time
Stanford was getting three, four, five All-Americans every year.  
That was neither here nor there. But the Olympic thing, I think, was difficult
because so much of the attention was focused on Rebecca Lobo and national
media and not necessarily on the Olympic team. It wasn't Rebecca's fault and
it wasn't Tara VanDerveer's fault. It was just more people in America in 1995
knew who Rebecca Lobo was instead of Teresa Edwards, let's say, or Jennifer
Azzi or Dawn Staley, because Rebecca came along at a different time and a
different era.  
I think Rebecca paid a price for it. And she shouldn't have had to pay that
price, because it wasn't her fault. But that's over and done with. And I've
always had tremendous respect for Tara as a coach. I really didn't know her
that well as a person, but we spent a lot of time talking over the years. And
it's kind of one of the reasons why this series that we had with them is going
to be a good series for both of us.  
She doesn't shy away from challenges, and neither do I. And I think we each
have a healthy respect for each other as coaches and I think as people.  
And I think she respects how we do our job and the kind of kids we recruit and
the way we run our program. And I certainly feel the same way about them.
They're in some ways a reflection of her, and my team's a reflection of me,
and we all live happily ever after.  
  
Q. Is there one aspect of this matchup based on the first game in December
from your standpoint that you feel is absolutely necessary for you guys to
win, for it to happen? Was it matchup or one aspect of the game? If there is
one, what would it be?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You've got two really, really good offensive teams out there.
Two teams that are not necessarily one-dimensional. And when you have that,
something's gotta give.  
If both teams are able to offensively do whatever they like to do and how they
like to do it and are successful at it, you know, it's a 90-to-87 game, one
way or the other. But I don't know that that's going to happen.  
So whichever team, I think, can defensively force the other team to be
uncomfortable, the way I like to say it, I think that would be, to me, the
biggest matchup.  
I don't think we can guard them and shut them down completely. And I don't
think they can guard us and shut us down completely. So something has to
emerge from the offensive end tomorrow, and I would venture to say, you know,
it's going to be difficult for both teams to find a way to stop the other team
from scoring points.  
  
Q. I understand that after the first Stanford game you pulled Nneka aside
and complimented her on just how much she had improved. Could you expound on
that a little bit after last night and where she is right now?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I really appreciate and I really admire kids who take it
seriously, they take the responsibility of being a college athlete seriously.
I watched her play as a freshman. And then I saw her on film as a sophomore
before we played them in December. And I just thought it was a completely
different player.  
And I admire that, because that means she took her scholarship seriously. She
took the responsibility that was put on her seriously to get better and get
better and get better, and a lot of kids don't do that. They don't. They just
take it for granted or they just expect that it's going to happen without
their having to work at it.  
And I just love everything about the kid, who she is, how she conducts
herself, how she competes. I can't say enough about her, really.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about how Maya kind of symbolizes your ability to
recruit the South and the importance of recruiting the South?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We haven't had a lot of players from down that way. It's only
been in the last couple of years that we've had a lot of success. Maya and
Tiffany are probably the two more prominent players from down that way.  
I think when you have a certain kind of kid who isn't confined by family
situations or just fear of leaving home and they want to be exposed to the
highest level, you know, you have a chance with those kids.  
I would say Tiffany and Maya were probably two of the easier recruiting
efforts that we had to actually put in, because I think they knew what they
wanted. So it wasn't almost like we went down there and convinced them or
cajoled them to come to Connecticut. I think both of them understood this is
where I want to be. This is where I need to be to satisfy my own self and my
curiosity and how I want to be challenged.  
It's not easy down there -- down here. Out this way it's impossible. Forget
it. There's no way you're getting a kid from down here to go to Connecticut.
It's easier for me to get a Russian kid, which I have (laughter).  
But, yeah, the right kids, they'll go anywhere if it's the right situation.
And we've been fortunate with those two, no question.  
  
Q. We heard Kalana talk a little bit about your strong suits as a coach. And
I guess it's your drive in getting these kids to focus on those little things.
Now that you're on the threshold of a perfect season in history, does
perfection become a moving target still, or will you be satisfied with that
perfect season, even if there's some imperfections in how you won the game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, this whole -- I think sometimes the whole perfect
thing gets bandied around and it means different things to different people,
you know?  
The only thing I've ever tried to impress upon my players is there's a certain
amount of perfection in your effort. The perfection, I don't think, lies in
what the outcome is. There's a certain effort that requires a certain amount
of perfection; that you're looking for the perfect way to consistently have
that effort.  
That at the end of 40 minutes, if your effort was unwavering and your
commitment during that game or during that practice was unwavering and you
never ever took a step back, lost your concentration or just decided I don't
feel like it or for whatever reason didn't have that same commitment to every
possession, I don't care about the outcome, and I think sometimes that gets
lost.  
I said this last night. We ran a couple of plays for Maya. She absolutely
executed those things perfectly. Whether the shot went in or not, there's no
complaining about that, because there's no way you can control that. But I can
control how she uses that screen, how she sets that screen, how she makes that
cut. That's what I'm talking about in chasing that perfection thing.  
Once she gets the ball in her hands, if it goes in, it goes in. If it doesn't
go in, it doesn't go in. Like the 3 she air-balled. She did everything right
and it was an air ball. So you can't worry about what happened after you do
everything right.  
So I don't want people to think that tomorrow the only thing that's acceptable
is absolutely no mistakes, absolutely a perfect game, we shoot 60 percent from
the floor and we hold them to 40 points and we win 90 to 40. That's not my
definition of things. I want our effort tomorrow to be perfect.  
  
Q. I think I remember correctly, you took blame for the Stanford first half
thing, running the wrong defense. Can you talk about the defensive effort? You
said before how offense -- everyone loves a 90-87 game, but realistically
that's not going to happen. And you guys have been shutting everyone down.
What is the difference in the defense you guys have in the last five games?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It comes down to matchups, too. Stanford's a difficult matchup
for us. I think any team -- and we're a difficult matchup for most people. I
think any team that has some versatility in their offense and can get you from
a couple different spots on the floor, it's hard.  
You can't defend everything. Defending Baylor is one thing because you know
what their strengths are, what their weaknesses are, and you can kind of play
the percentages.  
But when you're playing a team like Stanford, there's less weaknesses that you
can attack on your own defense. So it makes the challenge a little greater.
The first game, what I was alluding to was -- Maya didn't answer the question.
I forget who asked Maya about the first game and Stanford. That's why I was
telling Kalana, I said: Do you ever think she would say, Well, we were up 19
to 9 and then I was a dumb-ass and got my second foul and I had to sit and
then they tied it up, so I'm going to try not to get my second foul in the
first seven minutes of the game?  
But Maya is not going to say that. But the other four guys knew that's what
happened.  
So a lot of it is your defense is dictated by who you have on the floor. So if
we've got the right guys on the floor, and we're not in foul trouble, we can
play a certain kind of defense. We can get out and pressure more, change
defenses more and take more chances.  
But all of a sudden we were limited in that game so we had to play a certain
kind of defense that wasn't conducive for us. In the second half, we could
come out and play the way we wanted to play and defend the way we wanted to
defend and it changed the game.  
We could do the exact same thing tomorrow and it wouldn't work. But that day
it did. Tomorrow it might be something completely different. Tomorrow the
defense we played in the first half, which didn't work, might work great.  
That's the beauty of every game. That's the beauty of every game. You go out
there and this is what we're going to do. And they pick it apart. You go, all
right, time to change.  
That's why I get the big bucks, man (laughter). I said that 100 times.  
  
Q. Along that line, Tara is known as a pretty meticulous scout. How well
prepared do you expect them to be for your team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I mean, it's Stanford. They probably study all the time
(laughter). They're great at reading books and figuring stuff out, and that's
one of their strengths, I think. It's one of Tara's great strengths is they
are disciplined. They are meticulous. They do execute. They're precise in what
they do. No question about that.  
And I would think that after having played us now -- this is the third year in
a row in the Final Four and third year in a row -- second out of three years
that we played in the regular season, I think. I lose track sometimes.  
And they've seen us at our best and they've seen us at our worst. They've seen
us at full strength in St. Thomas where we blew them out and they've seen us
missing two starters in the Final Four. So I don't think there's any scenario
that they're not going to be prepared for come tomorrow night.  
When did they play, Monday or Tuesday last week?  
  
Q. Monday.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Another team that has an extra day of rest (laughter).  
  
Q. For the first time in a long time it seems, to borrow a fighter's
analogy, you guys got punched back against the ropes last night. I mean, you
talk all season long about this team's determination, their resolve. But to
see it actually when it had to have happened, when they had to come back and
punch themselves off the ropes and come back and take over, how gratifying was
that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, extremely. We know we had that in us, but you don't know
until you have to show it. One of the quirks of the NCAA tournament, the way
it played out, there's nothing you can do about this. Baylor played Monday
night. We played Tuesday night. They go home and they've got an hour bus ride
and we have to fly four hours here with one day less to prepare and we're
playing, and that's just a quirk. It's just the way it happened.  
And then we get two guys in foul trouble. We're zigging and zagging. And I
think all those things give you a chance to prove something to yourself that
you maybe don't have an opportunity to prove.  
And that's why I think last night, in the locker room, there was a different
look on the kids' faces. They were like, yeah, that's that was really good
because it was a tough week and it was a tough game and they were tough
circumstances.  
When you're a competitor, those are the kind of situations you love to find
yourself in. Because you're tested under fire a lot of times. And we haven't
been under fire enough. And yesterday was good. Yesterday was really good.  
  
Q. Coach, easy question and then maybe a little tougher one. Tara said
before that she hopes the series continues past the Palo Alto game next year.
You've got two California kids coming in as freshmen. I'm wondering what your
thoughts are about that. Secondly, you always tell us how you feel about
things. You're always very honest and you usually say them in a manner that's
very direct and entertaining. I'm wondering if you ever worry about how your
words are perceived nationally by the other coaches that hear you speak?
Especially the sound bites on ESPN. I'm talking about yesterday what you said
to Mark about the competition and, you know, if you were 38-0 again next March
that you were going to leave the game. Do you think you make more enemies by
saying things like that, or are you even concerned about that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I don't think why -- why would I make an enemy out of
somebody if I said that I think there are teams out there good enough to beat
us. I would think that's a sign of respect for the other teams; that they're
really good and I would expect us to lose because we're playing really good
teams.  
I've always been one to think, you know, you need to just get up in the
morning and think about your own team, what do you have to do to make
yourselves better, how can I prepare my team better, how can I recruit better,
how can I coach better, organize my staff better and all that.  
If you're spending five minutes, five seconds worrying about what Geno
Auriemma says, then you lost already. I mean, that's the way I look at it. I
say things that I think are meant to -- I never disrespect the other coaches
or the other teams. And never have and never will.  
And there's a lot of people out there that, for whatever reason, worry too
much about what other people say. I've never been one to worry about it. I
laugh at it. I think it's pretty funny. I kind of look forward to it.  
And people rile me up thinking that I'm going to say something and do
something that's going to be crazy. And they don't realize that I'm not like
that anymore. I'm gentle and kind and lovable (laughter).  
But they keep bringing me stuff. Somebody brought something into the locker
room last night before the game; that Kim said that she hoped Brittney would
dunk on Tina and that I would lose my mind on the sidelines.  
So the kids all read it and -- because you have to understand something: I'm
not like an Internet guy. I don't read blogs or chat rooms. So I don't know
what's going on in the real world. I've said this before: If it's not in the
newspaper or not on ESPN, I don't know that it existed, to be honest with you,
because I don't do that kind of stuff.  
I don't know what people are saying or thinking or any of that. I know
nothing. I'm Sergeant Schultz. And I know absolutely nothing when it comes to
that kind of stuff.  
So when people bring me this stuff, I'm just -- I get a kick out of it. I
laugh. And my players get a kick out of it. They think it's pretty funny.  
Kim made a comment about Georgetown was the second-best team in the Big East
and they would finish like eighth in the Big 12 or something. And our kids get
a kick out of that, because we beat the second-place team in the Big 12 by 40.  
  
Q. Are you ignoring my question about Stanford?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We're going to play Stanford just like everybody else. As long
as Tara wants to play, we'll play them. We'll play. We'll play all the good
teams as long as they want to play us. We've never taken a phone call from a
really good program and said no. And that will never happen. Anybody that
wants to play us, as long as we can get a date, we're playing you.  
  
Q. You and Tara are about the same age. She talked about growing up, no high
school team for girls and she'd go to the Y and play against guys and stuff.
Your situation was different. You came in at age eight from Italy. What was
your introduction to basketball? Did you know anything about it when you got
here? And wasn't there a story when you were in high school you were signing
your own report card so you could keep playing or something like that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Come on, you're making me sound like a dummy. Just because I
took advantage of the fact my parents can't read and write, come on. You're
supposed to figure that stuff out when you're a kid, aren't you? I showed them
my report cards. I told them they were really good (laughter). I said A means
awful. C means really cool. I took advantage of the situation.  
My mother told me that I used to walk a couple miles when I was a kid in
Italy, four, five years old, to this playground. There were a lot of
servicemen in Italy. They had a basketball court set up. I would go watch
basketball games. She said I was just fascinated by it.  
So maybe it was just always in there, you know? And when I came to this
country, the first thing I fell in love with was baseball. I had never seen a
baseball game. I was just fascinated by it and played it every single day of
my life if I could, still would play today if I could.  
But had to do something in the wintertime. And I got cut all the time until I
got to high school and some reason or another I made the team, I played,
enjoyed it. And just kind of always had an eye for it, you know? Like I saw
it.  
Like my daughter's an actress. You can't teach that. It's in you. Or a
musician. It's in you. You can read all the books you want, read all the
manuals you want, go to all the clinics you want, but if it's not in you, if
it's not a part of who you are, it's just hard to be good at it. It's really
hard to be good at it.  
My daughter's music teacher got mad at me one time because I wasn't making my
daughter play the piano with notes. I said: If you don't start reading notes,
I'm going to stop taking you to piano lessons. And she closed her eyes and she
said: Dad, watch. She played this one tune and she said: That's talent.  
What the hell am I going to say to that (laughter)?  
  
Q. Throughout this whole 77 games, whatever, it's always been about the
goal, not the streak, the championship. Has that been something that's been
hard for you to get across to them? Have they been able to do it on their own?
And is some of the talk about the streak kind of helped them focus on the goal
and not the streak?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I heard -- it was funny. I heard Kalana Greene answer that
question one time. And I thought she gave the best answer of anybody that's
been asked that question. And I think her answer was something to the effect:
You know, when I sign a letter of intent to come to Connecticut, I didn't come
to win 70 in a row. I came to win national championships.  
So that kind of mentality is where our team is, and it's always been about
what do we have to do to win the regular season championship in the Big East
or the tournament championship, or win the first round. It's never been
discussed at all, the numbers.  
I talked about it one time, to be honest with you. After we got to 70 or 71, I
said, hey, what you guys have done has been really, really good. It's
something you all should be really proud of. But those 71 don't mean anything
unless we win six in a row in a couple of weeks.  
So we haven't talked about it. I don't know if they talk about it among
themselves. I don't know what they're doing. I don't know how they do it. But
whatever they're doing, I hope they keep doing it.  
  
Q. You know Jayne Appel's game pretty well. What do you see as far as the
ankle and how it's impacted her in the last few weeks?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think at this time of the year, now, this weekend, I don't
think there's anything that's going to keep you from playing and playing as
well as you can. Everybody's hurt at this time of the year. Everybody's sore.
There's something going on in everybody's body.  
When Jayne's 100 percent, I don't think there's anybody who works as hard as
she does. I shouldn't say -- who works harder than she does. I think her
ability to score with both hands and she's a terrific passer and she runs the
floor great.  
I do think it's going to be crucial, that matchup between her and Tina, like
it always is. I don't think her -- whatever limits she may have ankle-wise, I
don't think they're going to be an issue tomorrow night. But that might be one
reason why Nneka's just exploded, you know? Maybe she's getting more
opportunities because of that.  
  
Q. Two-part question. Eleven Final Four, I believe eight different cities.
Your favorite, for whatever reasons why? And, secondly, like tough love with
your children, you've always gotten the most out of your players. And Tina was
someone who came here with loads of talent, but you could see early on that
she needed to be challenged. And you've certainly gotten the most out of her.
How are you able to do that with your players?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Some players you can't. I mean, I've tried that same thing
with other players and just didn't get anywhere with it. I think all the
credit goes to Tina and how hard she's been willing to work, and never backed
down and has always come back for more, above and beyond anything that you
would think a person would want to do.  
She's a pleaser. And kids who want to please, who want to do well, who have
certain goals, they're going to take whatever you throw at them and come back
and come back. They just have to learn how to. It's not that they don't want
to. They just have to learn how to.  
And that's been Tina's biggest strength. I think she wants to. She just needed
to learn how to do it and keep doing it the same way.  
There's some kids, they say it, but they don't really want to. With those kids
you can't get anywhere. You try and you try and you try, but you don't get
anywhere with them.  
  
Q. And favorite Final Four site?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Favorite Final Four site. Minneapolis. Philadelphia. San
Antonio. St. Louis. New Orleans. Atlanta.  
Philadelphia was my finest, because it was home. All my friends, my family,
everybody was there. That was 1.  
This is 1-A. This is a great town. I wish they could have it here every year.
I really do. I think the fans have the best experience here. I think the teams
have the best experience here.  
The people here do a phenomenal job of hosting the event. I don't think
anybody in the coaching community or in the same community would be
disappointed if San Antonio had the Final Four every single year. I just wish
our hotel bar would stay open later. Somebody call them.  
  
Q. During this run you've had you've played the same teams numerous teams:
Notre Dame, teams in the Big East, Louisville three times. It seems every time
you play a team the second time or third time, you make it a worst beating on
them and you beat them by more. Is there something to that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's putting me in a bad spot right now. I think it comes
down to the players and the matchup and what it is. And Louisville and
Connecticut is just a bad matchup last year for Louisville.  
There are some advantages and some disadvantages for playing somebody twice on
both sides. Don't get me wrong. On both sides. They're playing us, and they
know they lost and it got away from them badly in the second half. They know
they played us and they were up at halftime and pretty much could do what they
wanted. And the same goes for us.  
We know we played great in the second half. And hopefully we can do that
again. We also know that we couldn't stop them in the first half.  
So we learned some things about each other that can help us and also worry us
tremendously. That's why I kind of like playing teams for the very first time.
Like yesterday's game. They didn't know that much about us. And we didn't know
much about them. I like that matchup a lot better than playing somebody for
the second time or the third time.  
  
Q. This Stanford-UConn rivalry has been a little strange because one team
seems to dominate the other. This game is down to the wire with the national
championship on the line with two best teams in the country. What would that
mean, you think, in the big picture? There's been a lot of talk about you're
good or bad for the game. What would that mean for this game to have -- the
game between the two best teams in the country?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think that's the hope of everybody every NCAA game. I think
everybody that turns on the television, everybody that's at an event in the
NCAA tournament, I think that's their secret wish; that somebody makes a shot
as time's running out. Somebody drives the length of the court, like Jeanette
Pohlen did, and makes a layup and you win and you go to the Final Four.  
I think that's every kid's dream and every coach's dream, or nightmare if
you're on the other end. And every fan loves that kind of an ending. It's what
makes sports so exciting.  
We haven't made it very exciting, I guess. Our players were saying, man, our
fans were really quiet. Did you hear that Baylor crowd? They were really loud.
It wasn't just Baylor. All the Stanford people were jumping up and down hoping
that Baylor would win.  
So it's what everybody wants. And I think it would be pretty neat to be in
that kind of a game, as a coach, as a player, for the fans. I bet you that was
a pretty highly viewed game last night. I don't know the numbers. I don't know
any statistics. But I bet a lot of people tuned into that game last night.  
And when Baylor cut it to 3, they were pretty excited about it. So I think
that's what people want. And hopefully they'll get that. Not (laughter).  
  
Q. You're 6-and-0 in this game.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Like that means anything.  
  
Q. I think there's only one other coach in the history of sports who can say
that he or she has never lost this game in at least that many tries, right?
John Wooden. I think that's it. The kids come and go. You stay. And you always
play well in this game. Why?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, my president and my AD are here; you ought to tell
them that and explain to them exactly what you just said to me. I would like
that.  
And I wish I could give you an answer for that other than I always, always
thought that whenever we made it to this game we were the best team.  
There was never a time when we played in this game that we were the underdog.
Now, we may have been. I don't know. But I always thought we were the best
team; that if we could get to this game that we were the best team because we
would have proved it along the way.  
And then it was my job to just make sure we played like the best team. I have
never been in this game -- well, maybe just in Philadelphia -- I think
Philadelphia was the only time. I don't think I've ever coached a game in this
game -- a team in this game where we didn't have the best player in if
country, except maybe Philadelphia.  
So that's a lot -- go ahead. You're thinking. Go ahead.  
  
Q. Who would have been the best player in 2000?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I said other than Philadelphia. Other than Philadelphia, that
might have been the only time when we didn't have the Player of the Year on
our team.  
  
Q. I'm saying who was it?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't know. I know it wasn't Sue or Swin or any of those
guys. Catchings, maybe. I don't know. But that may have been the only time.  
So as much as I would love to say it's because of me, I've always brought with
me the best player, the best team. And that, believe me, is 90 percent of the
whole thing. You know?  
Most of the time that's what you need. You can't fool anybody in the final
game. There's no trickery going on tomorrow. There's no secret stuff. There's
no great strategy that's going to win tomorrow's game. Tomorrow's game is
going to be won by the best players.  
I've always thought that. I've always, always thought that. You can have a
great system of play. You can have a great style of play, and our style of
play and our system and our culture is pretty much designed to get us to the
Sweet 16.  
I would like to think that year in and year out, the way we operate can get us
to Sweet 16 and we've done that on a regular basis. But from that point on,
there's going to be a player, or two if you're fortunate, that's going to
decide in those two games and the next two games that we're going to win.  
And I've always been fortunate to have that.  
  
Q. Why do you think you saw basketball so well? Was it having grown up
watching and knowing soccer, or --  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think that's a big part of it. That's a big part. The next
pass, the next pass, the next pass. That's why our team passes the ball so
much, maybe. I've always been fascinated by the pass.  
And I think growing up as a kid, that's what soccer is. I love recruiting
soccer players. Kids who played soccer in high school are really good
basketball players. Because they see that the goal that that guy's going to
have comes from the pass I'm going to make to you.  
And very few kids see that. Very few kids see that. I loved the Edmonton
Oilers when they played hockey. How could you not love that? I'm just
fascinated by the pass. I don't know why. I just think it's so cool.  
And you just don't see it very often anymore. And Stanford's a very good
passing team. I hate playing against teams that are good passing teams. I love
teams that don't pass the ball. I love playing against them (laughter). You're
not doing anything; you just have to stand there and let them self-destruct.  
But teams that really pass the ball well, man, they're hard to play against.
Really hard to play against. I love recruiting players that love to pass.
There's very few players that play for me if you're not a good passer. And I
think that explains a lot of why we have good teams year after year after
year. There's tremendous value in our program put on passing the ball.  
  
Q. Tomorrow is Jayne Appel's last game in a Stanford jersey, speaking of
passing. You recruited her. What do you think her legacy is when she leaves?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Certainly her legacy will be enhanced a thousand percent if
they win tomorrow night. Because every kid would love to see themselves as
national champions. And there's nothing greater than winning the last game of
your college career and riding off into the sunset, winning a national
championship.  
But short of that, I think what she's done for Stanford is put them -- not
single-handedly, don't get me wrong, because I think they're a big enough
program -- but I think she's helped put them back into the limelight where I
think they had not been there for a couple of years.  
I think when she came in with that group that she's in there with right now,
and Candice Wiggins, who left, I think they put Stanford back into that
national championship picture. And that's something to be proud of and to
always take with you.  
I knew when I was recruiting her out of high school she was going to be a
great center, great basketball player, because, again, skilled with both hands
and terrific passer, competitor. Tough kid.  
They're the kind of kids that leave college feeling pretty satisfied. Pretty
fulfilled. And I think tomorrow night, if they were to win, would be the
ultimate for her. And I'm not saying she needs that, but I think that would
pretty much put it over the edge.  
  
Q. Do you see similarities in the two back courts? They aren't necessarily
the first, second, even third options, but when they need to, they seem to
have the ability, the tough-as-nails, gritty-type player that can make the
plays on both ends of the court. And do you see your back court and Stanford
in the same realm?  
COACH AURIEMMA: There's a couple of differences. This is Caroline's first NCAA
tournament. You know? I don't think they have anybody in their back court that
this is their first NCAA tournament. This is their third national championship
game in a row.  
Two out of three, right? So their back court is a little more experienced than
ours. Our kids are young. And I think the other big difference is their guards
don't fall down. Tiffany falls down every possession (laughter).  
So they have a huge advantage, because their kids stay on their feet. They
don't shoot as many air balls as my guys do. They don't foul as much as my
guys do. They're pretty solid in the back court.  
But whichever back court makes the most shots tomorrow could be the difference
in the game. I agree with that 100 percent.  
Caroline's like: You gotta put yesterday behind us; we're going forward. When
I came into pregame today -- I mean breakfast this morning, she was like this,
head down on the table, half asleep, half -- probably all those bricks running
around in her head. Because she's a competitor, you know?  
And that's why I don't feel bad about tomorrow. Caroline and Tiffany are going
to make shots tomorrow. Put it in the book. They're going to make shots
tomorrow. Or they're going to fall down trying or foul out. One or the other.  
You know what, good players don't foul out. You don't want a player that fouls
out or plays with four fouls. That's how you can tell a really good player. So
next time you're watching a game in there, just think, you know what, that
guy's a really good player. Why? They don't foul. They don't foul.  
Because when you foul, you have to sit on the bench. How can you be a good
player if you're sitting on the bench with fouls? Good players don't foul.  
Maya is a different breed. Maya swears she doesn't foul, so that probably
helps her. She doesn't know why she's on the bench. You have two fouls. No, I
don't. That wasn't me. It says it right up there on the board, Maya. No. 23,
two fouls. Good players don't foul.  
  
Q. I maybe stirring up a hornet's nest, but I'll try anyway. You go back to
'93 with Swoopes and you could almost make the argument from that point
forward that by and large the team that's won the championship each year from
then forward has had the best player. What does that say? I mean, you couldn't
say that in the men's game. I don't think anybody would argue that Butler,
Duke, West Virginia or Michigan State has the best player in that Final Four.
What do you think it says about this game and when does that change?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Never. It's not supposed to change. The best players are
supposed to win a national championship. And the best team is supposed to have
the best players.  
Now, the reason why it doesn't happen on the men's side is because the best
player is a freshman and then he leaves. So he's not ready to win a national
championship, a lot of times. So Duke, Butler don't need the best player. The
best player is John Wall, everybody says. But he's not experienced enough,
mature enough to win a national championship. So he's out of the tournament
and the two best teams are playing for the national championship.  
And that's the way it is in women's basketball, generally. The two best teams
are generally left standing and they happen to have the best players. That's
why they're the best teams.  
So we probably wouldn't be here this year if we had the same rule as the guys
have that you can leave. Because Maya and Tina would be gone. So in women's
basketball, the one cool thing about it is you're always going to see the best
teams playing in the Final Four. Because we always have the best players.  
Is that going to change? It might. It's happened before. And it will happen
again. If you said that Oklahoma was going to be in the Final Four, nobody
would have believed that at the beginning of the season. So it's going to
happen probably more often.  
But it will never be like the guys where you're going to get four teams that
don't have a First Team All-American coming to the Final Four. That's not
going to happen. But on the guys, that's going to happen every year. Because
as soon as a guy's really good, out. Carmelo Anthony. One of those things.  
That's why it's hard on the men's side in some ways. But in other ways, it may
not be that hard, because you're not always playing against the best teams.
You know, people talk about there's upsets along the way. Yeah, which means
that now if you're a really good team you're not playing another really good
team. You're playing somebody that upset the really good team. And so you've
got a lot of that. Women's basketball, you're going to have to beat the best
teams generally all the time to get where you're going.  
It's just a different dynamic, different dynamic. But I would be surprised if
Baylor and Brittney Griner, for instance, aren't in the Final Four the next
three years. She's probably going to be the best player. If we're here again
next year, it's because Maya was the best player in the country again.  
I just don't see that changing until, if ever, they change the rule, which I
don't think they ever will. Nor should they. If Tina or Maya play in the WNBA
from sophomore year on, I think the game of basketball, women's basketball
wouldn't be as good. I think it's good right now because the best players stay
for four years. And I think the guys' game is good because they leave. It
might not make a lot of sense, but it does make a lot of sense.  
  
Q. Just maybe to follow up on that. You've been heard to say I guess on the
"Outside Lines" report that one time it came out earlier -- I saw it in Dayton
-- you were talking about how maybe your career would be somehow fulfilled if
you went on the men's side and did what you're doing now. Do you look at that
in terms of a different challenge if you were to ever consider that? And there
are a lot of men's jobs open right now. And it's been reported that the Nets
are going to offer Mike Krzyzewski 15 to 12 mill, and you've said that --   
COACH AURIEMMA: Is that a year or total?  
  
Q. A year.  
COACH AURIEMMA: A year. That opens up the Duke job, huh?  
  
Q. There's also the Boston College job. Mike DiMauro wants you to consider
that one, too.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure.  
  
Q. Your thoughts, though?  
COACH AURIEMMA: We win 30 games every year and I'm going to go someplace where
I'm going to get killed.  
  
Q. A challenge?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, it's a challenge. I'm 56. I like the challenge that I
have right now.  
I said this to somebody else: I think in every person there's always this
thought of what about that. I mean, if you're a high school coach -- I know
some great high school coaches on the men's side and the women's side who are
struggling with that decision: Should I stay where I am because I'm really,
really good but I really want to take a shot at a college assistant's job and
maybe get a college job, men's or women's? And I know a ton of college coaches
on the men's side, especially, that would just give their right arm to coach
in the NBA.  
It's just -- you know, there's always that other thing that seems like people
want to try to experience. And I probably had that in me for the longest time.
Like anybody else would. Like anybody else would. I just have one huge
advantage over everybody else. I never had to make that decision because
nobody ever asked me.  
So I don't know what I would have done years ago if that opportunity ever came
along when I was young. So I've given a lot to this game on the women's side.
This game has given me more than I probably have ever given it. And I'm not
looking for any change or any other challenge than the challenge that I have
in front of me right now.  
Unless Mike called me and said he would give me 2 million a year to be his
assistant with the Nets because that's the greatest job in the history of
sports, being an assistant NBA coach. I may have the best job in all of
sports. But I'll tell you what, you gotta be pretty hard to find a better job,
an assistant in the NBA to a great guy.  
You get up. You go to practice. You're working with the best players. Watching
film. Doing individual work. Go to the game. Trying to figure out how to beat
these guys that are great. Game's over. No media. No press conference. Nobody
asking you why you suck.  
Go out to dinner. Nice glass of wine, go home and do it again the next day.
Come on, that's like dying and going to heaven.  
  
Q. If he calls and says come to the Nets?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Two million (laughter).  
Not taking it for any less. You hear that, Mike? Two million.  
  
Q. For all who were here, not watching ESPN yesterday, what did you say to
that guy about leaving, and was it a joke they didn't get? Or what happened
there?  
COACH AURIEMMA: What guy?  
  
Q. What John asked you about a while ago, said you would leave or something
if you were undefeated next year and they didn't get the joke?  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, I didn't say that. I didn't say that. People keep wanting
me to talk about next season. Man, if you win tomorrow and you're only ten
away from ADA, you know, I said: You're out of your mind. Really out of your
mind.  
That's when I made the comment that we play eight out of our 11 nonconference
games before January 1st, and they were all at one time in the top 15 in the
country this year.  
And if we can get through that kind of schedule with five freshmen, it's not
going to happen. It's not. If it does happen, I'll quit right there on the
spot. February 1st. I'll walk away. I said this -- I can't do this anymore.
Sorry.  
  
Q. I was going to follow him up and say so we tell Blazejowski that next
year when New York is open you've got no interest in coaching the Liberty in
New York --  
COACH AURIEMMA: No, 2 million minimum. I'm not leaving from Connecticut for
anything less than 2 million, plus a car, a driver, a house. Not moving. My
own personal publicist. Otherwise I'm staying right where I am.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'm pleased to introduce Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer,
as well as student-athletes Rosalyn Gold-Onwude, Jeanette Pohlen, Kayla
Pedersen, Nnemkadi Ogwumike and Jayne Appel.  
COACH VANDERVEER: We're thrilled to be playing in the championship game, and I
feel that our team is -- we will be ready. Our team is confident and at this
point I think having played the very tough schedule that we played it will
really pay off for us. So we'll have a productive day today. Our team has been
very focused and get ready for great game tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. I'd like to hear a couple of your favorite Tara stories, dealing with her
coaching intensity, coaching skill, whatever. Anybody who has a couple
favorite stories, I'd love to hear them.  
JAYNE APPEL: I think it may not come off at first, but how fun she is in
practice. We joke around with her all the time. I think my favorite thing to
get on her about is her Diet Coke. It's like my mother's coffee in the morning
to her. But we love her for it, so...  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Even though I've only been here a few years I've had a
terrific experience with Tara. She kind of highlighted one in practice the
other day when we were practicing. It was our last practice at Maples and she
had one of my favorite quotes. She said -- she said it to Kayla, I think. She
said, Kayla, sometimes you're the dog and sometimes you're the hydrant
(laughter).  
And so I forgot about that one, but she definitely -- she's really great.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, I remember her telling me one time -- Jayne and I were
both missing layups, but kind of to each other, she's like, It's all right;
keep playing Ping-Pong off the backboard. Implying she didn't want us to make
the layup. So that was pretty funny.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: I think one thing about Tara is she'll be the first one to
joke on you in front of everybody. So it's like, you know, some of it is kind
of true and stuff, but she keeps joking on you to kind of get her point across
so that you're even more embarrassed about something.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Tara is also kind of a jack-of-all-trades. You always kind of
randomly hear about Tara being somewhere or advocating for something. Two
examples would be you may not know she was actually in Cosmopolitan magazine
in an article and she was giving love advice (laughter) for how to catch that
male or female athlete of your choice.  
And another thing, Tara has been in another magazine as top -- what was it?
Best dressed coach? Does anybody remember exactly what it was? She was on
Forbes List for best dressed professionals or something. She made it
(laughter). It might have been the New York Times, she said.  
  
Q. For any of the players, this is where you wanted to be. Here we are the
day before the national championship game. I asked Tara last night, if you
think the last couple of games have been a little bit hairy, now that you're
here, can you guys just relax and play now that you've gotten to where you
wanted to go?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, this is what we've been talking about all year.
This is what we've been working for. And I would have to say it's definitely
kind of just a little bit of weight lifted off of our shoulders, knowing that
we've played as many games as we could possibly play.  
And now it's just to leave everything out, everything that we've worked for in
the season, just to leave it all out tomorrow night, and I'm really excited
that we made it this far, especially with the team that I'm on this year. I
don't think it could have been any better.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Yeah, I think there's not as much pressure anymore to get to
the national championship game. And we're all really excited to be able to
play one more game and go as far as we can in the tournament. That was our
ultimate goal. We didn't want to end our season early. We didn't want to end
our season early with a loss. So it's exciting to be able to get another shot
at UConn. And like Nneka said, put it all out there.  
  
Q. I'd like to ask each of you, or whoever wants to tackle this, what ways
are you different or better as a team than you were when the last time you
played Connecticut? Is it better press, better defense? In what ways are you
different than the last time you faced Connecticut?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: I think we're playing more consistently throughout each half.
I think that we now understand how to attack pressure, and the value of every
possession now. We don't want any empty possessions. We want to capitalize on
everything that they do. And I think we're more fresh. So I think we're just
kind of rejuvenated and just ready to go.  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I think at this point of the season it's not only the
players that are better equipped to handle UConn, but our coaches as well. I
think scouting at that point, there were so few games coming into it, UConn
hadn't really sculpted their idea. They had question marks, too, and both of
us were coming into it undefeated. I think now, after watching other people
play, we can figure out what will make us successful.  
  
Q. Jayne?  
JAYNE APPEL: I kind of agree with both of them. I think it really will help us
having only played one game in the past week and not three. I also think that
it will be different in the sense we've really learned. We watched our worst
moments in basketball. That's what we focused on. We watched our highlights
after the game, then after that we pick apart everything we did wrong from
physically to mentally.  
And that goes from player 1 to player 15. So I think that as a team as a whole
we've just really learned from our mistakes and hopefully we'll be able to
continue to improve on them in tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. For any of the players, kind of building on that last question. Tara
mentioned about how confident the team feels now. How much of is that based on
the fact that you played Connecticut in December and played them very
competitively and you have that body of work taking into this game tomorrow?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Are you talking about confidence in tomorrow?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Well, I mean, it's always good to be able to play a team
before you play them just to know their tendencies and what they like to do. I
wouldn't say that -- I mean, I guess statistically and scout-wise speaking, we
are confident in the fact that we've played them. But I think most of our
confidence comes from what we've learned over the course of the game since
then, whether it be on or off the court.  
We've definitely been put into several different -- I think we've been put
into almost every situation possible in a game. And I'm glad that we have that
experience. And when it comes to crunch time, we really know what to do.  
But I think the confidence right now lies within us. And kind of the dynamics
of us as teammates kind of as a sisterhood together, that's kind of lighting
the fire and pushing everybody to their limit.  
  
Q. I'd like to address this to Jeanette and Ros. None of the teams shot the
3-point well last night. I think it's 16 percent for all four teams. I wonder,
could you all talk about the dome, the impact, the different way it looks, was
it maybe the situation? And how big do you think 3-point shooting might be in
the matchup tomorrow night? Connecticut didn't shoot the 3 well either. Both
the 3-point shooting and perimeter scoring for both teams tomorrow?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I actually didn't even consider the dome as a factor. I
actually felt in shoot-around that all the guards were shooting pretty well.  
Personally -- I get this from my mom; I'm a little weird and superstitious
sometimes, the weird stuff -- sometimes I think there's a certain number of
made 3s out there and if you used them all last night they wouldn't happen
tomorrow. So we didn't use them. So I feel like maybe they'll all be put to
use tomorrow. And I feel like for a lot of our teammates 3s are contagious. I
know for me, and I'm not sure about Jeanette, but you hit one and it really
opens up the basket.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Yeah. And I don't really think any four of the teams that
played last night are exactly known for 3-point shooting. Most of the teams
have somebody inside or somebody that can drive and are really looking to get
the ball inside, and so I think that's one of the reasons why we came out on
top as far as the win, and UConn as well, because even if we're having a bad
shooting night, we can really score inside and dominate.  
  
Q. Jayne, you said you go over the things that you've done poorly in a game.
With that in mind, Connecticut's the only game you lost this year; how much
have you reviewed that game, referenced it, when trying to figure out things
you shouldn't do as a team the rest of the season? Have you watched the tape
again since December? And if all of you can talk about that, that would be
great.  
JAYNE APPEL: We watched it this morning I think for the first time kind of
since the game really cut up and focusing on them, and so I think we've kind
of -- although we haven't looked ahead, we've been working ahead. So I think
we'll be ready to come out and compete tomorrow night and really capitalize on
what we kind of had lapses in the last game with them.  
  
Q. (Question off microphone)?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think we saw a certain number of plays, in specifically the
second half, where we kind of just assumed they were going to make some of the
layups or didn't box out and not gave up on the play but weren't fully into
the play.  
And they capitalized on a lot of those missed layups. They were right there
for the offensive rebounds, and there were a few loose balls that they got. So
those are all things that we can fix. And that's where it comes down to
effort, and we know that we can really show that we can make a better effort.  
  
Q. It's been described as Connecticut's dominated for two years. They have
that long streak. It's been described as UConn and everybody else. You have a
history with them. You're the last team that have beaten them. How bad are you
itchin' to play them again?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I was talking with family friends and someone actually
said to me, you know, when the game got close between Baylor and UConn, I kind
of wanted to see UConn win because I wanted you guys to face them and have the
chance to avenge that loss and also say that if you did win, it was against
what people are calling now maybe one of the most dominant UConn teams ever.  
And I think it's fitting and exciting that we're going to see them again. And
I really don't know what else to say besides that. Like I'm ready to go out.
Whoever ended up winning, I'm ready to see.  
  
Q. Nneka, could you talk about what Ros was referring to, that moment when
Baylor got within 3. Did you learn something about Connecticut and the way
they responded? Because it seemed like it was the first time in this
tournament they had been challenged. And could you also speak to the impact
that Maya Moore had. She described your game having watched it as having been
a terrific impact, but can you just comment on that?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Well, I mean, first of all, Maya Moore is a phenomenal
player and athlete. And I was grateful that she complimented me. The least I
can do is compliment her. She's a huge asset for their team.  
But in regards to how UConn responded to I guess the closeness of the game,
when Baylor got them, I think it was within 3, I mean, they stayed composed
and they took care of the ball and kind of reflected how we handled
yesterday's game even.  
I think when good teams get into situations like that, they know not to panic.
And, quite frankly, I think that's something that we both kind of shared with
UConn. And I think they handled themselves very well. They didn't panic. They
didn't start throwing the ball away.  
But I'd also have to give credit to Baylor for giving them somewhat of a game
in the beginning of the second half. Baylor is a talented team and everyone is
going to want to play you their hardest. Oklahoma showed us that yesterday.
And so kudos to those teams as well.  
  
Q. Jayne, how well do you know Tina Charles? Can you sort of assess the
matchup tomorrow? And what do you see as her strengths?  
JAYNE APPEL: I know her very well. She's one of my great basketball friends.
And I think that competing against her from the age of 11 on, you know, I
think one of her greatest strengths is running from rim to rim. She really
likes to do her work early and get you in as deep as she can inside the key. I
think those are some of the greatest things about her game.  
  
Q. Nneka, a lot of focus tomorrow night, obviously, is going to be on the
matchup between you and Maya. Could you address that and what you expect of it
in light of the performances you both had in the national semifinals?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Like I said, Maya is a good player. We both have really
good teams. I think it's going to be a matchup not just individually but
collectively, just the disparity between teamwork and working hard and going
after each possession.  
I think it's going to be a battle that's going to show the fight to the finish
between everybody. And, I mean, Connecticut doesn't just have Maya Moore; they
have Tina Charles, they have Kalana Greene, Caroline Doty, Tiffany Hayes.  
And then we don't just have one player; we have all these people up here, and
then some on the bench as well. And I think it's going to be really great
matchup. I'm really excited.  
  
Q. Ros, this is for you. In your estimation, what is it going to take to win
tomorrow night?  
ROSALYN GOLD-ONWUDE: I think it always starts for us with a great scouting
game plan. I think that we are going to need a traditionally good game, like
that we always expect from our big three. Maybe an exceptionally good game.  
I think that our guards are going to have to do their part. We can't turn the
ball over. We have to box out. And we have to get back in transition,
especially on Maya, because she's really running hard in transition. And stay
with it, try to avoid their big runs and help each other out.  
  
Q. Two years ago you guys lost to UConn early in the season in a tournament
and you came back and beat them in the semifinals. Does this dynamic feel
familiar at all for you?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think, you know, even in the Pac-10 it's hard to play a team
twice in the year for both teams. You know their tendencies, you know what
they traditionally come out and do against you.  
But I think we're excited. We've been in this position before of playing for
national championship. We've been in the position of going home before a
national championship.  
So I think we're just going to take all of the energy, bundle it up into our
game plan, and come out and just try to compete for 40 minutes.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tara, when you watched the film this morning, what was more instructive:
The 15-2 run that you guys went on in the first half or the 30-to-6 run they
went on in the second half?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I've watched the game several times. And, you know, I
think that for us, obviously, we want to know that we can make the run when
we're down; that we're capable of beating a team in 20 minutes.  
At the same time, the second half, the game got away from us. And I think it's
just really important for our team to see how it got away from us.  
So I would say that we've probably focused more on how it got away from us
this morning, just to say: Look at the things we could have done. Look at the
things we need to do. Look at the things we're capable of doing.  
We didn't do those in December. We have to do those in April.  
  
Q. What didn't you do?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think that, first of all, for our team, and as you
can hear kind of these players talk about it, they really do well when there's
a very clear plan for them, and then people follow a plan.  
It really is very helpful for us to have played Connecticut and see our
matchups, see how people guard different people, what they do against us.  
And so for our team, a clear plan -- and I don't know that we had a clear
plan. And part of it was the fact that we had played a lot of big games
leading up to Connecticut.  
And this is tough, too, when we only have one day. We like it when we have
like maybe three or four days and we can go over things, and we spend a lot of
time watching video almost ad nauseam. Our team is like -- we joke about it.
I'll be like: Does anybody want to watch video? And they've seen enough.  
A lot of the mistakes we made were how we played screens. A lot of the things,
just our help side. Our not boxing out. Quite honestly, we were not aggressive
enough. And I think that part of it could be the fact that we weren't as
energetic as we needed to be.  
We were a little tired. And also at this point I think we had more bodies. We
can play Joslyn. She was just coming off a stress fracture.  
So being more energetic, being more aggressive, and learning from the mistakes
that we made, I think, will be key.  
  
Q. Obviously both teams are filled with some very talented players. But a
little unique situation in that each side has one who has the ability to take
over a game, as they showed last night. Could you talk about that dynamic of
having Nneka and Maya with that type of player on the floor?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, Nneka had a great game last night, and she is really
stepping up for us. Maya Moore is just -- she's a tough guard for anyone in
that she's so big, so strong. And she shot the ball probably the best of any
shooter last night, all four teams combined.  
She's the best player in the game right now in the college game, and she's
better than a lot of the professionals, too.  
But we can't have it be a one-on-one match. It can't be Maya Moore versus one
person for us. We have to really help on her. And not only do they have her,
but they have the second best player in Tina Charles. And obviously both of
them did a lot of damage last night. And we just have to really work hard to
limit their damage, and then maximize the strengths that we have. We're going
to need Jayne to give us more. Kayla to give us more.  
We can't expect Nneka to carry us with another 40-point game.  
  
Q. You played them when they came along in '95, you've played them various
times in their development --  
COACH VANDERVEER: You didn't have to bring that up, Mel.  
  
Q. I'm not talking about the wins or losses; just playing them. Talk about
their development over the years, what they do better now than maybe they did
back then, maybe they did something a little better then that they don't do
now?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You all are very familiar with Geno, his program, and this
particular team. Geno does a great job. He's a superb teacher of the game. He
has a vision for how his team will play. And they play that way or they don't
play.  
They are very talented players, individually, but collectively they're more
formidable, because they play so well together. And they're very physical. I
think that what I've seen with them is that their defense has really improved.
I mean, they've always been just a beautiful offensive kind of machine to
watch, how they pass and screen, and they're one of the best passing teams, I
mean, just traditionally.  
And they're an excellent shooting team. But their defense is what's working
for them now. They create a lot of turnovers. Like we turned it over like 17
times against them last time we played. They are extremely athletic and fast.
And you can't -- you can't shoot yourself in the foot with them.  
You've got to really value the possession of the ball. You can't give them
second shots. You've got to limit the good looks that they get. And even if
you're right there on them, they still can make shots.  
  
Q. You've got inside players, and you go there first offensively, but do you
have to knock down shots from the outside tomorrow night to win?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Last time we played them, we didn't shoot extremely well. We
were like 5-for-13. But JJ and Kayla and Jeanette all made 3s. I don't think
we can expect to win if we're bricklayers.  
But, you know what, they didn't shoot that well the first time we played them.
They were 3-for-20 from 3. And last night I don't think they shot that well. I
don't know what they shot from the perimeter last night. But everyone just
seemed to struggle.  
But we have really good shooters on our team. And if people focus on inside
with Jayne or with Nneka, that will be a time people are going to have to read
the defense and knock down perimeter shots.  
  
Q. You've done something probably no other coach has done: You won two
championships in three years. You win an Olympic gold medal. And then some of
your teams struggle or weren't as successful as the other teams. Now all of a
sudden you're back, third straight year in the Final Four. Psychologically,
what was that like? What was it like to win two championships, a gold medal,
and see this Connecticut phenomenon sort of blossom, and then you're able to
come back and beat that phenomenon and play them again?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, well, I think a lot of it has to do with the
players that you have. Recruiting great players and having, for us -- if you
look at maybe different years, for us we could tie it to -- we could look at
not just the coach and the program, but who our dean of admissions is. We can
look at kind of just the injuries that we've had. And it was very hard.  
It wasn't like that we were horrible. But once you get used to the cream, it's
hard to be down in that skim milk. It was really -- we wondered if we could
really ever get back. And I think we knocked down the door three times in a
row with Elite Eight. So we kind of said we're there.  
And then I think really the person that -- key players like Maya Moore for
Connecticut or Tina Charles for them, because they had a little bit of a lull,
by their standards, but we really got back on track with Candice and Jayne.
Candice Wiggins, you know, really just has a passion and she was just such a
charismatic player for us, and Jayne, the inside presence.  
Then along comes Nneka, and obviously Kayla and just having the players. And
then once you're knocking on the door, then you expect this. Our team expected
to come to the Final Four and expected to be in this game. And now we need our
team to expect to win.  
  
Q. Along those lines, to segue out of what you just said, I think among
casual fans, there's probably this inevitability that Connecticut's already
been crowned and you're going to -- you're playing for the Cinderella role
tomorrow. How do you respond to that as far as what the casual fan sees? And
also is there a motivation in your locker room because they've already been
crowned in a lot of people's minds?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I mean, sometimes I think that like with our team,
we just try to take it one step at a time. And our kids, one day I think they
had heard something on television or read something. They said, yeah, it's the
NCAA tournament, the Connecticut Invitational. They were kind of just like a
little -- just kind of talking about that.  
I said, hey, so let's get invited. And let's get here and let's just take it
one step at a time. And Connecticut has earned their -- the accolades that
they get. I mean, to go 77 games, that's incredible. That's just -- I think
that's tremendous.  
But what I try to do -- even during the year people will say: How about you
and Connecticut? And I'm like: We're not there yet. But now we can talk about
it. And our team has earned kind of the opportunity to talk about playing
Connecticut. And we are playing them.  
We did not play that well the first time around. We did well in the first
half. We went into Hartford, which I think is a tough place to play. We were
up at halftime. And then the game got away from us.  
And our team needs to -- we need to say, hey, we have to have the confidence
to know for one half we can win. We have to put two halves together.  
Whatever everyone thinks out there, you know, just like I think everyone had
maybe crowned the Patriots as NFL champions. Well, the Giants won.  
So we just have to come out and play. We have to play a lot better than
actually we're playing right now, and we might need Connecticut to have a
little off night.  
  
Q. The other big matchup tomorrow is going to be Jayne Appel against Tina
Charles. How concerned are you that Jayne is not in top condition at this
point, and that she's still a little gimpy from her ankle and has been for a
month?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Right.  
  
Q. And a follow-up, if I may. How would you like this game to be officiated?
Would you prefer that the refs let a little of the physicality go? Or would
you like it called very tightly?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Let me start with the officiating. Of course, which I have
no control over. I think they should call it the way they've been calling it
all year. They make a point of emphasis not to allow rough post play. And last
night I thought Jayne was -- I just thought it was a very physical game.  
I just think if you have people going to the basket and people impede their
progress or they're bumping them and pushing them and it's -- I don't think
it's good for the women's game. And I've always felt that way. I don't want it
really tight. I don't want ticky-tack trials. I think people are coming to
watch the best players, and we want them to play.  
But I don't think it should be a wrestling match or we shouldn't be looking at
like an NFL offensive linemen drill.  
The other question about Jayne is she's an absolute warrior. She is in pain.
She does not practice. She feels that her wind is good getting up and down,
but she is clearly not the All-American player that was playing that way for
us a month ago.  
And all we can ask her to do is to battle in there and do the very best that
she can, which I feel like she is. But I want her to get deep in and score and
make really good decisions about her passing. She rebounded well last night. I
thought she ran pretty well for us.  
But there's a couple times where she just is off balance and not finishing the
way I've seen her for four years. She's really key for our team's success. And
I think the fact that this is her last game and this is a person that she's
played against since she was 11 years old, I think you'll see Jayne give it
her all, what she's capable of.  
But her ankle is holding her back. She won't tell you that, but I can see it.  
  
Q. I want to get back to the film of the first game. You mentioned a while
ago that you had watched it several times. Does it get to the point with
Connecticut, because of the possibility down the road of playing them in the
Final Four, where it becomes sort of like something you carry around with you
and just pop it in the machine, when you have an hour, hour and a half to
kill?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Not necessarily. I kind of feel like I have it a little
memorized. I've watched it early when we went back. I mean, I can go through
and clip it so I have clips of it. Looking at like the stat sheet.  
But you kind of have to get away from that, when you have December. We can't
keep bringing that to our team. It's about -- for us it's about our journey.
For us it's about getting better.  
And I'm thankful that we scheduled Connecticut and Tennessee and Duke, because
I feel like -- and Gonzaga -- all these teams in different ways have helped us
get better.  
And Connecticut has helped us get better. But for our team, it's -- sometimes
we just want to show them and say here's what has given us problems. Here's
what we need to do better. Here's -- to play at the elite level, this is what
you have to be able to do.  
But I don't think it's healthy for us or for our team to constantly be putting
it in their face. I mean, I think it's tedious watching some of the games and
listening to some of the announcers just go on about how Connecticut never
takes a play off. I mean, they're kids. They're college students, like our
college students, and no one plays a perfect game.  
And that's what for our team is that we want to learn from the mistakes we
made, but also recognize, you know, you went into Hartford and you were up at
halftime. You did a lot of good things but not enough good things.  
  
Q. A lot is made in basketball about the relationship between the coach and
a point guard. They're often said they're an extension of the coach on the
floor. Conversely, could you talk about the relationship between the coach and
a post player, center? And to sort of follow that up, is it more difficult to
get maximum out of post players than perhaps perimeter players?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I think sometimes it's just different
personalities and different people click. What I try to do is -- as an example
with Jayne. Jayne is the closest probably on our staff -- she gets along well
with all of our coaches, but closest to Amy. Amy works with Jayne and really
is Jayne's kind of confidante.  
But I might be -- I speak with Jayne before every game. We step outside of the
locker room and I just remind Jayne how much I enjoy coaching her and what a
tremendous talent she is and how much she means to our team. And I just remind
her to stay out of foul trouble. But I feel like it's more -- it's not
positional, but more just personality.  
I thought you were going to ask me about Jeanette. I'm just getting to know
Jeanette. But if there's someone on the team -- I feel like I have -- maybe I
can just relate to Nneka really well. We're the oldest. We're the oldest of
four girls. So some of it is just based maybe on family or personality,
recruiting who you get to know. Not positional, in my mind.  
  
Q. You were talking about your scheduling and I guess I'd like to know if
you and Geno have had any discussions even preliminarily about extending your
regular season series beyond next year's game in Palo Alto. And do you think
it would be good for women's basketball if you and Connecticut played every
year?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I know that we have. I think Neal Eskin does the scheduling,
and we are working on that. And I hope that we are able to continue it.  
I think it's really good for us. I don't know if it's good for women's
basketball. But I think you have the East Coast/West Coast, and Geno does just
a great job with their team and program. They have outstanding fans.  
And I know that it will be a big game when Connecticut comes to Stanford next
year.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about your early days in basketball. Where exactly
did you grow up in Upstate New York? And I read a story in the Mercury News
last week that your father didn't want you to play basketball and you said:
Algebra won't get me anywhere, either.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Right.  
  
Q. I read another story that you would bow out in your Delta '88 to go watch
Immaculata play?  
COACH VANDERVEER: That's true.  
I grew up in Schenectady, New York, since I was from five to 15. At the time I
was growing up there wasn't basketball for girls. I would go out and play with
the boys. I grew up in a really nice like 80 home kind of neighborhood where
all the dads worked at General Electric outside of Schenectady. And it was a
Leave It to Beaver kind of childhood.  
I would go out to play, but as I got older the boys then didn't want girls
playing, so then I liked to have the best basketball; if they wanted to use
that ball, then I got to play. And I played all the time. If the boys weren't
there, I would just shoot by myself. And by the time I got to be about -- I
know my parents were just like -- they were both teachers. They would say:
Come in and do your algebra homework, study, because basketball is not going
to take you anywhere.  
So I would send them postcards like from Russia, you know, P.S.: Basketball is
what's paying my way over here.  
But as a young child, it was very hard, actually, because of not having teams
that I decided when my parents moved -- we moved to Niagara Falls, New York --
I was done with basketball. In fact, I'm kind of stubborn.  
I moved as a sophomore in high school. I hated where we moved. I hated leaving
my school. I was kind of bratty as a 15-year-old. Maybe an adolescent. So we
moved in November. My parents finally broke down. I never had a hoop of my
own. And they were getting me a hoop for Christmas. And I was like: I'm done
with basketball. I'll never shoot on that hoop.  
My dad put it up and other kids played on it, but I didn't play on it. I
decided to try out for cheerleading. It was a love/hate relationship with
basketball. Because I loved it, but there were no opportunities to play.  
So I just started watching. I watched Calvin Murphy at Niagara and St.
Bonaventure had Bob Lanier. And I watched it and studied it in my own little
way. I went to Indiana and -- I started at Albany because I went back to where
I had gone to high school, and then I just said basketball is no fun here.  
I jumped center, leading scorer, leading rebounder leading turnover. So I got
friends and drove out watched the tournament and I said I want to play in kind
of the big time of AIW basketball and went to Indiana and had a great
experience there.  
  
Q. So you didn't play on a high school --  
COACH VANDERVEER: Never. No, never played high school. My college season was a
seven-game regular season schedule. I sprained my ankle, missed half the
season. But I had great friends -- and I played -- I would go to the gym --
like I studied and went to class, and then I would go to the gym all
afternoon. We practiced after the boys, which was at 7:00 at night. So that
was -- I would go watch Bobby Knight's practice for like three hours.  
  
Q. How important is it for you guys to get off to a big start or a good
start tomorrow night? When you played them last year in the semis they kind of
blitzed you from the start, whereas in December you had a great first half
--  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that was really key for us. I like when we get out
to a good start in any game. We have started well with the exception of, I
would say, maybe our Arizona State game at home and our Arizona game.  
I think this team -- we've got to stay in contact with them. We're not like a
super athletic pressing, trapping, okay, we can get down and we can come back
from whatever, being down 15 or something.  
So we did get down nine and we did come back. We rallied. But I think we have
to come out and each possession, I mean, has to be a heavyweight fight. You
gotta stay up. You can't get on the mat.  
  
Q. Take a little detour, Tara. Geno is going to be the Olympic coach. The
first time since '96 on your turn that a collegiate coach is running the
Olympic team. If you look at histories, Pat, K, and you, in your own programs,
if you're looking at time lines, you all had dips around the same time you
were coaching the Olympians. Are there things he needs to be on guard against,
on guard for in terms of his own program as he moves in that direction in the
next couple of years?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, he'll do a great job with the Olympic team. I think it
is maybe a little bit different. For me I had to take the whole year off, so
my situation was maybe different than anyone's.  
I don't know that it's anything that you just -- you get -- you just get so
tired. Like for me I just was -- you just don't have the same amount of
energy. So I think it's having people around you who will do a lot of the
stuff for you that -- I mean, you just need other people working a lot harder
around you, because you just get worn down.  
I was just so physically tired and emotionally drained from the experience.
And I just didn't realize it until even in the middle of the year and I just
didn't have the same kind of bounce to my step and enthusiasm that you need to
have to work with collegiate student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tara, you were asked about how important it is to get off to an early
start. I'm kind of wondering, from looking at it from the other end of the
game, you had a couple of games where things got really tense for you down the
stretch with Xavier, and obviously last night as well. Do you wonder what the
same emotions might be for Connecticut; they've been behind in only like 38
minutes this year. Do you wonder what it might be like? Obviously you want to
put them in that situation, but do you wonder what it would be like for them
to finally be in a real tense game down the stretch?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, obviously we'd like to put them in that situation.
We'd like it to not even be that tense. We like to have that 10-, 15-,
18-point lead. But obviously look at what happened last night.  
I think for us -- Connecticut even last night was a little test for them.
They're human. They shoot air balls like we shoot air balls. They miss free
throws or they miss shots or they miss box-outs, and for our team I think it's
just going to come down to us being really physical, us not backing down,
making -- people making shots. Making sure we don't give them easy shots. Make
it hard for them.  
And I'm sure they're going to try to do the same thing to us, not letting
people be in their comfort zone. But I think that they have -- they've won
before. Even though maybe the games haven't been that close, I know they do
drills in practice. They play against guys and played down 10 and come back
and things like that.  
I just think that we have to focus on what we do and we have to do it really,
really well. And just see how -- we have to battle. And I just hope that we
come out and do that.  
  
Q. Reflecting back on '96, as it turned out it was a very important moment
for the growth of women's sports. And you won the gold medal, softball won the
gold medal. Soccer won the gold medal. Maybe one of the most celebrative
moments for women sports at that point. Could you talk about how that sort of
maybe changed the game for women and the way they were perceived in many
ways?  
COACH VANDERVEER: One of the things I think was that brought to my attention,
I mean, this was kind of funny was Sheryl Swoopes as an example, when Sheryl
Swoopes was first on the team, we trained for a year, she could bench-press 40
pounds.  
It was by the end of the year, I mean, it was more. I can't tell you exactly
what it was. But Lisa Leslie said to me: I'm proud of my muscles. You saw
women with strong arms and physical in a very positive way. And they were
proud of -- Lisa was excited to be fit and strong.  
Some of the training was intense for a year. I think it was -- it was really a
little bit of the foundation for the profession of women's basketball. And
seeing women not only as collegiate athletes but as professional athletes, and
for me it was just a tremendous year working with really dedicated and
committed women athletes and traveling the world.  
And I think it was a big statement, not just by our sport, but by the other
female athletes at the Atlanta Olympics.  
  
Q. Last night UConn had for one of the rare times during their streak, the
role players -- not Maya and Tina -- have an off night; I think they combined
for 15 points, the rest of the team. Does that help you guys get confidence
that that blueprint may work; that if they get in foul trouble and they're not
shooting well they can be in a little bit of trouble? Or is it, okay, they
have this off night finally and the odds of that happening two days in a row
or two games in a row is not too high for them?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, the numbers, I think, would show that Connecticut -- I
mean, Connecticut's best players are Maya Moore and Tina Charles and they
stepped up for them. And what do they score? Like 56 or 58 of their 70 points.  
You know, so they didn't need the other players. But I think that the key
players for their team are Maya Moore, Tina Charles, maybe Kalana Greene being
in there. But the other kids are great players. Hayes. Caroline Doty. They can
have a night off and their team can still be really successful.  
You have to, people say, pick your poison. They have a lot of weapons. And I
don't know that that gives me any comfort to say, well, okay, let's count on
that. I mean, they're all very, very capable of players. So maybe they buy
into Ros's mother theory: They're going to get a certain number of 3s and they
just didn't happen. So that could be bad news for us.  
  
Q. That seven-game season, was that Albany or Indiana?  
COACH VANDERVEER: It might have been nine games at Indiana. Seven or nine, I
can't remember which it was.  
  
Q. Which place did you sprain your ankle?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Indiana.  
  
Q. And when you played outside, were you playing at a playground in
Schenectady?  
COACH VANDERVEER: No. Driveways. I didn't have a playground. Families had
their house and a hoop on the garage. And my next-door neighbor had one, and
sometimes they'd park the car there so that I knew that wasn't available so
I'd go to the other one. Then there was another one that had a nice half court
that was out in a little bit of a field. So I kind of took over that one.  
  
Q. Do you remember Riley? Was he a big --  
COACH VANDERVEER: He was a little older than me. He went to a different high
school. But, yes, boys basketball was big in the Schenectady area.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  

Connecticut  70  
Baylor - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: I'm pleased to introduce Baylor head coach Kim Mulkey as well
as student-athletes Brittney Griner and Morghan Medlock.  
Let's take questions.  
  
Q. Morghan, a couple of sequences the first half when you guys didn't seem
to be able to get shots to fall, and then in the second half, when you got the
lead, got them down to 3, and then they took off from there, can you talk
about what happened in those two instances?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I just think that's where their experience kicked in. We got
lost on a couple of defensive plays, and Maya Moore, being the great player
that she is, she did what she does best, and that's take over.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you just talk about how tough it was to go against Tina
Charles with her kind of experience and just how good a player she is?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: You know, it was definitely a battle in the post. I just feel
like she did what she needed to do for her team, and being her experience. And
I just hope to just be back.  
  
Q. Morghan, can you talk about having to go up against both Tina and Maya
and how difficult it was to try to stop one and not both of them?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: It was really difficult. You can look at film on a team all
you want, but until you get on the floor with them and actually get up and
down the floor with them, jump with them, bang with them a little bit, you
never know how good players are. And just getting up with the two of them,
they're pretty good.  
  
Q. Brittney, when you guys do get it to 3, UConn calls a timeout. The bench
is going crazy. I mean, how much did you feel like the game was there for the
taking?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: It was definitely there for us to take. We just -- just
mistakes and let it slip through our fingers. It was right there. But I feel
like we never stopped playing to our ability and we kept trying to get that,
to get it down.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you talk about the matchup against Charles, how that's
helped you become a better basketball player?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Well, good thing they let us play tonight. Just learning from
her. Just how patient she is and just how her team plays off of her and just
-- she's All-American. What can I say?  
  
Q. Morghan, once you guys got it to 3 there, the rest of the game you all
really struggled to score. Did you guys kind of hit the wall there? Or what
was the reason the rest of the game where you guys just had trouble getting
shots and getting them in the basket?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I don't know. I think it might have just been the game of
basketball. The shots weren't falling. And they made a run. And I think
basketball is a game of runs. Tonight's game was a game of runs mixed in with
a little bit of inexperience. That's what happened, the experience and them
going on the run when we cut it to 3.  
  
Q. Brittney, can you talk about what Tina did specifically? Did she try to
body you away from your comfort zone? Were they continuing to try to slap the
ball out of your hands, things like that? Could you tell us exactly what she
did to try to frustrate you?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: She just did what normally every other post does. She's
physical. She tries to get me off the block. She was a lot better than most
other posts. And I wouldn't say I got frustrated or upset. I felt it was just
a battle. And she had more experience than I did.  
  
Q. Brittney, just wanted to ask you, I saw that Coach Auriemma stopped to
make it a point to tell you something at the end. Can you share what he said
to you? And what it meant to you to hear that from him?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: You know, he just told me that I was a good player and just
keep going. And it means a lot for the other coaches to just tell you that
you're a good player and just to keep working hard.  
  
Q. Brittney, you broke the NCAA record for blocks in a season this year as a
freshman, also the NCAA tournament record for blocks. Can you talk about how
it feels to accomplish that in your first collegiate year? And also what areas
of your game you hope to work on and improve on over the summer?  
BRITTNEY GRINER: Ball handling would probably be one. Just getting stronger
with my lower body and stop relying on my height would definitely be something
I'm going to get in the gym soon and start working on. That's basically it.  
  
Q. Morghan, you sort of watched these freshmen grow up, including the one
sitting next to you, who has had such a phenomenal freshman year. Could you
kind of put in perspective what the freshmen have meant to this program and
what you think that's going to mean for Baylor basketball for the next few
years?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I think one statement I can just bluntly make about that is
without those five we wouldn't have been here, period. And they have a bright
future ahead of them, and all I can say is the teams just better watch out
because what they did their first year is huge. No freshmen do that, unless
you're talking about a Maya Moore or Tina Charles. But collectively I think
they did a great job. And they're only going to get better.  
They have three years left. And it's just going to be amazing to watch them
grow and grow and turn into the players that UConn has and things like that
their junior and senior years.  
  
Q. Morghan, kind of following up on that. Obviously I know the loss is
disappointing. But even in the wake of that, do you still have a sense of
appreciation over what you guys were able to do this year?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: Definitely. I'm disappointed we lost and sad because it was
my last game and all that stuff.  
But I couldn't be more proud of this basketball team with the injuries and
some things, not playing well in conference and just all the stuff that we had
going. We weren't even expected to be here.  
I'm just really proud we beat the odds and we got here, and I'm proud that we
didn't quit tonight and we gave UConn everything we had. They just were more
experienced and you can't teach that overnight.  
But I think next year, when these kids are back in the Final Four, which they
will be, I think they'll know what to do in situations and stuff like that,
because they'll be more experienced than your average sophomores.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, you guys were halfway through the first half. I think you had eight
turnovers and three field goals. You were down 25 to 8 and you turn it around.
What happened to get back in the game and get within 3 there in the second
half?  
COACH MULKEY: Hustle plays. I thought hustle plays. And Griner got some more
touches. And they're freshmen out there and they were desperately trying to
keep the game close.  
  
Q. Kim, you guys went 1-for-7 from 3-point range in the one game with about
1:15 to go. How much would a couple early on maybe loosened up that zone that
blanketed Griner all night?  
COACH MULKEY: I didn't think they blanketed her all night, really. I don't
think they had to. I think she got the ball a lot in one-on-one situations,
and they came some.  
But we got good looks. And, sure, if you hit some of those early, it might not
have -- we might not have been down double figures at halftime.  
But we had good looks. I thought there were several things that were different
in the game. First of all, their two All-Americans scored all but 15 of their
points. And that's a junior and a senior for Connecticut that we had freshmen
guarding. Griner was guarding Tina Charles all night and Shanay Washington and
Nae-Nae Hayden and Jordan Madden took their shots at Maya Moore.  
Therein lies the difference in the game. And because of the experience our
freshman got guarding those great players, I can only think in the future
they're going to be really excited to have an opportunity to get back here.  
  
Q. Where does that performance from Maya Moore rank with you in terms of a
player playing a big game among the biggest stages?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, she's just -- she's National Player of the Year, isn't
she? That's what they do. National Players of the Year, they don't get
rattled. They get big offensive and timely rebounds. And she did. In fact, she
was part of the reason it went from a 3-point game when we cut it to 11, I
think she got some long rebounds there and some free throws, and that's why
she's the National Player of the Year. She's just a great, great player.  
And then when you have her on the perimeter and you add a Tina Charles in the
post and both of them had double-doubles on this stage, there's a reason for
it.  
They've been here before. They've experienced it. They've taken everybody's
best shot, 78 games or however many games they've won, and they just don't get
rattled.  
I've had players score more points against us in our conference. But she's
special.  
  
Q. Kim, I saw you get excited, M.J. get excited when you all cut it to 3 and
they called the timeout. Maybe you were already believing, but do you think
the team was believing at that point?  
COACH MULKEY: Believing?  
  
Q. That you could do it.  
COACH MULKEY: I think they believed before they tipped off they could do it. I
don't think I coach any kids that think they can't do it. I mean, they were
trying out there. They played hard. They just got beat by two All-Americans.  
  
Q. Are you telling them in the timeouts at that point, hey, we've got to
expect a run back from UConn?  
COACH MULKEY: I probably -- you're talking about when we cut it to 3? I wasn't
probably telling them that. I was probably saying: Now you see you can play
with them. It was probably something motivating like that, that, hey,
everybody in this arena is cheering for you to win and you can play with them,
and just trying to motivate them.  
I thought when you're playing as hard as they were playing and as hard as we
were playing, I just thought that fatigue set in with both teams. And he
didn't sub and doesn't play a whole lot of players. And if you look at my
stats, I didn't sub a whole lot either.  
And so you had some women out there that were really, really playing hard.  
  
Q. Kim, has the regular season game with UConn been officially set for next
year? The reason I ask, I was wondering whether you would get them before they
would get that 88-game winning tying --  
COACH MULKEY: It has been set. I couldn't tell you the date. And then they
come back to Waco the following year. We go there Maya Moore's senior year.
They come back after she's gone.  
  
Q. You don't know whether it's like November, December?  
COACH MULKEY: I honestly do not.  
  
Q. Can you give us an idea what Brittney talked about what she thinks she
wants to work on? Can you talk about what you think she'll work on next year?
But also the rest of your freshmen, they made so much progress, what are some
of the things you think you'll see them progress on next season?  
COACH MULKEY: As I always do at the end of the year, you sit down with players
and you talk about their individual strengths and weaknesses. With Brittney
Griner it will be continue to get her stronger and get her in the weight room,
make she understands she has to play with her entire body. I think she gets
bumped off the block a lot. That comes with maturity. That comes with more
weight training.  
And she progressed a great deal through the course of her freshman year. And
she will continue to get better.  
I'd like to see her become a better offensive rebounder. I'd like to see her
go in there and get a little more. And, yet, at the same time I've got to be
fair. There may be a reason why she is not a better offensive rebounder, and
it probably has to do with people all over.  
I could break them all down. Nae-Nae Hayden and Shanay and Nae-Nae, I'll sit
down -- I mean, Jordan Madden. I'll sit down with those kids as well and break
down what I want them to work on over the summer and what we'll work on
individually, and it could be anything from taking the ball off the dribble,
jump shots, perimeter shooting, but the progress those young ladies made is
big.  
But you haven't seen the best of them yet.  
  
Q. What did you have to say to Melissa and Brittney as they were subbed out
of the game?  
COACH MULKEY: Melissa Jones is hardest on herself. I told her: Take a look in
this building and look around. You have another year. You're not a senior. And
I think -- well, I know I did. I said: Thank God when you go to bed tonight
that you were able to experience this and that your injury was healed.  
Who was the other one you asked me about?  
  
Q. Brittney.  
COACH MULKEY: I told Brittney: I know a lot of four-time All-Americans that
didn't make it to a Final Four until their senior year. You brought your team
here as a freshman. Build on it.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  

Stanford  73  
Oklahoma - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Oklahoma head coach Sherri Coale and Danielle Robinson
and Amanda Thompson.  
COACH COALE: I first want to congratulate Coach VanDerveer and Stanford. I
thought they played extremely well and they have a terrific basketball team,
and I wish them the best.  
We did not have an answer for Nneka all night long. And it just took us too
long to get going. They scored 21 in the first half and 45 in the second.  
It was too little too late, and still with two minutes to go I thought we had
a chance to win the game, and we did. I'm unbelievably proud of these kids. I
cannot express what a joy it has been to coach them, how refreshing it has
been and their willingness to learn, their drive, their belief, their faith,
how they are with one another.  
It's been everything that's good about college basketball, and I feel blessed
to have been their coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Amanda, could you talk a little bit about how difficult an assignment it
was to guard Nneka in this game and what were you trying to do?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: She's very athletic. You know, she's making everything and
really aggressive down low. And we couldn't really doubler because they had
another 6'5" girl over there. With me in foul trouble I couldn't guard her how
I wanted to. She was just incredible all night. And she's a great player.  
  
Q. Could you talk about the difference between your team offensively in the
first half and in the second half?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We let our offense affect our defense. I mean, our -- yeah,
offense affect our defense. And so we know we weren't converting on that end,
so we struggled a little bit on the defensive end and then we would come down
and not convert again.  
We were just stagnant. We had no rhythm. Everybody was just standing, waiting
for somebody else to do it. They sagged a little bit, and that kind of socked
us up. I knew we'd fix it in the second half, but it just wasn't enough.  
  
Q. Danielle, the sagging, they didn't sag off Nyeshia. I think she only got
seven shots. Did they do anything special defensively to limit her shots?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I mean, they put their best defender, Rosalyn, on her. She
got some good looks. We all got some good looks. We just didn't knock shots
down when we needed to. I guess that's where we struggled in the first half.  
  
Q. You guys now have faced both Stanford and Connecticut. Assuming that
Connecticut moves forward out of its semifinal game, do you think there's
anything that Stanford could do to pull off the upset?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Stanford's a great team. They're both tremendously
athletic. They're both pretty big in size. I think it's going to be a great
matchup between the two of them.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: If they rebound like they rebounded tonight, I think it will
be a good matchup.  
  
Q. Danielle, like you said, it seemed like you guys got good looks, but did
you guys kind of have to take jumpers? Because you didn't have any room to
drive, it seemed like, because of their size. Was that one of -- Nyeshia
didn't get much going to the basket. Were you guys settling for jump shots?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I wouldn't say we were settling. We had open looks. When
you get wide-open looks, you have to knock them down.  
  
Q. Danielle, at the beginning of the game I think you started 0 and 9 from
the field. Particularly your jump shots seemed to be short. Was it something
they did? Was it the jitters, the big arena? What was it?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Wasn't getting under it. Leaning back a little too much.
And that's what made it short.  
  
Q. For both of you, in the replay of the game, in your mind, between missed
shots, offensive boards allowed, or the execution you were talking about,
Danielle, just what bothers you the most in the aftermath? What let it get
away?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Rebounding. We knew coming into the game that rebounding
was going to be the key. It seemed like we tipped it, we tipped it, and they
came up with it. Or we tipped it out of bounds and they had an extra
possession, new shot clock.  
Just wasn't securing the ball, and I guess a lack of focus.  
  
Q. 6:45 to go in the game; you guys were down 18 points. Was it just made
shots? What clicked that got you guys going? Because most people probably
thought that you were done.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: The game's not over until the clock says 00:00. And our whole
season has been about fighting. And we fought our way back to the game. And we
didn't want this to be our last one. And everybody just kind of linked
together and we found a way to come back.  
  
Q. Danielle, just continuing on that vein about the comeback, you were
really on fire at the end. Did you think at that point that you had them on
their heels and you were going to get it?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah. I mean, why play the game if you're not confident in
believing in your team regardless of the situation. I definitely think we made
that run. It's something we've been doing all year, like Amanda talked about,
come from behind. We knocked down some shots, and got a little momentum on our
side.  
You could tell that the momentum was on our side. They were a little bit
unsure. But we gave up a couple layups that kind of secured the win for them.  
  
Q. Amanda, one of three seniors on this Oklahoma club, talk about all you've
overcome this year, your experience at Oklahoma.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: We've overcome a lot. I mean, we've been -- over time we've
lost players. We've done it all. We've brought it together. And Abi, she
didn't play for three years and had the best year of her life. Nyeshia, a year
ago wouldn't have took the shots that she took this year. She knocked down
some big ones here to bring us to the Final Four.  
We all just fought, man. I'm just proud of everybody. And where we've come,
nobody can take that away from us.  
  
Q. Danielle, everybody talked about the size-versus-speed matchup. Obviously
their size played a role. Do you think you failed to take advantage of your
speed advantage, and, if so, how did Stanford negate that?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I think we did in the first half, just because we're so
stagnant. They were scoring. So we had to take the ball out and not let -- off
of misses it's easier to get a quicker outlet. So I definitely think that
affected us a little bit.  
  
Q. For either one of you, the baseball pass, you talked about giving up a
couple layups, the one to Nneka seemed to be the one that kind of maybe was
the last one. Did she get away? What happened on that play?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, she screened Danielle's player and went backwards, and
that kind of played it forward so that whoever she was defending wouldn't get
the ball. And we just had a mishap and she got a wide-open layup. So, I mean,
it was either one of us. Can't really blame. She got the layup. Game over.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Sherri, you opened by saying you didn't have an answer for Nneka. Is
there an answer for Nneka?  
COACH COALE: Well, someone closer to her size would help. She's just very
explosive and bouncy and does a great job of getting fouled, obviously, and
then converting free throws.  
She's just a tough matchup for a lot of people.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what coaching adjustments that you made late in the
game from the time that you were down by 17 to pulling back within two?  
COACH COALE: I don't really know that there were a lot of coaching adjustments
that had anything to do with that. Players made plays. We were doing what we'd
been trying to do the entire second half. And Danielle starts making jumpers
and everybody relaxes a little bit and gets lost in the game and quits
worrying so much about the score and just plays the possession that they're
in.  
And we did what we've done, what got us here. That's the tough part about it,
is if you go down, you want to go down playing your best. And the first half
wasn't anything like what we've shown in the last three weeks of the season.  
And what you saw in the final, you know, eight to ten minutes of the game was
a lot more like it.  
  
Q. Kind of a two-part question. First of all, seemed like you were doing a
lot of switching defensive zone, man, half-court stuff to try to take them
out. And for the most part, other than Nneka, you seemed to do a pretty good
job with that. But also when the team starts off shooting like it did, is
there anything you can do as a coach, just have to kind of hope it ends?  
COACH COALE: You know, I really think -- we didn't guard them nearly as well
as we wanted to. There were several times we were chunking it up a little bit
to try to negate the size advantage in the paint, and three people would
remember what to do and one or two wouldn't.  
And they caught us a few times on some cover-downs in the first half. I felt
like the first maybe four defensive possessions of the game we really guarded
them. We did some good stuff. We made them uncomfortable, and we went down and
missed shots.  
We took bad shots. One passed and shot and nobody to rebound. Danielle was
exactly right: our poor offense began then to affect our defense. And in our
mind you're worried about the play that happened before, and you just can't do
that, especially not at this juncture of the season, especially against a team
as talented as Stanford.  
  
Q. What did you tell them at halftime when you're down 13 and shooting 25
percent? What did you tell the team?  
COACH COALE: We talked a lot about how we have to all be on the same page when
we change defenses; that everybody's got to communicate; that offensively
they're giving us jump shots and they're not guarding Jas. So, Jas, go ball
screen, and then who is going to help if they're not guarding you.  
Talked about D-Rob getting to the rim and taking and making the 10-foot jump
shot, and continuing to go at their post players, trying to get them in some
kind of foul trouble which we obviously were never able to do.  
Ended up by telling them that we were ahead by 12 last year to Louisville and
they got to play on Tuesday, so let's go do it.  
  
Q. Coach, was there a case of nerves in the beginning? Because the shots
were not even close for the most part.  
COACH COALE: I don't know. How do you ever know? I mean, they don't know. I
don't know. They definitely wanted to win, and we've been sagged on all year
long. That's not anything new. It wasn't some big shocker.  
We just made some bad decisions and found ourselves in a hole.  
  
Q. Sherri, you talk about the legacy of these seniors.  
COACH COALE: They will forever be the class that took us to back-to-back Final
Fours. And it's such a hard thing to do. If my number is right, I've heard
that there are only six schools to do that. That's a pretty special thing.  
And Stacey Dales and LaNeisha Caufield and Caton Hill will forever be the
class that took us to our first Final Four, and these guys will be the first
ever to take us back-to-back.  
But I think even more than that these seniors have restored everything that is
Oklahoma basketball. And I don't know if restore is the right word, but they
have grown and they've figured out over the course of their four years what it
means to play hard all the time, what it means to sell out and be a great
teammate, what it means to commit to the process of getting better.  
They figured that out over their career. And that's what we're trying to do.
And we're sad about this and we hate the fact that we're not going to play for
the national championship on Tuesday. But I'll tell you what, we've done some
special things. This class has much to be proud of.  
  
Q. Sherri, talk about this third experience at a Final Four and as you look
ahead for this Sooner team and a top 10 recruiting class coming up for next
year.  
COACH COALE: Again, just very, very proud of these seniors and what they've
done and what this group accomplished amidst the adversity that we faced.  
The thing that it does is it removes a ceiling. It's kind of like the first
guy that runs a mile in four minutes and then all of a sudden everybody's
doing it. And for the kids within our program, these guys that will return
next year, this is what we do.  
I mean, Whitney Hand and Jasmine Hartman, this is all they know. You work and
you go to the Final Four. There's something that's contagious about that. And
they will quickly teach those five incoming freshmen what it means to work and
commit at Oklahoma, and we'll do our best to get back here on a regular basis.  
  
Q. Talking about Stanford's sagging defense, they certainly didn't sag off
Nyeshia. Could you talk about what they did to keep her shots limited?  
COACH COALE: They just followed her around. But you see Nyeshia got to the
free throw line 11 times. So she took advantage of that.  
We didn't shoot it quite as well from there as we would like. But they were
sagging off Jas, which people have done all year, and they were really backed
up under D and going under, and when they're committing to one guy like that,
the other guys have to make plays.  
We did a good job of trying to screen and get her open and got her the
basketball some. But she did a good job, too, as they followed her off of all
those, of putting it on the floor and trying to get to the rim.  
  
Q. You've coached some great players. You've coached against some great
players. What makes Nneka so special?  
COACH COALE: Her size and her explosiveness. I think she's just so bouncy.
She's really hard to keep off the glass. She's a fantastic rebounder, and a
great competitor. She plays hard all the time.  
  
Q. Did you have any sense of Jayne's health in terms of the ankle? What did
you see as far as how mobile Jayne was tonight?  
COACH COALE: She's not as mobile as she was earlier in the year, obviously.
But, you know, she's a competitor, too. And I saw her catching it on the block
and going really strong to the rim a number of times. I think it affects her a
little bit more in transition than it does in the half court.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  

Connecticut  70  
Baylor - 50

  
THE MODERATOR: Okay. Pleased to welcome up here to the podium Connecticut head
coach Geno Auriemma, as well as student-athletes Tina Charles and Maya Moore.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Going into the game you're always trying to conjure up all
these different scenarios that may or may not come up that you're going to
have to deal with.  
And the one scenario that I didn't conjure up was our two starting guards
going 1 for 14. I didn't plan on that.  
And in spite of that, these two players up here were just absolutely amazing,
because they had to do it all by themselves pretty much. And I can't say
enough about them and especially in the second half what they did, when Baylor
cut it to whatever they cut it to. I forget what it was.  
  
Q. Three.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Closer than I thought. So we had a chance to respond, and we
haven't had a chance to do that very often this year. And I'm glad that
everybody got a chance to see that, what these players are capable of doing
when they're pushed, when they're asked.  
I'm really proud of them. Not an easy team to play against, for sure. But I'm
really, really proud of these two, and I'm proud of the whole team.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Maya, just talk about the lead that you and Tina took tonight in carrying
this team to the win?  
MAYA MOORE: I don't think it's anything different than what we always try to
do. We always come out every game trying to be aggressive. And you don't
really have to convince us to come out and be aggressive.  
And I felt I had a mismatch most of the game. I was just trying to be
aggressive. And once I listened to my teammates and set up my screens and used
them, we got even more opened up. And Tina just does a great job of coming in,
a confident leader who is going to attack anybody that she's matched up with.  
She made some big buckets for us. Gave us a lot of momentum and blocked some
shots and came through for us on the boards.  
  
Q. Tina, can you talk about what was going on when they cut the lead to 3
and what happened after that when you guys were able to push out again?  
TINA CHARLES: I think the reason why we responded so well was because Coach
puts us in situations like that during practice. When we go to practice, even
though we have this streak going on and we're winning games, he still puts us
in game situations that could happen. And that happened tonight, and we all
just came together and we're like we're not going to lose. We want to go on to
Tuesday.  
And we just knew what was at stake. So because we always come out against our
practice players, we play hard and we're able to get the lead back. We knew we
could do it.  
  
Q. Maya or Tina, the first basket of the game was by Tiffany driving right
in on Griner. Was that by design? Did you want to set the tone right off the
bat, or is that just how the offense flowed?  
MAYA MOORE: That's just how the offense flowed. That got us all excited. It
shows the fearlessness of our team, of our underclassmen, and why we feel
confident in our underclassmen despite a poor shooting night. We know they're
going to bounce back with that same fearless mindset. I think it sparked,
really, the beginning of the game for us.  
  
Q. Maya, in the first game tonight you had a pretty phenomenal performance
by Nneka Ogwumike and then you came out and put on a show. Can you kind of
talk about you're going to have that matchup, you guys against Stanford again.
You're very familiar with them. Could you talk about that matchup and also
your thoughts on what Nneka did tonight?  
MAYA MOORE: She's an outstanding player. She works extremely hard. She has, I
think, developed faster than any sophomore in the country. And she has a lot
of confidence right now. She can do a lot. She uses her body well. And it's
going to be a tough battle.  
I absolutely have to come in on my assignments and just working hard. It's
going to be a battle. It's really not much more to be said about that. She's
going to come with it, and she knows what's at stake as well.  
  
Q. With Caroline and Tiffany in foul trouble tonight, you got 27 minutes out
of Kelly. Just talk about what she did for you guys tonight.  
TINA CHARLES: That's Kelly. When you look at the stat sheet, you don't see the
things she does. It really doesn't appear up there. But her giving us the
energy, the six assists, the rebounds, the four rebounds she gave us, she's
the boost off the bench, her and Lorin Dixon, especially.  
  
Q. Tina, you faced off against some of the best post players in the country,
certainly the NCAA, but also with U.S.A. Basketball. You could even say in the
world. Could you describe what it was like to match up with Brittney Griner
and just how you would evaluate her game?  
TINA CHARLES: It was definitely a battle, just physically. Just trying to push
her off the paint. Coach was definitely getting on me about the seven layups I
gave up and not forcing her to go to the middle. That's where my help was.
She's definitely going to be a great player coming out of college. You
definitely can see she wants to work hard. When her team comes around her and
tells her we need to post deeper, she responded and she'll try to get me
deeper in the lane.  
But she's going to be a great player.  
  
Q. Tina, can you talk about Brittney's position and where you see her in
three years and how fast or quick she can develop into a superstar?  
TINA CHARLES: I think that's her decision just mentally what she wants to do
and how much of an impact she wants to have on -- with Baylor and just in the
country.  
Her development, I think, could be like how mine was, just being mental. I
don't think it's anything physical. Just how hard you want to be pushed and
how hard you want to be motivated and just what you want to do for yourself
personally.  
  
Q. Maya, when it was 41-38 after the timeout, what was your mindset at that
moment? What was going through your mind?  
MAYA MOORE: Just keep attacking. Keep playing. Staying confident with
everything that we've done the entire year. It's important for each individual
to really have good body language at that point.  
And I looked up as I was inbounding the ball at my four other teammates on the
floor, and all I saw was positive body language and just attitude in their
eyes. And I saw that and I said: Let's go. We picked it up, got a steal right
off the bat, and we never looked back.  
  
Q. Maya and Tina, is the next one the matchup that you guys wanted in your
hearts of hearts, No. 1 versus No. 2, now this will be the third consecutive
Final Four in which you'll run into Stanford?  
TINA CHARLES: The matchup doesn't matter to us. Whoever is going to be in the
way, that's who we're going to have to go up against. It's nothing personal or
anything like that. Whoever it was, we're just going to face a challenge and
go up against them and play hard and leave everything out on the court.  
MAYA MOORE: I agree. I personally just want to play the best. I want to be
challenged. I want to compete. And Stanford has proven themselves to be that
team.  
  
Q. Coach Auriemma has talked about the diversity of your offense, how you
have worked so hard on that in your time. Can you talk about -- because
tonight I think that was a perfect example of you scored from all over in
every kind of different way. Could you talk about how much work you've put
into that?  
MAYA MOORE: Probably the biggest and hardest area for me this year has been in
the post. Coming out of high school you don't really have to have post moves
if you're taller and more athletic than everybody you face.  
And coming in as a freshman I absolutely worked -- even junior team in high
school I worked on my outside shot, my 3s. I just didn't get to do it a lot in
high school. So coming here, my 3-point shot I've been trying to keep
consistent.  
But he constantly challenges me. It's more of a mental thing, just to find
different ways to score. Don't settle for the outside jumper. Post up. When I
have mismatches, I'm looking more to post up. And Tina gave me a great pass in
the first half. And that's fun, when you can mix it up and score different
ways. That's what makes basketball fun.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Are you comfortable when the score gets uncomfortable, with your team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You know, I really enjoyed coaching the game tonight. I
thought it was a lot of fun. We've played a lot of basketball this year. And,
you know, there haven't been a lot of opportunities where we've been
challenged and we've been pushed to that extent that we were tonight.  
And I kind of enjoy that. I do. I enjoy that. I get a kick out of it. Just
like Maya said, we like the challenge. We like the competitiveness of the
game. Makes you feel like you really accomplished something at the end of the
night. That's how we feel tonight. Like we really earned that win. We really
accomplished something.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think about the one-on-one battles between Tina
Charles and Brittney Griner tonight?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I thought it went -- it went about the way I thought it would
go. Brittney was going to get X number of points and there's nothing you can
do about it. She's going to block some shots and there's nothing you can do
about it.  
I also knew Tina was going to get hers. Tina's a senior. She's been around a
little bit. She knows what she needs to do. And I think that might be the best
player Brittney's ever played against in her short college career. So I would
expect Tina to come out on top in that matchup, her being a senior.  
But as you saw during the course of the game, when Brittney Griner decides
she's going to score, there's not much anybody can do about it, including Tina
Charles.  
So that matchup went the way I thought it would go. And I also didn't think
they would have a good matchup for Maya Moore.  
  
Q. You said when Brittney decides she wants to score there's not much people
can do about it. Seems like that's kind of true for Maya too, especially with
the versatility. I guess if you could expand on some of the things she said
about how hard she has worked on being so versatile?  
COACH AURIEMMA: When Maya Moore was a freshman, she just caught it and shot
it. And she shot 3s and ran around the court, and that was the extent of the
game for her. And what we've been trying to work on with Maya is what happens
when those 3s don't show themselves and we can't get them, what are you going
to do?  
And I think she has put a lot of time in reading defenses and made a couple of
great cuts today and read a couple of great screens.  
And our kids are always quick to acknowledge her. We ran a couple of things
specifically for her after they got it to four or five or three whatever it
was. She made a couple of big buckets and the kids on the bench were yelling:
Great read, Maya. As soon as they saw Maya pop open they were commenting on
what a great read she made. I don't know that she would have been able to do
that a couple of years ago.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about what it is being one step away from
your ultimate goal for the year of the national championship and winning two
consecutive undefeated seasons?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I just thought of that when you said it. Because I was
thinking today about wanting to play Tuesday night. I really want us to play
well against Baylor. I want us to win because I really want to play Tuesday
night.  
But until you just mentioned it, it didn't dawn on me that there was anything
else at stake other than winning the national championship. So you know the
feeling right now that I have and the team has is exactly the same feeling we
had last year after we won our semifinal game.  
This is what we came here to do. And the fact that we're playing a really,
really good team I think makes it even better. We're playing a team again for
the second time like we played Louisville last year for the third time. So
there's a lot of familiar feelings that are going to be going through us these
next 48 hours.  
But I did mention to the team at one point that if Louisville had cut it to 3
last year in the semifinal game, I wonder how we would have reacted knowing we
had lost the year before in the semifinal game. That's why when they cut it to
3 this year, they had been there before. They knew what to expect. They knew
what to do. And they did it.  
So going into Tuesday night there's a sense of confidence. They know what they
have to do. They know they can do it. They've done it before. And that's the
best you can hope for right now and then play the game.  
  
Q. Stanford didn't get to the final quite the same way you guys did. They
had two close games and lost two games, obviously. Does that matter come
Tuesday night?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I don't think so. I don't think so. No. Their game against
Xavier was something else, though. It's funny, Tara would be the first one to
tell you they're really, really fortunate to be here. But once you get here,
then you still have to take advantage of it.  
So they caught a break when that poor kid missed those two layups. But they
didn't have any aftereffects of that because they came here and they beat a
good Oklahoma team.  
Sometimes when you get a second life as a team, you tend to make the most of
it if you're a really good team. And I think they're a really good team.  
I don't think it hurts them or helps them Tuesday night, what's happened. And
I don't think it hurts or helps us what's happened, you know? I hope they're
as tired as we are tonight. I know my guys are tired.  
  
Q. Is this what you had in mind when you recruited Kelly?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Kelly Faris? Oh, yeah. She's great, isn't she? I told her at
one point late in the game, I said: That's really cool you could come here as
a freshman and play in your first Final Four and the semifinals and played as
well as you played. Get six assists and four rebounds and play great defense.  
She impacted the game tremendously without scoring. That's what I saw her
doing in high school all the time. The kid has never lost in the postseason.
High school or college now. She won four state championships and she's still
winning.  
It's something about that kid that's pretty special. And I'm just glad she
didn't go to Butler like all those other guys (laughter). I'm glad we got her.  
  
Q. First of all, tonight, were they doing anything that actually frustrated
your 3-point shooters or was it just the basketball gods? The second half of
that is looking ahead to Tuesday night, what do you feel you have to do to
defend the title, and is there anything you think that Stanford could do to
upset that?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I have been saying all along that it's not preordained,
you know, that you still have to come out here and make shots. That's the key
to -- it's called basketball, as somebody told me one time. You've got to put
the ball in the basket, damn it.  
And what happens is we had a couple of games during this tournament where we
made 11 of them. I mean, everything we put up went in. And then you show up
tonight and, just like I thought, it's not easy to shoot the ball in these
environments.  
One, it's not easy to shoot the ball in the Final Four, because this isn't a
game in January in the middle of nowhere. You're playing in front of 25,000
people. You know every shot means more than it did two weeks ago or three
weeks ago or a month ago.  
So it's not easy to make shots as it is. Now you put them in a big dome. We
have absolutely nothing to look at that reminds you of anything back home or
on the road, and it's just hard to make shots in the Final Four.  
And, you know, we've got two young kids that didn't make shots. This is
Caroline's first Final Four. And she's very emotional kid and tried too hard,
probably. And Tiffany, Tiffany is -- she's only good when she's falling down.
And so if I can get her to shoot 3s while falling down, she'll make a couple
of them. She will. She only gets to the line and scores when she's falling
down or getting hit. So maybe somebody should punch her while she's shooting a
3, then she's got a chance.  
But shooting is shooting. We could come out Tuesday night and make 15 3s, but
if we shoot the way we shot tonight we'll be in trouble on Tuesday night,
because Stanford's a little bit different offensively than Baylor. They just
have a lot of offense.  
I don't know what they shot tonight. I didn't see the stat sheet on their
game, but they're a hard team to defend. They may be the hardest team to play
against in America. For us, anyway, because of all the offensive players they
have.  
  
Q. They shot 39 percent.  
COACH AURIEMMA: They shot 39 percent. Good, based on 2. What did we shoot? 41
percent. Good. Maybe the first team to 50 wins Tuesday. Why don't we do that?
I would like that. First team to 50 wins. Wait a minute. They went 1-for-15
from the 3-point line? See, they'll make 10 against us, I guarantee you. Mark
it down. They'll make 10. That's the way it works.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  

Stanford  73  
Oklahoma - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: I'm pleased to welcome up to the podium Stanford head coach
Tara VanDerveer and student-athletes Jayne Appel, Kayla Pedersen and Nneka
Ogwumike.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I first want to compliment Oklahoma on a great season and
great job that Sherri Coale did with losing the Paris twins and Whitney Hand.
To be in this game I think it speaks really well to their team.  
And, you know, it was a battle and it was very physical. Obviously, I think,
Nneka had a great game, and Jayne and Kayla battled in there. It was very
physical. And I thought we did an excellent job really taking care of the
ball.  
But it was a little bit -- they made a great run. We stayed in there. But I
was hoping that we could just kind of keep that space, keep that 14-, 15-point
lead the whole way through.  
But I thought our team worked hard, and we're very excited to be playing
Tuesday night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Nneka, Sheryl Swoopes scored 47 points in the '93 championship game. And
other than her, you're now in second place in the Final Four among scorers.
Were you aware of that? Has anyone told you that yet? And what do you think
about being in that company?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I wasn't aware of it, actually. But it's great to be
considered one of the greatest. But I would have to say it's because of my
teammates. Without them, I wouldn't be getting passes. I wouldn't be getting
great screens from Kayla, passes from Jayne and all my guards.  
But it's great, but there's more left, so...  
  
Q. Nneka, did you have kolaches for breakfast?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: No.  
  
Q. Could you talk about that last play, the long pass that sealed the
deal?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: You know, it's one of several time-and-score situation
plays that we go over in practice. And we ran it. I admitted to Coach and
Kayla that I didn't think I would actually be open.  
But Kayla asked Tara if she's open should I throw it, and I was open. And I
thought it was an awesome play to run. It was definitely spur of the moment. A
great coaching decision. We executed it right and it worked.  
  
Q. Kayla and Jayne, from your vantage point, what does a 38-point night look
like from your angle?  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Awesome.  
JAYNE APPEL: Do it every single time.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: We're so proud of her. She really hung with it, especially in
the first half. If we can get that out of her every game, we'll be happy with
that. She was a monster down low and really helped us today.  
JAYNE APPEL: I don't know if I can really add much to that. I think this is
Nneka every game. Hopefully we can get it on Tuesday.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Might I say, though, I learned from the best, because I
know no one forgets Jayne's 46-point game last year. So I think I learned from
the best and they helped me out.  
  
Q. For any of you that would like to answer, maybe two, but did last Monday
night's game, the way it was so tight, did that help when it got tight
tonight? Did that help keep the composure and breaking the press and then
sealing it?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, no one really wants close games. But it's different
-- it's different from preparing in practice for it and actually being in the
game and it happening. Because time is on the line. And everything is at
stake.  
And so I think Monday definitely gave us that experience. Disregarding Monday,
though, when games do get close, I think our team does an excellent job of
staying composed and poised. And so we did a really good job of that tonight.
And we just listened to the coaches.  
And we had confidence in ourselves which caused us to extend the lead when the
time expired.  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Yeah, Jayne just pointed out to me that we were winning the
entire time, and I think that really helped. I mean, just knowing, guys, calm
down, we're still up, we're still winning the game, it's all going to be okay.  
So Jayne, like, saying that to us, she really helped us keep composure, and of
course I think the Xavier game did help.  
  
Q. I'm sorry, during the timeout Jayne --  
KAYLA PEDERSEN: Jayne was always, Come on guys, like, You got it, you got it.
We're fine. Just calming everyone down and making sure that we're all on the
same page.  
  
Q. Nneka, how many family members? What kind of an entourage did you have
here? And did you ever imagine -- I know you have something left to do here,
your job is not done, but did you ever imagine that your Texas homecoming
would turn out like this?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Oh, absolutely. They never fail to mystify me. They're
really good at supporting me. I always get texts. Even when I'm in California,
I get texts, calls, e-mails. My high school coaches, my high school teachers,
all of my immediate family is here. And I'm really glad that Chiney also got
to sit down there with them. And the support is wonderful.  
And I'm not surprised at all how many people were there.  
  
Q. Were you surprised you had this kind of a game?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Oh, I mean --  
  
Q. For a Texas homecoming.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I just went out and played. I did whatever my team needed
me to do. Everyone was giving me advice. I always tell: All of my teammates on
the bench, they're always in my ear. They're always telling me good things to
do. And my coaches are always giving me advice and helping me throughout the
game.  
And on the court I feel so comfortable with my teammates, and that I think
helps in being successful in any way possible when we play.  
  
Q. You were winning the game the whole game. But they won the second half.
And I'd just like you to talk about what changes they made, what specifically
they did that brought them back so close into the picture, that close to the
game, and how did you respond to that?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think they hit some outside shots that weren't falling for them
in the first half. And they got some big rebounds on us. There was a series of
a couple of plays where I think that we kind of, you know -- didn't box out.
And I think they got some big boards on us.  
I think those three rebounds were big ones for us and was kind of the
difference in the second half.  
  
Q. Nneka, can you remember a bigger game you've had on this big a stage?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: For myself?  
  
Q. Yes.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, a lot of people come up to me about the Oregon game
at Oregon. But, I mean, I honestly don't -- it's always good to reminisce.
It's not really something I focus on.  
I think about what was the result of the game. And we were in the locker room
after the game, we were just getting pumped up and excited because we won.  
I mean, there will always be individual performances, but I think it's all
about the team.  
  
Q. When you went down near the end of the game, what happened there?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Jeanette made an awesome pass to me, and I think McFarland
-- is that her name? Yeah, McFarland, No. 53, was boxing me out before I came
down.  
And I honestly didn't know what was going on, but I kind of landed awkwardly.  
  
Q. What part of your body?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Just upon impact, pretty much my whole body. But I shook it
off and came back in.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tara, when Sherri opened her comments she said they didn't have an answer
for Nneka and I asked her is there an answer for Nneka. I would ask you the
same thing: Is there an answer for Nneka?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I thought Nneka played really well. And she really got the
job done on the block for us. I think that she stepped up where maybe some --
like some shots for Jayne didn't go for her, some shots for other people on
the perimeter didn't go.  
But she battled, and what I was really excited about, this is a very physical
game and Nneka got in there and kind of stood her ground in a physical game. I
think it shows how much she's improved and how competitive she is.  
  
Q. Assuming, Coach, that Connecticut advances out of its semifinal tonight,
what will your team bring into that game that wasn't there when you met in
December, that wasn't there last year?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think our team will bring confidence, knowing that we've
improved a lot, and I think our team will be excited; if that in fact is who
we play, they'll be excited about it.  
We know we need to play better and shoot the ball better, but I think tonight
against some very athletic and aggressive team we took care of the ball well.
We got the ball to a hot player on the court.  
We had some people missing some shots that really need to go for us in a
routine. But I think our team will be really excited and will want to have a
great game.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what got Oklahoma back in the game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think Jayne hit it. They had some shooters that knocked
down a 3. Amanda Thompson made two of them, I think, in the second half. How
many 3s did they make in the second half? They had four. Were all four in the
second half? I mean, they hit some shots.  
Roethlisberger hit one. And Thompson hit two. And then we were really working
inside, and Hartman hit one.  
But their 3-point shooting was about as bad as ours. Theirs was a little
better.  
  
Q. You said that you've seen Nneka mature in the way she handled herself in
this physical game. One of her high school teachers or coaches described her
as the kind of kid who would ask for permission before forgiveness, whereas
other kids would do it the other way. Is that a part of her that you think has
matured?  
COACH VANDERVEER: She's always been mature in that way. Her game has matured.
She's doing things less, I don't want to say mechanically, but she's
confident. She's in the flow. She knows what we're looking for. She's playing
with a lot of confidence.  
And like last year everything was new for her. She had to learn a whole new
set of plays and it took a while. But I think she finished really strong. She
played very well in the tournament. And then this year she came in after her
U.S.A. Basketball experience, her confidence being named Pac-10 player of the
year, being named All-American. She showed why she's All-American. And I
thought she had a great game.  
  
Q. Was a point of emphasis going into the game to take advantage of your
size and try to push them inside and did you kind of go to that more and more
as the game wore on? Did you try to exploit that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think there were a lot of things we wanted to do. First of
all, we worked as hard as we could to keep Danielle Robinson in front of us.
She's a great player. Local kid. I've known her since she was a little girl.
And she's a terrific athlete. And just a great player and congratulations to
Danielle for such an outstanding year.  
Stevenson is an excellent 3-point shooter. And Ros Gold-Onwude worked her tail
off to make sure she didn't get 3s.  
We were looking to help in off of their three players, and they brought in
some kids that hit some shots, doubling in. I think that they were more
physical than maybe I thought. I thought we had some times where we're going
in and going inside and they really bodied them a lot, but we ran on them.  
We got out and we ran, and I think it tired out especially their bigs, and a
real credit to Jayne who has not been conditioning on the court. She really
ran the floor really well. Made some great plays for us. Missed a couple
layups but was running really hard for us and was, I thought, a great
competitor.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the baseball pass to Nneka at the end of the game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I called that play (laughter).  
  
Q. That wasn't Amy?  
COACH VANDERVEER: That was me. I don't know. I just felt like we had the speed
advantage. And Kayla wouldn't throw unless she was wide open. And Nneka wasn't
going to shoot it unless she was wide open.  
You know, they were on a run and they were feeling some enthusiasm and some
momentum. So I think that kind of slammed the door.  
The other one Nneka had is the overhead pass to Jayne, was how did she get so
wide open? I have no idea. But you're not going to -- a team like Oklahoma got
down and to their credit they came back. But we've seen that from them all
year long. They've been battlers all year long.  
  
Q. My second question, without sounding like the wet blanket, your guards
were 4 for 18. Can you beat Connecticut with guards that shoot 4 for 18?  
COACH VANDERVEER: 4 for 18. That doesn't sound too good. I think I have
confidence in our guards. I have confidence in how Ros is playing and
Jeanette, and I think if we're playing Connecticut or Baylor, whoever it will
be, we're playing for a national championship. And these kids will -- I think
they'll really come out and play and relax and just knock them down.  
I have confidence -- I thought JJ took a good shot. Kayla is taking good
shots. Our team was taking good shots. We weren't taking bad shots. Joslyn is
a great shooter for us.  
Some of it is maybe just getting used to playing in this dome. Maybe -- they
didn't shoot that well either. I don't know how these guys are shooting out
here. But I have confidence in our perimeter shooting, and I'm excited to be
playing.  
I'm absolutely thrilled for this team to come this far. And I know that if we
get those looks, they will knock them down.  
  
Q. Tara, can you talk about just going through emotionally wrenching games
as you have?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, this is what makes the struggle, that makes it
fun. Honestly, I don't know. I mean, it makes it challenging. And it brings us
together. This is a team that has had to -- we've had to rally a little bit in
situations. And I really feel that our preseason schedule, our run right
through the Pac-10 has people very confident, has people very close. This is a
team that whatever happens on Tuesday night is all good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'm pleased to introduce up here at the podium Baylor head
coach Kim Mulkey and student-athletes Kelli Griffin, Melissa Jones, and
Morghan Medlock.  
COACH MULKEY: I don't usually have an opening statement, but I will today.
We're thrilled to be playing in the Final Four. We're especially thrilled it's
being held in our home state of Texas. And, again, I want to encourage any fan
in the area that's not bought a ticket to please do so.  
  
Q. M.J., you talked this week about the next 40 minutes, that's what you've
got to focus on. But as far as UConn and their team, obviously they don't have
many weaknesses. Is there one area that you guys know you have to focus on,
like just is it turnovers? What is it?  
MELISSA JONES: We have a very good basketball team obviously being No. 1 in
the nation. And there isn't a weakness on their team. Every single player is a
threat. The thing that Baylor needs to focus on is just making smart decisions
and not turning the ball over and falling into UConn's -- their game.  
  
Q. I don't know how to ask this except to ask it. How did the punch change
your team? Make you closer? Cause you to circle the wagons? Just talk about
how it changed your team.  
KELLI GRIFFIN: I don't know if it had much of a change. It was an incident
that happened that shouldn't have. We definitely tried to be there for
Brittney and just try to keep her head up, be there if she needed to talk
about it.  
But I don't really think it had a significant change to the team.  
MELISSA JONES: I think that it's helped all of us kind of grow from it,
especially Brittney. I think everyone in our lives at some point let our
emotions just get the best of us. It was just extremely out of character for
that to happen.  
However, when things get heated in a game, like now, she's the first one to
step up and say, hey, guys, let's calm it down, let's keep it cool and let's
just be Baylor. She's grown so much from it and it's progressed throughout the
rest of the team for us to do the same.  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: It's definitely something we don't even talk about anymore.
We're just here to get two wins and bring home the trophy.  
  
Q. Kelli, can you talk about -- Kim said this is a Final Four in the state
of Texas. Your home state. Talk about the excitement of playing in this
state.  
KELLI GRIFFIN: I'm definitely excited. My family gets to come. They don't get
to come see me a lot. My mom does, but it's nice to have -- to be able to have
your family to come out and support when they don't get a chance to all the
time. And it's definitely nice to have all of our fans in driving distance to
San Antonio to be able to come out and support. And it's just a good feeling
to be back home.  
  
Q. How difficult was it for you to miss most of the Big 12 season, have to
sit there and watch? And I know it was Coach's plan to try to get you healthy
for this time and it's worked out very nicely. But what was it like? And
particularly what did you try to do to help the freshman that were out there
in your place to get better?  
MELISSA JONES: I'm a firm believer that everything happens for a reason. My
injury, obviously it's something that's very frustrating to deal with, knowing
that the game you love you're not able to play.  
However, I felt like being on the sidelines helped put a different perspective
on how I saw things, and it was able to get a lot of the freshmen and younger
classmen to get some quality minutes. And they've grown so much ever since
that. And putting me on the sideline kind of helped me see things that I
haven't seen playing on the court before.  
And so, for me, to just kind of help my teammates out and telling them what I
saw just I think helped the team.  
  
Q. Morghan, what were some of your expectations for this year? And do you
feel like you've met them?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: Well, actually we have a notebook that we get at the start of
every season in this program. And it actually says on the cover: Excuses are
expectations. So once we got that, one of my expectations, especially being a
senior, was to get to the Final Four. And I had that expectation last year.
And I knew it would happen coming into this program. I just didn't know when.
And I'm really glad it happened this year.  
  
Q. What are your feelings on playing UConn? Nervous or excited?  
KELLI GRIFFIN: I think I'm more excited than nervous. It takes a lot to get me
nervous. And I'm excited to be in the Final Four no matter who is playing. But
it's definitely exciting to be able to play the No. 1 team in the country.  
MELISSA JONES: I think that this is something that you grow up wanting to do.
Ever since you were a little girl you want to play the best team. And
thankfully we've been blessed and in a position to do so.  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I'm really excited to have a chance to be able to knock them
off, stop the winning streak that everyone's talking about. And I'm just
excited just to be in the Final Four in general.  
  
Q. Can you all talk about how Brittney's presence shapes and changes your
defense?  
KELLI GRIFFIN: It definitely has a huge impact on our defensive end. Some of
us use Brittney as an excuse when we get beat off the dribble, to have her
inside to block shots. But, I mean, like M.J. always says, we're just happy
she's on our side and not anyone else's.  
MELISSA JONES: I think when somebody talks about Baylor defense, the first
thing that comes out their mouth is Brittney Griner. And I think that's a very
solid statement in the fact that if she's not blocking a shot she's altering
it or she's altering a play that's set for an opposing team just because of
her big presence in the middle.  
So she helps out a lot.  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: And to add to all that, I think it allows our perimeter
defense to extend out and pressure because they know we have a 6'8" kid who's
going to help you, like Kelli said, if we do get beat. It just allows us to
have more confidence and just to pressure opponents.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about the UConn winning streak and how -- I mean, the
Oklahoma coach was making jokes about this being the UConn Invitational. What
do you guys talk about when you talk about UConn and how do you get yourself
in the right frame of mind?  
KELLI GRIFFIN: Well, we don't really talk about that win streak much. I think
it might have been mentioned in our locker room probably once, and I think
that was yesterday. We don't really look at that. We are just looking at the
next 40 minutes. We know that UConn is a great team and it's going to be tough
to beat them. But we don't really mention their win streak much.  
  
Q. A few weeks ago Brittney was known as the big girl who threw the punch.
And the last couple of weeks Brittney is known as the great basketball player
who just totally has dominated the game with 35 blocks, 14 in one game. Do you
think that in any way that she was inspired after her suspension to show what
she's all about, rather than any perceived notions some people may have had
because of the incident?  
MELISSA JONES: I think that Brittney Griner should be known as the great
player who has been dominating the NCAA tournament, and I feel like she's the
girl who is going to change the game altogether.  
And I think it's not really talked about -- her punch was extremely talked
about because it was so out of character. I think that's why it was blown up,
because it's not something, if you know Brittney Griner, that it would ever
even happen. So that shouldn't really be what is talked about her, because of
what she does for this game, what she does for women's basketball and not just
Baylor.  
  
Q. Coach Auriemma was here just a little while ago. He said one of the
strengths of their team is if they have a 38-point lead and there's a loose
ball and somebody doesn't fall on it or there's a missed defensive assignment,
that everybody gets pissed; that they have that attack mentality all the time.
Do you think you guys have a little bit of that and do you have to play with
that to beat UConn?  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I actually think we have a lot of that. We go into every game
and every scouting report with the mindset to attack whoever the opponent is.
If you're better than us, not better than us, or just the same, we always
think attack first. And, I don't know, I guess being the No. 1 team in the
country they should have that mindset also. But we're Baylor and we think the
same way.  
  
Q. M.J., and I know the open practices aren't the most intense, but this is
a very loose team. Does some of that come from the freshmen or is it just
coming from everybody on the team how relaxed you are and how much fun you're
having here?  
MELISSA JONES: I think it comes from everybody in the entire program, from the
freshmen to the coaching staff. Some of us are serious and want to get down to
business. But we have those who want to help relax us, and I think everything
goes hand in hand and has been working so far in the tournament.  
  
Q. How do you deal with all the pressure in practices?  
KELLI GRIFFIN: I don't feel much pressure in practice. We just focus. We try
to listen to scouting reports and listen to the coaches and stay on task. So,
you know, you do that and pretty much practice will flow pretty good.  
MELISSA JONES: I think head coach, Coach Mulkey, does a good job of being
really intense and keeping us on our toes. Like they were talking about
earlier, if we don't run off a loose ball or if we're not putting out extra
effort to get a rebound, that's when we get in trouble for it. So we're always
trying to work our best in practice and everything.  
MORGHAN MEDLOCK: I think our practices are fine. They're not long and drawn
out. They're two hours, two and a half hours, depending on which part of the
season we're in, and we just get right after. We're intense. We get right to
the point. We get in there, shoot, take care of our business.  
As long as we do that we stay on task in practice, there's never any pressure
the next day when you come to practice or during the basketball game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Kim, what effect do you think the punch had on your team and the way you
played and the way you coached?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't think it's had an effect, other than I had to make a
disciplinary decision and suspend her and do other things and reprimand and
things and requirements that she has to abide by.  
But as far as play on the floor, I don't think it made us -- well, maybe the
effect was we lost the last game to Texas at home. That had a definite effect,
on her presence on the floor. But if you're talking about circling the wagons
and playing better, we were playing good before the suspension, and we
continued to play good after the suspension. So I guess the one game that she
missed affected our team for sure.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Morghan Medlock a little bit, what you've seen in her
since she's come into your program to where she is today and some of the
expectations you've had for her?  
COACH MULKEY: Morghan Medlock transferred. Before I take any transfers, I have
a pretty tough one-on-one with them and basically try to run them off and get
answers. Because, remember this, they transfer for a reason.  
And after having a one-on-one session with her, I was convinced that she
needed Baylor more than Baylor needed her. And for things that had happened to
her off the floor, and obviously after her mother's murder, I thought that we
were the best thing in Morghan's life other than her own family to help
console her and help her heal. And I still think that today.  
On the floor, Morghan went through a period when Melissa Jones was injured,
and she basically was not playing very good basketball. And I know she felt
it. I know being the only senior and the only -- one of only three that got
lots of minutes the year before, she wanted to do well.  
And I thought, consequently, she tried to do too much. And slowly but surely,
with the help of the coaches, she figured out, let the game come to her. Don't
try to do too much. And we're a very, very good basketball team when Morghan
Medlock quietly gets you a double-double. And I think she's done that quite
often in the latter part of the season.  
  
Q. I take it having a team with some younger players has tested you along
the way and drilled you. Could you talk about the mix and how I guess some
days you've wanted to kill them and some days you wanted to --  
COACH MULKEY: You're right on with that. Duke game is a classic example. You
really felt at the three-minute mark how are we even going to pull this out,
and within seconds you're going to win the ball game.  
And I think that that's been the case all year, especially with Melissa
Jones's injury. The silver lining to her injury is that we're in a Final Four
and I'm not afraid of those freshmen anymore. They're still going to make
mistakes, but I'm not afraid to put them in the game. They've had enough
experience on the floor, and you just hang in there with them.  
You take the good with the bad. They will make you look so bad on the
defensive end of the floor sometimes, and they'll go do something on the
defensive end of the floor that's just spectacular. And you can sneak one or
two in the lineup, but when you play as many as we do on the floor at the same
time, it scares you sometimes.  
  
Q. I understand on the bus ride down you guys watched a certain movie. It
was Miracle I believe. Was that -- whose choice was that and if you had
anything to do with it, was there a particular message behind watching that
movie?  
COACH MULKEY: It was three hours. And, sure, there's a message behind it.
We're the underdogs. The hockey team beating the Russians was big. I'd love to
tell you that that's going to motivate us, and, man, we're going to go out and
beat UConn, but, to tell you the truth, I think half the girls fell asleep.  
Hockey in Texas is not something they can relate to (laughter). But I didn't
want to listen to some of those movies that I've had to listen to all year.
And I thought, this is my three-hour bus ride, so put it on. Some of them
watched it. But some of them, they couldn't tell you if it was on. They had
their headsets on and probably fell asleep.  
  
Q. I take it you stayed awake and watched it.  
COACH MULKEY: I did watch it. I sure did. Yep.  
  
Q. You knew that having Brittney and this young group was going to make you
good eventually. But could you talk about it happening to this -- being this
good this soon?  
COACH MULKEY: I knew we were very talented. I said all year long, this team is
going to be special. But I didn't know when it would happen. And to have the
expectation of being in a Final Four, I don't think, would have been fair to
them. They were conscious of where the Final Four was and where we're located
and it sure would be convenient.  
But you can't put that type of pressure on a team and on a player that's just
being introduced to the college game.  
  
Q. You talked about the other day playing that underdog role. Obviously it's
pretty easy for this one to play that underdog card. But how inside your team
do you sell them on or believing that they can do this?  
COACH MULKEY: Maybe it's just my personality, Leon's personality. You know,
this ain't our first rodeo. Leon has been to 14 of these; I've been to 13 of
these. Geno, how many has he been to? 11?  
So we've been here, but these kids haven't been here. And they're excited, and
they need to enjoy it. And they need to go out there and relax and have fun
and dunk and shoot. That's not where our work is done.  
Our work is done before we ever come here. Our work is done when we leave here
and we go to that film room tonight and we go to that next hour practice.  
I don't have to spend my time coaching them because they're fearful. What I
have to spend my time doing is coaching them because they're still freshmen
and I know the mistakes that they're going to make against an experienced team
tomorrow.  
And so you teach them the game, the Xs and Os and the strengths and
weaknesses. You don't have to talk about a win streak. You don't have to talk
about the No. 1 team in the country, because you're so focused on the Xs and
Os part of it, and helping them develop into a better basketball player, which
will make us a better basketball team.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned how well your team was playing at the end of the
regular season and into the playoffs. What were the factors that turned a very
good basketball team into the team that has come this far in the playoffs?  
COACH MULKEY: I think it's Melissa Jones's injury without question. She was
told not to play or I was told she couldn't play two days prior to the Big 12
beginning at Oklahoma State being our first game.  
And we had to quickly, on the fly, start playing kids that we didn't want to
play a lot of minutes. And that was the freshmen. And we would win a game,
we'd lose a game. We'd lose a disappointing game, then we would win a game.  
And I just think that we put enough wins together that they became more
confident. And then we got M.J. back, and that piece of our puzzle, that glue
that was missing, was back. And we're better because of it.  
  
Q. M.J. said that UConn has no weaknesses. Obviously Coach Brock, the rest
of the coaches, you guys have been looking at film trying to find something to
attack or expose or whatever. I guess the question is: Is there a balance
between what you can attack and still being yourself, what got you here?  
COACH MULKEY: I think so. UConn -- we can't compete with them on the offensive
end. They score at all positions. They score anytime they want to, transition,
half court.  
That's really not what we do, because we're still young. And we'll take bad
shots. We'll take unadvised shots. We have to be smarter on the offensive end
of the floor than they do.  
I think both defenses will play extremely hard and try to take away our
strengths. We'll try to take away their strengths, but I think the offensive
end of the floor we may just have to be a little more creative.  
  
Q. Not that you would tell us, are you going to sell them on the Rocky
angle, on you can make history, you can shock the world, be on the evening
news, anything like that?  
COACH MULKEY: No. See, I don't have to. I don't have to. They're aware of the
streak. They watch TV and they read the newspaper. Of course, they know things
before I do through computers and all that stuff.  
But I'm going to be me. And whatever I do to motivate them in that locker room
prior to the game will just be something that I think of at the last minute.
It really won't be anything that I have to plan. This is the Final Four. And
if I have to motivate them and use some kind of eat a worm or something, then
-- we're not going to win anyway if I have to do that.  
I think they're just at the Final Four. They're loose. They're young. They're
excited. They're talented.  
And who knows what you're going to see. Who knows.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

## April 3, 2010

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Danielle Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18925)

### [Amanda Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19485)

  
_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'm pleased to introduce Oklahoma head coach Sherri Coale, as
well as student-athletes Danielle Robinson and Amanda Thompson.  
COACH COALE: Obviously we're excited to be here. Love the city of San Antonio
and the way they host the Final Four. Nobody in America does it better than
this city. Our kids have enjoyed being here, and now we're ready to compete.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Danielle and Amanda, in Oklahoma Sherri Coale's a rock star. Can you talk
about how -- has any of that gone beyond the state borders, any of your
travels with her, have you had any experiences that can speak to her celebrity
status nationally?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Everywhere we go, Coach Coale is known. You just hear
people, we'll be walking, Oh, it's Coach Coale from Oklahoma. I mean any
particular incident, I can't recall. But I know she's pretty well known around
the nation.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I think she's pretty high status, I mean, even out here. We
walked the River a little bit and it was only a couple of us and someone was
like, Is Sherri Coale with you? I said, No, she's probably in the room
somewhere.  
But she's pretty high. She's pretty high. Celeb.  
  
Q. Danielle, there were a couple of items in the media guide I was intrigued
by. One of them, as you could probably guess, is you have a notation: Not my
team, Stanford. And that was probably done quite a while ago. And, secondly,
if I may, the other item is if you were not playing for Oklahoma, you'd
probably be playing for Cal. How close were you to going to play for Cal?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Cal had been recruiting me before Coach Boyle had got
there. And I just really enjoyed my visits up there. And early on, I guess you
could say, Cal was at the top just because something important to me was being
close to home so my family could watch me play. And Cal is pretty close in
distance.  
And so I definitely took that into consideration when I was making my
decision.  
  
Q. What about Stanford?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I grew up watching them, you know, for many, many years.
And then as I took more and more visits and, you know -- I respect the program
a lot. Tara VanDerveer is a great coach. She has great players. But I just
didn't feel it was the right fit for me.  
  
Q. For both Amanda and Danielle. You guys have played the toughest schedule
in the country. During the season you played three teams that wound up being
No. 1 seeds and now you're playing a No. 1 seed in Stanford. How is that
schedule playing particularly tough nonconference games, how does that help
you get to where you are now?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I feel like it's helped us a lot. We faced all different kind
of teams, all different kind of styles. We've come from behind. We've had
leads. It's just given us opportunity to experience different kind of play.  
And a long time in the tournament, you know, you need that because when you're
scouting somebody, you can say, okay, we can compare that to a team we played
and it helps us go along and helps our game plan.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Like she talked about, we see a variety of teams throughout
the whole season, especially in nonconference. It prepares us well for the Big
12 conference, and that prepares us for the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Danielle, could you talk about playing against Jeanette Pohlen in the CIF
final in, what was it, 2007, and what you remember about her as a player and
also what -- if you've watched her develop over the years at Stanford and
obviously she's made headlines in the last week?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: You know, we played our senior year in the state
championship. She wasn't the point guard then as she is for Stanford now.  
She's a great player. I think she led her team for the whole season. I think
they only had one loss coming into Long Beach, if I recall that correctly. So
she was a great player, great leader.  
I got the chance to play her this past summer, learned a lot about her. She's
a great person. We've actually become pretty close friends, and we keep in
contact, especially since she's close to home in Palo Alto.  
So excited for where she's at. I was excited when she hit that shot last week.
And ready to play her, I guess.  
  
Q. Amanda, just to pick up on what you were saying earlier, what do you
think accounts for why Sherri is so popular? Is it just victory, or is it her
style or personality? What do you think it is?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I think it's just the way she carries herself every day. I
know she pays attention to more the little things. She's all about tradition
and just doing the right thing.  
And people see that. And they feel that and they just gained a lot of respect
for her. And I gained a lot of respect for her for doing that. And it just
makes everybody else follow in her footsteps, and she just makes great players
and she plays great games and she's not afraid to challenge us. That's why
she's so popular around.  
So she's just a great person.  
  
Q. I wonder, your program has been involved with some memorable games with
Stanford in the past. Does the rivalry you have with that school still
resonate with newer players who don't have any experience? And also how much
would it mean to end that losing streak you have against Stanford that
stretches to four now?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I'm not really familiar with a couple. I just know the one
that's the most recent. I mean, it's a great rivalry for women's basketball. I
don't know how big it is. But I guess I could say it's somewhat of a personal
thing for me being from California.  
But we're just going to execute our game plan against a great Stanford team.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, like she said, I'm not familiar, but I've heard about
the games in the past, and it was against Oklahoma and I feel like I'm a part
of that family so I think it's going to be a rivalry however long it goes on.  
That's how we'll play the game, as if we just lost to Sanford last year.  
  
Q. For both of you, give me your thumbnail analysis of Stanford and what you
all have to do to beat them?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: They have really tall posts down there, and they just execute
very well. So we definitely have to take away their cadence and disrupt what
they do and outwork them and just play hard.  
I think everybody's going to be good at this time of the year, so we just to
do what we do well, to stop what they do well.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We have to speed them up, use our athleticism to our
advantage. We definitely have to block out against them. They're extremely
good on the boards, especially Kayla Pedersen. We know that we have an
advantage with our athleticism.  
  
Q. For both players, a lot of teams, when they get to this point, look back
at a turning point in the season. Outside of the Whitney Hand injury, there
doesn't seem like there was. Was this just a building process and a maturity
that you guys reached to get to this point, or what's your feeling on that?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I think one of our turning points was the loss against
Texas at home. We knew that for us it was unacceptable, and we had to make
changes. And we went into that locker room and that's what we did. And from
here on out we've been playing that better.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I think we've had several turning points throughout this
year. You know, those are definitely one of the key ones.  
But I think that great basketball, it has a lot of changing points. In order
to be a great team you have to go up and down and go through struggles, and
when you overcome them, that's when you get to points like this, times in the
Final Four. You don't really look back on them; you just build on it and learn
from them and keep going.  
  
Q. We're obviously here for the Connecticut Invitational, but the fact that
a lot of people are going to perceive the fact, well, it's going to be
Stanford and Connecticut in the championship game and Stanford gets the chance
to end the streak and all that. Do you get a little incentive from the fact
that maybe people are just saying, hey, it's nice Oklahoma and, to a lesser
extent, Baylor is here, but they're just kind of standing in the way of the
Stanford-Connecticut game? Does that give you guys any motivation if that's
the case?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, you know, people say what they say. I mean, they have
their opinions. But I think it just puts us in a great position to change
history. UConn is going to be UConn. Every other team is going to be
themselves. Everybody's competing for a championship.  
So we know what we expect of ourselves, so we're going to play our game and
not worry about what everybody else is saying. We're just creating a bubble
and staying within that and having fun while we're doing it.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Like Amanda said, we know what we're capable of. We don't
need the support of anybody beyond our Oklahoma circle, because we've been the
underdog all season and people didn't expect us to be here right now, and
we're here.  
  
Q. Amanda and Danielle, how do you and your teammates get along on and off
the court?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Well, we're like sisters. We're like family. I can say this
is probably the closest team since I've been here. We just have so much fun.
And, I mean, we're pretty much together I feel 20 hours a day out of the 24
hours, regardless if you see somebody on campus, stop to talk to them, or at
the gym or go to their house. We're like family.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I would have to agree. We're pretty close. And a lot of teams
it's hard to have fun and be honest at the same time and take constructive
criticism and encourage at the same time.  
I think that this team, we can do that and also have fun. You kind of learn
from each other and just enjoy every moment. I think I've enjoyed every moment
with these guys all year. And I'm just thankful that I have them as teammates.  
  
Q. Can you both talk about how last year's experience at the Final Four you
think will help you this time around?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, I feel like we got satisfied last year with just
getting here, and this year we kind of learned from that and know that we're
going to enjoy San Antonio, but we're here to do a job and we're here to get
to the next game. And hopefully we get that championship. And just never
taking our eyes off of it and just kind of live every game and play every game
like you're not going to have another one.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah, last year we settled -- we got here, we went into
halftime with a 12-point lead. And we just came out flat. And we know how hard
it is to get here, especially back to back, so we're just going to go out
there and fight like we have for our whole season. We're just going to play
for each other and go out there and have fun.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tara VanDerveer said earlier that her first Final Four -- I think she
said it was 1990. She wore a ribbon in solidarity with Oklahoma because they
were going to drop the program. Could you tell the story what it was like when
you got there: What was your office like, was it hard to recruit, what was
your salary? Probably wasn't great. What did you creatively do to build the
program and get people to come play and showing up to watch, too?  
COACH COALE: Okay, how long is this press conference? There's quite a story
there.  
When I came to Oklahoma, I have used the analogy before that it's like finding
a rusty old car out in the middle of the farm, and you think: I can do
something with this. The windows are cracked and I can fix them, the tires are
flat and I can fix them, and we can do a paint job. Okay, I can do this. And
then you open up the hood and there's no engine inside. It's a little bit
worse than you might have imagined.  
We had nothing. There was not one single player being recruited according to
the files. So I had never recruited a player before, so, okay. But I used my
network. And that's what it's all about. You know people who know people who
know people.  
And I signed Phylesha Whaley, because my college coach, I had a friend who was
Phylesha Whaley's high school -- who was a friend of Phylesha Whaley's high
school coach. I had never seen her play. I brought her in for a visit and
decided to sign her because she had great eyes and I thought she'd run through
a wall for me. She turned out to be unbelievable and holds all kinds of
records at Oklahoma now.  
And we went and found Stacey Dales in Canada and nobody had ever heard of her.
And I went and watched her in the first three passes she threw were off the
wall. And called my assistant coach: She's fabulous. I love her. I gotta have
her.  
It was just a series of really God being involved in leading us to the right
kids. I really do believe that. And knowing people and building step-by-step
and knowing that it doesn't -- if you want to build it to last, you don't do
it immediately. It takes some time.  
And we never took the Band-Aid approach. We went out and found great kids.
Character kids who believed in the way we wanted to play and believed in our
mission for building a championship program. And they came and they toiled and
Phylesha Whaley came and lived through 5-and-22 and 8-and-19 and got us to the
stinkin' Sweet 16 where we won the right to play Connecticut. Whoohoo.  
And a phenomenal group of kids who paid the price to build a foundation that
would last which allows us to be in this position today.  
So that's the Cliff Notes version.  
  
Q. While we're dealing with past history, obviously you guys had a very
simmering rivalry with Stanford in the past. Talking to the players, it sounds
like it's not quite as intense as it might have been maybe seven or eight
years ago. Is that fair to say? And could you talk about the rivalry that you
had with Tara in the past and how it's maybe evolved over the years?  
COACH COALE: You said we were 0 for our last 4? Is that right?  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
COACH COALE: What's overall series? Because I have no idea.  
  
Q. Two and four, I think.  
COACH COALE: Okay. Obviously it's not a huge rivalry with me because I have no
idea what you're talking about exactly in terms of numbers.  
Here's the thing: The only time we meet Stanford is in the NCAA tournament.
And Tara and I have tried for years to schedule. We would love to have that
home-and-home matchup. We tried. When the twins got here we tried because of
Danielle. And because of their final schedule and our final schedule, it just
has not been feasible. We've not been able to make it work.  
So when you say rivalry, I guess maybe it is. But to me the only time we meet
is when we're in the Sweet 16 or Elite Eight or the Final Four and it's the
NCAA tournament.  
Of course we're going to meet quite often because we're both getting here. And
the numbers say that you will.  
I don't sense any special rivalry with Stanford over the years, especially
with these kids, because they haven't played them. So sorry to bust your story
(laughter).  
  
Q. I'm honored to interview a rock star.  
COACH COALE: I'm honored to be at the UConn Invitational (laughter).  
  
Q. As far as the scheduling, is it a fine line between scheduling too
difficult, particularly when you're going to be in the Big 12, you know,
during the conference season, when you schedule non-conference, do you worry
ever about, you know, burning your kids out or losing too many games and
affecting their confidence? And has this team been able to handle the
difficult schedule as well as maybe any you've had?  
COACH COALE: You know, I think that's maybe one of the blessings of once being
a high school coach and just jumping up to this. I didn't know you were
supposed to worry about stuff like that. I just wanted to play the really good
guys so I could figure out how far we had to go to become one of them.  
And it seemed to work for a while. It got us into the NCAA tournament. Got us
to the Sweet 16, and I thought this seems like a pretty good way to do it. Get
me every tough team you can. Find me the best in America. I want to play home-
and-home with them.  
I just always had enough confidence in our kids that regardless of the
tenacity involved in the Big 12, we were going to win enough games to get in
the tournament.  
And when we got in the tournament, we were going to be very well prepared to
succeed there. Our goal was never just to get there; it was to get to the
tournament and win. Even back when Phylesha Whaley and I were just dreaming
about it, it was get to the tournament and win.  
And I think that schedule has played a huge role in it. I know it's built this
team's confidence. Not a doubt in my mind.  
  
Q. You had the Paris twins. You have Danielle. Is there some sort of story
to how you've been so successful recruiting in the Bay Area?  
COACH COALE: I don't know that there's really any magic to it. Obviously when
you get kids like Courtney and Ashley, who are so renowned, not only within
the state of California but across the country, but when you get Cali kids --
I know when Geno got Diana, then that opened the door.  
More people are looking at your school because there's that connection there.
And I think that probably put us on the short list. I don't know that beyond
that there's any real magic, except that there are a lot of Cali kids who love
the way people support basketball at the University of Oklahoma.  
And I know for Danielle, when she got there and saw how big of a deal it is.
It's a really big deal in Norman, Oklahoma, to be on the women's basketball
team. It's a really big deal in Norman, Oklahoma, to go watch the women's
basketball team. I think for a lot of California kids that's very attractive.  
  
Q. Kind of picking up on that Connecticut Invitational theme --  
COACH COALE: Wendell started it.  
  
Q. I know. Thank you, Wendell. I think there's also a little bit of a
perception that this is not the sexy game that the other one is. This is kind
of like the other game. I just wondered what your thoughts on that were.  
COACH COALE: Well, we're playing. And as our team likes to say, we're still
here. I don't really know that it matters what type of circus revolves around
the game. And in some ways I think it's a blessing in disguise to be not part
of the circus.  
But one team is going to win that game. And either ourselves or Stanford are
going to be playing for the national championship on Tuesday. So it's a pretty
significant game, I would think.  
And I think there will be a lot of folks who feel the same way.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit about Abi? She spent a lot of time behind the
twins on the bench, and just kind of her progress this year and what the task
is in front of her playing Stanford?  
COACH COALE: I'm glad you asked about Abi, because I think she's a fantastic
story, because her story is refreshing. You know, kids these days play high
school ball and they're All-World on their high school team and they play
every minute and they think they're the end-all to the game of basketball.  
Then they go to college, and if you get five of them and you've got some
players left at all from the previous season, they're not all five going to
play all the time. And for a lot of kids that's really, really hard. There are
some who never get past it. They never get past the fact they don't start as a
freshman. Abi didn't start as a freshman or as a sophomore or junior. Not only
did she not start she hardly played. And she was willing to come to Oklahoma
and not wait -- I want people to understand this, Abi did not wait. Abi got
better from her freshman year to her sophomore year.  
It took a year to figure how to work the way we wanted her to work in
practice. From her sophomore and junior year she started to put the
intellectual pieces of it together, the why you go here and why you don't go
there and what the screening angle does and why we teach it, and it all
started to kind of make some sense to her.  
And then going into her junior year, she started to figure out how to really
compete and add all those things together. The missing piece was she wasn't in
physical condition enough to play any significant amount of time. Her junior
year, she could have played more had she physically been prepared, because all
the other pieces were there.  
And so she looked around and said, Courtney and Ashley aren't going to be here
next year, looked at her teammates and I look like I'm going to be the center.
Uh-oh, I better take care of my business. And she did.  
And look at what she's done. It's a fabulous story. And I think young athletes
everywhere should really pay attention to it, because that's the right way to
do it. She was in it for the long haul. She was in it for the stuff that
matters. If you ask her right now she wouldn't have had it any other way.  
People keep asking what are you going to do with Jayne? Jayne's a fantastic
player. I don't want to take anything away from Jayne Appel. She's may be the
greatest interior post passer we've seen in years, and obviously an incredibly
capable scorer in either direction.  
But Abi has played Cokie Reed from Texas, she's played Tina Charles from
Connecticut, she's played Brittney Griner three times. It's not like Abi has
been the biggest kid on the floor all the time.  
She gets this. She understands it, and she'll be ready for it.  
  
Q. You're the only coach here without a national title. What would winning
the national championship do for you, professionally and maybe, more
important, do for the program?  
COACH COALE: I'm younger than the others, so write that, please (laughter).
Just barely.  
Oh, it's why we do what we do. It's the grand prize. Obviously. I think our
returning to the Final Four this year put us in a different category. Put us
in a different league, nationally. But you don't really get to be a part of
that small circle until you get to cut down the nets here.  
And that's what awaits us. And before you can do that, you've got to get here.
So we did that part. But we've got some unfinished business.  
And I think it would catapult us even into maybe an even more elite circle.  
  
Q. You mentioned on the conference call Wednesday about the respect and the
friendship you've had with Geno Auriemma over the years. Could you take us
back to -- I think it was '96 when he first came to Norman to check out Stacy
Hansmeyer and the first time you met and how that friendship has built?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, it was the fall. It was snowing sideways. And Geno came in
the gym and he had on loafers with no socks. Seriously, aren't you from
Connecticut? It's winter and he's complaining about the weather and how cold
it is and he doesn't have a coat and he has his jacket lapels up. I said, Go
sit down. I've got to practice. That's kind of how it began.  
He appreciated the way our kids worked and appreciated the things that we were
teaching high school players. And told me that. There's just sort of been a
mutual respect there in terms of the game of basketball and how it ought to be
played and how it ought to be taught.  
And it's just evolved through the years.  
  
Q. Tara VanDerveer said that she thought that this might be been a really
fun year for you to coach because of the losses from last year, expectations
were lowered, and you just could go out there and do some stuff as a coach and
try and build. Was that the kind of season it was for you, work with some
unknown parts to get it this far?  
COACH COALE: It really has been a fun year, but really made it fun has been
the willingness of these kids to learn and adapt and transform themselves.  
You know, coming into the year, we thought we would play in a certain way. And
we were moving toward that when Whitney got hurt. And it had to be adjusted a
little bit at that time.  
And from that point forward, everything from everybody's role changing a
little bit when Whitney went down to making changes in the lineup. Jasmine
moving into the starting lineup after Carlee had been starting. Playing
different guys, guarding post guys, moving guys around on the floor, changing
defenses, whatever kind of manipulation we needed to have in order to be
successful, these guys are all about it.  
And I think you can ask any coach anywhere. One of the best things in the
world is to be able to call a timeout and say, okay, we're going to do this.
And it's something they've never done before and you draw it up and tell them
to do it and they go out and do it exactly like that, it doesn't matter if
you're coaching junior high or in the NBA, that's a pretty cool thing.  
And these guys are receptive in that way. So it's been really, really fun. We
get to tinker and try things out and they don't always work. The things we
draw up or the ideas we have don't always work, but our kids always dive in
head first to try, and that's what makes it fun.  
  
Q. Seems like a size versus speed matchup. Do you see it that way? And will
this boil down to who can take advantage of the mismatch the best?  
COACH COALE: That's a simple way to look at it. And I think most games
ultimately do boil down to that. For us, we've had an ability all year, it
seems, to play the way we need to play in order to win, whether it's half
court or full court, or patient on offense or scoring quickly.  
We can do it a lot of different ways. Not necessarily real pretty whatever way
we do it, but we found a way to be effective. So hopefully we'll be able to
use our speed to our advantage.  
  
Q. Stanford has been in only a couple of close games all year and were very
fortunate to escape the last one. You've been in plenty of them. Does this
give you kind of an advantage if this game is close?  
COACH COALE: Oh, I think it does, just because our kids believe we're going to
win. Does that mean I necessarily want it close at the end? I'll take 12 or 15
points if we can get them.  
Our guys, when we went to overtime with Notre Dame, when I went to the huddle
before the overtime, I knew we were fine. Our guys just believed they're going
to win. And, again, that's a reflection of that schedule we played all year.  
  
Q. You probably play that 2002 Connecticut team better than anybody. You
gave them fits there in the second half of the championship game. This year
you were ahead of Connecticut in the second half. Geno says that that 2002
team could beat this year's team 9 out of 10, but obviously they're doing
something right. Are they doing anything that we haven't seen before in
women's basketball, or what is singular about what Connecticut's doing right
now? And I ask that with all the respect I know you could beat them Tuesday
night if you played them.  
COACH COALE: Thank you. I agree with him, I think the 2002 team was better.
They were deeper. They had really a superstar at every position on the floor.
When you look at what those kids have gone on to do in the WNBA, it's obvious.  
I don't know, though, that there's been a more dominant center than Tina
Charles and the way she's played this year. She is so consistently
predictable. You just know what you're going to get.  
With that 2002 team you might get Aisha, you might get Swin, you might get
Tamika. You never really knew and what combination thereof. They know what
they're getting from Tina Charles. They go right to her. And sometimes it's
that focus, I think, on knowing where those baskets are going to come from
that maybe makes them great in a different sort of way, if that answers your
question.  
  
Q. Considering what you all have been through this year, what you've
overcome, where does this team rank, regardless of what happens in the next
couple of days? Where does this team rank on your satisfaction meter and the
other really good teams you've had?  
COACH COALE: I don't ever rank teams. I love them all. It's like asking me
which one of my kids are my favorite. I love them all for different reasons,
and this team definitely has a special fiber. And because of the way they're
wound up with each other, they're going to have similar relationships
throughout their lives like the 2002 group.  
That group, they get together every year whether they go on a trip or meet up
somewhere, they just -- they talk all the time. This group will be like that.
And some are a little bit more so than others. This one just happens to be --
maybe part of it is because of the small number. We don't have a lot of folks
on our roster.  
Two, when you do things together, you have a tendency to become pretty wound
up.  
  
Q. Coach, if you're familiar with the '82, '83 and '84 men's tournaments --
I know I'm going back a ways -- could you make a case that the Olajuwon family
is due some good fortune in a Final Four?  
COACH COALE: I was so deeply embedded in my incredible basketball career at
the Oklahoma Christian College that I don't remember -- no, I do remember what
was happening. And, yeah, maybe some magic in there.  
  
Q. What kind of motivation do you receive after being in the Final Four
twice before and not having being able to win yet?  
COACH COALE: Oh, good question from the juniors. Well, it's like being invited
to this incredible feast. They just set the table and the food looks and
smells fabulous, and there's just dish after dish after dish after dish, and
you get to get in the room and you get to sit down, and then they take all
your utensils away. And so we're still hungry.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Pleased to introduce head coach Geno Auriemma and student-
athletes Tina Charles and Kalana Greene and Maya Moore.  
COACH AURIEMMA: We've been talking the last couple of days about being in the
Final Four and what a unique experience it is and how you have to really try
to get as much out of it as you can, the whole experience, not just sitting
around waiting for the games.  
A lot goes into the preparation part, because it's not easy with all the
things you're asked to do. But this group has been real good all year about
zeroing in on what's important and making sure that we stay on task.  
And now tomorrow we get a chance to play in the game that we've wanted to play
in since we got back to school last April. And we're just anxious to go. We
really are. And I know I speak for them and everybody else in our program.
We're anxious for tomorrow to come.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For any of the players, Coach just talked about zeroing in on what is
important. What is important right now for you guys?  
KALANA GREENE: I think what's important is getting the next win and doing the
things that we've done all season to get the win. I think when it's time to
have fun, we know how to do that. When it's time to get on the court and play
basketball, that's when our focus really turns on and try to get the next win.  
  
Q. Tina, just your thoughts on playing against Griner tomorrow night and
what kind of challenges she presents?  
TINA CHARLES: Coach has made it clear that it's not Tina Charles versus
Brittney Griner; it's UConn versus Baylor. All the challenges I'm going to
face we're going to face them together, if there are any challenges. Just
going to go out there and play hard.  
  
Q. Maya, can you just talk about this ride you've all been on, the winning
streak, and can you just talk a little bit why the team chemistry is so
good?  
MAYA MOORE: I think our program, just the way we do things, definitely gives
us an opportunity to have strong chemistry. We're always together. It's a
unique set of people, I think, first of all. You have to have a good group
that like to be around each other and like to be in the gym.  
And really have the same interests. And most of us do. We live together. We
always look out for each other. Anytime we go anywhere, we're always going in
groups, going out together.  
And we have an unselfish group. You know, if you watch us play it's so clear
we don't care who scores. It's all the same. We all get just as excited if
Jacquie Fernandes is hitting a 3 or Caroline Doty is hitting a 3. It's just a
unique group and our coaches do a great job of setting the atmosphere.  
  
Q. Tina, obviously you don't have somebody on your team who is 6'8 ". What
can you as a team do to simulate Brittney? Do you use brooms in practice, for
example, or do you use 6'8" guys? What can you do to prepare in that
fashion?  
TINA CHARLES: Just mentally go out there and play hard. We're not going to
change anything that we do, offensively. We're going to -- Coach is going to
give us a game plan and go out there and do it the best we can. We're not
going to change anything we're going to do. We're not going to use brooms or
anything.  
  
Q. Tina, just wanted you to reflect a little bit about the matchup you had
as a freshman when you played Sylvia Fowles and what impression did that make
upon you, and do you see any similarities in this matchup? I know you've said
it's not me against Brittney. But so many of us here making into that, because
we see that matchup in the post. But do you see any similarities, she being an
up-and-coming center, you being regarded as one of the best in the country,
and back then Sylvia being the best and you being the up-and-coming center?  
TINA CHARLES: You know, I guess like how everybody thought for me, there's a
lot of growth left for her. Definitely going to be -- when she's leaving
college, going to be one of the great centers to come out of college.  
Like I said, a lot of growth. You can just see. Every time I see her play,
she's improving on something. Whether it's a different move where she has the
ball, whether it's her intensity level, just how she gets energy when she's
blocking shots, just little things like that. So definitely there's always
room for growth when you're a freshman.  
  
Q. What about the impression of Sylvia, the matchup, what impression does
that make?  
TINA CHARLES: Definitely was a challenge, something that I wanted to see
myself when I became a senior, wanted to become one of the dominating seniors
to leave school.  
  
Q. Maya, obviously you guys being the defending champs and the winning
streak puts a target on your back pretty much every time you go out there.
Coach talked about the anxiousness that you guys are feeling to play. I mean,
do you guys get motivated for going up against the best teams in the
country?  
MAYA MOORE: Absolutely. That's what March is. That's what the Final Four is.
That's what UConn basketball is. We're a competitive group and that's why
we've been able to maintain the success we've had, because our coaches and the
players around me are very competitive.  
And anytime you can get a matchup with a competitive team who has talent, who
has worked hard, who has shocked a lot of people in coming as far as they
have, and they're on a roll right now, we would have it no other way. That's
when basketball is fun. If it's competitive, high pressure, everybody's
watching, that's what you love.  
So after practice now I was ready to go. I was asking our assistant coach,
Chris Dailey, if we could play right now because I was ready to go. We're
definitely excited and anxious to play.  
  
Q. Early this morning the Oklahoma players talked about Coach Sherri Coale
as a celebrity and certainly around Oklahoma. This is for any of the players,
do you think of Geno as a celebrity?  
TINA CHARLES: He's The Godfather (laughter).  
  
Q. Want to expand why you --  
TINA CHARLES: He's Italian (laughter).  
  
Q. Maya, Baylor has a lot of freshmen. You have been in this event as a
freshman, and I know you had a lot of preparation coming into that event. Is
it a little overwhelming as a freshman, everything you have to experience, and
can you reflect back on what it was like for you your first time at the Final
Four?  
MAYA MOORE: You're just excited and soaking in the experience. You're not
really -- I don't think you're really too stressed, unless you feel like your
team isn't ready. That's the only reason I would be stressed, if I didn't
think we were the best team out there.  
But you're really not doing a whole lot of thinking. I mean, as poorly as we
played at times my freshman year in that game, most of the time I wasn't doing
a whole lot of stressing or thinking; I was just going out there playing.  
It's a good thing when you come in you're fresh and you don't have anything to
compare it to, you're just going out and playing. It can be an advantage. But
if you don't have upperclassmen that ultimately take the responsibility for
the team, you can get in trouble.  
So I just feel real good with where we are, just the experience I've had from
freshman year until now. I feel like I have and the seniors next to me have
taken a lot of responsibility for our team and we feel really confident.  
  
Q. Kalana, with your third time back in three years, I assume the entire
team is pretty comfortable with the logistics that surround being at a Final
Four. Coach was talking about the way you guys get pulled around different
places and everything. You pretty much know what the deal is by now. Does that
help you get ready for the game that you've already had to deal with all the
off-the-court stuff that you have to do?  
KALANA GREENE: I think we know what to expect. I think the first year we came
here, Tampa, you know, we were excited. But then there's like a lot of things
going on and you're like, oh, my God, I'm ready to play. You're kind of
overanxious.  
Now I think we expect everything that's happening, and I think our time
management, we know when we're not doing a lot of the off-the-court stuff we
need to relax and get ready for the game. Especially after this afternoon.
We're going to take a lot of time to just relax and get out. Get our mind off
of basketball and get our mind off of being in the gym all day and clear our
heads before we come in tomorrow to work.  
  
Q. Maya, I wanted to get a chance to ask you when it happened, but were you
surprised when you won the Wade Trophy this year?  
MAYA MOORE: Anytime you get an award that's based on someone else and their
opinion of you, you can never really be sure. But it's an honor to be
respected in that way.  
And I'm just glad that it's happening the way it is, just as far as how far
our season is going. And to have my teammate up there with me, Tina, and the
rest of my teammates over in the corner cheering and acting goofy for us and
excited is what makes it really worthwhile.  
So it's an honor, but that's not why I came here. I came here to play tomorrow
and take care of business.  
  
Q. Maya, you guys have been playing unreal defense all season long. It seems
somehow you turned it up a notch in the tournament. I think you
(indiscernible) 40 points a game and shattered almost every NCAA record for
defensively. What have you guys done differently the last four games to sort
of get even better defensively for an unreal defensive effort all season?  
MAYA MOORE: At this point it's not a whole lot of physical changes or
improvements. It's all in your mind. It's all focused, knowing your scouting
report. Just really studying your opponent and knowing what you need to do.
Trying to make the other team not necessarily steal the ball every time but
make them uncomfortable, disrupt their flow, and just continue with that
aggressive attack mentality.  
And we pick it up in March and in April. That's what we do at Connecticut.
It's the best time of the year. It's our favorite time of the year to play,
and we just come with everything we have, and we're just using that momentum
from each game, pick up the defensive intensity.  
  
Q. To follow up with that, March and April, you yourself have turned your
game up. Your numbers are a video game, like shooting 70 percent from 3-point
land and 64 percent from the field. Do you turn your game up in March and
April as well?  
MAYA MOORE: I always try to play my hardest every game. And something about
the tournament, I guess it just gets me excited. But I'm just playing free
right now. I'm not trying to do a whole lot of, like I've said before, not
doing a whole lot of thinking, not trying to improve or work on my game per
se, but I'm just going with my strengths.  
I'm comfortable out there and my teammates are doing a great job of setting
screens for me and finding me in transition and playing great defense, which
gives us more opportunity to play offense. And I'm just really comfortable
right now.  
  
Q. Maybe two of you can answer. How has the complexion of this team changed
without Renee running the offense?  
TINA CHARLES: It changed a lot. There's things that Renee can do that just
can't be replaced. Just the way she'll just penetrate in the lane and able to
dish that off or how she just always wanted to come down the court and be in
transition all the time. That's what Lorin Dixon is doing for us right now.  
But I think it was a great challenge for Tiffany Hayes and Caroline to come
out of their shell and just do something they probably didn't think they could
do. I think that's one of the best things about playing for Coach.  
He'll take you all year-round and make you feel like you can do something
else. Make you do things that you need to work on, that can help you in the
long run. But it's not about having a two point guards; it's just about
getting the job done. And so far that's what Caroline and Tiffany has done for
us.  
  
Q. Maya, you've been dominating teams by 30, 40 points all season. How
concerned are you that if you get into a close game, that things won't go your
way? Specifically, where Stanford has been in the same boat all season, except
for the loss to you, and then they wound up being in a close game and had a
real hard time. How concerned are you with that?  
MAYA MOORE: I'm not concerned. It's the same mentality and attack mindset that
we have during the game is what I believe will carry us over in a close game.
It's the fact that we will never stop attacking. We'll never stop playing
hard. And so if another team decides to do the same, we're confident that
we'll be able to be the winner in the end, because we go hard every game,
regardless of the score.  
That's why you see us diving on loose balls when we have a 30-point lead,
because we're playing in that attack mentality, with that attack mentality for
40 minutes. Because we play that way we have confidence if it comes down to
it, we'll still be in that same mindset, if it comes down to the wire.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, one of the things that I've noticed throughout covering you is
that no matter what kind of challenge Connecticut has, who their individual
players are, Connecticut always seems to just focus on what it has to do to be
successful as opposed to what the other team does. Is this another example of
that philosophy with Griner coming up tomorrow?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, I think every game involves two things: There's
things that you know you're going to have to do to neutralize some things that
they do, and you know that there's certain strengths that you have that you
have to try to take advantage of.  
And I think as a coach you have to make that distinction between how much of
our focus is going to be on what they do and how we treat them and how much of
our focus is going to be on what we do and who we are and how we're going to
approach things. I think you have to do a little bit of both. I don't think it
can be all one or the other.  
But I would say tomorrow's not going to be that much different than all of our
other preparations in that the majority of our preparation is what we're going
to do, how we're going to do it, and knowing that they're going to react a
certain way and we're going to have to go to plan B, when that time comes. And
maybe plan C.  
Some games you get a plan A and it just stays there and you don't have to
worry about anything.  
  
Q. Coach, earlier was talking with Coach Coale about the first time she met
you. She talked about how you came into this little barn of a gym in October
with no socks, coat pulled up around your neck. Can you talk about that day
and how your friendship has blossomed over these last 15 years?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I just wanted to fit in with the locals (laughter). At least I
had shoes. I mean, you know? I remember my first impressions were, wow, this
is like really good. This is not like your typical high school practice. I
coached high school. I know what a good practice looks like. I know what bad
ones look like. And I'm watching them practice and go through some drills.  
I thought this is really good. This is a really good program. She really knows
what she's doing with these kids. And they're fortunate to have somebody like
that, who is passionate about the game and knows how to teach it. Knows what
she wants to teach and knows how to teach it. Not a lot of people do.  
And that was my initial reaction to Sherri, and our friendship kind of grew
from there, probably because of our shared love of the game and the way we
play the game, and I think there's a lot of similarities between the way they
play and the way we play.  
And kind of flattering a little bit that they're using Danielle Robinson the
exact same way we used Renee Montgomery last year. And we talked about that a
lot in the offseason.  
And I'm glad they're having a lot of success. I knew it would happen. I just
didn't know to what extent. That's been the best coaching job I think she's
ever done, given who graduated and Whitney Hand getting hurt, it's pretty
remarkable that they're here. I'm not surprised.  
  
Q. Your players talk about attacking for 40 minutes. It's hard to get -- I
mean, a lot of teams talk about it, it's hard to get players to do that. Is
that something in the players individually, or is this -- have you had a team
like this before in that sense? And is it because of them personally?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I have had teams like this before. I don't think you win -- I
don't think you go through a season and win as many games as we've won in the
past and win national championships unless you can have that kind of
mentality.  
Sometimes it's a little more subtle, and sometimes it's really overt. I mean,
this team -- it's evident what they're doing, and there's no subtlety about
it. It stems from the expectation level and who they are as people. I could
have the same expectations, which I've had of other players and other teams
and not have this result.  
So it all stems from the individuals. They have it in them, and it's our job
as coaches to get it out. They didn't have it in them, we wouldn't be doing
what we're doing.  
  
Q. I guess they called it having a little dog in you or something, they say
great players have maybe a mean streak or a little nastiness. Do these as a
team have that, and have you seen that before in the team?  
COACH AURIEMMA: They don't have it. They don't have it. Again, they don't have
what Shea Ralph had or what Diana Taurasi had or Swin Cash.  
  
Q. As a group?  
COACH AURIEMMA: As a group they have it. But as individuals they do not.
They're more a collection of parts that make a great whole. Some of the other
teams I've had, there were individuals on there that were -- like they don't
have what Renee had. But they get the same things done. They just do it in a
different way.  
  
Q. Last weekend with Tina Charles as a player for you, and I would ask you
to reflect on that relationship from where you started and where you ended
up?  
COACH AURIEMMA: A lot has been said about that. I did think about that, too,
as a matter of fact. Last weekend I thought about it, that this is the last
week. The last week of practice. Maybe the last two games.  
And I do think back to freshman year and how quickly things changed, that in
practice I thought, wow, this kid's going to be something special. In the
first two exhibition games, I was like, wow, we haven't had anybody like her
in a long time. This kid is an offensive rebounding machine.  
It didn't dawn on me until the third or fourth game that all the offensive
rebounds were her missed shots. And that's when the problem started, because
she was patting herself on her back for all of the offensive rebounds and I
was bitching about every missed layup.  
So it fell apart quickly that freshman year. But from then on I think the
expectations that she has for herself are so much higher than they were back
then. She's so much more mature. She's someone that now you don't have to
necessarily kind of badger all the time. You can just point some things out to
her, whereas before you would point something out, it would go in one ear and
out the other because she couldn't understand why you were saying what you
were saying or why you were doing what you're doing.  
And she's such a nice kid that you couldn't even get her mad. You just shook
your head and said, man, it's really hard to get mad at this kid because she's
such a nice kid.  
And she wants to please me so bad that it was really hard for me to go to
practice and say, You're the worst player I've ever coached in my life. I know
you love me, but I hate you as a player. And I think you're a great kid and I
think you're sweet and a good student, and I wish I could take you home, but,
man, I hate the way you play basketball.  
It was a constant back and forth like that until all of a sudden it dawned on
her, you know, I think Coach is right; I don't necessarily like myself as a
basketball player as much as I could.  
And now I think she understands. But everybody has their own timetable, you
know. I'm just glad that hers didn't run out before she finished her
eligibility.  
  
Q. Heather Buck didn't practice today. Is there anything wrong with her?  
COACH AURIEMMA: She's been sick for the last couple of days. Stomach problems.  
  
Q. And the question is: Knowing how you feel about Maya and Tina personally,
and you understand their nuances as players so well, next week, when you take
them on the court as the coach of the United States Basketball Team, how do
you separate those emotions when you have to make a determination where they
fit into this other big picture?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's very easy for me. I don't ever have a problem with
that. Whenever I coach my players outside of UConn, they have to prove to me
that they're better than everybody else. They get nothing from me. It's like
when I coach my son's AAU team, the first person that got benched, first
person that got thrown out of the gym was him.  
So when we show up for a national team, every little thing that Maya Moore and
Tina Charles does that I let somebody else get away with they're getting in
trouble for, and they know it. Because if they make the team and they're
starting and they're playing a lot of minutes, it's not going to be because
I'm their college coach, it's going to be because they earned it.  
So if we win Sunday and we're fortunate enough to play Tuesday and we win
Tuesday and they're all jumping up and down and hugging and kissing and loving
life when we get together next week, I hate 'em (laughter).  
  
Q. Geno, obviously people have asked you before about being a man coaching
women's basketball. And, I mean, it's obvious you can do that at this point. I
was wondering about is there like a secret to co-existing with them? Like we
know you can coach them, but like the other stuff? Do they ever gang up on
you, the kids and your wife and daughters and C.D. and Janelle and do you ever
feel outnumbered? Or is there a secret to co-existing with all of them?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, wine helps (laughter). Helps tremendously. Feeling like
you're tremendously outnumbered and saying, yes, dear, no problem, and knowing
like what's important and what's not important to get upset about, what to
argue about, what not to argue about. I don't have a lot of rules with my
team. That's the problem.  
Most coaches get themselves in trouble. They try to micromanage these kids. We
have very few ironclad things that we believe in. Standards of how we are and
who we are and what we do. So they know I'm not after them all the time; that
when I get after them about something, it's really important to me. And it
becomes important to them.  
But I'm not yap, yap, yap, yap. You know, they do that among themselves.
That's what women do. That's what girls do, you know? And I let them do that
whenever they want.  
It's like stretching. We stretch. That's the biggest waste of time in the
history of sports. But we have to stretch. And I give them ten minutes to
stretch before practice so they can all sit around and talk about what movie
they saw, what pair of shoes they saw in some store or -- you know. And I stay
in my office until they're done and then I come out. It's nauseating.  
You let them do what they do because that's part of who they are. I let them
make decisions about all kinds of things. And they're really good about it. I
treat them like adults. I don't treat them like kids. I expect a lot from them
and they know what they're going to get from me, and there's no nonsense.  
And it's the same thing I am with my kids at home. I give them exactly what
they need. I give them everything I have. I give them everything I have, and
they know it. Everything I have is theirs. My house is their house. My
family's their family. And that's why it works for us, I think.  
  
Q. Your streak is incredible. But I'm trying to figure something out, and
maybe you can help a little bit. There are hundreds of thousands of girls,
maybe millions of girls, and women playing basketball in our country. And, as
you know, when UCLA men had their streak, they had 16 games that were in
single digits and they had two that were one-point games. You guys, of course
-- no team in the last two years has gotten within single digits of you. It's
great for you. I'm wondering how is that possible that there's not one team
that can get within single digits with all of these girls, with Title IX --
you know the rest. Thanks.  
COACH AURIEMMA: How is it possible? I don't know. I wish I could give you like
-- I wish I could give you a list, say, Here you go, here's the list, it's
because of this, this, and this.  
But, to be honest with you, everything I will put on the list you would say,
So? Don't other teams do that? So? Doesn't that team have that?  
It's something that I have a hard time explaining, because it doesn't make any
sense. It doesn't make any sense. But it's happening, again, and the cynic out
there will say, well, everybody else is really bad. But that's not true. Not
everybody can be bad. The UConn fans will say, well, that's just the way it
is. Connecticut is supposed to win every game.  
But somewhere in between there there's the players themselves, and a unique
group that just came together at the right time and the right place and it's
gotten bigger than any one of us individually now. It just kind of has a life
of its own and it just moves forward.  
We don't think about it. We don't talk about it. We play a game. They know.
And this could end tomorrow. Tomorrow we could lose by double digits.  
Everything that we've done right up to this point could all go wrong. But no
matter what the score is, no matter what the situation is, my players are
under the impression that it doesn't matter; we're going to win. And maybe not
every kid that plays college basketball says it doesn't matter, we're going to
win.  
I've seen teams, when they're winning, they know they're going to win and they
know they want to win. When they're losing, they accept losing. Okay. It's not
our day today. The hell with it, my bad, I'll get it tomorrow.  
And my guys refuse to accept that under any circumstances. They will not
accept it. If it happens, we'll have to deal with it. But they won't accept
playing poorly. They will not. They will not.  
And if we're up 30 and there's a loose ball and two of my guys don't dive on
it, the guys on the bench are pissed. If somebody dribbles by somebody and
somebody doesn't rotate over and the lead goes from 38 to 36, the guys on my
team are pissed, because that should not be happening. We worked too hard for
that to happen. But we're up 35, I don't care.  
And if they made a goal already that we're going to hold somebody to 50 points
and they get to 45, the intensity level goes up ten times, because they don't
want them to get to 50. Forget how many we have. So it's that kind of
mentality that somehow just becomes -- it's pervasive in our program.  
I don't know how it got there all of a sudden, and I don't know -- I can't
explain it. But it's there right now. It's there. And I'd venture to say that
the teams we play against know it's there. And tomorrow, you know, that kid
could just take her hand and just wipe all that away and 70-some games would
go right down the toilet.  
  
Q. The question is meant obviously as a compliment towards your program.
It's been mentioned by many people. Because of your dominance and the amount
of points you win by, some people have questioned whether UConn basketball is
somehow good for the game. Your response to that, because it's obviously
something that you've built up. But in the big picture, do you see this as
somehow negative for the game?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I've been asked that question a lot, obviously. And I think --
I've worked really hard the last five or six years to not lash out at people
and get defensive and be my old self. And a lot of the guys that cover our
team aren't too happy about that. They like when I make smart-ass comments and
get myself in trouble and annoy everyone in America and let all those people
think that I'm an arrogant ass, say, See, I was right.  
But I've worked really hard to stay away from that stuff. So when I say this,
I don't want it to sound kind of rude or anything towards anybody, but most of
the people asking those questions are gender-biased. If this was a men's team,
no one would be asking that question.  
I don't remember anybody asking questions about, you know, when Tiger was
winning every major, is this good for golf? Can't anybody out there beat this
guy? No, they couldn't. He was too damn good. Well, everybody all of a sudden
had to get better. So you either get better or you just keep letting people
win.  
And if you just keep letting us win, then, you're right, it's bad for the
game. But I guarantee you, five years from now there will be a lot more good
teams in America than there are today because of what we're doing. Just like
after we won the whole thing in 1995, there are a lot more programs doing what
they're doing now than there were back then.  
Somebody's gotta stand up there and say, I'll be the bad guy. And right now
I'm the bad guy. I'm the guy that everybody loves to hate. We're the team that
everybody loves to beat. We're the Yankees, we're the Celtics, we're the
Montreal Canadiens, we're the Russian hockey team before 1980.  
But everything goes away at some point. Everything changes. And when the
change comes, it will be because somebody's paid attention to what we're doing
and said, you know what, that's how I'm going to do it. I'm going to knock
those guys off. And it could be this weekend. But it's going to happen. And I
would like to think that we're going to help it happen, and that's good for
the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'm pleased to introduce Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer,
as well as student-athletes Jayne Appel, Nneka Ogwumike, and Jeanette Pohlen.  
Coach, when you're ready.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First of all, we're very excited to be here. It's just a
thrill to be back, and our team is really appreciating the opportunity to
compete for the national championship.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jeanette, could you just talk about the last few days for you, because I
think it's probably been a little bit different than the few days before
that.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Yeah, I would just say that the past few days it's just been
great with all the support and love that was shown for our team and not just
me but everybody else on our team. We had a great send-off rally before we
came here.  
And just been getting a lot of messages and people just very supportive of our
team and excited that we're here, too.  
  
Q. Jeanette, could you talk a little bit about Danielle Robinson. I know you
played against each other in high school. She's a Northern California girl.
Just your remembrances of her but also playing against her tomorrow night?  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Well, her and I are pretty good friends. We became pretty
cool over the summer when we played together, too, and she's a great player.
One of the top point guards in the country. And she'll be a challenge for us.
And she's obviously one of the keys to their team, and just like she was in
high school when we played her.  
So in that respect it won't be too different. But her and I are really cool.
And it will be a fun game. It's cool to meet in the Final Four.  
  
Q. What did it take you three personally to get here to the Final Four?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think it took a commitment to the team. The first thing is
putting the team first and having the right attitude throughout the entire
year and coming out every day and working hard.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: And, I mean, personally for me I think just kind of pushing
each other. We really expect a lot from each other. We hold each other to a
really high standard. So every day practicing and all the games that we played
in preparation to this part has really helped us.  
And I think we're doing a really good job of letting each other know what our
expectations are of each other.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Yeah, I would ditto what they were both saying. A lot of
preparation and time and work went into how -- you know, us getting here. Our
coaching staff put so much time -- they watched so much film and got us
prepared for all the games we needed to win to get here. And we tried to stay
as focused as possible to make it here.  
  
Q. Jayne, could you talk about the team's mindset given how you guys got
here, and just kind of the -- Tara called it getting a second life. Just is
it, oh, wow, we've really got to button up and pay attention to some of the
things that were a problem, or is it -- do you feel, well, that's a bad game
and put it behind you? How do you deal with the way you got into the
tournament?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think, you know, if you make it by 40 points, you make it by
four seconds, either way you're still here at the Final Four. But we
definitely take things from that game and learn from them. We take the
opportunities that we have made smart plays in, and we didn't in that game,
and learned from them and hopefully apply them in the next game.  
And I think we build on that excitement that we gain from that game. We just
take the energy and kind of put it into our work and our effort that we're
going to put into the Oklahoma game. I think that's kind of the attitude our
team has had throughout this trip to the Final Four.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could just talk about the rivalry you guys have had
traditionally with Oklahoma throughout the years?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I mean, I haven't really -- I haven't really played against
Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Anything about the previous games?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Yes, actually we have. Tara and Ros and Amy, I think you
said, were the only ones that played Oklahoma -- was it in San Antonio? Yeah,
in San Antonio. We even practiced at the gym where they prepared and they told
us about how serious everyone was and how focused everyone was in preparing to
play Oklahoma.  
And when the game time came, everyone was ready, and everything went as they
had hoped. Everyone was focused and everyone did a really good job of knowing
what they were supposed to do. So she's kind of reminiscing on that and trying
to let us know how important this is in terms of preparing for, you know, this
level of play.  
And I thought that was really special that it was actually here at this same
place, playing Oklahoma again.  
JAYNE APPEL: I remember actually watching the last game with Oklahoma. I
remember how well Stanford looked like they had prepared for the game. I
remember watching Brooke Smith do particularly well in the last matchup
against them.  
  
Q. This question is for Jeanette. Have you been able to come down off of the
high from, you know, your game-winning shot and describe to me kind of some of
the feedback you've gotten from that?  
JEANETTE POHLEN: Yeah, I definitely think I've been able to come down, just
because, you know, after we had our day off, we were right in the getting into
all the Oklahoma stuff that we were preparing for.  
So it's still exciting to think about, but I think for the most part a lot of
us have moved on just because we have so much more to focus on to prepare for
our game.  
And, like I said, it's been nice having all the support and people saying
they're huge fans of our team, and I think it was great for women's basketball
as far as viewers. I feel like a lot of people were watching that game that
night. And, like I said, it's just been kind of crazy, and there were a lot of
big shots made to get to that point in the game as well.  
  
Q. Nneka, how much of a home game do you consider this, since you're in
Texas? And have you played here before? And, finally, is your whole family
going to be able to get out here?  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: I haven't played in the Alamodome, but it's definitely only
a few-hour drive from where I live. My whole town is going to be here, so I'm
really excited, my high school coach, my AU coach, and my sister's already
here for WBCA, so that's special as well.  
It definitely does feel like home. It was funny because when we landed I told
everyone no one in California knows what a kolache is, and so I told everyone
I'm going to buy them one.  
A kolache is like a pig in a blanket but people eat it for breakfast. So
they're all over the place. I mean, maybe it's just Houston. But I love
kolaches and I was asking where they were when I was in California and
everyone's like, what is that? Hopefully I'll buy everyone kolaches.  
It's real exciting. I have a lot of fans to come to support Stanford, and it's
just really nice being able to play here at home. And I'm really excited. And
so there's no place to win a national title than here at home. I really want
to make that happen.  
  
Q. Jayne, it's been about a month since you initially sprained your ankle.
Is it not getting better? Do you simply need rest? After the season is when
it's going to get better and right now you're just bucking it up?  
JAYNE APPEL: Yes. I think it's hard for any injury to fully heal when you're
playing on it. Even though I haven't been practicing. Going at the game tempo
and game impact on it, I think it just takes longer time.  
  
Q. Jayne, if I might follow up on that. You seem to have a little trouble in
the last game pushing off. Are you any better this week than you were in this
past game? Are you at like 85 percent or what?  
JAYNE APPEL: It's hard to put a percentile to it. I think it will be as well
as it will be for the game. I think my teammates, my coaches have been very
supportive of me trying to put me in positions where I can really help the
team. In the last game, since Phillips was such a big post presence inside,
kind of be the passer for Nneka.  
So it's kind of just coming out tomorrow and seeing how it feels. I don't
practice on it so I don't really know how it feels until game time.  
  
Q. Tara, you might not like this question because I know you don't want to
look ahead, but so much of our focus has been talking about what could happen
if you win, and if UConn wins and you get a chance to play them again. So with
total respect to the fact you have a game first, how much would each of you
like to get another crack at UConn? And, again, with that understanding that
you've got to play another team, but is that at all a part of -- looming maybe
even in the back of your mind somewhere?  
JAYNE APPEL: Not at all. I think we're more focused on what we're doing and
whoever we're competing against. We're going to come out with our best game
plan and try to play Stanford basketball.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Jayne couldn't have said it better. We get the question a
lot. And the answer never changes. Because I don't think our mindsets ever
change. We're always focused about us.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: I agree with both of them. I have nothing new to add.  
  
Q. Nneka and Jayne, what are your impressions of Oklahoma when you watch
them on tape?  
JAYNE APPEL: I think that their guards are tremendously quick. And that we
will really need to be focused and play a smart basketball game against them,
really come out and be able to execute our offense. I think that will be a big
thing for us.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: Yeah, I agree. Their guards are electrifying, and we have
to contain them. But also they have Abi Olajuwon and Amanda Thompson who are
also very talented players. Olajuwon is really good at finishing around the
basket and Amanda Thompson is very talented, has a very talented outside game.  
And just every game plan is the same: contain their players and play Stanford
basketball. So I think that's what we're going to do, just come out
aggressively.  
  
Q. For all three student-athletes, how does this compare with other Final
Four experiences?  
JAYNE APPEL: I don't think the Final Four experience ever really gets old.
It's always exciting to come back. You never know. You never know when you'll
come back, and you won't ever come back with the same teammates. It's very
exciting for us and we're excited that we get another chance to play.  
NNEMKADI OGWUMIKE: And Tara does a good job letting us know. Obviously we know
this, but she tells us there's no guarantees. It wasn't guaranteed that we
were coming here, obviously due to our last game. But I think we had enough
heart to pull it out, and there's no guarantee we're coming back.  
So we just have to make the most of this once-in-a-lifetime experience. And I
think that everyone's really invested in what they do. And everyone's really
focused.  
And we're also taking everything in. Everything is so exhilarating and really
exciting. Everything is so breathtaking. But at the same time, we can also
have fun if we win and play hard, so I think we're trying to make the most of
that experience.  
JEANETTE POHLEN: As a college player, it's a dream to come to the Final Four,
and you can get the opportunity to make it to a championship game. And, like
Jayne said, it doesn't get old. I'm still as excited this year as I was my
first time coming my freshman year.  
It's just a totally different experience than anything else that you'll
experience in college basketball. It's the biggest stage you could be on for
women's basketball. So it's very exciting.  
  
Q. Jeanette, is this Oklahoma back court the fastest, quickest you've faced
this year? And, secondly, in this big arena, is there any problem with depth
perception on shots?  
JEANETTE POHLEN: For your first question, we've played against some pretty
quick guards. I would say that Oklahoma's probably going to be up there. But
we've played against Duke. We've played against Tennessee and UConn, and
Oregon.  
Even in our league we had some pretty quick guards and have had to come up
against numerous different presses. And so I would say they're definitely up
there. But we've had some experience against some pretty quick guards.  
As far as depth perception, we will see how that goes once we go out there and
practice. Hopefully it won't be too much. I guess that's why we're going to
get out there and get a lot of shots up so we get used to the court and the
arena.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I read where you described these two teams as kind of regular teams.
Nothing -- not in a negative way but nothing really exotic. I think there's a
perception out there by some, at least, that this is kind of like the other
game, you know, it's not the sexy matchup that the other game is. I just
wondered what your thoughts were on that.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, for me it's the big game. But, you know, one time we
were at the Final Four in 1990 and we had just beaten Virginia, actually. And
I went out to scout. And it was the first time I coached in a Final Four.  
And one of the fans, I heard the fan say, well, that was the JV game. Now is
the real game. So if we're the JV game, so be it. We're going to come out and
play the best JV game possible.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Ros's development? And from what I've read, that you
guys kind of butted heads earlier in her career. But things seem to have
worked out. If you could talk about that.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Sure. Well, you know what, I think there's always different
players that, when they go to college, you know, they have a maturing --
they've got to mature.  
And Ros really had to go from that caterpillar to the butterfly, and she
really, during that caterpillar stage, she did give me a lot of gray hair and
we did butt heads, but she's not the only player who has kind of gone through
that process.  
So I was ready. And I really worked hard to kind of really communicate with
Ros, this is what we need you to do and this is how we need you to do it. And
sometimes just as, you know, young adolescent children, sometimes they want to
do it their way. That wasn't the way it was going to work for our team.  
And this year, I think there's just a light went on with Ros and actually with
our whole team. And it's like everyone said, all right, let's try it Tara's
way. And Ros this year has had a fabulous year in that she comes to practice
and she really, she works hard every day.  
She really competes. She stays after and works on her shot. She calls up one
of her friends, a guy who is very quick, and had him come to practice. She
thought she'd get ready to guard Danielle Robinson. Her quickest friend is
coming, she's doing zigzags before we even go to practice.  
So she really gets it. That's what's so rewarding about being a coach is to
see the growth and development of a young person. And we do tease about all
the stuff we've gone through with Ros. And we have so many Ros stories and
we're just like, you know, we'll be talking about her for years.  
  
Q. Sherri Coale is the only coach here without a national title on her
resume. Can you talk about what that does for a coach? You've won a couple.
What does that do for a coach? And is it still paying dividends even if it was
years ago?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Nothing against Sherri, but I hope she doesn't get it this
year (laughter).  
She's done a great job. When I referenced even that first Final Four in 1990,
I wore a ribbon in 1990 because Oklahoma was dropping their women's program.  
So we as coaches, if you go back and look at -- I can look at the shirt I was
wearing, it had a ribbon on it. And that was in solidarity for the Oklahoma
women's basketball program that they were dropping it. And thank goodness they
didn't because look at what she's done and look at what a great program they
have.  
Having won a couple national championships, I do think that sometimes you
might say to yourself, well, okay, if I did it before I can do it again.  
But, really, it's all about this year's team, this year's players. Just being
here and having a chance. So I don't know that it does help a coach one way or
another. But I don't know that it hurts.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Abi Olajuwon a little bit from the film you've looked
at. She waited a long time to get her chance to contribute to this team?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Right. I saw Sherri Coale yesterday. First of all, what a
tremendous job Sherri has done this year with her team. To lose Courtney Paris
and Ashley Paris and to lose Whitney Hand, but in some ways some of those
teams are the most fun because there isn't the expectation. They have lost
some games, but they've battled back in big games. And Abi Olajuwon is a big
part of that. For someone -- I believe she lost 30 pounds. That's inspiring.  
That shows someone being committed, and she's a very nice player. She has
great footwork. I've watched Abi since she was a young player out in
California. And I think that's a great success story for her to -- someone
could say, well, I didn't play my freshman year much or my sophomore year or
junior year, heck with it, I'm just going to go through the motions my senior
year.  
And I think it's very inspiring that she did the work and she's led their team
and is basically the inside presence for them to be here. I need to know her
workout and eating routine (laughter).  
  
Q. Coaches at this point love to say it's all about matchups. Is there a
matchup that's of particular importance, you think, in your game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I guess I agree that it is a little bit about matchups. I
think we match up well, and if there was maybe a key one, I think it will come
down to our matchup with Danielle Robinson. And we don't have one person that
can guard Danielle Robinson. And if it wasn't that one, maybe it's Amanda
Thompson. Those two, I think, are going to be probably the pivotal players.  
But our team is -- you know, our team is really dedicated, I think, to doing
whatever it takes and we've had different leading scorers in different games.
So if we need Jayne, and hopefully she'll be able to play and play well for
us, you know, that could be a key matchup inside. Maybe it will be Ros with
Stevenson.  
One thing about both of our teams, we play about seven or eight people, and
there are no secrets. And there are -- I don't think we are exotic teams. We
don't have a Brittney Griner on our team. We don't have a Maya Moore on our
team. So I think we're both blue-collar teams, kind of just going at it, and
it's going to get done in the trenches.  
  
Q. Following up a little bit on the question of winning.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I hope I'm here talking about it.  
  
Q. Winning national championships, we hear a lot about Geno and Pat. Of
course you were the Olympic coach. You've got those titles from the past. How
bad do you want another one this year or anytime in the future?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, I mean, coming into the Final Four, we took I
guess a 10-year hiatus. And being here is really special. And obviously to get
here is great. And then once you're here you always want to win it.  
And we're going to work as hard as we can to get it done. What Pat has done is
phenomenal. She's built an incredible program. What Geno has done is
extraordinary.  
But I think that at Stanford, with the academic institution that I represent,
I'm very proud of what our team has done and what our program has done. And do
we want to win a national championship? Yes, all these people would tell you
the same thing.  
Can we? It's to be seen.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys have had some intriguing matchups with Oklahoma in the
past. I wonder if you could talk about the rivalry that happened in the past.
And is too much made of that now considering this is a completely new group of
players who probably weren't -- they don't have any concept, really, hearing
what the girls had to say about it early on.  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, like with Tennessee, we've played them every year.
Oklahoma, we went through a stretch where we played. We did have a home and
away series and we would end up playing them in the tournament. And there was
a little connection with some of the California kids, even like with, you
know, the Paris sisters being from the Bay Area.  
But we've had -- I think we've had a good rivalry with Oklahoma. And they
started out and got us down, and then we kind of came back at 'em. But they
have a great program and I think they're a great matchup for us. But we
haven't kept it going year in and year out like we have with other programs.  
  
Q. What kind of strategy do you advise your team to do for this upcoming
game?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, our team, one of the things I think that our team has
to do is we have to really focus and concentrate. And we watch a lot of
videotape. We do a lot of individual kind of talk to people individually about
what we expect them to do in the games.  
We do a lot of preparation, walkthrough. And you have a week to get ready. And
one of the things we count on with our Stanford students is the fact that they
will really focus and remember and execute a game plan. So we're hoping for
that.  
  
Q. You're the last team to beat Connecticut. I think you're the only team
since then to even be ahead of them at halftime. So you know this team. You've
had success against this team. Where is that team -- I realize they haven't
won anything yet this year, but are they doing anything that's singular or
unique we haven't seen in women's basketball before or not? Sort of where do
they fit in historically, this team?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I don't know that -- they have great players. But I
think I just think Geno would -- they have great players. But there are a lot
of great players. So I think it's what -- I think it's the culture that he's
developed at Connecticut and that this is how you play basketball. This is in
terms of your conditioning and your passing. And he has a great program.  
And they really are -- they're on a roll. And they started out -- I think,
again, just like the great job that Sherri has done, I think Geno has done an
equally great job in that they lost Renee Montgomery and you have Doty and
Hayes stepping right in and they bring Dixon in.  
He knows the game. He teaches the game well. And they're on a phenomenal, I
think, extraordinary run. And to keep that focus and be able to do what
they're doing is outstanding.  
And we did -- I think what our team did was when we played there -- and I hope
that in two days we can have the conversation if in fact we win and they win.
But our team, if anything is different about this team this year is our team's
confidence, and that would come in handy.  
  
Q. You've talked a little bit about Stevenson and Robinson. Is Ros going to
start guarding -- start the game on Robinson and could you talk a little bit
more about those two guards for Oklahoma and what makes them great?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, Ros will guard Robinson and Ros will guard Stevenson.
If cloning was in, we'd have two Ros's out there. But I'm not sure where we'll
start her or who she'll be on in the beginning of the game. Right now we're
debating it. But Jeanette is a very good defender for us, too.  
But Ros, she's going to have to play really well. And I think that she's
playing with a lot of confidence. She is kind of a lockdown defender. So I'm
not sure which one we'll have her guarding right now.  
Did I answer it all right for you?  
  
Q. Maybe a little bit more about the two Oklahoma guards.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, Danielle Robinson is -- she is an absolute -- turns
into an afterburner's jet. She just goes from end to end as fast as anyone.
She has such incredible speed and quickness, and every time you look at her
she's smiling and laughing. She brings great energy to their team.  
And the two of them together just play so well together. Stevenson is a
recipient of a lot of her passes. Stevenson to me is more of a 3-point
shooter, pure shooter, where Robinson is more of a slasher. And I think for
our team, we just -- there's not one person on our team who can stop them; we
have to play team defense against them. We're going to have to have people
really focused on helping, not just one-on-one Ros against Robinson or
Jeanette against Robinson or Stevenson.  
So they're really fun to watch when you're a spectator but really tough to get
ready for as a coach.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2010

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
RICK NIXON: We're joined by Stanford head coach Tara VanDerveer. I'll ask
Coach VanDerveer for an opening statement, and then we'll go to questions.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Thank you, Rick. And thank you very much for the very nice
compliments. We're very excited about coming to San Antonio.  
I feel that our team, you know, we had a very tough regional, and I want to
just compliment Xavier on a great regional championship game and our team was
really given a second life.  
And I know that our players and our staff are very appreciative of that and we
plan to make the absolute most of it.  
RICK NIXON: Questions.  
  
Q. You had a chance to play UConn earlier in the year, and you probably
didn't want to look too far ahead. But when you look at this tournament, when
you see the things UConn has done and the ways offensively and defensively you
try to control that team earlier on, what will Kim Mulkey and Baylor and what
will maybe potentially you have to do to change that tide from happening
again?  
COACH VANDERVEER: They're playing very well. And I think it's -- playing any
great team you have to kind of minimize their strength, and they have a lot of
strengths to minimize. So it's a tough job. I think Kim is a great coach. She
has an exceptional player and something different to prepare with Brittney
Griner. No one else in the country has that type of post presence defensively,
and so I think that there might be some adjustments that Connecticut will have
to make to go up against her.  
And also obviously there are other talented players. But for us we are focused
on Oklahoma and working as hard as we can so we'll be in that championship
game, regardless of the opponent.  
  
Q. How has that -- obviously with the last second the other night, how has
that rejuvenated and refocused the team? You mentioned it gave them a second
life, but are they excited now they have that opportunity?  
COACH VANDERVEER: It was a shock, honestly, coming back on the bus. We haven't
practiced. I haven't seen the team. We went back to school. So we'll practice
this afternoon. I know that it was a shock then, and waking up Tuesday morning
it was like, oh, my gosh, we're still playing, we're in the Final Four. It's
amazing.  
And we just -- I've felt bad and I know a lot of people felt bad for Xavier,
because they really had us on the ropes. But somehow we wiggled out. And we
definitely want to maximize our opportunity, and so I do think it has given us
really a second life.  
  
Q. Could you first expand a little bit about Necka's development in all
facets, both offense and defense? And then if could you address how different
a team Oklahoma is than Xavier. They don't have a lot of size and quickness.  
COACH VANDERVEER: First of all, with Necka, I think the biggest thing is
Necka's confidence. I think she gained it through the season last year. She
finished very strong, playing very well for us in the NCAA tournament, and it
even built more doing so well for U.S.A. Basketball.  
Necka is a young player, she's really learning the game, and I think she's
really dedicated herself.  
What I noticed this year is she is so attentive and she's such a student of
the game. She's so focused that I just think that for her it's really paying
off. She's a very athletic player. She's working on expanding her game,
shooting 3-point shots.  
She is a total team player. She does whatever our team needs her to do,
whether it's rebound, scores on the block, defends. So all facets of our game
are maturing, and I just think we're really proud of how hard she works and
her improvement.  
And in preparing for Oklahoma, they are like us, I think, in that they're like
maybe -- I call them my regular team. You look at Kentucky, they're extreme in
what they do.  
You look at even Baylor with Griner, that's extreme. You know what I mean?
With Xavier, that's extreme, they're so big. For us and Oklahoma, we're kind
of regular teams. If anything, Oklahoma, you know they don't maybe have as
much size as we do but they have more back-court quickness.  
  
Q. Is it a good thing or just a product of how you guys have been that in
this NCAA tournament you've had a different leading scorer every night or
every game you've had?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I didn't know that. I think we have good balance. I think
that for us we're not all about Jayne and we're not all about Necka. We're not
all about Kayla. Jeanette has had a good game or Ros has had a good game.  
And I think in order for us to do what we really want to do and having a shot
at winning a national championship we'll need not just those five but I would
say maybe eight, nine, coming off, with the four coming off the bench.  
Joslyn Tinkle hit a big shot for us. J.J. Hones hit a big shot and Melanie
Murphy came off playing a good Pac-10 tournament. Hopefully she can step up
more in the NCAA. And Michelle Harrison, until she got really -- got knocked
in the head, she's been practicing really well. So those are the people we're
really counting on.  
  
Q. My question is, this is not something that's going to be surprising to
you, but I think a lot of people have considered this tournament more than
anything else a coronation for Connecticut. And I wonder as the No. 2 team in
the country, obviously as a team that's only lost one game, when you hear that
stuff, when you read that stuff, what's your reaction to that, when, at least
externally, outside of your program, people believe that this is not really a
competition but a coronation this year?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, you know, Connecticut has -- obviously they've had a
great season. They've had a great run and they have great players. But we know
that it's getting the job done on that night.  
And I think sometimes, like when it's called the Connecticut Invitational, we
say, hey, we just want to get invited. And then we get there and let's play
well. And obviously for us right now our total focus is on Oklahoma. And what
we have to do is we just have to take care of -- it might be, you know -- I
don't know. I don't know what kind of preparation Connecticut does. I think
they have to prepare for whatever team came through there. I think they would
have to prepare for whether it's Duke or Baylor, too.  
I think we're all doing the same thing, just preparing for each game and
trying to get in the championship game.  
But they've made some just tremendous statements, a regional 40-point game,
and we win the regional with four seconds. So there's -- we're getting there
different ways. But we're all there. And we're very excited and I think for
us, you know, we want the opportunity to play in the championship game.  
  
Q. One thing that's interesting is sometimes when you have a -- lose a
really key player, how do the other players adjust to that? When you guys lost
Candice Wiggins and to make the Final Four without her, Oklahoma has done that
losing Courtney and Ashley Paris, could you talk about the challenge of coming
back after losing that dominant player and how sometimes other players step up
their games?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that's true, in that for us Candice was -- Candice
was so dominant for our team. But I think she taught other people how to
compete and brought confidence to people like Jeanette and Ros and Jayne. And
when you go there, you're like, wow, this is awesome, we want to go back and
we want to even obviously do better. So you kind of get -- I think you see
teams that go multiple years.  
A lot of different -- if you look at kind of the records, Auburn went through
years in a row. You have teams that go back multiple years. LSU, they went
five times in a row. So I think that the teams they get used to playing at
that level. They get used to winning at that level. And they pass it on. And
Candice did get it going for us. We were knocking on the door before that, but
she got it going for us and other people have said fine, let's keep going.  
  
Q. Could you comment on how strong your defense has been really throughout
this whole year, and particularly the challenges of trying to slow someone
like a Danielle Robinson on the perimeter, how your guards will respond to
that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think our defense on the perimeter has started with
Rosalyn Gold-Onwude. She always has been a really tough defender for us. But
she really takes it personally. And she really takes pride in her defense. And
she just -- we give her a kind of a job and if it's guarding Danielle
Robinson, we'll say here's some little tips, but she really she watches extra
video. She'll talk to me about, well, I'm not sure we should play that screen
that way.  
She's very intelligent. Like we played one player where when the player was
going right, we went over the screen. When she was going left, we went under
the screen. I mean, she really concentrates on her defense.  
After that, I think you've got players who, you know -- I call it Ros plays
kind of lockdown defense and other people are really great at taking charge.
Melanie Murphy. And Kayla Pedersen is a great defender at 6'4".  
Jayne and Necka, we play scouting report defense. I tell them this is what I
want you to do, and they work hard to do it. I think Jeanette works hard
defensively. Now we need people coming off the bench and giving us a little
bit more. Joslyn can help us more. J.J. plays excellent help side. She can
guard people and she's a very smart defender.  
  
Q. These teams are different, but you and Oklahoma, you guys have had
previous NCAA tournament meetings, most recently in 2006, Courtney's freshman
year. Could you talk about the style and philosophy you guys have had? Both of
you have had a lot of success.  
COACH VANDERVEER: You know, we haven't played for a while. Obviously, that was
the last time we played, and that was at The Alamodome actually. But we have
similar teams. And I think we approach the game kind of in similar ways, and
they have a go-to post player.  
They really -- they run a triangle. Maybe we run it different ways. But I
think we're similar, and just with playing them, I think there's a certain
comfort level for probably them and us. I mean, Danielle played on the same
team as Jayne Appel did, a summer team, East Bay Xplosion. They played against
-- Jeanette and Danielle played against each other for the state championship.  
So not just her but other people through USA Basketball. Abi Olajuwon from
Southern California. So there's a connection with our team and their team.  
  
Q. The fact that the Big 12 has got two of the Final Four teams in there,
and it's -- Nebraska obviously won the regular season undefeated and A &M won
the conference tournament title, and neither one of those teams are in San
Antonio, would that to you seem to suggest pretty good depth for the Big 12,
the fact that two teams that were kind of in the middle of the standings end
up in the Final Four?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, I think the Big 12 should be really commended and
complemented on their commitment to women's basketball.  
You don't have two teams in the Final Four or that many teams doing so well or
even that many teams invited unless you have a great commitment and it starts,
whether it's at the -- I think it starts probably at the conference level but
also at the individual university level, when you have what it seems to me is
that Big 12 teams value women's basketball.  
You have crowds. You do TV. You do promotion. I think the high salaries of
coaches are probably the averages in the Big 12. You probably have the
numbers. I don't have them at my fingertips. But there is a commitment and
just saying we value women's basketball.  
And I think it's a great statement, and I think it's something that I hope
that other conferences look at and say, hey, let's keep up with them. We don't
want to play second fiddle to the Big 12.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask if you could sort of assess the pluses and minuses of
playing a Final Four in a dome as you will this weekend as opposed to a
conventional arena, and if you sort of -- if there's any way to sort of
duplicate the experience before you get there or what you talk to your players
about in that circumstance.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Until you brought it up, I didn't think about it. We've
played there before. I'm going to say absolutely nothing. We're so excited to
be playing there. We're hoping that I'm sure it will be a great turnout. I
hope it will be a sellout. And it's just a great atmosphere.  
And just I think if you make a big deal about something, you'll find things
that confirm your hypothesis whether it's about shooting or defense or
whatever.  
But I'm just excited to be playing there and we're very excited to be going to
San Antonio.  
  
Q. Can you give me a couple things what Jayne Appel has meant to the
program?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, Jayne is -- we call her -- she drives a bus. Jayne is
the real deal. She's a competitor. She's a very skilled player. She's a great
passer from the center position. She scores. She rebounds. She runs the floor.
She defends. And I think she really loves playing for Stanford. And I think
she'll do a great job this weekend.  
And just you saying that just made me kind of well up thinking the fact I'm
only going to coach her for two more games. And I will miss her dearly. She's
my two-on-two basketball partner when we play in Arizona. Down there we play
two-on-two, and we're undefeated.  
  
Q. Wonder if I could ask you to expand a little more on Necka, but
specifically defense, because I think that's something she's also improved a
lot on, and just talk about how much she's grown and learned in her two
years?  
COACH VANDERVEER: We play a majority of our defense is player-to-player
defense. And so we need her to -- I think she's gotten good experience. We
need her to play against, usually, the 4. Whether that's sometimes Maya Moore,
whether that's Gilbreath in our conference or any number of different post
players. Last year it was Ashley Walker. She's played against really top
players. Necka is a competitor.  
She is very intellectual. She really takes things. She focuses and says, all
right, make this player go this way. Take away their strengths. She works very
hard at the defensive end of the floor, and I think she has improved a lot. I
think you're right.  
  
Q. It popped into my head sitting here watching ESPN seems as the expansion
on the men's side to 96 teams is a fait accompli, would that be a wise thing
for the women's game? And, if not, when do you think we could see reasonably
see a 96-team tournament?  
COACH VANDERVEER: You say you think it is a done deal?  
  
Q. Apparently Jim Delany from the Big Ten said -- used the words probable
and likely.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think if they do it on the men's side they should do it at
the same time on the women's side, just in the fact that opportunities to play
in the NCAA tournament are really special. And if that's what's -- I think so
many people are losing their jobs because they maybe don't go to the
tournament.  
Maybe that is motivating in a positive way for women's basketball too. If they
were to go next year, I would hope women's basketball would do the same thing.  
  
Q. Do you think there are 96 good teams -- I mean, if you had a tournament
to decide a champion, do you think there are 96 teams that would be worthy of
playing in it?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I do. You know, if you look at -- I mean, there are a lot --
I think there are teams in our conference that could have played in it and
competed very well in it. Because of the number of automatic bids, you know,
we played some closer games in our conference than we did against some of the
early rounds.  
So I think it would be -- if that's the decision in some ways people might say
it waters the tournament down, or maybe it's not as special. But I think that
we have to be open to change. And then once it's there, I don't think it will
ever come back. How many rounds would that be?  
  
Q. Apparently at least two.  
COACH VANDERVEER: Any play-ins first?  
  
Q. The format I've heard on the men's side is actually -- no, it would be
one more round. The format I've heard is the top 32 teams get a bye into -- I
guess to the regular 64 format, then the other 64 play.  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think that actually would be good. I think that would be
good. I think that would be good, actually, for women's basketball. Where you
wouldn't have like a tier one, like we're a 1 or Connecticut was a 1 or
playing a 96. But I think that would actually help women's basketball a lot.
And once you explain to me how they were going to do it, I think that would be
really, really good for women's basketball.  
  
Q. In what regard? How so?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Just in that that's one of the biggest problems we have is
developing that group of teams, those 64 teams. And it's not clear necessarily
that there are teams that are left out, and it's almost like the development
of the middle class of basketball, you know?  
Those are the teams that we need having incentive for and we need improving
and those teams that are on the bubble. So I think it would give them more
incentive, and we need women in the gym and offseason improving and getting
that experience because it's so positive that I think it's a big carrot that
could be used for teams and help develop our game.  
Even more so, I think the men's side, they're already there, so they're trying
to figure out who really deserves it, but for us it would really help us
develop it.  
  
Q. I know this game is a couple of years ago, and obviously the rosters have
changed and in particular for your team, Candice Wiggins has now moved on to
the pro ranks, but is there anything that your program can draw on from the
fact that you guys are the last team to beat UConn before they went on this
long run? Does it weigh at all into anything we're about to see over the next
couple of days?  
COACH VANDERVEER: If a rematch materializes, I think it helps people's
confidence on our team to be able to -- to know that they have been on the
winning side against Maya Moore or against Tina Charles.  
Now, these are different teams. But I think that when you go into a game like
that, I think that that would be helpful.  
I also think the fact that we're playing them and they have a great team and a
great program helps us get better.  
  
Q. The way the game transpired the other night, do you think that was kind
of a karma payback for some of the close losses you had in the regional finals
with Tennessee, maybe, and LSU?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't believe in that. But I think that, you know,
sometimes -- sometimes you're lucky. And that might have just been one of
those situations, and we're very fortunate to survive that game.  
And, I mean, I think Xavier gave us all we could handle, and there were a lot
of things that went wrong in that game, but it was really nice to have
something go right.  
RICK NIXON: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2010

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_SAN ANTONIO, TEXAS_  
  
RICK NIXON: We'll ask Coach Mulkey for opening remarks, then we'll take your
questions and answers.  
COACH MULKEY: I'm doing my best to sell tickets. Being in the state of Texas,
we certainly want the people from Texas to show up. And San Antonio is a great
city of entertainment, and we're excited to be there.  
We're young, and we are a team that has had ups and downs throughout the
course of the year, with injury and suspensions. But we have everybody back
and healthy. And we're just excited.  
RICK NIXON: Questions.  
  
Q. There's been so much press, particularly lately, on Brittney and what
people think she will be, and people sort of placing already some sort of
historical comparisons on her. Can you give me a sense of how the coaching
staff has managed expectations, in particular expectations that sort of are
being thrown around externally, outside of your program?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I'm not sure, unless you give me specifics of what
expectations you're referring to. If you're talking about the great player and
playing above the rim and all that, I can comment on that.  
  
Q. I think people are just -- in terms of people sort of saying that she's a
chance to be the best player of all time, people comparing her to sort of like
having Bill Russell-like impact. There's sort of the building of her
reputation, at least outside of your program, is really growing, in particular
over the last couple of weeks.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I would agree with all of that, because, guys, I've been
around this business since I was 14 years old. I've played international ball.
Olympic ball. A little bit of all of it.  
I've played with some of the greatest players ever. And against some of the
greatest players ever. I've played with big players. Uliana Simanova
(phonetic), the kid from China, all these great big players who are in Hall of
Fames, but I've never been around a player like Brittney Griner that plays
above the rim and can effortlessly dunk it with either hand. She can goaltend,
and I think that she can be the greatest ever.  
But the thing that I will tell you quickly about Brittney Griner is she's
never won a championship. The other night against Duke was the first time the
young lady's ever had an opportunity to cut a net down.  
She will tell you she came to Baylor not to become the greatest basketball
player ever, she came to help win a championship. Because there's no greater
feeling. While she understands with her size and her ability come much
recognition, welcomed recognition, much attention, but Brittney is the same
kid today that she was before she started the season, that she was in high
school.  
She's like a sponge. She wants to win. She wants to get better. She doesn't
want to disappoint people. And she's just got that hunger and that presence
about her that I'm not sure sometimes if she really realizes how much
attention she's garnering right now.  
I think she's just always been a kid that's tall and can do some other things
that other kids can't do, and she just comes to play.  
  
Q. In a couple of press conferences you've called her a sweet child. And I
wonder if you can give us a story or two that just sort of amplifies her
sweetness.  
COACH MULKEY: She's a hugger. She's a hugger. As athletes, sometimes we do the
high-fives and we do the handshakes and we do the chest-butting, but Brittney,
when you greet her and you meet her and she knows you, she just has a smile on
her face and she wraps these long arms all around you, and she's a hugger.  
And then when you talk to her it's yes, ma'am and no, ma'am, and then when you
watch her spend countless hours of her own time doing autographs with little
kids and putting them in her lap and holding them up. She doesn't have to do
those things.  
But she enjoys doing them. And she understands that, you know, that's what
mannerly people do. And she's not any different in that she has a competitive
fire about her. But her mannerisms don't fit her body. Her mannerisms, if you
watch her play, even just watching her play, she has like a little sweet
softness about how she runs down the floor.  
I watched her so many times in high school, just take those arms and just wrap
them around her teammates in a huddle. And so she has a gentle side to her
that I think people just don't really realize that don't know her. They see
this big body, and she's just really gentle.  
  
Q. When we were in Memphis, you said you'd worry about Connecticut tomorrow.
Well, tomorrow's coming closer. I'm sure you probably watched last night. Just
your impressions of what your task is going to be on Sunday night?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, actually I didn't watch the game because, as you well
know, my family comes first. And my daughter had a softball game at that time,
and I knew that I could watch that game later and tape it. And that's what I
did. So I didn't see it live. I went to my daughter's softball game.  
What can I tell you that 37 other teams haven't already told you? We are up
against, I guess you'd say -- what is it? -- David versus Goliath. And I have
so much respect for what Connecticut has done. And I don't think there's
anything but positive to be written about that program.  
And we understand the challenge. We understand that we're not supposed to win.
We understand 37 other teams haven't won. We understand the win streak. But we
still have to play. And so we'll go out there and do like those other teams
did and just play hard and do the best that we can.  
  
Q. Just in terms of just some nuts and bolts, when you look at that team,
you talked about how you've been around the game since you were 14, can you
put this team in some kind of context with its talent?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I listened to what Geno says because I don't pretend to
know his team like he does. But from what he's said, he said this is not his
most talented team. I know this: This particular team is pretty darn good. And
nobody else has been able to beat them. And they're just darn good.  
And you try to think, well, maybe we can do this against them, and then they
expose this. Or maybe we can play this defense against them, and then they
expose you here. They're good individually. They're great collectively. And
when you add a team that is number one in the country in field goal percentage
defense, that has my attention more than anything they do on the offensive
end.  
I think the story of them being number one in field goal percentage defense
and Baylor being number two in field goal percentage defense sends a strong
message to recruits across the country.  
While we're going to help you make All-American teams and get to Final Fours,
when you come to these two programs, you're going to have to guard people.  
  
Q. One thing -- and I don't know if you've seen enough of Connecticut, but
watching the game last night, some of the commentators were mentioning the
fact that -- they can be up 20, 30 points and they're playing like they're
down 10. And is that one of the things that maybe is more maybe in the fact
that they haven't been challenged in a game, but it doesn't really matter what
the score is, they just seem to play at a high level no matter what the score
is?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, that starts with your coaching staff. I'm sure Geno
doesn't allow them to look at the scoreboard. You go play. And when you're
good, you don't have to look at a scoreboard. You just go play.  
And I think a lot of it is the competitor in you. A lot of it is they
understand the attention that they have received because of the win streak.
And at this point in the season, it's not about the win streak. Those kids are
trying to win a national championship.  
  
Q. How difficult or will it be difficult for you to convince your players
that we can win this game?  
COACH MULKEY: No. You don't even -- you go into a film room at this stage and
you're breaking down individual tendencies of players and the team and then
you go in and say here's what we're going to try to do, here's what we're
going to do.  
You don't at this point of the season need to do a bunch of rah-rah stuff and
say you can do it, it's David versus Goliath. These are grown women in a lot
of respects in that they've played enough games to be beyond the motivational
talks.  
And you've got to be in that film room and you've got to study the strengths
and weaknesses of who you're guarding and what we're trying to do and then
just leave it on that floor, just leave everything you have on that floor, and
that's what we'll do.  
  
Q. One other thing, just obviously Oklahoma is there. Two Big 12 teams.
Again, what does that say about the Big 12 conference? I know it's all been
said before, but the fact that getting half the Final Four in San Antonio, how
big a deal and how special is that?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, it's very special. For those of us coaches in the Big 12
you're always proud to see your conference do well, because while we recruit
against each other, and we compete against each other in the league, we're
still a conference that can sell the league.  
And I think that to have two from the same conference playing in San Antonio,
particularly that both schools and their fans are within driving distance of
San Antonio, I would hope that Oklahoma and Baylor would have the most fans
there and appreciate that we're hosting in a region or an area that they can
come see them.  
  
Q. First, could you talk about how Brittney -- it seems to me she blocks
shots in a very intelligent way. She's not trying to swat them into the third
row. She's trying to keep the ball in play, which is a smarter way to do it
and she gets you more possessions that way. If you could sort of talk about
that philosophy, how she blocks shots. And then also about how your other
freshmen in particular have grown and how they're able to play with her in
terms of really relying on that force inside but also how well their defense
has improved during the course of the season?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't think any coach can teach a player of Brittney's length
and height to block shots. She does that naturally. And the amazing thing is
Brittney doesn't get in foul trouble very much from blocking shots.  
And she's able to time it. She doesn't leave the floor until she sees the
opportunity to just go up and get it. And then also she's able to defend
differently than most because when most mess up defensively, they're playing
catch up. Brittney can play catch up and still block a shot.  
So her blocked shot, the way she's blocking shots is really Brittney's just
athleticism and timing. I think that other players around her, when a shot is
blocked, have learned to don't stand still, because that's like a turnover. Go
get that blocked shot off the floor like a loose ball and let's go and
transition and try to make something happen.  
If I remember the second part of your question, you may have to remind me of
what you said, but if it was about the other freshmen around her. A lot of
their progress has to be attributed to Melissa Jones' injury. We didn't have
Melissa Jones for the Big 12 conference except for maybe one and a half of a
game, and they were thrown into the mix. Not by choice, but because they had
to play.  
And now at the end of the year with Melissa Jones back in the lineup, I don't
hesitate to play them.  
  
Q. You mentioned this isn't the time you do a lot of rah-rah speeches, this
is really a lot of X and Os and basic film work, but it still strikes me that
part of facing UConn is not to succumb to the, oh, wow it's UConn and they
can't be beaten. That's really kind of the essence of your personality. Could
you talk about how you impart some of that or if you do in the course of
preparation?  
COACH MULKEY: That may be the case with some programs, is just the name UConn
is intimidating before you ever hit the floor. I really want to give UConn
more credit than that. Just the fact that they're so dang talented and good is
what's beating people.  
I just -- having been a player myself and going through an era at Louisiana
Tech that was the UConn of the '80s, and you had Tennessee after that and Old
Dominion before that, the players I played against weren't intimidated by
Louisiana Tech any more than we were intimidated by other teams.  
I just think that there's -- it's just the fact that they're good. It's not
that that streak or UConn, the name, bothers you; they're just darn good.  
  
Q. I know you maybe touched on this a little bit already. But if I can ask
you to draw upon all your experience once again, have you ever been in a
tournament or seen a tournament where a team like UConn was so dominant and
was so favored to run away with this?  
COACH MULKEY: I don't know. Gosh, man, I feel like I'm old having gone through
so many eras of good basketball. I guess not, because they hold the record for
most consecutive wins, and nobody's really come close to them. I was looking
at their scores of the teams that have come closest to them. When you can do
that for that period of time, you're pretty dominant.  
And when you're winning and you're good and you know you're good, man, that
snowballs into making you feel like you're even greater than you are. But the
thing that you gotta remember, guys, I don't care how good UConn is, one day
they will lose, just like Louisiana Tech lost when we held that 50-something-
game win streak. Tennessee, all those teams. It's inevitable.  
But I know this: They have my utmost respect. And, gosh, we're up to a
monumental challenge, and I just hope that we can keep it close.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about Morghan Medlock's journey to this point and
could you talk about the courage that she's shown since she's been with you?  
COACH MULKEY: Morghan Medlock came on a visit, wanted to transfer from USC.
And like I do with all transfers, I sit down and we have lengthy
conversations. And I basically try to scare them away, because with transfers
you must understand they're all transferring for a reason.  
And if you're going to come into this program, you must understand what's
tolerated and what's not tolerated. And after having that conversation with
Morghan Medlock and her honesty of why she wanted to come here, it convinced
me that this is where she needed to be. And then when her mother was murdered
last year, without question Morghan Medlock was where she needed to be.  
And she has matured so much off the floor, not just because she's older now,
but because she understands life, and she understands basketball is just a
very small part of it. And it's been fun to watch her finish her senior year
experiencing something that she never got to experience, and that's a Final
Four. And being the only senior, it has to be a little more special for her.  
  
Q. If I could take you in a different direction. A couple seconds ago you
sort of in passing talked about the winning streak that you had at Louisiana
Tech and you mentioned Old Dominion and Tennessee and programs like that. Do
you have a fear that the history of this sport is kind of getting lost?  
COACH MULKEY: No, I don't. Not any more than my great-grandchildren won't know
who Michael Jordan is. That's what life's all about. It's change. It's
different eras. You just move on. And those that grew up during the Louisiana
Tech era will talk about it for a long time. Those that were there in Old
Dominion, the Immaculata era will share that with generations.  
But I really don't. I just think that with time comes change, and it's just
Connecticut's time and it's their era.  
  
Q. Could you break down the matchup, what you expect to see between Brittney
and Tina Charles?  
COACH MULKEY: No, I really can't break it down because, honestly, I'm still
studying films. But I can probably before we play them. I've spent so much
time just looking at the team itself, to break that matchup down it would be
more generic of you're dealing with, what, two big girls that are presence in
the paint. They're both great defensively. They block a lot of shots. And I
would imagine it's going to be a battle down there and very physical.  
  
Q. You said earlier in the teleconference you don't expect to win this game.
What did you mean by that and why? You said you didn't expect to win this
game.  
COACH MULKEY: No, I didn't say we didn't expect it. I said why would the
expectations be any different than the other 37. Nobody expects us to win this
game. We're going to go in and we're going to fight and we're going to do the
best we can and do our work and do -- just play as hard as we can and see what
happens.  
But you can't go into a game with a defeatist attitude. Who would want to play
for a coach who had that kind of attitude?  
You go in, you present things to your team that you think will help you or
will help put you in a position to win. But, no, I don't have a defeatist
attitude.  
  
Q. UConn obviously in so many of their games, even against top opponents,
they seem to get on huge runs where not only do they take a huge lead but the
opponent seems to lose a little heart, a little belief that they can play with
these folks. Is that going to be a point of emphasis for you guys just to, A,
stay out of that sort of position but also just not to lose heart if things
start to go south?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, I hope I can have some timeouts left and help them there.
I hope we can just keep using as many timeouts as we can. In fact, I'm going
to ask Geno before the game if I can have his five timeouts, and if he'll give
me those, then I'll take 'em.  
But I don't know, guys, that I'm going to talk about the negatives. See, to me
that's a negative. Talk about the positive. Talk about what we do well. Here's
what they do well. Here's what you gotta do, in our opinion, to slow them down
and try to keep it close, and who knows what will happen.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what attributes Brittney has that you think can
make her the best player ever? Other than the fact that she plays above the
rim better than anybody ever has, what other things does she do well on the
court?  
COACH MULKEY: This may be the best thing I could say: When you go into a film
room and you're scouting your opponent, we all go, here's what we have to do,
look at her on film. Man, she's an impact here. Brittney Griner alters your
thinking and sometimes makes you completely change your style of play.  
And that probably sends a message as to why a lot of people think that she
will be one of the greatest to ever play the game, because she takes away some
of, if not a lot of, most team's strength.  
I've seen post players shoot the 3 ball the whole night and not post because
that's their strategy of how to get Brittney away from the goal. And not many
times are coaches willing to change what they do so good on the offensive end
because of one player. But, yet, I think a lot of coaches do that.  
  
Q. One other question, what do you appreciate about the way UConn plays
defense? You obviously play great defense because you're No. 2 in the country.
What do you appreciate about how they play the game defensively?  
COACH MULKEY: I said it earlier. It's not written about enough. I think one of
the big stories needs to be that they are the number one team in the country
in field goal percentage defense and Baylor is the No. 2 team in the country.  
If I was just a fan and didn't know anything about Connecticut and didn't know
anything about Baylor and I saw that stat, a true basketball fan would say: I
like those two coaches because they make those kids play both ends of the
floor.  
  
Q. But is there anything in particular they do well defensively?  
COACH MULKEY: Well, they're active. They're very active. They're very big. You
know, they have great help side. They have a post in there that blocks shots.
They get in passing lanes. They create a lot of their offense from turnovers.  
RICK NIXON: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2010

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

  
RICK NIXON: We're joined by Oklahoma Sooners head coach Sherri Coale. We'll
start with an opening statement and then go to questions.  
COACH COALE: Thank you, Rick. I appreciate it. Our basketball team is
incredibly honored to have earned the right to participate in the Final Four
in San Antonio, and we are very much looking forward to it after the
hospitality that we experienced in San Antonio in 2002. We know what a
fantastic job the city does in welcoming the NCAA championship and we can't
wait to get there and compete.  
And just really, really proud of this bunch of kids and looking forward to the
opportunity.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you kind of big picture, obviously first time the Big 12
has managed to get two teams to the Final Four, and I know all the time you
coaches are always talking about how great the conference is, and obviously it
is. But from a national standpoint, does this really kind of help underline
the fact that particularly this year the Big 12 is really tough considering
that Nebraska won the regular season and A &M won the tournament but two other
teams are in the Final Four?  
COACH COALE: I think if there were any doubters out there as to the difficulty
of our league, they've been made believers by just what's happened. I don't
know how you can look at that and not realize the depth and parity within our
league.  
And I think what we face on a Wednesday/Saturday basis in the Big 12
conference is what enables two teams like Baylor and ourselves to fight
through the NCAA tournament and end up in the Final Four competition that we
face regularly prepares us.  
  
Q. Also wanted to ask you, we talked to Tara and Geno about this, but I
guess Jim Delany, the Big Ten commissioner, said he thinks it's probable that
the men's will expand to 96. That's something that's been talked about quite a
bit. Do you think if the men's tournament expands to 96, is there a reason for
the women's tournament to expand? Are there enough teams deserving to be in a
96-team women's field if it gets to that?  
COACH COALE: No, we're not ready for it.  
  
Q. Your team's been playing real well late in the season, had a good run
through the conference tournament. But, in any sense, are you surprised you
guys are here?  
COACH COALE: No, absolutely not. Love this bunch. They've believed from day
one. Nothing they do has surprised me ever, on a daily basis or in the process
of a game, putting games together.  
We were talking as a staff -- I'm not sure we lost two games in a row all
year. We just -- we had the Connecticut-Nebraska stretch there in our season,
but other than that we've played incredibly tough competition and been able to
rebound and turn ourselves around.  
So this group has a special resolve about them. So, no, no surprise here.  
  
Q. Stanford's a pretty familiar tournament opponent for you as a coach and
your staff, but does this Stanford team look like some of the other ones
you've played? Is this a familiar system?  
COACH COALE: Yes, they're big and skilled and smart and, I must add, very well
coached.  
  
Q. I ask this kind of in jest, but do you think you guys will make the Final
Four when Connecticut is not on an undefeated run coming into the Final Four
at the same time?  
COACH COALE: I probably owe you an answer about Stanford from last night. I
apologize about that. You know, I don't know. I don't know. Somebody's gotta
beat Connecticut, somebody has got to stop the madness at some point. And I
don't know if it really matters if they're undefeated or not. They seem to
always be in the Final Four and they seem to always find their way into the
championship game.  
I don't know what our tournament would do without them. Since I've been
coaching, I think they've been in it but one year maybe. Maybe two. One.  
I don't know. They're really good and they're playing really well right now.  
  
Q. I'm working on a story about Amanda Thompson. Strikes me that she has
this kind of -- you talked about her being an old soul and the heart of a
lion. Just talk about she's been through a lot in terms of the shoulder
problems and just how she's grown up at Oklahoma and the type of player she is
right now.  
COACH COALE: Well, Amanda will be the first to tell you there isn't anything
that happens on the basketball court that's really hard for her because of
just things she's had to experience and get through in her life. This is a
Bowl. This is a game. While things may be challenging, nothing's really hard.
And I think that is revealed in the way that she plays.  
She is as sincere of a kid as I've ever worked with, just incredibly
coachable, a sponge. Wants to learn, wants to work, wants to get better. Wants
to do the right thing. And where she has really grown I think is in her
ability to lead people. She came here. She wanted to do the right thing all
the time. But she didn't necessarily want to demand it of everybody around
her.  
She was of the mindset I'm going to take care of my business and what you do
is entirely up to you. And so sometimes teaching kids to learn how to demand
the same from the people around them as they demand from themselves is as
tough as anything. Kids fight that sometimes.  
A.T. didn't. It was hard for her. But she didn't fight it and she's become an
exceptional leader on our team.  
  
Q. Sherri, you had the opportunity to play Baylor three times a year, twice
during the regular season and once in the championship. What did you see out
of Brittney Griner? Could you give us a scouting report, what you expect?  
COACH COALE: As impactful as she is on the offensive end, it's the defensive
end where I think she makes the biggest difference.  
I think we can all put together some schemes to keep the ball away from
really, really talented post players. I shouldn't say keep the ball away, but
to minimize the touches of really talented post players, whether you sag or
you double or you go on a catch or you go on the bounce or you zone. There's a
million different things you can do.  
That doesn't mean you're going to keep her from scoring baskets. You can
minimize and maybe neutralize a little bit. On the defensive end it's a
conundrum, because she can stand in the middle of a lane and block your shock
outside the elbow. And I'm not exaggerating, there's no hyperbole there. It's
really, really hard to get to the basket.  
So at the end of the day to beat Baylor, you're going to have to make some
outside shots. And you're going to have to not turn the ball over and you're
going to have to not be impacted emotionally and mentally once you block
shots, because until you've been on the floor with it, it's a really, really
hard thing to handle. And the first time we played against them, it took us by
surprise.  
And, you know, you prepare for it. You watch film. You test out -- if you're
tall and you try to replicate it as best you can. And you just can't. And the
more we were on the floor with it, the better I think we got at dealing with
her defensive presence. But it's a different deal.  
  
Q. You had a chance to play UConn earlier in the season. Is there anything
you've seen from that team watching the film, heading into the Final Four,
lately that gives your team a better idea of what to do to try to defeat
them?  
COACH COALE: Again, I think there's no substitute for being on the floor with
your foe. There's maybe a mystique that can be dismantled. There's the
confidence that grows from being on the floor with an opponent. So I think
maybe experience is the best teacher there.  
  
Q. This Final Four is a homecoming for Lyndsey Cloman. Can you just talk
about how she's grown this season and the contributions that she's made to
your team?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, you know, Lyndsey is like most freshmen when they come into
college and they've played every minute of their high school careers and
they've been the go-to and the horse that their team has ridden.  
She doesn't get to play very much and it was difficult for her. I think like
most incoming freshmen, they have to adjust to a new role as well as a new
pace and an entirely different style of basketball. More knowledge than their
brain could take at a given time.  
It's like they're thirsty for a drink and you're spraying them with a water
hose. Lyndsey did a great job of learning how to be, first and foremost, an
excellent teammate. And then, secondly, but just as important, a learner every
day in practice. And she has continued over the last month, especially. She's
continued to learn and grow, and you start to see a buildup of some of that
attention paid and reps, experience throughout the year.  
She's making the most of the time with Abi and learning from her and pushing
her and being a great teammate with Abi. And I think Lyndsey really has a
chance to help us. I really like the way she's embraced her role over the last
month or the last six to eight weeks, I should say.  
  
Q. You talked about the San Antonio and the hospitality here. What makes
this -- specifically what makes this a great venue for the Final Four and do
you see San Antonio being in the mix for this event for years to come?  
COACH COALE: Boy, I hope so. And I'll tell you this: We were fortunate enough
to be in the Final Four in 2002. And I talked to some men's coaches after
that. And, you know, without fail, the men's coaches that I spoke to said the
best city in America to have the Final Four in is San Antonio.  
So I think we were a little bit spoiled, that being our only experience there,
we were a little bit spoiled, and I think it comes from a couple of things.
Number one, the weather is usually fantastic. And the atmosphere that
surrounds the Riverwalk. It's just festive and it presents opportunities for
the charm of the tournament to really grow.  
You know, you go up and down the Riverwalk and people are wearing their colors
and yelling "Boomer Sooner" and whatever the Huskies do. Do they bark?
Whatever. It's conducive to that thing that makes collegiate athletics so
special.  
And last but not least the hospitality, the people there. The city of San
Antonio loves basketball. You can tell. And everybody in the city -- here's
the most impressive thing. I've been to Final Fours not as a participant but
as a coach attending a convention and a championship all over the United
States. And you go in some cities and three-fourths of the people don't know
what's going on in their city.  
I didn't encounter one individual in San Antonio who said, Now why are you
here? Everybody would say, oh, you must be here for the women's championship.
That was a cool feeling.  
  
Q. My question is about Geno, someone who you know very well and have
coached against many times. In terms of looking historically among the coaches
in the women's game, where would you rank him at this point?  
COACH COALE: He's the best.  
  
Q. Absolute, he's the best?  
COACH COALE: I don't think there's any question.  
  
Q. Why?  
COACH COALE: His consistency. The high bar that he sets and the demands that
he makes on his kids. Excellent recruiter. Recruits kids who can and will play
the way he wants to play. And that's the magic, in my opinion, of recruiting,
getting the kids that you want to coach who can play the way you think the
game ought to be played.  
And I think it's really, really hard to maintain the edge that his team's
maintained through all of the success that they've experienced, and I think
that's probably his gift at the end of it all.  
  
Q. First, you and Kim are more or less contemporaries, and I can't remember
when you started at your respective schools, but you've been there for a
similar length of time. Could you talk about how Kim has built the Baylor
program?  
COACH COALE: Again, she's recruited kids who can play the way she wants to
play. Her teams are very hard-nosed, very tough. She's had star after star. I
think of Sheila Lambert and Sophia Young. I think of Brittney Griner. I throw
Tisdale in that mix, too. I love that point guard. I thought she was
fantastic.  
Kim always seems to have a heady, tough point guard and been a superstar. She
built her teams that play in a similar way to the way that she played, tough
and smart and unrelenting.  
And I think she's done it by going after those kind of kids who flourish in
that environment.  
  
Q. I wonder if you would elaborate on your statement about the women's field
is not quite ready for 96 teams. Tara VanDerveer mentioned earlier a couple of
hours ago -- said she thought an expansion might sort of -- I want to make
sure I get it right -- either help the middle class of women's basketball or
establish one. If that makes sense.  
COACH COALE: Well, I have a very strong opinion about it. I don't think it's
good for the men's game. How could you -- why would you touch what just
happened in the men's tournament?  
I'm speechless to even respond to it. How could you ask for a better sporting
event than what's just occurred? And you look at our women's tournament and
we've had all kinds of close games and victories at the end and overtimes.
We're getting it. We're figuring it out.  
And I think anytime you expand that field, what you're doing is a couple of
things. Number one, watering down what happens. And, number two, you're sort
of defeating what you're trying to accomplish with parity in terms of
competitive games and earning the right to be in something special.  
And I'll tell you, I just feel very strongly that getting into the tournament
is something that you earn over the course of a season. And I don't think that
just everybody should get to go.  
You know, I'm about to go on the soapbox about my daughter's third place
soccer trophy in the garage. I won't go there. I'll spare you. But I just
think that getting an invitation to go means you have accomplished something.
And the wider and broader we make that field, maybe the less significant that
accomplishment.  
  
Q. Speaking of trophies, who is going to get possession of the homemade
trophy?  
COACH COALE: Oh, that one goes in the locker room. That one will stay in the
locker room until it disintegrates from old age.  
  
Q. Nyeshia last night, what kind of jet fuel was she on? The couple of
steals she had at mid-court -- I know the other team, Kentucky, was supposed
to be quick. I know she played really well in Kansas City, but she seemed,
last night, to just be going to another gear.  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I would agree with you. And I have no idea why I didn't
feed her whatever I fed her earlier. I think she just -- she just realized
that she had an early drive to the basket and just short-armed a layup. And I
think she realized on that drive -- and we've had this conversation during
countless games throughout the year, you can get to the rim, you can get to
the rim. And she'll shake her head in agreement. But there's not really a buy-
in there, a belief.  
And when I told her at the timeout last night you can do that every time and
you will make that layup, I saw in her eyes that she understood that she could
do that.  
And it became a priority for her. And interesting, because her first year as a
freshman, the ball came out of her hand a different way every single time she
shot it. Her perimeter shooting touch was not very good. And that's probably
being kind.  
And so what she did was she got to the rim and she got to the rim and she got
to the rim, and then she worked on her shot and she became the 3-point shooter
that I couldn't convince to get to the rim.  
And so finally, over the course of this past year and a half, she's realized
how to put those two things together and how one can complement another. And
she just got in the gear last night. There were a couple of plays in the open
floor where she came up with a rebound or came up with a deflection, turned
into a steal, and dribbled past two Kentucky players who were running full
speed, without a ball. And these guys aren't slow.  
I mean, their team is very athletic. So maybe she's realized there is still
yet another gear and we'll see that a couple more times.  
  
Q. When she's improved her outside shot and the ability to get to the rim,
is this one of those things that just maybe right now in her career where
everything's kind of crystallized into saying, hey, I've kind of got -- I've
got the package here and I can sort of, you know, do whatever the defense
gives me?  
COACH COALE: Nyeshia is one of those cases where when we signed her at the
University of Oklahoma she was really raw. She was an athlete who had a very,
very limited skill package. And she has grown and progressed as much as any
kid I've ever had in our program.  
But I don't think she's playing as good of -- I don't think she's playing as
well as she's going to play at the next level. I think she's probably piqued
the interest of a lot of WNBA coaches. She's one of those where you can't
afford to not take a look at her, because if there's this other level up
there, it could be something really special.  
And I think she's given us some glimpse of that. And the thing about Nyeshia,
she's learned how to work at a really high level. And with all that
athleticism and that skill that she's developed, accompanied with the work
ethic, she can still do some things.  
  
Q. To talk a little bit more about Nyeshia, she seems to have grown from
this player that a couple of years ago really didn't want the ball in her
hands when the game was on the line to a player that's kind of carried you the
last two games. Could you talk about the heart of Nyeshia, what you've seen
her grown as a player this year, particularly?  
COACH COALE: Well, it's been a progression of four years, obviously. She had
to learn how to listen first, and then she had to learn how to do things that
are hard. And this is interesting in that it seems over the years the kids
that have been the toughest to teach in terms of effort, you can play so much
harder than you're playing right now. The kids that I've battled with over the
years end up in their senior years to be the kids that find this other
ethereal plane where they just get after it.  
I think of Laneisha Caufield. Everybody knows how hard Caufield played down
the stretch in her senior year. I fought her as hard as any kid I've ever
fought early on in her career, saying you can't take possessions off. You have
to play harder. Laura Andrews, another kid who just thought she was playing as
hard as she possibly could. And then when she figured out, hey, there's this
other gear, became just an unbelievably hard-nosed player for us in her senior
year. So Nyeshia's progression is not unlike those of the two players I just
explained.  
She figured out it hurts, it always hurts to go to that next level. But she's
not going to die, and the result of having gone there and performed there is
worth all the pain and then some. And now she loves it. She loves competing
like that.  
  
Q. Coming into the season everybody was saying no Courtney or Ashley Paris,
no chance at a Final Four. Then when Whitney gets hurt absolutely no chance at
a Final Four. Was there ever a time when anybody on this team thought that
that still couldn't be accomplished?  
COACH COALE: I really don't think so. I go back to the day after or the
afternoon immediately following the game when Whitney tore her knee up. And
when I called the team together, just the look in their eyes, I can't say they
looked at me with complete conviction that we're going to the Final Four, but
they looked at me believing that we could become special.  
They knew it would take a while. But they believed that the end result, if
everybody bought in and did what they were supposed to do and what was
expected of them, that we could become extraordinary.  
And I say that "if," because that was the thing. And they looked at each other
with an honesty and sincerity and kind of here's where you make the choice,
the line in the sand has been drawn, either we all buy in completely, 100
percent to taking care of our business and we be extraordinary, or we don't
and it's over.  
And it was that look of really just stripped down pure honesty -- I can't
think of a better way to describe it -- that made me know that we had a chance
to do something special.  
  
Q. Can we just -- your first impressions of a matchup with Stanford, and I
know this Final Four there's going to be a lot of focus on big players, Tina
and Brittney, certainly, and then Stanford's got its big players inside, but
what's your first impressions of a matchup?  
COACH COALE: Well, the first thing I think of when I think of Stanford is a
multitude of weapons. They never come in and just have one or two guys that
lead them in scoring. They always have balance. They always play well
together. They're very disciplined, very methodical about what they do, a very
rhythmic offense.  
So the charge, I think, is always to disrupt them in some way. And that's a
lot easier said than done.  
  
Q. With 4.4 seconds on the clock, would you go the length, would you call
timeout, what would you have done?  
COACH COALE: I'll tell you what, it depends on your personnel, it depends on
the situation, it depends on your opponent and what you've seen from them all
night long.  
We have plays that we practice all the time, length of the floor. We have, if
they let you get it in, dribble across half court, one dribble across half
court and pick it up call timeout. We have a quick hit from the sidelines. It
depends on what you have in your package and what your kids feel comfortable
with.  
I think the most important thing at that juncture in a game, whether it's 4.4
or 2.3 or 7, it doesn't really matter, but when you've got the ball with
seconds to go, most important thing is that your kids feel confident about
what you ask them to do.  
And if you go out there and you draw something that they've never done before
and they're the least bit confused or uncomfortable, you're not going to be
successful.  
So I think it's much more their confidence level and their comfort level than
the exact thing that you diagram to do.  
RICK NIXON: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## March 31, 2010

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
RICK NIXON: We're joined by Connecticut head coach Geno Auriemma. We'll start
with an opening statement and then go to questions.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Wow, it's been kind of a whirlwind 48 hours, getting back last
night and spending a couple of minutes with some of the players here today and
going over the schedule coming up. No matter how many times you've been in
this, it never ceases to amaze me the intensity level that you try to squeeze
in in such a short period of time and how quickly it gets on top of you and
how quickly all of a sudden you've got to get to a place and get ready for a
game. And, yet, every coach in America hopes and prays for being in that
situation.  
I'm very fortunate, as is my staff and my players. We had an incredible run at
the regionals. And we're tired, I'm sure, from getting in late last night, but
we can't wait to get on the plane tomorrow and go to San Antonio and get ready
to play on Sunday night.  
So that's where I am, and I'm sure that's where Kim and Tara and Sherri are.  
RICK NIXON: Questions.  
  
Q. Just want to ask you about Brittney Griner. What do you think about her
as a player and her future?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, I haven't had the chance to watch Brittney play an awful
lot, either at a distance or up close. You know, you tend to spend a lot more
time with teams that you know are on your schedule.  
But I was watching a couple of their games today, and from what I've seen
briefly and from what I've been able to put together, obviously there's no one
like her in the game today. I think she's on the tip of everyone's tongue when
it comes to conversations about what is one of the most exciting things that's
happening in the game of women's basketball.  
And I think she's improved tremendously from when I saw her in high school, in
just a short period of time. And I don't think there's been anyone that young
that's been able to impact games as much as she's had the ability to do,
especially in the NCAA tournament and the Big 12 tournament as well. And I
would like to think that her future is -- like maybe Yogi Berra would say, her
future is still ahead of her. She's only going to get better. She's only going
to get better. If she's this good now, it's scary how good she'll be when she
gets a little more experience and a little more mature.  
  
Q. Can you give us your perspective on your lengthy winning streak versus
national championships, and I guess it boils down if you had a choice between
an 88-game winning streak or national championships, if you could only have
one, which would it be?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's easy. I mean, national championships are what define, I
think, players and coaches. In the end, that's the prize that everyone that
coaches a team or plays on a team strives for.  
I think winning streaks are a byproduct of doing the things you feel like you
need to do to win the ultimate prize, which is the national championship. I
guarantee you, if we were fortunate enough to win a national championship, my
team would be celebrating a lot more than celebrating whatever streak happens
to be going on at that time.  
And I'm exactly the same way. I don't think anything can take the place of
winning a championship.  
  
Q. I've got a question for you about possibility of expanding the
tournament. Jim Delany was quoted today in the USA Today saying that expansion
on the men's side -- the words that were used were probable and likely. Do you
think that would be a good idea for the women's field to go to 96 at some
point soon?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, you know, when you look at the rationale, like what's
the rationale for the men's team, for the men's tournament going to 96, is
there because there are 96 teams that are worthy of being in the tournament,
or does it make sense on some other level?  
I don't know. If you take the rationale are there 96 teams in America that
have proven over the course of a year that they should compete for the
national championship, I would say no.  
I haven't seen it. That doesn't mean that it's not going to happen or it
doesn't mean it should or it shouldn't. If you ask me in my personal opinion,
I have not seen that there are 96 teams that could compete for the national
championship in women's basketball.  
Maybe someday there will be. I just don't see it right now.  
  
Q. If I could follow that up, I asked Tara the same question about an hour
or so ago, and she felt that what a 96-team tournament could do would -- I'm
paraphrasing her; I hope I'm getting her words exactly right -- she said it
would help the middle class of women's basketball, those teams that are sort
of on the bubble, but it might help make the whole field better.  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're talking about almost doubling the field. I mean, okay,
so actually by a third, I guess. But if you're asking me -- I think there's
two different questions here. If you're saying from a competitive standpoint,
does it make sense because you would improve the field, because there's that
many teams that are that good that are being left out, I would say no.  
If you're doing it for other reasons, you're trying to grow the game, you're
trying to make coaches feel like we've accomplished something, you're trying
to give kids that experience, you know, it's like going into a Bowl system.  
Do that many teams deserve to be in a Bowl game? Because they've had great
seasons. I don't know. If you're saying for the experience of the college
student-athlete, sure. I'm all for that. I'm all for that.  
I think it's the same thing that we do in the Big East tournament. We allow
all 16 teams to come to the Big East tournament, because I think it's the
right thing to do, from an experience standpoint, of kids experiencing the
tournament.  
But if you're asking me from a competitive standpoint, does it make the field
better, I would say no.  
  
Q. I wonder if you can just give us a breakdown, a sort of specific
breakdown how you handle the scouting for Baylor. Was there a coach assigned
to the previous game? Would you assign certain coaches to look at certain
things on each of their teams? Do you do everything as a staff? I mean,
obviously, without giving away trade secrets, how do you approach the scouting
of a Final Four opponent, in particular one that you haven't seen a lot of?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think when the brackets come out, you know that there's
potentially -- if you're going to play six games, you know you're looking at
what the matchups are, and these are the possible opponents. And at that point
in time, the coaching staff starts to divvy up who is going to take which
opponents.  
And then you go from there. So Shea Ralph had the main responsibility of
Florida State, and now Chris Dailey has Baylor, because that's the way it
played out. That doesn't mean that everybody else is doing nothing. That's
just kind of the way it plays out.  
The same thing will happen for the other two teams if we're fortunate enough
to win. Somebody's already involved in breaking down those two teams. So you
can't wait until the last minute. It's been ongoing.  
This is not the first time that our coaches have been looking at Baylor.
You're doing that even before the brackets come out, to a certain extent. As
the season started to wear down, late February, early March, our coaches are
starting to look at teams around the country we haven't seen a lot of and
starting to watch them play.  
Like, for instance, we had watched Nebraska play. Even though they got knocked
out. You know, we wanted to be at least a little bit involved with who they
are, because we have never played them, we had not seen them.  
So that's something that I think our staff has been doing all along, and I'm
sure everybody else is doing a similar thing, maybe not in the same way.  
  
Q. Just curious, just your opinion on what this great streak of your guys
has done for the game. Has it really helped draw interest and excitement for
the sport, and can you see where fans might also say they're winning by so
much, things are kind of predictable right now?  
COACH AURIEMMA: You're with the Wall Street Journal?  
  
Q. I am.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Have you ever covered women's basketball before?  
  
Q. Certainly have.  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's not a normal thing for the Wall Street Journal to do.  
  
Q. Yeah, but we do sports now.  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'm using it to illustrate there's a lot of different entities
right now that are asking questions about the game that didn't ordinarily ask
those questions, and the fact that the questions are being asked means that
there's a certain level of interest in that the game on Sunday coming up
between us and Baylor, I gotta believe there's a lot of people interested to
see who wins that game.  
And I gotta believe there's an awful lot of interest in who wins the
Stanford/Oklahoma game, because if we were to win, then they're going to get a
shot at knocking Connecticut off.  
So as the tournament has gone on, I think there's tremendous interest in what
we're doing, and I think it's all because of the streak or because of what
we've done. So I like to think of it that way. Obviously there's enough people
that think the other way, that for whatever reason we're pushing people away
from the game or we're not helping the game grow.  
That's not my job. That's not what I get paid for, to help grow the game of
women's basketball. I get paid, and my job is to make sure that my team is the
best that it possibly can be. All the other coaches in America, it's their
responsibility to do the best that they can with the team that they have. So
there's nothing I can do about it except go about doing what I'm doing.  
The rest will take care of itself. But I don't think anybody can say, if
they're being really objective, that, hey, being this good is bad. I guess
only in America could you make comments like that. And people are making those
comments and there's nothing I can do about it.  
  
Q. Number one, the 40-point win over Florida State, the great first half
against Temple, the really wide margins in the tournament, is this an accurate
barometer of how well your team is playing or something that should be
discounted? And, secondly, when was the first time that your staff took a look
at Baylor? How long ago was that and maybe how much do you think they've
changed since then?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think that the scores in the tournament are the scores. I
don't think there's -- we don't sit there in the locker room and put a point
number on the board and say, you know, today I think we're going to win by 30
or today we're going to win by 40. The scores just happen to be the scores.  
  
Q. I guess my question was are they there because you're playing really well
right now as opposed to --  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I could say we're playing really well. The alternative
is to say we just played four teams that suck, and that's not the case. So
we're playing at a really high level right now. And defensively we're playing
really well. We're making a lot of shots.  
And you put those two things together, and we have some experience. We've been
in the tournament. We've got kids that this will be their third Final Four.
We've got kids that won a national championship last year.  
Yeah, Caroline is struggling because this is her first tournament. Kelly
Faris, this is her first time through this. But most of the other guys,
they've been through this. So we're playing with some experience, some know-
how, and the scores are the scores.  
As far as Baylor, I mean, I saw them play earlier in the season, and it's not
easy when you're bringing somebody in like Brittney who has the ability to
just change everything that you're doing.  
You almost have to build your team in a completely different way than what
you're used to doing. So it's going to take some time. And I just -- I just
think they've changed tremendously since the beginning of the year. And
they're still changing. Somebody asked me, hey, Iowa State beat them by a lot,
you beat Iowa State by a lot, so I'm the first to infer that we're going to
beat Baylor by a lot; it doesn't work that way.  
They're a team that now, on any night that they play anybody, as they proved
in the Tennessee game, are capable of winning that game, and a lot of it has
to do with how much Brittney has grown as a person, as a player.  
  
Q. Maya said the other day one of the most difficult parts of the NCAA
tournament is trying to balance the incredible focus on basketball with a
sincere effort towards her academics. Could you talk about how pleased you are
with how your team has handled that as a whole?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, it is hard. That's why it wears on kids. It doesn't wear
on you if you don't care about school. If you're just disinterested or just in
college to play basketball, it doesn't wear on you.  
But if you're a kid who takes their schoolwork seriously and you're a
conscientious kid that goes to class and puts the time in, now all of a sudden
you're on the road all the time, you're missing classes, you're under the gun,
then to get it done or when you get back or before you leave, I think it's an
incredible strain on student-athletes.  
I really admire and really appreciate how hard these kids have to work that
are in the NCAA tournament. All the teams. And I think that's a big part of
why college basketball is so special, because you've got kids trying to
balance both of those things.  
And if you tell everybody, hey, we didn't play well in the NCAA tournament,
but our kids, you know what, they managed to keep up their grade point
average, like anybody cares. It's all about winning.  
I think what's lost in all that is the incredible obligation that these kids
have and how they manage to balance it is pretty incredible. They should be
saluted for that.  
  
Q. After the 2002 season when you guys played Oklahoma, you made a comment
that they've been running on the video highlights of the NCAA tournament about
you thought Oklahoma was the next program to arrive on the national scene for
women's basketball. Having gotten to the second consecutive Final Four, what's
your thoughts on the OU program?  
COACH AURIEMMA: It's the same as -- my thoughts are the same as they were in
2002. You've got a good, young coach that came in there, tremendously excited
and motivated and willing to do it the right way, and a great administration
that supported her. And here they are.  
Ever since 2002 they've been a national player. They've been a program that
people talk about when it comes time to talk about the ten or so top programs
in the country. And I'm not surprised one bit with where they are right now
and what they're doing, and it won't surprise me if ten years from now they're
doing the exact same thing.  
It's further proof that you can grow the game. You've just got to hire the
right people, give them the resources, nurture them a little bit. Oklahoma's
got a great athletic director. They've got a great athletic department. And
they put the right people in place and they are where they are.  
If more schools decided that they wanted to do that because they had the
ability to do that, then we wouldn't be asking questions about is the game
going to grow, is it not going to grow, has it gotten better, has it not
gotten better.  
They're a perfect example of what can happen in a short period of time. And
I'm not the least bit surprised at where they are or what they're doing.  
  
Q. This is a perfect lead-in, because seems to me Baylor is the same way.
That's a program that was nothing in the national women's basketball scheme.
Came in, they've won a national championship. Going to a second Final Four.
What you said earlier this week or a few days ago about how important that
was, it was just a bottom line commitment thing, do you see Baylor as a
similar situation?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Absolutely. Absolutely. There's absolutely very little
difference in the Oklahoma situation and the Baylor situation in terms of
schools getting behind their program, hiring coaches that are committed to
winning and doing it right, and then giving them the tools that they need to
be successful.  
That's the formula for success. I think what I said might have been a little
bit misconstrued that everyone should aspire to be where Baylor and Oklahoma
is right now. That's not what I mean. If you're a school of limited resources
and limited facilities and whatever, you can't be where Baylor and Oklahoma
and Connecticut and Stanford are right now. But you certainly can be better
than where you are if you aspire to be.  
And at places like Oklahoma and Baylor, they aspire to be in the Final Four
and win national championships and compete at the highest level. And that's
why they're doing it.  
That's the model a lot of schools should be using to make their programs
better. Find the right coach, give them what they need. Nurture and grow in
your community, and you're going to wake up one day and be in the Final Four.
If you do that and after a couple of years you don't see any progress, get rid
of the coach or whoever is running your women's basketball program and start
over again.  
But to just sit there and have the status quo over and over and over again, I
don't think Oklahoma or Baylor would be where they are right now if they just
kept on doing business the way they were doing it before.  
So they're to be commended and be admired and be emulated.  
  
Q. You've been able to motivate this team even in games -- and they're
motivating themselves even in games where the opposition really just does not
match up. Is this sort of -- I don't want to say fun, but sort of an
exhilarating experience because there is so much attention on Griner and how
well she's played, and especially is that a challenge that it seems that your
players will most especially want to face?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think every player, every coach loves a challenge. I don't
know anybody that's in this field or competitive field that doesn't like
challenges. And my players are no different than anyone else.  
And what I've tried to teach them along the way is that the challenge isn't
Brittney Griner. The challenge wasn't Florida State or anyone else that we may
play in the future.  
The challenge is to play really, really well and to play at a really high
level. Now, when that's your challenge and you throw in now, okay, well,
here's the obstacle to that challenge, now obviously kids are like even more
motivated, even more alert and receptive to what you're saying coaching-wise.  
And my guess is that when that's in front of you, you have a tendency to play
better than you would otherwise. Believe me, that's what I'm counting on. I'm
counting on the fact that we're playing a really good team with a really good
coach and a unique player in the Final Four. And that in and of itself is
something that every great player would say, wow, that's the arena I want to
be in. That's why I came to Connecticut.  
  
Q. Earlier you made mention yourself that Brittney Griner is the type of
player who changes the way opposing offenses will play. And Kim Mulkey said
earlier on the phone call she noticed that quite a bit with the teams she
played, that other teams try to do different things because she's there. My
question is not so much necessarily what you guys will do differently, but how
do you resist the temptation to try to do something differently, given the
success you've had?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I think the problem that a team might have would be to go in
and revamp everything you're doing just to accommodate that one individual.
And I think what that does, then, is tells your team, listen, everything that
we've done up to this point is not good enough. Now we've got to do things
differently.  
And I think that's a bad message to send to your team. I think all along the
way, these last four or five months of practice, or in games, we've played a
certain way that includes whether we're going to play five guards, five big
guys, a team that walks it up the floor, a team that runs up and down, a team
that has a 5'8" center and a team that has a 6'8" center.  
So you hope along the way you're doing things in practice or you're working on
things that when you do have this opportunity in front of you, you can talk to
your kids about, hey, listen, remember when we did this? Well, this is how
we've got to do it now. Okay?  
You point out subtle changes, subtle things, and we do that for every game. We
did things a little bit differently for Florida State than we did for Temple.
But nothing that we hadn't done already before. So I understand what Kim is
saying. You can go look at a team out there and say this team is struggling
against us because that's not the way they normally play.  
I think a coach has to make some tough decisions there and you've got to be
careful the message that you're sending to your team.  
  
Q. You have Brittney, obviously a big factor in this, but Baylor has the No.
2 field goal percentage defense in the country, and it's something that your
program has had, obviously being No. 1, is not really talked about that much
this year is the defense. I know you take a lot of pride in the defense and
the players take a lot of pride in the defense. How different will that be to
play where it will probably be a little bit more of a defense-oriented game
this Sunday?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's what happens when you get to the Final Four. There's
not that many bad defensive teams left playing in the final weekend. The
reason you're playing in the final weekend is because you're good defensively
and you're good offensively and you're well balanced and you're well coached
and all those things.  
So we're going into this weekend knowing that the teams we're going to be
playing are really good on both ends of the floor. Yeah. Baylor is a heck of a
defensive team. 14 or 15 shots every night never make it to the rim. That's
pretty good defense, isn't it?  
So I remember when we had Carol Walters and Rebecca Lobo. We were blocking
that many shots every night. It's incredible the kind of defensive numbers you
can put up when you're doing that.  
So points are going to be at a premium this weekend, for all four teams. It's
not going to be easy to score a lot of points, and the team that does make
shots and the team that does score is probably the team that wins.  
And because we score so many points, you're right, people don't talk about our
defense that much, which is fine. You know? Because I'd rather them try to
figure out how to stop us than how to score on us.  
  
Q. I want to ask you: How much do you let your team celebrate or acknowledge
what they've accomplished? And is there ever a point where you tell your team
that, you know something, you're arguably the best team in the history of
women's basketball?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I've never said that. I've never said that they're the best
team in the history of college basketball, women's basketball. And I have to
make sure I mention women's basketball.  
Bob Huggins left me a nasty voice mail saying that I said at one time that we
were the best team in college basketball, men or women. I guess he was tired
of fighting with his team; he wants to fight with me now. So we had a big
laugh about that.  
So I always want to make sure, hey, I never said my team was the best team in
the history of college women's basketball. I still don't say that to them. And
if they say that to themselves, I have no control over that.  
I let them celebrate every day. Every day is a celebration with my team. They
celebrate how good they are, they celebrate how hard they play, they celebrate
how much they enjoy each other and playing the game the way they love playing
it. They celebrated last night. They celebrated the Temple win. They
celebrated winning the Big East championship.  
You know, I talked to them in the locker room before the Iowa State game. I
said no matter how many times you've been in this locker room, no matter how
many times you've been in the NCAA tournament or how many times you've been in
the regionals, don't ever take it for granted and make sure you appreciate
just how hard it is to get here, no matter who you are.  
We're not here sitting here looking at the streak and looking at how many
games we win and pretending that none of it matters except the next thing.
Now, it's not like that at all.  
We're celebrating everything every day. And maybe that's why we are able to
keep doing it, because we're not obsessed with what's next. I want them to
celebrate, because it's going to end. It's going to end Sunday or it's going
to end Tuesday. It's going to end.  
And for my seniors it's going to end right after Tuesday, because they're
leaving. They're not playing any more games at Connecticut. I want there to be
a lot of celebrating on a regular basis.  
  
Q. Obviously this game is Baylor against UConn, but I think a lot of the
attention is going to be focused in the paint with Brittney and Tina. How do
you look at that matchup? And has Tina ever played, faced a shotblocker like
that before?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah, when Tina was a freshman and a sophomore, she
played against Sylvia Fowles who is as good as any center who played in
college basketball in all the years that I've been coaching. And Tina really
struggled against Sylvia and Tina outplayed Sylvia and won against Sylvia.  
So Tina's been on both ends of it where Sylvia totally dominated Tina and Tina
beat Sylvia and won the game. How is this going to be? You know, it's like the
stock market. When people ask you to buy from a stock broker, past performance
is no guarantee of future success. Whatever happened in the past happened. And
just because you play great against Sylvia doesn't mean that you're going to
play great this time, but if you struggled doesn't mean you're going to
struggle.  
It's its own matchup. Brittney poses different problems than Sylvia did and
Tina poses certain issues for Brittney that no one else has that she's played
against this year.  
But the game isn't going to hinge on Brittney Griner and Tina Charles. A game
generally never does hinge on one matchup between two people, as intriguing as
it may be. Both of them could play great and their team lose. Both could play
lousy and their team win. I prefer to make it Connecticut versus Baylor and
the matchup is the matchup, and hopefully they'll both play great.  
  
Q. How do you prepare for a shotblocker like that who has controlled the
paint? And even from a team's standpoint, that's, I think, where you get a lot
of your points.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Well, again, you have two choices. You can either stop going
in there and get away from everything that you've done all year long, or keep
doing what you've been doing all year long.  
And we're going to keep doing what we've been doing all year long. And if I
didn't do that, my players would lose respect for me. We're going to play the
way we play. I'm sure they're going to play the way they play. They're going
to have to find an answer for us and we're going to have to find an answer for
them, whatever that is.  
  
Q. A lot has been made of comparing teams and everything. But don't you
think it's kind of unfair to compare this team to others that you had because
this one is not done yet, this one is one national championship, they're on
this long winning streak, but it's not done. So is it hard to -- unfair to
compare this team to some of your other teams?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah. I agree with you 100 percent on that. That's why I never
do it. But I'm pressed on it all the time, obviously.  
But when it's all said and done, whatever happens this weekend, good, bad,
whatever, down the road we'll look back and try to put this team in its proper
perspective. That time will come. It's not here yet. And whoever wants to put
this team in its proper perspective can do it at that point in time. But until
then it's not worth it. It's not worth that discussion.  
But that's rational people like you and I thinking that way.  
  
Q. I'm kind of following up on what Michelle was asking you about, but
watching the game last night, the ESPN announcers were talking about how even
when you guys were up 20, 30 points that your players were playing like you
were down 10. And do you guys -- are they coached to say, look, we're just
going to play the game, we're not really playing the opponent, we're not
playing the scoreboard, we're going to try to play a perfect game, maybe try
to box out every time, try to contest every pass, and just kind of play the
game and not really worry about everything else, and if you give complete
effort everything will work out? Is that kind of some of the philosophy?  
COACH AURIEMMA: That's the whole philosophy, actually. It never ceases to
amaze me, to be honest with you, why people are amazed at what these kids are
doing in terms of effort. I thought that's why you go to practice. I thought
you go to practice so that you can work on what you want to get better at. I
don't ever remember going to practice and saying, listen, guys, stay in your
stance, move your feet, get through screens, contest shots, but when we get up
20, don't do any of that.  
You imagine the absurdity of that? You know?  
  
Q. I mean, it's a tough thing to do, it's kind of like, well, I think it was
in a league of its own -- A League of Their Own where a guy said the heart is
what makes it great. It's like that's what -- it's hard to do that kind of
stuff.  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yes, it is. Yes, it is. And if every kid -- if every kid
playing college basketball today just put it upon themselves and said, look,
I'm going to compete as hard as I can every possession, you know, I'm not
saying you would win more. And if this makes any sense, but you lose a hell of
a lot less. It would take somebody to have to beat you. And instead teams go
out there, they half-ass it and they lose and they can't understand why they
lost.  
And the only thing I've tried to do is tell my guys, listen, just compete on
every possession, at everything. And that's the way I was brought up. I was
brought up that way, and I've tried to get my teams to do that in all the
years that I've been coaching. And if people can't get their players to do
that, then either you got the wrong players or you shouldn't be coaching.  
Because that's what we do. That's what we do. We try to get them to do that.
We're not always successful. But, man, you can't just say wow I can't believe
you guys are diving on loose balls when you're up 25.  
Well, then tell them to stop. I'll tell them to stop. Listen, you're making
everybody else look bad around the country that doesn't do that. So when we
get up 30 stop diving on loose balls. I mean, it's just -- you're absolutely
right. I hear it all the time.  
And that's another reason that I think in spite of the winning streak and all
that, you gotta admire these kids for how hard they play, for how hard they
compete, how much honor, how much respect they bring to the game. That's
something to be admired. It's not something you think is bad for the game. No.
It's bad for those kids that don't want to play like that.  
But maybe it's good that it will make them say, hey, look, Kelly Faris doesn't
look that much different to me, I can do what she does. Lorin Dixon doesn't
look that much bigger than me, I can do what she does.  
So maybe five or six kids, watching those kids play saying, hey, I want to
play like that. And all of a sudden that's a good thing.  
  
Q. When did Bob Huggins make that call to you? And has there been anybody
during the tournament who you've heard from that is just in basketball circles
that was surprising, that sort of just called you out of the blue, either to
compliment your team or again to leave angry message for you about something
you said?  
COACH AURIEMMA: He wasn't being angry, he was just being Huggins. He
threatened to bring his team up here and play us on our home court so he could
prove to us that they were better.  
  
Q. That's this year he's talking about?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yes, this is this year. Again, because people are going to
want to make us out to be something we're not. And apparently somebody did say
or it came across like I said we were the best team in college basketball.
Which is absurd.  
  
Q. Has anyone -- have you heard from anyone that you're not particularly
close with that surprised you in terms of taking an interest in your team, a
coach reaching out or anything?  
COACH AURIEMMA: Yeah, I get that and it surprises me from different walks of
life, not just in coaching. It surprises me sometimes who's paying attention.  
  
Q. Anyone stand out?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I haven't gotten anything that says -- other than -- a lot of
this stuff that I get from my friends, they accuse me of having the best job
in the world; that I don't have to coach real hard; that I got the easiest job
in America; that I should just play golf all year-round and just show up for
games.  
So they see what we do and they just, I think, marvel at the numbers and they
think, man, this guy's got the greatest situation in the world. And they're
absolutely right. I do. But I haven't gotten anything from anybody that's just
flat out come out and say, hey, what you guys are doing is lousy for the game
or any of that stuff. I don't get any of that.  
I'll tell you, one of our biggest fans is Bill Belichick. He's one of our
biggest fans. He makes sure he lets us know all the time that he thinks we're
great.  
  
Q. He'll call you up out of the blue and say how's it going?  
COACH AURIEMMA: I'll hear from him telling me you guys are unbelievable, you
continue to raise the bar, you guys are amazing.  
I think people in this that have done great things, they appreciate how hard
it is to do. They really do. They appreciate how hard it is for kids to play
this hard all the time and compete and try to get it right all the time,
without looking -- I challenge anybody to say that we're out there and we're
arrogant and we're cocky and we disrespect the game, our opponents, anything
like that.  
So to see it being done the way it's being done by these particular players is
just -- I think anybody who appreciates that kind of stuff is really taken by
it. Really taken by it.  
RICK NIXON: Thank you, Coach.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  88  
Kentucky - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined at the table by the Kentucky Wildcats' head
coach, Matthew Mitchell, and his two student athletes. Coach, your thoughts on
tonight's game?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I want to congratulate Oklahoma. What a fantastic
performance they had tonight. As a coach, I was totally impressed with how
they came out, with a lot of tenacity and fought back from an early deficit
and really got control of the game.  
We were beaten by a very, very good basketball team and a very good basketball
program that we have tremendous respect for, and we wish them well as they
head to San Antonio.  
  
Q. Victoria, did you feel like you guys maybe didn't have quite as much
energy tonight as you had in the first game?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think there was a definitely change from how we had played
in previous game. We know we didn't play our best, but I thought we came out
in the beginning and definitely gave our effort and energy. And just at the
end we just weren't ourselves, and I think we kind of got into a better
offense, missing shots, let it get to us and we just weren't the same
defensive team that we usually have been.  
  
Q. Amber, when Oklahoma switched to a zone, how did that affect what you all
were doing?  
AMBER SMITH: We just got real passive, and we didn't attack the gaps, so we
hurt ourselves in the zone.  
  
Q. Victoria, Nebraska got down early obviously and they didn't let that
necessarily -- or at least you guys got on Nebraska early and were able to
hold them down, but did Oklahoma's experience being in this situation, do you
think that played a factor in the game?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Um, I'm not sure. I mean, I don't know what they were
thinking, but we weren't worried about what they were going to do. The whole
time we were thinking about what we were going to do as a team. Obviously they
are a good team and they've been here before, so that might have been a factor
for them, but that wasn't our mentality to think about their experience.  
  
Q. Amber, could you discuss their guards? They were maybe quicker than some
guards that you guys have faced before, and they seemed to get some points
driving to the basket the way you guys usually do.  
AMBER SMITH: Yeah, I mean, but we've played guards that quick, so I mean, it
was just we weren't focused in fundamentally on defense. We didn't get to the
right position in defense, so that was our fault. We just turned the ball over
too much.  
  
Q. Could you talk about just the season and what it's meant and kind of will
you remember this feeling for next season?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: It's definitely been a great, amazing season that we've had,
the work that we've put in since last season in the summer and the preseason,
and the mentality that Coach has gotten us into to represent Kentucky as a
school and as a state, people have definitely come out to support us more.
People are looking at us like we are -- that's Kentucky, okay, that's a
defensive team. They definitely recognize us more.  
All I can say is that it definitely hurts that we lost, but we're definitely
going to cherish this moment, this season, this team because we started
something new, and the people coming next year are definitely going to have a
lot to fill because especially with the two that we're losing, Amani and Lyd,
what they've been through and all the injuries that they've been through,
they've battled a lot, and they've definitely helped us out this year with
their leadership and their hustle and everything the whole entire season. I'm
proud of them and I'm proud of my teammates where we've gone so far and just
cherish this moment forever.  
  
Q. Amber, you guys got off to such a fast start and it looked like Oklahoma
couldn't hit anything, and then all of a sudden it just seemed to switch as
quickly. Were you guys shocked by how quickly Oklahoma got back into the
game?  
AMBER SMITH: We weren't shocked. I mean, we know we are a good team and we
knew they were going to make their run and we just had to make a run back and
we didn't do that. We stopped playing how we were defensively. We came out of
the gate great playing defensively and then we stopped doing that and that's
how they got their lead, so I wasn't shocked.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season. We'll take questions
now for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, from your perspective, you guys got off to such a great start;
what happened?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I thought that Oklahoma just really absorbed that
initial blow with, you know, an attitude of coming back swinging. When you
have veteran guards that are as good as those kids are, they just kept going.
We just missed a few rotations there in transition where they were able to get
it deep and kick it back out and made some shots. I just thought they kept
their composure.  
And then when they went to the zone, we did a really poor job there of
attacking that. It kind of got us out of attack mentality. So there's 100
things happening in the game and we'll go back and watch the film and see what
we could have done better, but that's my initial impression, that they were
able to keep their composure.  
  
Q. Against that zone, just how effective were Robinson and Stevenson out in
front of that with their hands?  
COACH MITCHELL: It was good. They were very effective. I didn't think that the
offense -- we had 45 percent shooting at halftime and 39 points, and we had
nine offensive boards and made a couple threes and making our free throws, so
I thought that they were very aggressive at the top, and so they definitely
made some plays up there, but I was more concerned about our defense at
halftime.  
  
Q. I know you said all season you don't want to talk about what you've
accomplished this season until the season is over. Now that it is over, can
you take some solace in the fact that you've really done a lot of things that
Kentucky has never done before as a program?  
COACH MITCHELL: I don't think there's any question that when we reflect back
on this season, everyone involved will know that this was a special basketball
team. You know, it's not even about not going to the Final Four tonight; it's
about being in that locker room with a bunch of kids that just absolutely
pushed it to the limit.  
I told them back there that I wouldn't trade places with Coach Coale at all. I
congratulate Oklahoma. I'm real, real proud of Kentucky.  
  
Q. Going forward, do you feel like you need to get a little longer, keep the
athleticism but get a little longer on your roster?  
COACH MITCHELL: Oh, sure, absolutely. You know, where we were at this stage,
we just needed to get the right kind of people in the program, and that's from
staff members to players to support staff. You need the right kind of people,
the people that are dedicated to honesty, hard work, discipline, things that
we talk about. And so now as you move forward, you certainly look for tall,
long, athletic people that like honesty, hard work and discipline, and so
there's no question that we are addressing that right now in recruiting. We
would like to keep this style of play if we possibly can. I think it's a fun
way to play, and I think it's exciting.  
And I think there's some players out there that will be the right kind of
people, and that's what we need to be looking for. So I'm confident that we're
doing that. We get a lot of good response from people. I think people are
excited about the direction. So we will be working hard to get that done.  
  
Q. Could you discuss their quickness a little bit? She was talking about
their guards in the top of the zone, but they were scoring points off
turnovers. They were doing a lot of things that you guys do to other teams.
Talk about what they were able to do.  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, I just thought that Stevenson probably played -- I
haven't seen her play that well, and that's a compliment to her to be able to
sense the moment and raise her level. She was really quick. And Robinson is a
terrific guard, and so I just thought those two kids really controlled the
game.  
They are outstanding, veteran guards that just weren't going to be denied
tonight. I just thought that we were -- we would have had to really, really be
in tune tonight with what we needed to do and for whatever reason -- one
reason is because Oklahoma is awfully good. Another is we just weren't as
sharp as we'd been all year. We've been sharp a bunch of times. You know,
we've been sharp a bunch of times, and I just leave here sad for the kids
tonight, but what a tremendous effort by a group of people to come together
and become their best.  
  
Q. I noticed you huddled the kids on the floor before you left. Could you
talk about just what you said or what you told them there?  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah. I really feel like this team was committed, and as a
coach that's what you just pray you can get. We got a lot of commitment from
those folks wearing blue up there in the stands, and they've been with us all
the way through an undefeated season at home, through an incredible March
through the SEC tournament and the NCAA Tournament, and they've been there for
us. And I just wanted the players to recognize that's part of why it's so
special to be here and why we're so fortunate that Dr. Todd and Mr. Barnhart
have been good enough to let us all be here and put on that jersey.  
So I wanted them to just walk out with their head held high. They've had a
great, great run, and then acknowledge those good people that spent money and
effort to come out here and support them. So that's what we talked about.  
  
Q. Kind of a two-parter. The first one is do you think that next season
you'll be picked to finish 11th in the SEC, and with everything you have
coming back, you have to be looking at next season already and kind of feeling
good.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, the first part, you just never know what people are
going to do, so I don't have any idea. I would suspect that we probably won't
be picked.  
But here's the trick now. This is an important thing, that we do not take this
team for granted. And one thing that I was able to -- that I've been able to
learn that's been very valuable is that tradition is important and tradition
is great, but really the focus needs to be every year is a new year. Every
year is a new team. We're losing two seniors, I'm telling you now, that we're
going to try to replace with a sophomore that needs to get better and we're
going to try to replace with some freshmen. You can't take it for granted that
it's just going to keep rolling along.  
So the challenge for the next team is they won't fly under the radar. They'll
never have that again unless there's some type of dip, you know, and people
aren't expecting it from year to year. But the hope is and the plan is that
this won't happen again.  
So now they've got to approach it with just white hot intensity as we ramp up
to get ready for the next one. So I will never, ever go into next season
taking what happened this season and just thinking it's going to happen.
That's going to take -- this team worked so hard day after day after day.
People thought they were going to be a bad team; they didn't listen. People
thought we wouldn't get to the SEC tournament championship game. No one
probably thought we'd get to the Sweet 16. Certainly no one thought we were
going to get to the Elite 8.  
So this team has accomplished a lot, and so for next season, whatever good we
can take, whatever momentum builds, whatever standard has been set, I think
that's how you use this season getting ready for the next, because these kids
aren't robots; they're human beings. They have to go out and go through it and
do all the work.  
We will go in with tremendous optimism but knowing that we have to stay true
to what our principles are.  
  
Q. Victoria played the way that Victoria always plays, but you kind of
needed another person to step up, and that's happened almost every game this
season. What did you feel like happened with the other scorers this time?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, it just -- Sunday night you go 8 for 16 from the three-
point line. You get down to this point and teams are really good and they have
ability. You just don't have an opportunity to work through a bad night. It's
-- I thought we were trying. I thought that -- there's so much on the line.
People react differently in this setting. I thought A'dia got a little
frustrated, and that's because she cares. That's because she wanted to
continue to play with this team, so you don't fault her for that. You try to
learn from that and move forward. We just missed some shots that we've been
making.  
I don't think it was a product of us not trying. I thought the kids were
playing hard. We wish we'd played better, but we clearly needed somebody to
step up and be that complement to Victoria. She had a whale of a game.  
  
Q. You touched on them briefly, but can you talk about what Amani and Lydia
have meant as seniors to this team?  
COACH MITCHELL: I appreciate you asking that, because those two players have
overcome so many points in their career here at Kentucky where they wouldn't
be here tonight, so that's a wonderful thing for them. We wouldn't be here
tonight without those two.  
What we as the coaches at Kentucky are trying to do, we're trying to be
honestly competitive and win games, but we believe that our mission is to help
these kids become better people and get them prepared as they leave, and I'm
really, really proud of Amani and Lydia because it hasn't always been hard --
it hasn't always been easy for them, and they've made some changes just as
people. So I'm really, really excited for them in their future because they
are -- they have worked themselves in a position to be successful people, and
they use basketball as a tool to get them there.  
So I'm really, really grateful to those two. You couldn't write enough nice
things about those two kids and how proud of them I am. They will always be a
part of this program.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments. Good luck on next
season and congratulations on a great year.  
COACH MITCHELL: I want to thank everybody here in Kansas City. We were treated
extremely well, and thanks to everyone who helped us out here.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  88  
Kentucky - 68

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by victorious Oklahoma, Coach Sherri Coale and
the student athletes. Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
COACH COALE: First of all, I would like to congratulate Kentucky for being in
the Elite 8 and performing the way they did. Early on their pressure defense
gave us all kinds of trouble, and later when we counter-punched, I thought
their youth and inexperience showed a little bit. But the job Matthew has done
with that team in the short amount of time with that program, getting to the
Elite 8, they'll be back, I couldn't be more impressed. He and his staff, the
way they handled themselves and the way the kids handled themselves tonight,
they were just a terrific opponent and really just appreciate the way they
competed.  
My kids, they just win. They just win. Grit, intestinal fortitude, never
doubt. They just believe, and we talk about the eyes and the look you need to
have in your eyes when you compete for championships. Even when we were dismal
in the first five minutes, the look in the huddle was one of belief. They felt
like they belonged here and believed in their ability to get the job done, and
what a tremendous legacy already, and it's not over yet, but for these three
seniors to guide their teams to back-to-back Final Fours. That puts us in a
different league. That's a different deal. Those three kids will forever be
known as the first to do that, and I love that for them because they're
special.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, it seemed tonight the game was almost like a mirror of your
season. There was some early adversity you fought through and then you blew
through at the end. What do you think it is about this team that's allowed you
guys to do that?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: I think just throughout the season we had to fight, and
after every loss that we had, we learned from it, and it was different every
time. You know, all the tough games that we've won, it just showed, and it
played a big prior in tonight's game when we were down early.  
Like Coach said, we knew the game wasn't over. There was a lot of time on that
clock. We may have had wowed or whatever, I don't know what was wrong with us
in that first four minutes, but we turned it around and we played Oklahoma
basketball.  
  
Q. Danielle, I thought when you guys went to zone, that changed things up a
little bit. Talk about that and how that changed the tone for you all.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We knew coming in that we were going to have to use our
zone a little bit. A lot of teams hadn't seen zone a lot this year, so we knew
we could use that to our advantage, and I think that's the best zone we've
played all season. So definitely happy that it worked.  
  
Q. Amanda, it seemed to me like there was just a look on your face after
that early start that was like, you probably wouldn't want to say what you
were thinking inside. You just looked furious, and it looked like there was
this huge burst of energy. You pulled down a couple of rebounds. Can you talk
about what was going through your mind and how you think maybe that was sort
of the jump start for you guys?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: You know, when we first started and after I got that first
turnover, I was like, Oh, my goodness, this is one of those kind of games.
Then we got down maybe 10 or 12, and I was like, We're not about to have this.
So the ball came off, I got a little energy, got a rebound and came down, got
a little jump shot, just kind of released that pressure a little bit. Once we
got those shots, they really kind of backed up for that little span or
interval. Everybody kind of fed off that, and we took that lead and didn't
give it back.  
  
Q. For Amanda and Danielle, everybody says goals never change, always keep
your eye on the prize, all that stuff. But back in November when Whitney went
down and you didn't know what was going to happen, how much was this a
legitimate dream that you could still do this?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: We never took our eyes off the prize no matter what happened,
who left, who got injured. We knew we could still fight. We just knew we had
to double everything we did on the court, and everybody took responsibility
for that, and it showed today.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Like she talked about, we never took our brains and our
minds off of going back to the Final Four. We felt that if we did, we would be
settling. We'd make an excuse for something that's really uncontrollable.  
You know, Whitney is not gone, she's still a captain. She's still at practice
every day. She's just not playing. So we knew that we still had a special
leader on our team, and she's definitely helped us out throughout the whole
season.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, just about a week after you played UConn, you were at K State,
had a really tough start, I think you were down by 21 with maybe 16 minutes
left in that game and came back. I don't want to say that was any kind of
turning point, but that could have been a game where you guys might have
easily lost, just the resilience in this game and how that reflects what this
team has been like this season?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Like I said, this team just never gives up. We had a rough
start, and it just lasted way longer than four minutes. Halftime we were still
-- before halftime we got some baskets and got stops, but we were still
clawing, and at halftime we just looked at each other and said, Hey, either
we're going to fight or this season is just going to rest up on this. So we
just turned it around and decided that we didn't want to be what everyone said
that we were going to be. We wanted to be more, and that's what we did. We
changed it around.  
  
Q. Danielle, what was said in the huddle? You guys were down 10 points. You
have a time-out. You were settling for jump shots up to that point. What was
said about driving to the basket?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We just knew that we just needed to settle down. We were
sped up a little bit, but we've been there before. So like A.T. talked about,
we just needed to calm down, chill out a little bit, and that's exactly what
we did.  
THE MODERATOR: The NCAA has announced that Oklahoma Stanford will play Game 1
at 6:00 p.m. Central Time on Sunday and Baylor-UConn is at 8:30.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about it seemed like Carlee really gave you guys a
lift when she came in. Talk about sometimes we just think of her as a shooter,
but it seemed like she did a whole lot else this evening.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah, Carlee is a real versatile player, especially on the
defensive end. She's long. She rebounded for us. Before she checked in, I
mean, in the first half, I asked her, Are you ready? And she said, Yep, and I
knew from then on that she was going to be great tonight.  
  
Q. Amanda, after the game Sherri said that on that first time-out when you
guys were really struggling, she said something like y'all ready to just get
back on the bus, and you sort of said, no, Coach -- you sort of settled her
down to some degree. She didn't say that, but that was my impression. Is that
correct, and were you startled at what she said?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I wasn't startled. You know, when she says those kind of
things, it's not really -- it's kind of like a blow to the chest, like we're
not doing what we're supposed to. So I kind of told her, Just tell us what we
need to do and we got it. She listened to me and she told us what we needed to
do, and from that point on we made our run.  
We had to play defense and we had to make baskets, you know, and from then on
we went into that zone. Our two guards up top, they got touches, they got
steals and we got back-to-back fast breaks. It was just amazing. They play
awesome the whole game, and Kentucky was really -- they played really well,
but we fought back, and we played together, and it paid off.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season and a great win
tonight. Good luck in San Antonio.  
  
Q. Sherri, I hate to give you absolutely no time to think about this, but
Stanford coming up next, can you talk a little bit about -- you said in the
Big 12 tournament, you said one of the strengths of this team is you can be a
different type of team depending on your opponent, you have that versatility.
Obviously, Stanford is a way, way different team than Kentucky. Can you talk
about that match-up?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I think Stanford's offense is obviously an offense that is
rhythmic, and you've got to break the rhythm. You can't let them get the ball
where they want to get the ball. They're incredibly different than Kentucky,
night and day. We do that in the Big 12. We play Texas A & M and then we go
and play Iowa State. So we're accustomed to that.  
I can talk for a long time about Stanford because I've seen them play several
and I know what they do and I know Tara and I know how she teaches them, but
with all due respect, I'd just like to talk about us for a while.  
  
Q. Talk about Nyeshia, what an NCAA Tournament she's having.  
COACH COALE: She was fantastic. I think she finally figured out that she's
fast with the ball in her hand. You know, you tell her all the time and it
sounds so trite, but she is a three-point shooter and she's a fantastic three-
point shooter, but she has a great first step. And she got to the rim the
first time, and you could just see the light in her eyes that she'd figured it
out and she continued to attack the rim and that was really the difference.
That's when we began to blow it open.  
  
Q. You briefly touched on the legacy of these seniors. Can you expand a
little bit more?  
COACH COALE: Yeah. I just -- I think it's special when kids can lead a program
to back-to-back Final Fours, and for each of these three kids, we talked about
it along the way throughout this tournament, their personal growth
individually as people, as basketball players and then their collective growth
as leaders of a basketball team has just been a phenomenal thing to witness.
This could not have happened to three more deserving kids than the three we
have here. They're just so humble and they're so together and so fun to coach
and it's been a very rewarding year that's not over yet.  
  
Q. I think it was with those three you had in mind when you said, This puts
us in a different league. But expand on that a little bit, too, back-to-back
Final Fours and what it means.  
COACH COALE: Well, I think if you look over the last decade, there are folks
who are always there. Connecticut is always there. Tennessee is almost always
there. And then you have those other two spots, and Stanford is there quite a
bit, and then you have a new kid.  
You look back in 2002 and it was Tennessee and Connecticut and Duke, who had
been making the push, and then we were the new kid. And then last year you had
Stanford and Connecticut and Louisville was the new kid, and we got back -- so
back-to-back years, I can't say that it puts us in a Tennessee and Connecticut
league because we haven't won it yet. But you can't win it if you don't keep
going. I just think it separates us a little bit, and a very special moment
for our program.  
  
Q. Weird game, there's one lead change. They got ahead, you caught up and
took the lead and they never caught back up. Could you see that once you got
ahead the momentum had shifted and you were pretty comfortable at that point
with the result?  
COACH COALE: I felt like the momentum had definitely shifted, but I don't know
that I was comfortable until somewhere around the eight-minute mark, and even
then Danielle gets her foul until we made that little run.  
But they were young, and you could sort of see the indecision coming in when
we changed to the zone early on and turned them into passers instead of
drivers. I felt like if we could just continue to score that we were going to
be in great shape. But I don't know that I got comfortable for a long time.  
  
Q. With two teams from the Big 12 in the Final Four, what's it say about the
Big 12 conference?  
COACH COALE: What we've been saying all year; it prepares you. It prepares you
for postseason play. I think it speaks volumes about the Big 12. Folks are
starting to catch on, and they're talking about it being the toughest
conference in the country, obviously the most well-attended conference in the
country, and for us and Baylor to both be playing there, I think the proof is
in the pudding.  
  
Q. You're going back to San Antonio where you played Connecticut for the
National Championship. Talk a little bit about that.  
COACH COALE: A little bit surreal, actually. For it to be in the same city,
for it to be this team, you know, that group from 2002 -- the first time you
go to the Final Four, it's an amazing, amazing moment, an amazing, amazing
experience, and then the next time you're supposed to. From then on out,
you're supposed to.  
That 2002 team had this special spunk about them. I don't think at the start
of the year anybody thought we'd be a Final Four team. I thought we were
pretty good, but I don't know that anybody thought we could break in and go to
the Final Four. Not only did we go there, then we competed in the championship
game.  
That group of kids just were a remarkable group of young women, who they've
gone on to become and what they've gone on to do. All those kids have been
texting this week while we're here and sent flowers to my room and texting
each other and getting everybody together and telling our kids we'll be
waiting on the River Walk, we'll hold a boat for you, come see us.  
As a coach, God, it doesn't get any better than that. It just doesn't get any
better than that.  
  
Q. I forgot to ask the players this, but what was that silly basket with the
eggs and stuff?  
COACH COALE: It's not a basket, it's a trophy. I know it turned out to look a
little like a birthday cake, but it's not, it's a trophy. Today was a long
day. Playing a late game is tough, and you don't want to take the kids out and
about. They just played an overtime game 48 hours ago. But you also don't want
them sleeping all day. So we just found a way to occupy their time and bought
a whole bunch of stuff and just junk and said, Make a trophy. That trophy
we're going to -- and our deal has been go to Kansas City and get a trophy,
and we didn't do it in the Big 12 tournament.  
That's one of the reasons -- everybody asked us after the selection show when
I said, This is perfect, everybody thought I was talking about my bracket. No,
I'm talking about we get to go back to Kansas City and get the trophy. It had
been our theme and it didn't work out and, okay, we still get to go. I told
our guys you're going to get the trophy, but then we've got to put that out in
the legacy court and do all that stuff with it at the Lloyd Noble Center.  
These seniors need something really special, something that stays in our
locker room that says they created a legacy all their own, so let's build our
own deal, and they did, and every piece of it means something.  
One of the reasons these kids have been so fun to coach, you can throw
anything out there and they'll embrace it and they'll be all about it. They
just dive in head first. We had to break them away from it. It's time to go to
shoot around, quit building the trophy, and they just had to finish it and get
it exactly right and then they carried this stinking thing around with them
everywhere. I mean, they're so proud of it. They just embrace opportunities. I
think that's one of the reasons they play so well when the game is on the
line.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, again, congratulations on a big win. Best of luck in the
Final Four.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the University of Kentucky Wildcats, Coach
Matthew Mitchell and his student athletes. Coach, your thoughts about last
night?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, last night was an awfully good game for us. I thought
Nebraska was an outstanding basketball team. Going into the game, and I
thought nothing less of them after the game, just thought they were terrific
and knew we would have to play extremely well to beat them. And it just makes
me real happy for these players that they were able to play as well as they
played last night when the -- you know, with the magnitude of the game.  
So it was just a terrific performance by our players. They've worked so hard
this year all year long to get themselves in this position, and I'm just
awfully fortunate to be coaching them.  
  
Q. For Victoria, obviously you guys weren't picked to finish very high even
in your own league this season. But when did you begin to get a sense that
this was a team that could really do some damage?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think really like towards the middle of the beginning of
the season. It was preseason before the SEC Conference and we were playing
really well together. Our defense was really getting after it and as a team
you could see the collective energy that we had and everybody wanted to be out
there playing basketball, and it just went on from there.  
  
Q. I guess Amani, can you talk about being the senior, just how you've seen
this team develop and what it means to you to be able to go to an Elite 8 as a
senior at Kentucky?  
AMANI FRANKLIN: It means so much. My first three years here, we went to three
straight WNITs. We knew coming into the season that everybody was dedicated to
come into the gym and put the work in needed to be where we're at in this
position right now. So it means so much to us right now.  
  
Q. Maybe Keyla, you can answer this, or Amber, if you want to answer, too,
just talk about the fact that you guys played such strong defense. I mean, the
pressure that you put on Nebraska, they talked about that was something they
really didn't experience at all this year, and if both of you could maybe talk
about that and how that's been such a big part of what you've seen.  
KEYLA SNOWDEN: Right. We worked really hard this whole season already since
that's a main part in our practice and our defense. So I think that's helped
us a great deal this whole trip to the NCAA Tournament, and I think it will
continue to be a success for us in the future.  
AMBER SMITH: We knew Nebraska hadn't faced really any pressure, and so we knew
that was going to be effective in the game. I mean, that's our game plan is to
play hard defensively, get after people with intent. It's been working for us
this for, so just going to stay with it and work hard on it.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if the defense has progressively gotten better, like if you
guys, maybe the two of you again could talk a little bit further about that,
if you thought you were really good at one point, it just keeps getting better
and better. Do you feel that way sometimes?  
KEYLA SNOWDEN: I think as we continue to play together and we just continue to
practice more aggressively in practice, that it's continued to get better.  
AMBER SMITH: Yeah, I agree. I mean, we just worked so hard, and so I think
it'll never fail us as long as we work hard, and I think it has got better and
I think it will get better.  
  
Q. Victoria, have you guys played a perfect defensive game yet? Or do you
think that you guys could still potentially get better on defense?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I don't think we have played a perfectly complete defensive
game. I know we have our moments where everybody is on one tilt and everybody
is moving and rotating on defense. But every now and then we just have a
couple times where we'll slip up and get penetration or just different little
things. But we definitely have a lot more room to grow and just things to get
better at.  
  
Q. For Amber or Keyla, obviously the pressure has been really successful,
especially last night. But talk about the challenge of playing up against
Danielle Robinson, one of the quickest and best point guards in the country.  
AMBER SMITH: I look at it as an opportunity, and I mean, we're just going to
play her like we have been playing everybody else, and we're going to pressure
her. We're going to pressure the whole team. I mean, it's a great opportunity,
and we're going to take advantage of it.  
  
Q. Victoria, can you talk about the emotions and feelings about being one
step away from being into the Final Four?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think we're all on an emotional high right now. Everybody
is really excited. Just ready to continue what we're doing, and we know that
we're not done yet. I know we just left the Sweet 16 going into the Elite 8,
and Coach is just saying, okay, enjoy the win, but we have another win to get
to and we've got more to come. So don't settle for anything.  
  
Q. Victoria, we're talking a lot about your defense that people have talked
about all season with you, but you guys shot I think 50 percent last night and
had a very good offensive performance, too. Can you talk about why -- it
seemed like you got shots you wanted all night and you hit them. What do you
think worked so well for your offense last night?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think we were really patient in our offense. We just used
what we had to our abilities with driving to the basket and just kicking to
the shooters. I think that was just one thing that got us real -- especially
defense got us points but also we were just real patient and not rushing
things on offense and letting it come to us.  
  
Q. Just curious with the short turnaround obviously, what you know about
Oklahoma and what your game plan is as you head into that game, another Big 12
team, and what you've learned about them in the last few hours.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Well, we don't know much right now. That's why we're coming
to practice today and getting prepared. You know, I know Coach had laid out a
good game plan for us, and we're just going to just stick with whatever he has
to throw out for us and play our game like we've been playing all season.  
A'DIA MATHIES: I think we're just going to continue to play Kentucky
basketball, continue to play defense, pressure, and hopefully like last game
we can knock down shots and make it a good game because Oklahoma is a good
team, so I think it's going to be a good game.  
  
Q. For Keyla and A'dia, your three-point shooting, I think you're hitting 45
percent in the NCAA tournament so far as a team. What light has come on, or is
it just that they're focusing so much on Vic inside that maybe it's opened up
some stuff for you guys?  
KEYLA SNOWDEN: Our point guards and people on the wings, they've been able to
get us the ball and find us when we're open. And also Vic, when they double-
team on her, it allows us to get open shots. Just being in the tournament
atmosphere I think it's given our team just another motivation to knock down
open shots and stuff.  
A'DIA MATHIES: Yes, a lot of times we were fortunate to get wide open,
especially on deep penetration and things like that, we was able to get open
and knock down some shots, and I think that's really helping our team out
right now.  
  
Q. A'dia, sometimes it still seems like when you're open for threes, you
hesitate just slightly before you shoot it almost every time. Is that because
you want to drive it inside or -- what are they telling you about three-point
shooting? Are they telling you to take those shots?  
A'DIA MATHIES: Yeah, they say take it if I'm open but also be aggressive and
attack the basket, so I try and do both. Sometimes I'm a little hesitating,
but if they leave me open, I will take it.  
  
Q. A'dia, I think if I read this right, your dad had told you a lot about
the history of Kentucky basketball and what basketball has meant to that
state. But obviously women hadn't got as much attention, and that was one
thing you wanted to come to Kentucky to change that culture. Can you talk
about what it means in your first year to go someplace that Kentucky has never
gone before in women's basketball?  
A'DIA MATHIES: It means a whole lot, especially to be able to do with these
girls because we love each other a whole lot. Just changing the program around
and head it in the right direction and making Kentucky basketball more than
just the men's, making it the women's, too. So it means a lot to me.  
  
Q. For Amber and Amani, how much I guess public response have you gotten in
the last few days? I mean, Tweeting and Facebook, how many texts have you
gotten? Kind of talk about the craziness surrounding all this.  
AMBER SMITH: Okay. When I checked my Facebook last night, I had like 90
notifications. So many people just congratulating me. We're just happy that we
have so much support from back home or whatnot, so it's just been crazy the
last few weeks or so.  
AMANI FRANKLIN: Yeah, it's been awesome. Checked Facebook and Twitter, and
everybody is just showing us a lot of support from back home. It's just great
to hear people who usually don't watch us are now watching us since the guys
are out. (Laughter).  
I mean, everybody is kind of watching us, so I mean, that's great for Kentucky
women's basketball. But Keyla, she had 99 messages after the game, I had about
50, so I came in second place.  
AMBER SMITH: I had 14.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I had seven.  
A'DIA MATHIES: I was somewhere between 30 -- I was in the 30s.  
  
Q. Amani, Coach was saying last night about how you guys had to commit to
this really intense conditioning to be able to play the way you were, and last
night at the end of the game you guys were still playing as hard as you were
at the beginning. Can you just talk about that mindset to be in that good of
condition to be able to play the style that you have?  
AMANI FRANKLIN: Oh, yeah, definitely. I want to thank Coach Tracy, giving her
a shout-out. She just had us committed during the off-season to come in and
work hard. Those 20 and 20s that we ran really paid off and suicides and the
list goes on. We just committed, especially, like you said, to play this type
of defensive pressure that we have, we really have to be committed to being in
great shape, and that's just helped us along the way.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. We'll let you go back to your
locker room. We'll take the first question for Coach.  
  
Q. Matt, what about the development of Victoria, and the fact that she
played high school ball in Tennessee that's so competitive, do you think that
helped her be prepared for college, and then how she's advanced since she's
been in your program.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I think Victoria played in a very good high school
program, and she played in a very good -- with a very good club in the summer
that competed at the highest level nationally. So I think she was very
familiar with basketball at as high as the level can get in the summer and in
high school, and I think her parents really did a great job of giving her
opportunities to compete.  
You know, she was a national -- she was an All-American in high school in
track, and track is a very competitive sport. You have to get yourself
mentally prepared to run a race or compete in an event. So she showed up
really equipped to compete at this level.  
And while her game was not by any means complete when she got to us, she was
able right away to get in defensively and function at a high level, and she
just has so much desire on the defensive end of the floor to make plays.  
She did arrive probably equipped better than most freshmen to compete at this
level.  
  
Q. The players kind of touched on it a little bit, but obviously as
mentioned with the men being out, is this an opportunity for you guys to kind
of gain a little bit more spotlight as far as people who may have not either
gone to a game or really seen a lot of the women play? Is this an opportunity
maybe to get a little bit of light shown on your program and to have some new
people show some interest?  
COACH MITCHELL: I guess it is. We're not thinking about that a whole lot. But
certainly there's a lot of passion for Kentucky sports for all of our teams,
and everybody knows how passionate people are about our men's program. But
we've had tremendous support over the years, and this year was really special
for us.  
Anybody that is able to watch these players play I think is given an
opportunity to see something special, and so I'm really happy if we have an
opportunity to show this team to the country, and I'm really happy for these
players if they get any recognition from this because they have absolutely
worked themselves into a position to be special, and I'm awfully proud of
them.  
  
Q. I kind of asked the players about the frenzy in the last couple weeks of
just playing on national TV and they were comparing numbers. How many friend
requests do you have? Have you even had a chance to check it and maybe just
your text messages and that kind of thing?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I'll tell you where I am on that. I had to ask Vic what
a notification is. I have a Facebook page, but I haven't been on it in a
while. I certainly haven't checked it here.  
You know, I have my phone. I have a lot of texts. It's hard to get through all
those, so I haven't read any papers or anything. We're just so busy with the
opponent. Nebraska had plenty to keep us busy there, and Oklahoma is really
tough. So I'm not locked in on that part of it right now.  
  
Q. Given your impressions of Oklahoma, I'm sure you know a little bit more
than your players do at this point.  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah. Oklahoma is a team that, first of all, I have admired
for a long, long time, that program. Coach Coale is right there at the top of
coaches in this profession that I really, really respect. And I don't know her
well, but I have watched her teams over the years, and especially as an
assistant coach, just watched the way they conducted themselves, the way that
they play for each other, and it's real evident to me that it means something
to those kids to play for Oklahoma.  
And that's what I always said when I became a head coach; I wanted our players
to understand how special it is to play at Kentucky and to have that kind of
passion and pull for each other.  
So we approach this game with an unbelievable respect for our opponent, just
probably can't say enough good things about their program. Now, this
particular team I have watched some throughout the season on and off when I
have a little downtime and watching other teams play. They're one of the teams
I like to watch just because of what I just mentioned, my respect for Coach
Coale.  
And I think they are as equipped to handle what we do as anybody that we've
played up to this point, and what I mean by that, they are a team that
actually executes the backdoor pass, and they can make plays -- a lot of
people can come into a game and say, okay, Kentucky is going to pressure,
we'll put this backdoor play in, and they can't do it all game long.  
So what I'm real concerned about is Oklahoma actually is equipped to do that.
They've done that. Whenever I watch them, they're going to have some backdoor
plays every single game, so that tells you they have worked on this, and it's
part of what they do.  
So that's a huge concern for me with Oklahoma, just their ability to execute
in the half court. So it's going to be a mental game for us now. We're going
to have to commit more than ever to our defensive fundamentals to be able to
stay in a stance and guard the kids on the wings and some of their isolation
plays. It's going to be really, really tough, and they are an unbelievable
opponent to be getting ready for right now.  
  
Q. Oklahoma mentioned that you guys remind them a little bit of A & M, Texas
A & M, as far as the pressure and stuff like that. When you look at them on
tape or you see them, is there any team or opponent you face that comes to
mind?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, that's one of the questions I always ask the coach
that's scouting the game, who do they remind you of, and they have pieces of a
lot of teams in our league. They're a little unique. You know, Robinson sort
of reminds me of a little taller version of our point guard, Amber Smith. I
think this is going to be a terrific match-up.  
One thing that we try to do is push it in transition, and I think that our
point guard, Amber, does a really good job of getting the defense to shift in
transition, what we call slashing the floor, slicing the floor, and I think
Robinson does a great job of that. She's really, really tough.  
Obviously they have some size that we don't have. That's going to be tough for
us. But they're just a really good team, play hard, play for each other.
That's why I respect them so much. They're not exactly like really anybody in
our league. They just have pieces of a lot of things, and they're awfully,
awfully good.  
  
Q. You're mentioning that Oklahoma is well equipped for your defense. Well,
if neither team can, as they say, impose their will on the other, it sounds
like it could be a stalemate in that situation, where does this game get
won?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, no, I think that for us what we still have to try to do,
what we're going to do, so we need to try to impose our will, and Oklahoma
needs to do the same.  
I think it'll be won for us on the defensive end, and we will have to do a
good job. I think rebounding is at a premium right now. I think when teams get
real even, like last night with Nebraska, I thought we did a little bit better
job of 50/50 balls and hustling just a little bit more, and that's not being
disrespectful to Nebraska. I just think that's where the games come down to,
because you start looking -- it's amazing. You get to this round and you start
looking at the stats and they start becoming pretty similar and that's because
the teams are good at this point in time.  
So I think it'll be about the intangibles here on this game. Robinson plays a
bunch of minutes. Amber plays a bunch of minutes. Vic plays a bunch of
minutes. Their kids -- we're playing about the same number of kids is what I'm
trying to say. I think it's going to be a lot about effort and who can execute
and who could knock down a shot or two. That will be probably how it comes and
shakes out there.  
  
Q. Could you discuss the progression of your defense over the course of the
season, and then kind of the same question I asked the players, have you seen
a perfect defensive game, and what can they still do to get better?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we play in such a tough league and such great
competition and we've played such great competition in this tournament, that's
awful hard to do to play a perfect game. I think that we have -- that we are
closing in on near perfect effort, you know, and that's really the goal is
perfect effort. It's difficult to have perfect execution. It's just impossible
because teams are so good.  
But the thing that -- the reason we have progressed and we're in the position
we are now is because they never grew weary of the fundamentals, and that's
why they have my respect and my admiration is that we put them through I'm
talking about late, late in the season, we're still doing 30 minutes of
defensive fundamental footwork every day, and it's the same drills every day.  
It would be very easy for them to complain and to moan and groan or to just
kind of get through a drill, and there's just so few times I ever had to stop
and say, Look, this is not the kind of effort we're looking for. I'm talking
about very, very few times over a long, hard season. We're talking about over
120 practices. It's tough.  
So the reason last night we went in with so much confidence, we talked about
real simple things. It was our fundamentals. It was closing out. It was
putting pressure on the ball. It was denying passing lanes. It was fronting
the post. The compliments -- I had some friends of mine that are coaches that
aren't playing right now, and they came in for the game, and the compliments I
received were, Wow, you front the post, you deny the passing lanes, you put
pressure on the ball.  
The reason they have progressed and the reason they'll have a chance to win
tomorrow night, I don't know that we can, but we'll have a chance is because
they've been willing to work so hard.  
  
Q. Keyla started the last eight games. What precipitated that change, and
how impressed have you been with her play since then?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we had an injury with Carly Morrow. She's dealing with a
fatigue issue that we're trying to figure out exactly what's going on there.
So she was -- her minutes had to drop because she couldn't go. She would get
winded very easily.  
And so as her condition progressed to a point to where we needed to make a
change in the line-up, so there were some candidates for that job, and Keyla
got it because she had worked really, really hard at the defense. Here's
something I want to tell you about Keyla Snowden. About 13, 14 games ago, we
were at -- it may not be that long, but we were at Vanderbilt here in the last
couple months, and she didn't get off the bench, and I didn't put her in the
game because I didn't have any confidence that she would defend.  
She started coming in for extra work, and basically just made up her mind that
she was going to be committed, and it's really remarkable -- it's a remarkable
thing, an example for the rest of our players, that if you just change your
mindset, you can go from literally not getting in a game to, as you all are
witnessing, being a significant player on college women's basketball's biggest
stage.  
I'm really proud of her because she was getting it in practice. It was not a
lot of warm and fuzzies in practice for her. It was tough every day for her to
come in because I knew she had the ability. I knew she could do it. So she's
been a real difference for us in this tournament, just her range is so deep,
you have to respect that, and if you don't, she's going to burn you.  
But I always knew she could shoot, but it was the defense that turned it
around for her, and she's been terrific for us.  
  
Q. You mentioned the tradition with Oklahoma and the fact they've been here
before. They know the drill coming to the NCAA Tournament. Your team does not.
Is that something you can maybe use as a real advantage, that maybe coming
into a situation they don't really know, they'll just go out there and play?  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, I think that's all how you approach it, and the thing
that this team has done a great job of all year long and why I'm optimistic
that we'll be able to handle this is they have not gotten caught up in
different things.  
And this has been a year, I've said this before, we've come to a lot of points
in the season where we could have gotten a sense of arrival, of stop and smell
the roses, feel like things were great. There were a lot of big moments in the
year. And they have resisted the urge to do that. They have continued to punch
through and work, and so this will be -- everybody is aware of what's on the
line. It's a big, big moment. There's no doubt about it. I think it's silly to
say it's just another game. It's not.  
But what we will try to do is get all of those things -- how happy we would be
to win, how sad we would be to lose, get all the consequences of the game off
our mind and just focus on what we need to do, and this team has shown me they
have that ability, and so I suspect they're probably going to be able to do
that one more time.  
  
Q. You touched a little bit about rebounding, but talk about facing Amanda
Thompson, Abi Olajuwon. Thompson is averaging over ten rebounds a game and Abi
is playing the best she's ever played here lately.  
COACH MITCHELL: It's going to be tough. It's going to be one of the big keys
to the game to who can just fight and battle, and we're at a big disadvantage
there, huge disadvantage in size. We will have to have five players committed
to scrapping and working, and we call it action-oriented rebounding, action
words, grab, pull, snatch, dive, whatever you can do. We talk to them about
those words before games because we just can't get into a jumping match or
think we're just going to jump up and get rebounds. We really have to fight on
the boards.  
Thompson and Olajuwon are imposing figures. They are tough, tough rebounders.
I keep going into those games and saying how in the world are we going to do
it, and somehow they've figured out a way to do it.  
But this will be a huge test for us on the boards and will be a big part of
the game. We'll have to compete with them hard.  
  
Q. Just to follow that up, talk a bit about defending Olajuwon in the post.
She had a double-double last night and is really playing well offensively.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, our whole philosophy there, and everybody knows by this
time that we don't have a lot of height. We've talked about it all year. Our
philosophy is pretty simple. We try to start playing post defense 35 feet from
the basket, so we're going to try to get you to catch it where -- if you want
to catch it at the three-point line, we're going to try to get you to catch it
outside the NBA line. And if you want to catch it at the elbow, we're going to
try to get you 10 feet from there.  
So the post defense starts for us on the perimeter. So we need to pressure so
much that our philosophy is if you can't see her, you can't throw it in there.
So there's more -- there are going to be times when we just can't keep it from
getting in there, and those are just tough situations. You then just have to
fight as hard as you can, kind of hope she misses, box out, get the rebound,
limit those opportunities for her, but really the goal with her is just to
keep it out of her hands. And that's not a secret. That's what we've done.  
We have a lot of big post players in the SEC, and so we've had varying degrees
of success with big players. This will be as big a test as we've had. She's a
really, really good player and has worked herself -- you can tell she's been
dedicated to getting better. It'll be tough. She's a good player.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach. Thank you very much. Congratulations again. We'll
see you tomorrow.  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, your thoughts about last night's game?  
COACH COALE: Again, very, very proud of our kids. I thought we made the plays
down the stretch obviously, showed a lot of grit and determination, very, very
proud to be playing in the Elite 8 and to have the opportunity that we'll have
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. I guess we'll start with you, Danielle. Kentucky really, I mean, they
used their speed and quickness so well last night, and having seen Nebraska,
were you surprised how well they were able to use that to beat Nebraska and
what are going to be sort of the keys to addressing that tomorrow night?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Well, Kentucky has been doing that all year. They've been
the underdog, and I mean, that's extra motivation for them. And so they
definitely used their speed and athleticism to their advantage with whoever
their opponent is, and just getting out in passing lanes and running in
transition is what they like to do. We know we have to value every possession
and not turn the ball over.  
  
Q. Danielle, it was 20 years ago this week that your school decided to drop
women's basketball. As you know, they reinstated it. What do you think that
would mean? I mean, what has the experience meant to you and your teammates
and your friends, playing women's basketball at Oklahoma? How do you think it
benefits young women?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Well, it's definitely a blessing and a great opportunity
that we've all received to go and play -- come and play at the University of
Oklahoma. You can just tell how special the program is and how much it's been
through by the stories that you hear from Coach Coale about when they weren't
really supported, and now we have one of the top five attendances in the
nation. It's just a special privilege to be able to play for such amazing
coaches and be supported like we do in the state of Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you talk about, it's sort of interesting that you guys sort
of all this season have been thinking you have yourselves as the underdog
because of what you lost, but Kentucky will try to say, Hey, we're more the
underdog. We haven't ever been in this position before. Talk about just what
that sort of means in terms of the mentality going into this game. You guys in
a lot of ways have to feel like the favorites because you've had this
experience before?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah, we definitely come in with a lot of experience,
especially previous season, Final Four appearance. So we have to use that to
our advantage. And we have three special seniors that we don't want to lose
yet, so we're going to do all that we can to spend as much time as we can with
them.  
  
Q. Amanda, Kentucky is sort of a newcomer to the big stage in women's
basketball. How much do you know about Kentucky just in general? Were you able
to watch them much? Do you know anything about them other than what you've
learned in the last six, eight hours?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I watched them a little bit when they played Michigan State,
and I saw a little bit of their fight and fire and how they got out and ran in
transition. You know, saw a lot of film today.  
They're just a team that plays hard. I mean, they're scrappy. They're going to
find a way to get in people and to get baskets. We're just going to have to
keep our composure and use our basketball IQ to outwork them and outsmart
them.  
  
Q. Amanda, can you talk a little bit about Victoria Dunlap and who she
reminds you of from the Big 12?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: All of them are pretty athletic. They work hard, and you
know, they're fast. We've got quickness, too, so I mean, it'll be a great
match-up. The game will be fun.  
  
Q. For Nyeshia, you talked a little bit last night about how you thought
about the maturity that you had learned in the last two years really helped
you last night as far as being aggressive and taking those shots. What do you
think last night's win did for, I guess, this team going forward?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: It just showed our toughness and like our will and how well
we play for each other and how much we'll fight. It just showed that we've
been there before and that if we ever get in a dog fight like that, we won't
back down.  
  
Q. Abi, talk a little bit about how the preparation for playing Kentucky
would have been different had you played Nebraska, a team you know very well,
against a team that OU has never played in the history of the program?  
ABI OLAJUWON: Well, obviously the familiarity is something that we came in.
When we played Notre Dame, that was something -- we had played them before. We
knew what they did and didn't do and now we have to base everything off film
and what we've seen in the NCAA Tournament.  
I think that they're a very fast team as you can tell, and Victoria Dunlap,
you don't become SEC Player of the Year just by doing nothing. So she's an
amazing player, and I feel like at the end of the day we played in the Big 12,
and it's the No. 1 and hardest conference for a reason and we played day in
and day out different kinds of teams that are very versatile. It kind of
reminded me a little bit about Texas A & M, how fast they are and especially
how scrappy they are. So I feel like even though they are a different team
that we've never played before, the dynamics of them are a lot like Texas A &
M.  
  
Q. This is for both Amanda and Abi. One of the things Connie Yori said she
thought really hurt Nebraska very badly last night was they got out-rebounded,
and they got out-rebounded by a smaller team. You know, they have Dunlap and
basically four guards, so they were out-rebounded by quickness. What can you
do, I guess, asserting your size to make sure you win the rebounding edge?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, I think we just have to be aggressive. We have to be
strong on the boards and make sure they don't -- if we're putting a body on
them, they can't really out-quick us. If we're aware of what's going on at all
times, I think we won't have that problem.  
ABI OLAJUWON: One thing Coach Coale tells us a lot, and I guess it showed
yesterday when Kentucky played Nebraska, rebounding is all about will and
determination. So it doesn't really matter the size. If you want the ball bad
enough, you're going to get it, and I feel like they took a lot of long shots,
and long shots rebound long.  
But our guards do a great job of getting the shots that go over our heads and
pushing the ball, and I feel like that's going to be to our advantage, not
only the post players rebounding. That will help us.  
  
Q. Abi, you had a big game against UALR and Sherri mentioned you were the
best player in practice a day or two later and then you have this huge game
last night. The player you were ten days ago versus the player you are now, do
you feel like you're in a different place that quickly?  
ABI OLAJUWON: I guess it could be the urgency. Every game could be my last and
when you think of it that way and your back is against the wall, you're going
to do anything and everything to make sure that it isn't until it's the last
game and you're okay with it being the last one. But you don't want your
season to end and you do everything in your power to make sure that that
doesn't happen, and I guess just the urgency.  
  
Q. Jasmine, can you talk a little bit about your defense over the last month
and a half?  
JASMINE HARTMAN: I just think it's just being tough and going out there and
playing hard and just trying to stick to the best player and also just --
really just watching film on them.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, after making a shot and having a game like you did last night,
is it easier to go to sleep or harder to go to sleep?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: It's easier to go to sleep, just to know that we finished
out tough and our teammates -- everyone contributed, and it wasn't -- people
like to blame and point fingers at the end when it comes down to one shot, so
yeah, I think it's a lot easier to go to bed at night.  
  
Q. Amanda, can you talk about how well this team has played in close games
this year and the belief that this team appears to have that they're going to
win every game down the stretch when it's tight?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I don't know, it's just our heart and our passion for winning
games. I mean, we've been in situations all year where we've either been close
or in overtime, and when you've had that kind of experience, you learn what to
do and what not to do, and I feel like we've learned that over the year.  
You know, we just stick together. We don't play as individuals, we play as a
whole, and when you have a group of people that do that, I mean, that's how
you become successful at the end.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, you guys had 21 assists last night. Talk about how well this
team is sharing the ball.  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Yes, very well, and typically to me, honestly, I think we
share a lot all the times. Last night we just happened to knock down shots,
and it's a big difference when you're going in -- our guards and everything,
we fed Abi, you know, we just basically turned out big, and it was like, okay,
we're going to finish this out and get the W. So we just found it deep within
and knocked down shots.  
  
Q. Amanda and Nyeshia, about Abi, if you're willing, as she sits next to
you, the last ten days, just what you've seen from her and where she's -- just
where she is now.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: She has been unbelievable over the past couple days, couple
games. You can see it in her eyes how much she wants to win. You know, it just
shows what she's done over the year and in the off-season has been paying off.
I just want nothing but the best for her, so as long as she keeps doing what
she's doing, I'm fine with it.  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: As far as me, Abi has done great things throughout the
season, but I could just go back to what she says. Now I think she gets it.
She sees a sense of urgency, and she knows that we need her every time. She's
been great. You can look back every time as a team we've been successful and
won. I think there's just a sense of urgency for her.  
  
Q. Danielle, do you enjoy going against an opponent that really goes against
your strength? Kentucky is a team that's going to attack, put a lot of
pressure on you guys, bringing the ball up the court. That's your bread and
butter, what you specialize in doing. Do you sort of enjoy that because you're
confident in your ability to do that?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Oh, yeah. We're definitely confident in everything that we
do. They pressure us, but it's nothing that we haven't seen coming into this
game. The best thing is you can attack it and exploit it, and that's something
we have to do for 40 minutes tomorrow night.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you return to your locker room, and
we'll now take questions for Coach Coale.  
  
Q. I know you've addressed this a lot, but I think for outsiders who may
just sort of be tuning in to see what Abi has done when she waited for three
years. You talked to the Big 12 tournament about how these kids got better
every day even though people didn't know it. What about the character that
that takes to sort of wait your turn and wait as long as she did.  
COACH COALE: Well, I think that there are very few young players anywhere
today who are even okay with sitting as a freshman. I mean, kids today come in
and they want to immediately play for 35 minutes, and they think that that's
-- that they're entitled to that because they got a scholarship. That's the
mindset.  
Abi was so different from that and so refreshing. It wasn't as if she said,
Oh, I'm okay to come and sit on the bench for three years. She said, I want to
come and get better. When I play, I play. When I can help you, I help you, and
I just want to get better.  
Why else would she choose to come to Oklahoma and play behind Courtney? And
Courtney deserves a lot of credit for Abi's development, as well, going
against her every day in practice and being unrelenting. Courtney and Abi had
known one another for years, and trust me, every day in practice, Courtney was
never nice to Abi, and that was probably the best thing she could ever do to
her to make her better.  
Abi is just one of those great stories, never complained, never whined, never
felt like she was getting the raw end of the deal. She just came to work and
got better every day, and then when it came time for her to have her
opportunity, she just took full advantage of it.  
Last night was just -- good story. That's the way that's supposed to happen.  
  
Q. Sherri, going back to Doug's question about 20 years ago, can you take us
back to what you thought? You were a Norman High in March of 1990. Can you
take us back to what went through your mind when you heard that news and just
sort of reflect on how far it's come in 20 years and what you can even achieve
tomorrow night?  
COACH COALE: Well, of course I was a student at Norman High. You left that
wide open.  
Yeah, I was teaching senior English at Norman High School, and I remember
vividly, I went into the teacher's lounge to get my attendance records out of
the mailboxes where we all go, and a couple of the guys who teach upper level
courses at Norman High who were just sports junkies stuck their heads around
the corner and said, Did you just hear what happened? I said, No, what just
happened? They said OU just dropped their women's basketball program. I said,
No, they didn't. They said, Yes, they did. It was just on the radio. I said,
Is everything on the radio true? No, promise, it's really happening, it's
really happening. I said, They can't. They said, They did. I said, They can't.  
I walked out the door and went back to the north gym and wrote my practice
plan for the day. That's really all I thought about it at the time. There was
this little thing called Title IX that wasn't going to let it stick for very
long. So I watched on TV and watched the players and I felt horrible for the
players who were losing their opportunity to compete. Watched nationally at
the coaches' convention as coaches en masse just rallied around and said,
Don't let this happen at one of the major institutions in our country. Don't
let it happen, and they didn't, and the program was reinstated.  
It was a tough period and obviously a tough mark on our program, but you know,
sometimes what you do after the dark day is the most important thing. I will
never forget when we went to the Final Four in 2002, and it was in San Antonio
ironically, just a fantastic place for the Final Four. People are everywhere
around the river walk, and that's where I met Kay Yow. She brought a red
ribbon to me, and she said, You don't know me, but my name is Kay Yow. I said,
Yes, I do know you. She said, What a moment, what a moment for this sport that
this program was dropped and here you are in 2002 at the Final Four. That
should be a message to everyone who has a women's basketball program, that you
can do anything you want to do, and that was my first encounter with the
legend Kay Yow. I walked around the river walk and saw a lot of folks wearing
red ribbons on the lapel of their shirt, wearing ribbons to say look what can
happen.  
  
Q. Along those same lines, would you agree that the events of that week, I
think it took a week for them to reinstate the women's program, was a catalyst
for the success that followed, at least the interest -- it seemed like a lot
of people back then became aware of women's basketball at Oklahoma and kind of
agreed, well, okay, maybe we should give it more support and more of our
attention? Do you think that in the long run looking back it helped the
program?  
COACH COALE: Honest answer, no. When I took over in '96 we averaged about 200
people per game. They hadn't decided yet that it was important. They decided
it was important that somebody should have a program but not that they should
do anything about it.  
For whatever reason, we were able to generate a little bit of excitement and
bring in some players, and when we got the exposure to the right people, it
began to grow and grow and grow. And I really think maybe that's something
that's really unique about Oklahoma. Once we got the product in front of
people -- you've got to give them some reason to come, whether you're giving
tickets away or you're having a carnival or whatever it might be, get them in
there. I knew if we got them in there that Oklahoma people would love our
product. I knew that they would fall in love with our effort and the way that
we competed for each other and everything that we stood for, but we had to get
them there.  
It was kind of like the old Herbal Essence -- I'm really going to date myself
now -- where they told two friends and they told two friends and so on and so
on and so on. That's how we built it. That's what happened. We were able to do
that because we had some phenomenal kids who were just willing to lay it on
the line and let people fall in love with them, and that's what happened.  
  
Q. I'm sure you've been asked this a million times, but for those of us not
as familiar with your program, you have a lot of familiar names to a lot of
sports fans in Olajuwon and Roethlisberger and you had the Parises. Is there
somebody about your program where there's a comfort level with either the
siblings or with the parents of these players?  
COACH COALE: No, I don't coach the siblings nor the players' parents. It's
just mere coincidence. I found Carlee Roethlisberger doing a coaching clinic
in Ohio, and after the clinic person after person after person came through
and said, Hey, have you seen this kid at Findlay. I said, Where's Findlay? I'm
in Ohio. I have no idea; not where we go to recruit quite often. After about
the sixth person said it, I was like, Who is the person at Findlay? Who is
this kid and why is she not going somewhere? And the next person in line was
Carlee's high school coach, and she said, Actually, she plays for me and her
name is Carlee Roethlisberger. And I said, Okay. Carlee what? And she said,
Roethlisberger and shook her head like this. That was the extent of our
conversation. It never even went any further. I said, Okay. Sent T.K. up to
watch her and we loved her. She's a great kid and fell in love with her work
ethic and her ability and signed her.  
Same thing down the stretch. I had recruited Courtney and Ashley for a long
time before I figured out who Bubba Paris was. So it's about the kids.  
  
Q. I asked the players this about their belief that they're going to win
close games. When you're in the huddle and you're looking them in the eyes, do
you get a comfort level there with what they believe they can do?  
COACH COALE: These guys have great eyes. They're full of faith and belief and
commitment, and they lock in on me in huddles. They listen. They buy into
everything. They buy into one another. They buy into our coaching staff. I
always tell my point guards that point guards arrive at the gym with their
teammates with their best performance in their eyes. This is a team that
player for player does that.  
Danielle shows up seeing Amanda's best game in her eyes, but I think Abi shows
up seeing Nyeshia's best game in her eyes, and it's just passed along one to
the other, and I think that's something special that keeps us playing.  
  
Q. Your famous manifesto that you wrote before you got the OU job, I know
all about it except what's in it. I'm not asking for everything that's in it,
but did you have any kind of vision for what you could achieve, and is this
something close to it, Final Four with Stacey Dale, the Final Four with
Courtney Paris, on the verge of another one if you win tomorrow night without
either one of those, I mean, just consistent top-level success?  
COACH COALE: Well, you would be sorely disappointed if you saw the contents.
You know, what is that, the rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated.
I mean, it was an outline of my vision of how I could get from where we were
to where I wanted to be, and is this what I envisioned? Absolutely.
Absolutely. Just didn't have a timeline on anything. I felt like we could
become one of the elite women's basketball programs in the country. I didn't
see any reason why not.  
For one of the same reasons I loved the Norman High School job when I took it
barely out of college was, you know what, they win football championships all
the time. They win volleyball championships all the time. There got to be
athletes walking around the school. We've got to be able to win. It's a
culture of success. You go to the University of Oklahoma, it's a culture of
success.  
Shoot, I walk around campus and go to head coaches' round tables and I'm like
12th on the list in terms of success and we're about to go to the Final Four
again. You walk in last year after the Final Four and a couple people won
national championships, and you're like, Oh, we went to the Final Four.  
That's what happens. It's a culture of success, so why could we not be
successful? There was a reason. So of course there was a vision and the
infamous manifesto was simply how I figured out that I wanted the job and
thought I could do the job. It was more a message to myself than anyone else.
It was a process.  
  
Q. Danielle I think said that Kentucky, they've seen pressure before, that
it's nothing they haven't seen, but Nebraska and Michigan State, they've all
said that's pressure like we've never seen. Do you think they know what
they're in for just based on what you've seen the last few hours?  
COACH COALE: Well, I think we have a pretty good guess because we play in the
Big 12 south. If anything can prepare you for that, it is that. We've played
Texas A & M three times. We've played Baylor three times. We've learned some
things about ourselves over the course of that. And I agree if you have not
been on the floor with that, watching film doesn't do it justice. Sitting
court side doesn't really do it justice. You have to be out there on the floor
with it.  
I do think they're a little different from A & M. They're not as long as
rangy. They may be faster, though, if that's even humanly possible. But I
think the way that they play, the relentless waves, that's very much like
Texas A & M, and that's probably the greatest comparison, even more than the
athleticism is just the unrelenting defense, and it never changes. It never
lets up, regardless of what's going on, score, time, et cetera. So I think
we're probably just about as prepared as anybody could be.  
  
Q. It seems like this offense is really in the best rhythm it's been in all
season, and obviously that will come into play as you're facing Kentucky's
defense.  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I think rhythmic offense is often as a result of trust, and
the more you play together and the more you buy into one another, the higher
your level of trust, and thus the improved performance.  
I made a great point that's often taken for granted. Someone asked about the
assist total, and you can ask our guys when I come in the locker room after a
game that's one of the first things I point to, that's what I talk about at
halftime. She simply said, We made a lot of baskets. It's awful hard to get
very many assists if you're not making baskets. There have been games this
year where we've shared the ball, but when the ball doesn't go in, you don't
get an assist for it. I think that's what makes those numbers so pretty from
last night. We did make baskets.  
But I do think our rhythm is good. I think we're sharing it, and I think that
begins with Danielle Robinson. She has just got to play at the right pace and
she's got to handle the tempo, and I'm personally very happy for her that she
has been on the floor with Texas A & M three times because she has allowed it
to speed her up in the past, and I think she's figured out how to prevent
that, and I think she'll be a key obviously tomorrow night.  
  
Q. How have you changed as a coach, not psychological, not dealing with
personality and that kind of stuff, but just strategy and in-game stuff? Are
you a lot better than you used to be, or was that always easy? How do you
think you've progressed just X's and O's wise?  
COACH COALE: I'm sorry. I just keep thinking about this tee shirt I have that
says, "The older I get, the better I was." I don't know why. I just can't get
that one out of my mind.  
I don't know. I think the development of my staff as much as anything, the
amount of faith and trust I have in them and the way we are together. I
probably spend a lot more time focusing on offense now, and Chad Thrailkill I
say is in charge of our defense, but we rotate assignments every year and he
is in charge of our defense. He and Jan often talk at time-outs about changing
coverages or swapping match-ups or whatever, how we're guarding ball screens.
They're kind of figuring that out while I'm thinking about what we want to do
on offense next, and I think that balance and that faith that we have, how we
all work together, that's helped me, I think, improve and grow and make better
decisions.  
Hopefully I'm getting better. Hopefully I'm better right now than I was last
year. That's kind of the idea just like a player. You want to keep getting
better and better. Hopefully tomorrow I'll be as good as Tom Izzo. I'm going
to work real hard overnight to see if I can be.  
  
Q. That triangle thing you guys do, is that relatively new or is that
something you've been doing for several years?  
COACH COALE: Triangle thing?  
  
Q. I don't know anything about it, but everybody is saying they're running a
triangle offense.  
COACH COALE: That's hysterical. Yes, Tex Winter actually invented that, and
the Chicago Bulls made it famous, and when we run it, it doesn't look very
much like that at all, but we try real hard.  
We call it cornering -- there are a lot of different names for it, but we call
it cornering. We use it on sidelines. We use it for set situations. We've used
it for entire games. I think against Kansas we ran it the entire game.  
It's just something, it's a way for us to get some action that we can be
successful with, and there are different pieces of that. But it can be a
beautiful offense. Nobody runs it better than Stanford right now in the
women's college game, and I think the key for it all is to have a great
passing post guy, and obviously Stanford has those, and when we put Amanda
Thompson in there, she's pretty good at it, too. And Abi is not bad at it at
all, either. She's thrown her fair share of backdoor passes.  
But it's a beautiful way to play, and it's really a lot less scripted -- I
guess you could run it in a very scripted manner if you wanted to, but it's
got a lot of reads and requires a high level of basketball IQ to really run
well.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, thank you very much. We'll see you tomorrow
evening.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kentucky  76  
Nebraska - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. Your comments about tonight's game?  
COACH MITCHELL: Very proud of our team. I thought they did everything asked of
them tonight. We just wanted to play with a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of
energy, a lot of effort. It's been our formula for success all season. We were
up against a tremendous basketball team tonight, so really proud of our
players, and we will be working hard to try to advance on.  
  
Q. This is for A'dia. Could you just talk about the team's perimeter
shooting? It seemed like with your three-pointers you got a lot of uncontested
shots.  
A'DIA MATHIES: Fortunately we got left open a couple times, and we knocked
down some shots. I'm just glad that they was falling to be able to give us
momentum to be able to pull away in the game.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, just what this means to you guys, the fact that you
got a big win over a top seed in this tournament and now you're moving on to
the Elite 8, what that means to you.  
AMBER SMITH: It means a lot, and we're definitely not satisfied, but we're
going to enjoy this win tonight. Nebraska was a tough team, and obviously
they're No. 1, but we didn't come here looking at seeds. We just came here
just ready to play, and I thought we did tonight.  
A'DIA MATHIES: Yeah, it does mean a lot to us, just to know that they're a 1
seed and we can compete with the best in the country. It just gives us a lot
of confidence knowing that we're still hungry and trying to take it even
further.  
  
Q. A'dia, how important was your team quickness tonight?  
A'DIA MATHIES: It was very important, especially every game. We tried to push
the tempo and tried to just feed every team we play up. That's part of
Kentucky basketball, and I think we did a good job of that tonight.  
  
Q. Amber, how difficult was it in the first half when you guys were playing
so well to have to fight through all the foul trouble?  
AMBER SMITH: It was very tough. You know, we just had to stop just reaching
and play fundamental defense. That's what Coach preached us at halftime is
don't play with our hands, move our feet. So I think we adjusted in the second
half and we did better.  
  
Q. A'dia, what changed for you in the second half? I think you had four
points in the first half. What changed for you? What opened up for you, I
guess?  
A'DIA MATHIES: Personally they left me open a couple times. I was able to
knock down some shots and get more confidence and get some momentum, and as I
kept shooting they just kept falling. I think that helped me out tonight, and
it helped our team out.  
  
Q. Amber, what went through your mind when they cut it to seven? Was there
any panic? What went on in the huddle? What did you guys do?  
AMBER SMITH: Coach just told us to calm down and stay focused and take care of
the ball and just be ready to shoot free throws and be ready to make them. So
he just told us to run our stuff because we've practiced it every day, going
through that type of situation. He just told us to focus and take care of the
ball.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a big game. We'll see you tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously last week you guys had the "home court advantage." What
was the atmosphere like out there and was that difficult at all for you guys
to fight through?  
COACH MITCHELL: It was very difficult at times when Nebraska could get some
momentum, and I was so impressed with our players in that atmosphere because
it was tough. It was loud. I thought the Nebraska fans did a great job of
trying to give their team energy. And I thought we made some pretty tough
plays to answer some big shots that they made when the crowd was really trying
to get behind them. So very impressed with their support that Nebraska
received from their fans, and it was a tough atmosphere to play in.  
  
Q. Can you just, I guess, how important was the way you started the second
half? You kind of created a cushion. It was big enough to hold on.  
COACH MITCHELL: It was a big key. We went into halftime, Nebraska went into
halftime on a 4-0 run, and I was really concerned coming out of halftime that
if we let them get going, it was going to be tough.  
So we talked a lot about the first four minutes. You know, you try to break it
up into four-minute segments. It's been successful for our team to sort of
narrow our focus at times, and so the first four minutes was critical, and I
was thrilled with that start. That was a tremendous start to the half and
allowed us to get control of the game. Really impressed with our players to be
able to do that at this point in the tournament.  
  
Q. Connie Yori talked about Kentucky's quickness advantage. Is that a common
occurrence against most teams, and how did you see that manifest itself
tonight?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I just -- first of all, you have to realize how hard
these players have worked to get into the physical condition required to play
this tempo. I just can't thank -- our athletic trainer does a great job, our
strength and conditioning coach does a great job, but these players have to
commit to what you're asking them to do. And we are pretty much all in right
now with that type of commitment.  
So you can't overstate the importance for our team. We are not tall. We don't
have a lot of size. We do have good, well-conditioned athletes, so that's our
whole method of playing. We have to play with quickness. We have to use the
speed to our advantage.  
And I think the way it manifested itself tonight is very deep there in the
second half, we were still quick inbounding the ball and running it back at
Nebraska, and you can't do that if you're not in shape. So I thought the pace
of the game was where we wanted it tonight, and it was a big advantage for us.  
  
Q. In what ways do you feel like your schedule, especially playing a
perennial power such as Tennessee, has helped prepare you for this tournament
and reach this point?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, our league is fantastic, and we had -- you see four
teams in our league advance to the round of 16. You know there's some really
quality teams and quality players. And so I think the Southeastern Conference
prepares you well for whatever you might see in this tournament.  
I think that's invaluable that you can kind of find out what your personality
is as a team and what works and what doesn't. I think the conference play
really allowed us to establish an identity, and it's been good to us.  
  
Q. When you got up by 16, 18 points, did your strategy change? The kids
really seemed to work the shot clock down like you wanted to, which was the
opposite of quickness.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, that's a tough situation to be in. At times you're
coaching some kids out there that are only human. They know what the score is.
We're trying to tell them to keep pushing. Then there's times when we're
telling them to be smart with the clock. You had to know that a team as good
as Nebraska with those players that we have so much respect for, you had to
know they were going to make a run.  
And so I was just hoping that we would remain aggressive. I thought we got a
little passive there when they made their run. We looked like we had not
practiced much press offense there, and those things happen. You just see
teams all the time in that situation. It happens. We'll work real hard to not
have it happen again, but I was real happy with the way the team played today.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what this means for the program? You guys keep
going further and further in kind of an unprecedented run this season.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we've had that question a few times, and it's not time
for us to attach meaning to or significance to this win. There will be time
for that.  
What we need to do is put our energy into whatever confidence we can gain from
tonight. We need to get that and take it into the next game.  
So there will be a time when we can look -- clearly this is a special group,
special team. I love this team. But it's not time for that right now. But when
the time comes, obviously this will be a significant victory.  
So really proud of our players tonight, thought they gave a tremendous effort,
and you can see they're one of the toughest teams in the country.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Amani Franklin's play? She didn't score a lot of
points, but she had some huge rebounds and big steals at all the right
times.  
COACH MITCHELL: So happy for Amani and Lydia both. I just think they are
playing with tremendous urgency. They are playing with tremendous purpose. If
you could see what I see as far as the growth both of those young women have
made as people and as players, it's really something that is special to me. So
happy I get another practice with those two. So happy we get another game to
play with those two, because they are huge for our team, and they're not
always huge statistically, but they both played with tremendous heart tonight
and tremendous focus, and they were both talking in the huddles about what we
needed to do. So it's a great thing to see those two playing the way they are,
and we are certainly a better basketball team because of the improvements that
they've been willing to make.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll see you tomorrow afternoon.  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you very much. Appreciate it.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  77  
Notre Dame - 72

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Coach Muffet McGraw of Notre Dame. Your
thoughts on tonight's game.  
COACH McGRAW: I thought Lindsay Schrader and Melissa Lechlitner played great.
They didn't want their season to end. I thought they did everything they could
do offensively to help us win the game. I thought they beat us from the three-
point line.  
I thought Stevenson, she really played well, five for eight from the three-
point line including the game winner. That was someone we were really, really
trying to guard and just lost her for a second on a number of occasions, and
that was the difference in the game. I thought they rebounded really well,
too. We didn't do a good job on the boards, and our bench, which has been our
strength all year long, just gave us nothing tonight.  
  
Q. Lindsay, can you talk about your night offensively?  
LINDSAY SCHRADER: Well, if I was going to go down, I was going to go down
swinging. I always told myself that I had to attack the basket, and I sure did
tonight. I should have done that all year. I don't know why I was kind of
holding out. Yeah, I wanted to score. I didn't want to lose, and it just kind
of took over me. But I left it all out there.  
You know, people look around and see I'm not upset, but there's nothing else I
could have done. That's just the way you've got to do it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Oklahoma's inside game and the problems that Olajuwon
caused?  
LINDSAY SCHRADER: Yeah, well, we were really, really focusing on Stevenson and
her three-point abilities. So that left her wide open sometimes in the post
area, and she's strong. She's a great player.  
  
Q. Melissa, what was it about the mid-range jumper that was working today? I
mean, when did you feel that comfortable with it and just stay with it?  
MELISSA LECHLITNER: Well, the screens that Lindsay and our post players were
setting were really opening a lot up for me. So right from the getgo, the very
beginning of the game, my first one fell and so I just kept attacking and
using their really good screens after that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about you guys were down I think six points with about two
and a half minutes, 2:40. Can you talk about how you guys regrouped and
attacked and put it into overtime?  
LINDSAY SCHRADER: Yeah, we decided to rebound a little bit and get some
defensive stops, and we came down and had a couple of really good offensive
plays, and Skylar hit that big three and sent it into overtime. We just kind
of dug down a little bit.  
  
Q. Melissa, can you talk a little bit about the legacy of this senior
class?  
MELISSA LECHLITNER: Yeah, such a great four years we had here. You know, it's
been fun representing this University, and I wish we could have went a little
further.  
  
Q. Lindsay, Coach has already said that on a couple of occasions you guys
just lost track of Stevenson. Were you surprised that she attempted the three
in a tie game that late in that situation?  
LINDSAY SCHRADER: No, I'm not surprised that she shot it. I got over there as
fast as I could, and she let it fly. She was hitting them all game. I guess
that was my fault. I should have been more conscious of where she was.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, we're going to let you return to your locker room.
We'll take questions for Coach now.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about what you had planned for the final 4.4 seconds
and how that all unveiled?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, it was a play we've worked on quite a bit, but you know,
it obviously went awry. Schrader was going to throw it to Skylar for three,
but probably in hindsight should have just given it to Skylar right at half
court and let her dribble it down. She probably would have made it because
she's that kind of player. Yeah, it was obviously four seconds, you're going
with your late game play that you've worked on all year long. We didn't -- the
pass was a little off, and they defended it well.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the comeback from six down with 2:40 left and talk
about Skylar's three-pointer?  
COACH McGRAW: Yeah, that was huge. We ran the same play that we got Barlow the
three for in the Syracuse game, and she responded well. She hadn't been
shooting that particularly well all game, but she has the kind of confidence
that I thought she could make it.  
Erica did a good job of screening for her to get her that last three. Lech did
a nice job getting inside the lane to get the three-point play. It was only
two possessions, we got back to back, three points for each, and were able to
get a stop in between, which was the real key for the whole run.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about Jasmine Hartman's defense on Skylar
tonight?  
COACH McGRAW: I thought that Skylar got a lot of lay-ups in the first half
that didn't go in for her, and I think it probably frustrated her a little
bit. You know, and then we went into Schrader for a good deal of the time in
the second half. She was able to hit the three, got a couple in transition,
but I think we probably didn't get her the ball enough to really let her do
what she can do.  
  
Q. Just because of injuries and other situations, you guys have really been
kind of up against the 8 ball with size this year having to play such a heavy
guard lineup. Was this a game where that kind of caught up to you in some way
because of the way Olajuwon played and Amanda Thompson?  
COACH McGRAW: I thought Olajuwon played really well, and I was disappointed in
our post that we didn't do a better job on her. We worked on some different
things. We were trying to double-team her, and she got some offensive rebound
putbacks and just some easy, easy baskets off of penetration when we didn't
drop in.  
I was really disappointed in the defense we did on her. She played very well,
and I mean, seven offensive rebounds. That's almost as many as our whole team
had. She did a great job hanging on that weak side block and waiting for her
opportunities and she used her size. I thought Erica Williamson might be able
to defend her a little bit better. I thought Becca could be a little more
quicker and Deb maybe could block a shot, but really we were 0 for 3 in
guarding her. She just really outplayed us.  
  
Q. From inside and outside tonight, was there one of those areas that was
more of a concern to you going into the game?  
COACH McGRAW: No. I think we were worried about both. We played about half
man, half zone. I thought they hit some shots on both. They got it inside a
little easier I thought against the man-to-man, but she hit a couple threes on
the man-to-man, as well. You know, we had a really good plan, I thought, going
in, and you know, we didn't get to the double-team as we had kind of worked
on, so that was a little disappointing that we weren't able to get down and
double her.  
  
Q. This was the second time you've played Oklahoma this year. Did you see in
any adjustments they made from the first time?  
COACH McGRAW: I thought Olajuwon played a lot better. She just played better.
I thought Stevenson made more shots. Otherwise I thought we did a pretty good
job on Robinson. I thought Skylar's defense was really outstanding on
Robinson. I thought she kept her in check, did a great job on her.  
But their inside game I thought -- really just Olajuwon, I thought she really,
really played well. We did a decent job on Thompson. So I thought Olajuwon and
Stevenson both really stepped up for them.  
  
Q. I wonder if you could sort of just reflect on the season that Skylar has
had. It seems like she's been everything you could have wanted this season.  
COACH McGRAW: She really was. Right from the getgo, she was MVP of the
Paradise Jam. She's been our leading scorer all year long. She's been a close
second in assists, leads us in steals. She'll occasionally be the leading
rebounder if that's what we need her to do. She's our best on-the-ball
defender. She had a sensational year. She really wanted the ball late in the
game, and I was disappointed that we didn't get it to her a little bit more
because she's such a game player. She's so competitive. She just wants to win,
and just really -- she had a great year.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Kentucky  76  
Nebraska - 67

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Nebraska Coach Connie Yori and her student
athletes. Coach, your thoughts on tonight's game?  
COACH YORI: Well, I want to congratulate Kentucky. I thought they played
really well. They came out and got us on our heels, and we just couldn't get
back to who we were all season until the latter part of the game, and that's a
credit to them.  
You know, I've said, and these guys have heard this probably 1,000 times this
year, ever since we started our conditioning sessions, I said, Guys, if we can
rebound and we can compete on the boards, we can beat just about anybody. And
tonight was an example of us not competing on the boards and the loose balls
and the rebounds went their way and ultimately that was the difference in the
game. But congratulations to Kentucky.  
  
Q. Kelsey, what went wrong, I guess, from your perspective just as a whole
with the team tonight?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Well, you know, Coach said it. When we defensive rebound, we
can be a really good team and compete with some of the best teams, and we
struggled with that tonight. But you have to credit Kentucky; they knocked
down shots. They shot really well. I mean, kind of like Coach said, we were on
our heels and we never quite recovered from that. But I think how we lost the
game in the last final minutes credits a lot to our character. We never gave
up, we came back, we fought, and it was a bout till the end.  
  
Q. This is for any of you. What parallels do you see between the way this
team played tonight and when you played here a few weeks ago against Texas A &
M?   
KELSEY GRIFFIN: You know, both teams pressure. They're both pressure teams.
Both teams out-rebounded us, and we knew rebounding was going to be important
and taking care of the ball was going to be important in the game. It was good
what they did in the first half as far as what they were able to do convert
off of our turnovers and their steals, and that's what kind of gave them their
lead. Then for us not being able to defensive rebound like we needed to,
battles of possession is a huge thing in basketball and hard to win a lot of
games if you don't win the battle of possession.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you talk about handling the ball against their pressure
defense and how it played out into what you thought it would be going into
this game?  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: Well, we knew that they were a pressure team, kind of just
to piggyback on what Kelsey and Coach had said, we were on our heels, and we
did a better job later in the game, but initially in the first 12 or 10
minutes, we didn't handle the pressure very well, so....  
  
Q. Cory, it seemed like especially in the second half late you started to
make a run, you started to put things together, but Kentucky just wouldn't let
you get back in it because they started hitting shots. What was your thoughts
on that?  
CORY MONTGOMERY: Well, you know, when we got down, our team never gives up,
and that's the great thing about watching us play is we're going to fight
until the very end whether we're winning the game, whether we're losing the
game, and we never were going to give up and just let Kentucky walk away with
a win, and I think that really shows the determination that we had. We didn't
get the job done, but we still stuck with it and kept in the game and gave
them all that we had until the end.  
  
Q. Cory, I know that this probably stings a lot, but do you have any idea
when it'll wear off and you'll have a second to think about what you guys
accomplished this year, because it was a pretty remarkable season. When do you
think about that?  
CORY MONTGOMERY: Well, it does really hurt right now, and I'm sure it'll hit
us all when we wake up tomorrow morning and don't go to the gym to practice.
But if you do look at our season, we ended up really -- it didn't end the way
we'd like to, but we still had a really good season and we accomplished many
different things for the Nebraska program and we ended up with a strong record
and we were Big 12 champs, so we did some really good things. If you look back
to our season, we still had a really successful season. It just didn't end the
way we wanted it to.  
  
Q. Kelsey, can you talk about the impact of the early foul in the second
half and how that affected the way you were able to play when you came back
in?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Well, as of late I've been in foul trouble a lot, so I was
kind of used to it. But fouls happen. I have to be able to play through them.
You know, in hindsight probably should have taken the three instead of driving
it all the way, but I tried to stay aggressive. I don't think it really took
me a lot out of the game because I had two more fouls I could potentially get,
and we needed to stay aggressive in order to try to fight back into the game.
So I don't think it really affected how I played too much.  
  
Q. Did you guys feel that maybe there was a lack of energy or your legs
maybe weren't under you or is that not a fair assessment?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: I can't speak for the rest of my team, but my legs were fine
for the game. I know -- I do know that all of my teammates wanted this game
and we were all fired up and wanted to play. We were excited to play. We love
playing with one another, so tonight was no different.  
  
Q. Kelsey, the way that you guys started, usually you guys start the second
half kind of surging ahead or at least seizing momentum a little bit. But what
happened there to start the second half because that's when they made their
run to kind of create some cushion?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: I don't know. It was just kind of a fight throughout the whole
game. You know, every time it seemed like we could kind of get a little break,
they just hit a big shot or stole a ball. Like Coach said, taking care of the
ball and defensive rebounding was huge, and we weren't quite able to
capitalize on it as much as we needed to.  
  
Q. The seniors can touch on this, just where you're leaving things now in
your final game and where the program has come to in your years here.  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: You know, the thing that hurt so much about losing this game
isn't the game, it's the fact that I'm not going to get to go back and
practice with these underclassmen and the rest of my seniors.  
That being said, I think that we have helped Nebraska put Nebraska on the map,
and I'm so excited to see what the team is going to do next year. They're
bringing in some great freshmen. The freshmen this year got great exposure.
Everyone grew up a lot this year, and so I'm really excited to see where
Nebraska is going to go, and I know it's only going to get better from here on
out.  
Coach Yori is a great coach. She's obviously done great things with the
program, one of the hardest working people I know, and it's been an honor
playing for her, and I know there's only good things to come in the future for
Nebraska.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thanks for coming. We'll take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, if you can just pick up where they left off on the senior class in
general. I know you spoke volumes about them all year, but at the end of the
season now.  
COACH YORI: These guys -- our senior class, I can go back as far as seven
years ago and say -- and I said this at that time, that this senior class,
which Kelsey was added to the senior class, but seven years ago when those
guys were sophomores in high school, I said, this will be the most important
class that we'll ever have.  
The recruiting part of it I could foresee ahead that it was going to be a big
class. It was going to be an important class to get us over the hump, and
obviously they've done a lot more than just get us over the hump. I mean, they
have taken us to a No. 1 seed in the NCAA Tournament, won 32 games, absolutely
shattered the school record, won their -- were part of winning the first Big
12 championship in program history, and I'm sure I'm forgetting some things,
but 30-game winning streak.  
These guys are -- I've been a head coach for 20 years, and this is absolutely
the most unselfish team that I've ever coached. They didn't care who got the
credit. They weren't about points, rebounds, stats, minutes. They were just
about being great teammates, working every day to get better, and there's
nothing more that you can ask for as a coach than having an opportunity to
work with the young women in our program who have that great character.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could talk about how tough this Kentucky team is
to defend because they're not particularly big, but they're so quick and they
have scoring throughout -- all over the court.  
COACH YORI: Right. Well, John Wooden always says that -- he used to say when
he coached, he'd say, if you have three players on your team that are quicker
than your opponent, you have a really good chance to win.  
And if you look at their lineup, they were either as quick or quicker at every
position than us, and that was the difference. They got every loose ball. They
chased down loose ball rebounds. They beat us to the ball. And the collection
of those plays added up to a win for them. They're a very quick team.  
It's not that we lacked quickness, but we weren't as quick as they were at
every position, and ultimately that was the difference.  
  
Q. You shot 60 percent in the first half and then the first six minutes
nothing went your way in the second half. I know that they asked the players
about that. Just your comments on the start to the second half.  
COACH YORI: Well, we didn't do the things we talked about at halftime. We
wanted to pound the ball inside. We didn't get the ball inside enough tonight.
And that's been our bread and butter all year, and we did not take advantage
of our size advantage on the low block. We just didn't get enough post
touches. And finally when we did you could see Cory score down there and
Kelsey, as well. We just didn't get an opportunity to get the ball inside
enough.  
They hurt us. Again, they got us on our heels, and I really felt like to start
both halves, I mean, their energy level was very good. You're always going to
play a little bit quicker to start the half because you're a little more
fresh, and I thought that's where the game was decided, at the beginning of
each of those two halves.  
  
Q. That quickness that you talk about, how much of that was something that
you fully anticipated coming into this, and what did you want to do other than
take advantage of your size to counteract that?  
COACH YORI: Well, that's the main thing. We needed to -- and we needed to
rebound, and we knew we had to chase down loose ball rebounds. We just weren't
quick to the ball.  
But there's no reason why we didn't get the ball inside more. That's
disappointing that we weren't able to do that. You know, we knew they were
quick. They're not a big team. We watched plenty of film. We knew they were
quick. We tried to simulate it. You do the best you can to simulate it but
hard to simulate.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments. Congratulations
on a great season.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  

Oklahoma  77  
Notre Dame - 72

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the University of Oklahoma, Coach Sherri
Coale and her student athletes. Coach, your thoughts about this evening's
game.  
COACH COALE: I could not be more proud of these kids, just a relentless, gutsy
effort. The way we've won a bunch of games this year. Just so proud of player
after player. I could talk about each one over and over.  
I thought Notre Dame was fantastic, as well. I think this was one of those
games that can really grow the sport of women's college basketball. It was a
clean game. One team would score, the other team would answer with a basket,
another basket. Just a high-quality basketball game. Notre Dame is a fantastic
team. I don't get speechless very often, but I can't think of anything better
to say other than I'm just really, really proud of this bunch of kids.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, you said earlier in the week that if you got the chance at
another game winner like that, you were going to make it. Can you talk about
that play and what was going through your mind when you got the ball and the
shot clock about to go off?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Yes. I mean, I played it back in my head before we played
Notre Dame tonight, about how much I ran from it in my sophomore year. I was
like, you know what, I'm not going to do this to my team, and I want to play
some more. So I just said, hey, when the clock is running down, if you're not
going to take it, who is, so I just jumped up and shot it.  
  
Q. Abi, Muffet McGraw was just saying she thought the biggest difference
between the time you guys met earlier this season and tonight's game was your
play. Can you talk about how much you looked to take it inside against their
post players and how much you took advantage of that?  
ABI OLAJUWON: I think that honestly just comes with experience. We played them
very early in the year before we even started our conference play. As you
could tell this year our conference was very hard, and having those games
every other day gives you great practice, and even going against scout, that
always helps a lot, and I just feel like I feel more familiar with being on
the court.  
Then it comes with -- we had no intention of going home tonight. I kept
saying, we have practice tomorrow. As much as in the past I'll go, oh, man,
there's practice. When you're saying -- you can't wait to practice. You would
give anything to practice. I knew Amanda and Nyeshia knew that we were ready
to stay.  
  
Q. Amanda, can you talk about what was going through your mind that last
possession, last 30 seconds and the way the play developed, and just take us
through that whole sequence?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Well, they scored, of course, and the game was tied up, so
I'm like, all right, we've got to do something. Time is running out. And you
know, we've been in tight situations like this, but I felt like, well, my
role, even though I want them to go in always thinking when the ball is going
to go off, so the majority of the time I'm thinking, get the rebound, get the
rebound or just do anything so they won't get the ball and go down and score.  
So I mean, I knew we had it before Ny even got the ball. I knew she was going
to be open, and I was going to get the rebound. But I was so happy that she
made that shot. I mean, it was huge. It was huge. It was amazing. I'm proud of
her.  
Two years ago it was a whole different story, and it's -- when you do the
right thing, good things happen to good people, and she's a great person, and
I'm glad it happened to her.  
  
Q. Amanda, I wonder if you could sort of expound on what Abi has meant to
the team this year for somebody who had to play behind Courtney for three
years and everything she's done to be able to play as well as she has as a
senior?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I feel like she's committed herself to getting better. She
worked in the off-season and just put herself in a position to be successful
during the year. You know, every game she was just a step closer at getting
better, getting better, getting better. What a great time to be such a
dominant player. Her presence on the court is unbelievable. Our point
differentiation is positive when she's on the floor. It's just a whole
different game.  
She showed that today, being down there battling, and we're talking, and she
wants every possession. And when she has that attitude, we're going to be
successful, and I'm happy for her, too.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, can you talk about sometimes when the other team hits a big shot
to go into overtime they take the momentum. Can you talk about when you
huddled up there after Diggins hit the shot to tie it, what you guys were
talking about going into the overtime?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Basically that we've been in these situations way too many
times to just die and give up. Overtime battles, I mean, we've won throughout
the year, so we weren't nervous or anything about it. We just said, hey, we
get another five minutes, so here we go, so as soon as we started the tip,
just get the ball rolling.  
  
Q. Nyeshia, you and Sherri a minute or so after the game hugged at mid-
court. Can you let us in on what was said between the two of you?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Yeah, she said that -- basically she was just very proud of
me, and she was like -- what did you say? What did you say? She was like --
no. She said, "Are you mature or what? Are you mature or what?" And I'm like,
"I'm mature, Coach. I'm mature."  
  
Q. Nyeshia, you've had some games late season where you got really hot at
the end of the game and you did that tonight but you were hot early, as well.
Can you talk about why you think you got in the flow of the game so early and
throughout the game?  
NYESHIA STEVENSON: Yeah, it basically shows when I really want the ball. Every
time I caught it, my feet were ready and my hands were ready and my mind was
ready to shoot. I never hesitated, and I think that's what made me knock down
baskets early.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, have a good evening. Questions for Coach Coale?  
  
Q. Sherri, looking back through all the scores this season, when Nyeshia
hits four or more three-pointers, you guys are 8 and 1 now. Can you talk a
little bit about her scoring?  
COACH COALE: Yeah. Obviously when you play a team that runs a lot of zone,
you're going to have to make some shots from the perimeter. I thought the fact
that she started out the game making a few really relaxed us and felt like we
could go back to her late in the game. I think they did kind of lose her a
bit. They concentrated obviously very hard on her after she hit an early one
but kind of got lost a little bit a couple times in the second half and we
didn't find her and felt at the end like we could.  
She's been that thing for us, that spark, and when we get those three-point
shots along with the penetration that we get from D. Rob and then the post
play we get from Abi, then we've been obviously pretty successful.  
  
Q. Just wondering when you play in the Big 12, very tough conference, that
meat-grinder schedule, how that might help you when you get to NCAA Tournament
times and games like this?  
COACH COALE: I think it makes you tough. I think it makes you physically and
mentally tough. We have had to play every possession all year long. We haven't
been good enough to take any off. We just can't win if we do that. These guys
have figured out how to concentrate, concentrate more on the possession than
the scoreboard, and I think that really was reflected tonight.  
Just I felt like we were in the middle of every play instead of paying
attention to the score and the time and all the things that go with all the
hoopla that comes with being at the Sweet 16. We just played basketball
possession.  
  
Q. I'm looking at Jasmine's line, and it's sort of okay just to look at it,
but she seemed like in the half court offense to be the one who was able to
find those open people and turn those into made baskets. Comment on what she
was able to do for you tonight.  
COACH COALE: Well, she does a really good job of attacking the gaps of the
zone, and she sees herself as a passer. And so obviously she's going to be
able to find guys at the block who are stealing out. Did a really good job, I
thought, deep in the shot clock a number of times, the ball in her hand deep
in the shot clock, and she was patient, patient enough, didn't panic. But the
thing Jas did all night was guard Skylar Diggins, honestly, and the two for
three from the three-point line was gravy.  
  
Q. Obviously the stakes were high in this game, but would you say this was
one of your better all-around games, the Sooners' better all-around games all
year?  
COACH COALE: Oh, I have trouble comparing games. I really do. I would probably
have to watch the film before I could tell you that, because in my mind right
now about all I can see is Nyeshia's three ball going in the basket, so you
might want to get back to me later on that one.  
  
Q. At the end of regulation you had the ball in a similar situation, about
30 seconds or so left, but they had three fouls to give, I think. Did you know
you were in trouble in terms of with that many, it would be tough to get a
decent shot in the last second?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, we knew they had fouls to give, and I thought Muffet did a
great job of strategizing the final seconds there. We were trying to get deep
enough to inbound it and have -- we didn't want just one second on the clock.
We thought if we could have three on the inbounds, we could catch it and shoot
it and maybe get a foul that way. But a little too much time clicked off the
clock there at the end. I was trying to call time-out, but I guess I wasn't
yelling loudly enough.  
  
Q. Sherri, for Abi to go 35 minutes tonight and play as well as she did, I
mean, I know you've been talking all year about how she committed for her
senior year, but this is probably a centerpiece game of that commitment.  
COACH COALE: You know, everything about this game I thought was kind of how
it's supposed to be for this senior group. Nyeshia and the similarities from
two years ago and the reflection of her growth.  
And then Abi over the course of a season; you know, she just deserved this
stage and she deserved that performance, and every time Notre Dame scored, Abi
was our answer. When we were grinding it out around the 10-minute mark, she
just was undaunted in the post. I loved her demeanor. I loved her focus. I
loved her rebounding. I just thought it was fantastic and so appropriate for
her.  
And I think a big part of her performance tonight came from how well she
played in the first and second rounds. It's that confidence that just
continues to build. I don't think she's anywhere near as good as she has a
chance to be at the next level.  
  
Q. Jasmine has had some really good defensive games. Can you rate this one
compared to some of those most recent games?  
COACH COALE: Well, based on the way Skylar has been playing of late, this
would have to be one of her top two or three. She's committed as a defender,
and she likes that. She relishes the opportunity to guard the opposing team's
best perimeter player. All night long basically she did exactly the right
thing.  
Right at the end she went under the old screen and gave Skylar the three and
she was fighting like crazy to get over it and Skylar made a great play. It
was a tough shot, people running at her. But aside from that, it was a pretty
flawless defensive performance on her.  
  
Q. Two-part question: One, did Nyeshia get your conversation pretty close to
straight? And second, at the risk of being corny, can you talk about just sort
of the cool aspect of the NCAA Tournament and what it can do for somebody like
Nyeshia redemption-wise?  
COACH COALE: Yeah, we won't get corny. This will be good. Yeah, the
conversation was pretty much that. I said, "My, how you have grown up. Are you
mature or what?" She was yelling right back in my ear, "I'm mature, Coach. I'm
mature." It was pretty funny. But I just told her how proud I was of her and
her growth, and it couldn't have happened to a better kid in a better
situation, and I just wanted her to soak it all in.  
As far as this stage and this tournament and what it can do for you, most of
the success in life is about being confident and about believing you can do
things, and the really superior part of athletics is that it can teach you
that if you let it. It teaches you that confidence is something you give
yourself. You earn it and then you give it to yourself and then you accept it,
and nobody else does that for you. And if you can learn that lesson through
collegiate athletics, you can be successful at anything you do.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, thank you very much, and congratulations. We'll
see you tomorrow.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the University of Nebraska Huskers Coach,
Connie Yori. Coach, congratulations on a great season. Your comments, please.  
COACH YORI: Well, we're excited to be here. Obviously when we saw the pairings
come out and we were in the Kansas City Regional, we were very excited about
that. Obviously heading to Minneapolis was a good thing for our program in
terms of proximity to our state to get fans to get up there to watch us, and
then getting back here was obviously an important step for our program, and I
understand that we might have a few fans here tomorrow night and hopefully be
on.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH YORI: Our schedule for tomorrow? Is that what you're asking? Well, we're
going to sleep in a little bit, and those guys that need to go to church,
they'll have the option of doing that. And then we're going to be watching
some film throughout the day, and we've got a shoot-around in the afternoon.
So we're going to try to get three meals in in about a six-hour period. I'm
sure our players will enjoy that, especially some of them.  
It's a late game, and that's just the nature of this, and we happened to draw
the late game. It doesn't matter what time we're playing, we're going to play.
It will be a late night, and if we were to win, it's going to be a short
turnaround, but we'll deal with that if that happens to take place.  
  
Q. Have you noticed the similarities between your program this year and
Kentucky's? Both teams have the Conference Player of the Year, the Conference
Coach of the Year. Both teams made great strides from disappointing seasons
last year. It just goes on and on. You would think that would make for a good
match-up.  
COACH YORI: Yeah, there's no question a lot of parallels there. You can go
back a little further. My first year at Nebraska we were picked last in the
Big 12, and we met our expectations that year and actually finished 12th. And
Kentucky this year being picked 11th and being able to finish in second place
in the SEC is just a phenomenal coaching effort and player effort.  
I mean, these guys -- I mean, Kentucky is every bit as athletic as anyone in
the country, and coach has done a great job of getting those guys to play at a
high level, to play with a great passion and a great energy, and you know,
they definitely provide some issues, will provide some issues for us.  
But definitely some parallels there, two teams that got it turned around. But
you know, the thing about us is two years ago we felt like we were on track to
make something special happen in our program and then got hit by the injury
bug. Obviously last year we didn't have the season we wanted to, but at the
same time, you know, injuries are a part of the game.  
  
Q. Connie, beyond the track of the programs at Kentucky and Nebraska and the
similarities you mentioned, do you see any similarities in the way the teams
are built this year between Victoria Dunlap and Kelsey Griffin having some
similar roles in their teams and also the players on the perimeter?  
COACH YORI: Well, Kentucky basically plays four perimeters and Dunlap, and
Dunlap is as athletic a player as there is in the country. She is a phenomenal
athlete and scores in a variety of ways. They definitely provide a lot of
problems for us really on both ends.  
There are some similarities in that both of us do want to get up and down the
floor. I do think it's going to be a fast-paced game. I don't think -- whoever
is operating the shot clock tomorrow night, they could probably have the night
off, because I think it's going to be up and down. That's who we are, that's
who they are, and both of us will be picking up in the full court. They do a
little more in their full court defense than we do, but they're just
phenomenal athletes. They've got great athleticism across the board, great
quickness across the board.  
  
Q. You mentioned kind of earlier in the week maybe some of that pressure is
off a little bit because you got those first two wins in the tournament. Do
you feel like you're playing with house money a little bit this weekend, or is
it that much that the pressure is off?  
COACH YORI: Well, I guess we're going to find out. I feel like there's been a
little bit different level of comfort with our players the last couple days in
practice, and maybe that's partly me. But also I felt like we played a little
bit tight in the first two rounds. We've never been in this situation before,
and so I felt like there was some pressure to get back here to Kansas City.  
Now, obviously I think we've practiced really well the last two days, and I
think that we'll be ready to go, and I think we're well prepared, but it's
just going to come down to how our players are feeling and then it's going to
come down to execution.  
  
Q. I know you're focused on Kentucky and getting your team ready, but I'm
sure you noticed that Baylor won today, beat the No. 1 seed, Tennessee. I'm
just curious on your thoughts on how that makes the Big 12 look, what you
thought about that.  
COACH YORI: Well, we're the No. 1 RPI league in the country, have been the
last three years, Big 12 is the best league in the country top to bottom with
depth. Baylor lost to Missouri this year. Missouri finished 12th in the
league, and you just -- that's just the nature of our league. Everybody in our
league is very, very good. Baylor finishes 9 and 7 and think just knocked off
the No. 1 seed in the country, so what does that say? It says our league is
great. It says our league has tremendous depth. There's great coaching in our
league. There's great players in our league.  
  
Q. Is there any specific ways you can think of that the Big 12 prepares you
for the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH YORI: Yeah, lots of ways. I mean, competition level. We have seen night
in and night out the best competition in the country, and not to say -- take
light of any other league, but from top to bottom, as I said, I think our
league has really prepared us well for playing against just about anybody. And
style of play, I think we're going to see a little bit different style of play
tomorrow night than really anyone that we see in the Big 12. But I think UCLA
helped to prepare us for that a little bit.  
You know, our league, top to bottom, you're going to see a variety of
different defenses, a variety of different offenses. You're going to see just
about anything that you can imagine in basketball in our league, and that's
what also makes our league that much more interesting. I think the ability to
be versatile in the Big 12 I think is important. I think that's one of the
things that makes us -- has enabled us to make the run that we have during our
Big 12 season.  
  
Q. Speaking of UCLA, you guys came out pretty cold against UCLA. Can you
talk about what might have been a factor in that and how you guys plan to not
do that again?  
COACH YORI: Well, UCLA is good. They're a top 25 team. We were the only No. 1
seed that played a top 25 team in that round. They were the best -- a team
that should have been a little bit higher draw or had a little bit higher seed
based on what they had done. You know, bottom line is that they came out and
played with a lot of energy. We didn't handle the pressure early, but then we
settled down, we got poised, and we did a better job of handling it.  
  
Q. Kentucky does a great job of forcing turnovers. I think it's like 10
steals a game or something they're averaging. But coming off the game that
Lindsey Moore had, how important will she be to the game plan and just taking
care of the basketball in general?  
COACH YORI: Yeah, that's an understatement. They do a great job of stealing
the ball. They had 30 steals in their first two NCAA games, so again, you're
talking about a team that's just about as athletic as anybody in the country
and plays small ball and just really provides a lot of problems for you really
on both ends because of that.  
Lindsey has had a great freshman season, and she's played better and better
throughout the year and has really taken control of our team. You know, she's
going to have to do that tomorrow night, as well.  
But also you can't put all the onus on Lindsey. You've got to have other kids
handle the ball. Talking about versatility, we have four ball handlers on the
floor a good portion of the time. The fact that Kelsey has the ability to
handle the ball, Yvonne and 'Nique can both do that for us. Hopefully that
will help us tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Just curious, you mentioned you talked about Victoria Dunlap and what
type of athlete she is. What do you see between her and Kelsey Griffin, how
that match-up will play out tomorrow?  
COACH YORI: Well, I don't know what they're going to do in terms of match-ups
and whether they're going to use her to guard Kelsey or not. I haven't been in
their scouting report sessions. But I do know what we're doing to do, so
you're talking about two very athletic players.  
You're talking about two players that run the floor very well, get easy
baskets in transition in both cases. You're talking about two very good
rebounders. You're talking about two versatile players who can put the ball on
the floor who are both very good defenders. So there are a lot of parallels
there.  
  
Q. Do you think that as much problems as a pressure defense can have on an
offense, do you think it kind of plays into your style of play and that you
can score quickly and create mismatches?  
COACH YORI: Well, you've got to handle the pressure. You've got to handle that
first line of defense and then more so you've got to handle that second line
because I think they do a really good job not in just their first rotation or
first line of defense, but they do a pretty good job in the rotations, as
well. We're going to have to handle the pressure, and if we can do that,
that's what pressure does.  
If you can handle it -- there's a couple different ways you can look at it.
You can handle it and look to attack and try to get easy baskets or you can
handle it and set up your offense. We're going to have to be smart in, first
of all, handling it and then take our moments where we can be aggressive and
then also be smart if we need to pull it out.  
  
Q. A follow-up to the answer you had about Lindsey Moore a few minutes ago.
I know she's proven herself to you all year and you don't really consider her
a freshman 34 games in, but did she do anything in the first couple of rounds
with her poise and especially the way she handled the defense against -- the
UCLA defense that impressed you even more?  
COACH YORI: I watched Lindsey play a lot in high school. My assistants watched
her a ton in high school. We knew we were getting a very good point guard when
she came here to Nebraska. We knew the kind of poise that she showed. We know
the kind of competitor that she is. So what she did in the first two rounds
did not surprise me. I just think that's who she is. I think she's a very
competitive kid who may not make the right play every single time, but she
will learn from her mistakes and then try to correct them.  
  
Q. First game in Kansas City since the only loss of the year. Are you kind
of glad it's not over at Municipal and it's at Sprint?  
COACH YORI: Well, I'll just tell you what, our locker room is a lot nicer than
Municipal. We've got a 60-inch flat screen TV in our locker room right now, so
that's kind of sweet. No, we don't mind playing at Municipal, but obviously
this is a great facility. We're glad to be at the Sprint Center.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season. We'll see you
tomorrow evening. We're now joined by our Nebraska Huskers student athletes,
Kelsey Griffin, Dominique Kelley and Cory Montgomery. We'll take our first
question for the floor.  
  
Q. Cory, have you noticed the similarities and the parallels between your
team and their team? You both have the Conference Coach of the Year, you both
have the Conference Player of the Year, both have under .500 disappointing
seasons last year and this year you're having the best season in program
history. That seems quite a coincidence, isn't it?  
CORY MONTGOMERY: It is. Someone actually pointed it out to me the other day
about all the similarities. There are a lot of similarities. They're a really
versatile team. They love to push the ball, play tough defense, and those are
some of the qualities we use in our game in our style of play. It's kind of
like playing yourself in a way for some of the things that they do, and you
know, they're a tough team and they're going to be a tough opponent.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you talk about the challenges that your backcourt is going
to face against a lineup that a lot of times has four guards on the court and
just if you've seen anything similar to that through the season and what you
expect?  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: Yeah, well, we play in the Big 12 conference, so we're used
to the quickness and the get-up tempo. But they're definitely -- we've seen a
lot of similarities actually in the UCLA game in that they're going to get up,
throw a lot of defenses at us, they're going to pick the ball up in the
backcourt and just pressure us for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Kelsey, can you talk a little bit about Victoria Dunlap and what kind of
problems she poses for you guys?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Definitely. Her athleticism, I know about being a little
undersized so that by no means can't -- that by no means means she won't be
able to score in the low block. She's very quick off the dribble, a versatile
player. So yeah, she's going to pose a lot of problems. But not only that, she
can also get up and defend, as well. She's definitely a focal point.  
  
Q. All the history that's been made this season, now you're 24 hours out.
Can you describe the anticipation?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Yeah, you know, it's great, but at the same time, it's more
than just a game. You know, we're enjoying hanging out. I don't know how long
I'm going to get to hang out with these girls on a day-to-day basis, and so
we're excited about the game. We're ready to play, but at the same time we're
going to make the most of this experience.  
  
Q. Kind of a question for all of you. Last time you guys were in Kansas
City, you lost. Do you have to exorcise a demon at all here or is it just good
to be so close to home?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Well, we don't really look at it as comparing then to now.
We're not even playing in the same building or the same court, you know, so --
I think it just depends on a game-to-game basis. We're going to come in and
we're still going to shoot with confidence and play our game of basketball and
we'll see what happens once game time comes. But we're not playing in the same
arena. We're not looking to the past. We're only focusing on the task at hand.  
  
Q. I know you always want to win, but there's been a couple weeks now and
you've had some other games now since the loss in the Big 12 tournament. Did
it relieve any pressure at all no longer being "undefeated"?   
CORY MONTGOMERY: I think it does. We didn't focus too much on the fact that we
were undefeated. Every opponent is going to give us their best. We have to
prepare and we have to be ready for that. We do have less pressure right now
that we feel, you know, we've gone to the Sweet 16 and we're showing that
we're a good team and we worked hard to get to where we're at. So we're going
to just keep going out and playing Nebraska basketball and keep playing as a
team and doing the things we've been doing all year long.  
  
Q. Dominique, Kentucky has been described as a high-pressure kind of a high-
octane team, but do you think that that type of style can play into the
strengths of your team and that you can score quickly and that you can take
advantage of mismatches and handle adversity?  
DOMINIQUE KELLEY: Well, like Corey said, I think we see a lot of similarities
in our ballclub that they have, as well. I think it's going to just be more
about seeing who can take care of the ball, who can handle the pressure and
always a big focal point for us to rebounding. We feel like if we do those
things, then we'll put ourselves in a good position going into this game.  
  
Q. Kelsey, can you speak to the suggestion that there's less pressure on you
guys now and how exactly that works? It seems like Sweet 16 would be a time
where pressure is kind of heightened?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Yeah, it's true, but the thing about this team is, you know,
after our wins and our losses, we've always gone back to the drawing board. We
know we've made mistakes, and this year has been about continual improvement
and making the most of the opportunities given. So where it may seem more
pressure has been added, we know we've prepared really hard and we've put the
time into the gym, not only in the weeks prior to this but even over the
summer, that you deserve to make the shots because you've worked hard to get
in the gym and make those shots.  
So for us, yeah, there may be pressure, but as far as making history for our
program and things like that, it's just all about the ride. We're just
enjoying the experience.  
  
Q. Kelsey, as it goes with most teams Kentucky is better at home than they
are on the road. Do you expect this to be kind of a home court advantage being
three hours from Lincoln?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: I sure hope so. We have some awesome fans. I believe even
though it's a late night on Sunday, the Nebraska people are just crazy enough
to make it out and pack the gym. So I sure hope it feels like a home court
advantage. However, we're not -- we don't prepare for home games differently
than away games, so that doesn't change the game plan a whole lot. But I know
our fans are amazing, and I'm expecting there to be a lot out there on Sunday.  
  
Q. Can you guys just talk a little bit about Lindsey Moore? Obviously she's
been great all year, but coming off the game she had in the last round, career
high in assists, and especially going up against a team like Kentucky who
turns the ball over, how important is it to have confidence in a young player
like that in how she'll do?  
KELSEY GRIFFIN: Yeah, Lindsey, if you didn't look at the roster, you wouldn't
expect her to be a freshman. She knows the game obviously really well. She's a
smart player. She knows how to play under pressure, doesn't seem to phase her.
I wish I had more years that I could play with her to be honest.  
I'm not expecting anything different or anything less than what she gave,
probably something more, if I know Lindsey at all, for our game against
Kentucky. I think it'll be a challenge. They bring a lot of pressure, but I
know she's more than willing to rise to the occasion.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, thank you all very much. Congratulations on a
great season. Good luck tomorrow night.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're ready to start with the University of Kentucky Wildcats,
Coach Matthew Mitchell. Congratulations on a great season. Your opening
comments.  
COACH MITCHELL: Thank you very much. We are excited to be in Kansas City,
really appreciate the hospitality that's been shown so far. It's been a great
experience up until now, and we are looking forward to getting out on the
floor and practicing today, have a very, very tough opponent in Nebraska. We
have a lot of respect for their team and how they play, so we have a tough
task tomorrow night. But we are looking forward to the challenge and think our
players are ready to get it going.  
  
Q. You had such a great leap forward this year from last year. Was there a
time this season when you began to realize that this could be a really special
year for you and the players?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, it was a gradual thing that happened. It was not an
"aha" moment or something like that. I think that early on we found out that
we had a team that was willing to work extremely hard, and they were able to
sustain that over the course of the season.  
I think our game against Louisville was the first time where I felt like they
were able to execute a game plan, get themselves mentally, emotionally ready
to play. I was impressed by that. So that gave me some confidence in the team
going into conference play. And then we've just had some really good games in
the conference. I think the biggest time for us was a road trip. We beat LSU
on a Thursday night and Mississippi State on a Sunday, and when we did that,
probably solidified it with me that we could be pretty special.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the 9:00 tip and the kind of things you'll have your
players do during the day tomorrow?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we're thrilled to be playing at 9:00 and happy about
that. We have a chance to play one of the best teams in the country, get into
the Elite 8. So whatever time they wanted to set the tip-off is fine with us.  
Tomorrow we will have our normal game day activity. They'll have a little bit
of extra time maybe to rest in the afternoon. We'll encourage them to do that,
but I don't think that's going to play a huge factor.  
I think when you get to this point, certainly we are excited to play, and I'm
sure Nebraska is, and things like that have not really bothered our team very
much this year. We're thrilled for the tip-off, and we're looking forward to
it.  
  
Q. Wondering about your reaction to what just happened on ESPN. I'm sure you
saw Baylor beat Tennessee, and how it may or may not affect your feelings
about this. One, you've got a Big 12 team that beats the SEC champ, but also a
No. 1 seed goes down in the Sweet 16, so just what are your thoughts about
seeing that and its relation to tomorrow night?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we were practicing, so I didn't see it. I feel bad for
Coach Summitt, who gave me a tremendous opportunity to be in this business,
and I feel bad for our conference to lose somebody out of the tournament.  
As it would relate to our game, I don't think it will have much impact. You
know, we have done a great job all year of trying to keep whatever challenge
we have next right in front of us and trying not to think a lot about external
things.  
So I don't think it'll impact our team at all, give us more confidence or less
confidence or more anticipation to play or less. I just think that we have a
pretty focused group, and I think they will put all of their energy into
getting ready to play Kentucky basketball and getting ready for a very, very
good Nebraska team.  
But it's funny, we haven't paid much attention to other people in the
tournament just because that's sort of what we've done all year, just stayed
focused on what we need to do, so I don't have much of a reaction other than I
hate it for Coach Summitt and hate it for the SEC.  
  
Q. Do you have any thoughts on the similarities between your program in this
situation right now and Nebraska's? Both of you are having school-record win
totals. You both have the conference player of the year. Both of you came from
way back from last year, disappointing years last year, to great years this
year. There seems to be a lot of similarities in the two programs right now.  
COACH MITCHELL: I think it makes for one of the most interesting match-ups
we've had in the tournament. I just -- I know how hard our team has worked
this year and how committed they've been, and so I know Nebraska could not be
where they are now had they not had something similar to that.  
So obviously I don't know much about their team or what happens inside their
program, but you just have to know that that's a committed group of young
women that have played very hard and probably didn't listen to a lot of people
outside of the program, and I think that's the great thing of what our kids
did. We were picked 11th, and all we ever told them is we'd never coach them
like they were going to finish 11th; we would coach them in anticipation of
finishing first. So I'm assuming Connie probably had the same type of message
to her group.  
I think it's great when young people can be rewarded for hard work and putting
everything they have into something and not listening to other people and
letting other people define who they are, so I think it's two teams that are a
good example of that.  
As far as on the basketball court, I think there are a lot of similarities.
You know, some of the places where -- I think they're a little bit better
three-point shooting team. We may cause a few turnovers. But other than that
the scoring is pretty close, the points allowed are pretty close. It seems
like it ought to be a heck of a game.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your regard for the Big 12, your level of respect
for the Big 12 as a women's basketball conference, and if there's any common
threads you see that run through those top teams in the league?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, first of all, we have tremendous respect for the Big 12
and think it's a great women's basketball conference. I'm impressed with the
commitment to all the -- that all the schools have made to women's basketball.
That's very impressive to me. It seems like everybody in the league is very
committed to women's basketball being excellent. A lot of great coaches,
similar to the SEC, and a lot of good athletes, real athletic league.  
So I think it's a tremendous test for us to play the champion from the Big 12.
Nebraska proved they were the best team in a great league this year, so we
have a lot of respect for the Big 12.  
  
Q. When you've taken a look at the UCLA game that Nebraska played, do you
see a lot of similarities in how UCLA tried to attack Nebraska with pressure,
tried to disrupt Nebraska with what you've tried to do all year? Are there
similarities or are you really a lot different than UCLA in the way you try to
trap and distract?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, conceptually we probably are similar as far as their
concept is trying to pressure and trying to get you to turn the ball over,
speed you up. We're very different in how we try to do that. They mix their
defenses a lot, and they run a lot of combinations, combination defenses, what
some people call junk defenses, triangle 2, things like that.  
We are a pretty straightforward team, man to man, very little zone. So I don't
think we pull a lot of punches. We're going to just try to play extremely hard
and pretty fundamentally sound man-to-man defense and try to extend that
sometimes, but I didn't see a lot of similarities between us and UCLA.  
  
Q. Just wondering where this team's psyche is right now, where they are
mentally, physically, and how they feel about coming into a big game like
this?  
COACH MITCHELL: I've been real impressed with them. They impressed the heck
out of me against Michigan State with how they handled that situation. I think
they got a lot of confidence from that. So I haven't seen anything that would
concern me. So disinterest, people acting like we've arrived at the place
where we're going to be and that's good enough for them, lack of focus, any of
those things that I might be trying to watch for and be concerned about,
haven't seen it. I've seen a real upbeat, energetic group, extremely focused.
The last three days of preparation have just been outstanding. We had a very
good practice this morning.  
So I'm going in with a lot of confidence, and you know, it's all about what
the players can do at this point mentally. I think the game is going to be won
with which team can execute and really work through adversity and all those
things you have to do in a basketball game.  
We have a tough, tough team to play. The only chance we have is to go out and
give it everything that we have, and from that standpoint, I think they are
there. I think they're mentally there, ready to go out and give a great
effort.  
  
Q. What's your biggest concern with Nebraska and with Kelsey Griffin? Is it
that amazing to see one player coming back and making this kind of impact for
a team?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, first of all, she is amazing. She is an amazing
basketball player. It would be hard for me to be more impressed with someone
than I am with Kelsey Griffin. She gets a lot done just with her physical
strength, her determination, just a really tough player.  
We put together personnel edits so our players can get familiar, and you watch
her, and she takes so much contact at the basket, and a lot of players can do
that, not a lot can finish the way she does with contact. She gets to the line
a ton. She's very, very physical and tough.  
And then you put that on top of a player coming back is extremely impressive.
So you see what a difference that she can make in this team, and basketball is
a funny game; one person can make a huge difference on a basketball team, and
by no means are they just Kelsey Griffin. They have a really good basketball
team. But concerning her, I'm just really, really impressed and would love to
coach someone like that. So that's the highest compliment I could pay her.  
And then the team, what concerns me about Nebraska is just their balance and
the weapons that they have offensively being able to score. When you average
the points that they average and you have four of your starters in double
figures and you have the ability to shoot the three and then a dominant inside
player, it's just an extremely difficult team to play against because a lot of
times you're looking for weaknesses, who can I play off of here, who can I
back off of, who can I -- how can we find a weakness there, and it's hard to
do with them on the offensive end.  
I think we'll have to do a very good job of playing as close to our identity
as we can, trying to make everything for them tough, and that's not going to
be easy to do. They're a fine basketball team.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if they remind you of any teams that you've played, and I'm
also wondering if you've seen other teams attempt to play the kind of ball
pressure that you guys apply.  
COACH MITCHELL: You know, they remind me of really no one specifically in our
conference. They have pieces of teams, but that's what makes them so good.
They just have a little bit of everything.  
So not anybody that just jumps right out at me, but I've watched a lot of
tape, and it's -- they've played obviously some really good teams. It's just a
little -- I'm interested to see what will happen here. This is a great team.
We're going to try to take out of their -- I'm not giving away any secrets
here. I'm sure they understand what we're going to try to do. We're just going
to try to make it really, really tough for them to run things.  
Now, they're so talented, they make us look pretty silly out there trying to
do that. I don't know. We have a lot of respect for them. They're very good.
But we'll certainly try to stick with what has us -- you know, dance with the
one who brung you I guess is what we'll do.  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Good luck tomorrow night.  
We're joined by our two student athletes from Kentucky, A'dia Mathies and
Victoria Dunlap.  
  
Q. Victoria, what are your thoughts on Kelsey Griffin? I'm sure you've seen
film. She's the Big 12 player of the year. You're the SEC player of the year.
What are your thoughts on her?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think she's a great player. She has a variety of ways to
score. She's very mobile at the post with her size, and just has a lot of
threats.  
  
Q. Victoria, would you figure on guarding her quite a bit? I know you
probably will switch around some, but it'll be you two for quite a bit of the
time, wouldn't you think?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Yes, Coach talked about who's going to be guarding her
starting the game.  
  
Q. Victoria, I'm wondering you're going in as the underdogs, I guess,
because you're the lower seed. Is that a role you're comfortable with and kind
of what's your thinking of being the underdog?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think all year we've been the underdog with a lot of games,
but our mentality is just to go in as we're the top dog and not worry about
what they're going to do but what we're going to do as a team. Coach is going
to make sure that our mentality is just go out there, play hard and strong and
not worry about anything else.  
A'DIA MATHIES: Yeah, I think the underdog role, it's less pressure actually. I
think when you just go out there and play Kentucky ball and just be aggressive
and play defense, I think that's going to help us out tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Victoria, have you noticed similarities between the two teams? You both
have made great strides from last year. You both were about .500 last year.
You both have the conference title of the year, you both have the conference
player of the year. You're both having the greatest season in school history
as far as total wins. There's a lot of similarities between you two it seems
like.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Yeah, I guess if you go back and look at all the different
things. But I think one thing that we'll definitely have is just our speed and
our transition play that we'll definitely get out and score a lot of buckets,
and that's just our maybe focus that Coach talked about, just getting out --
that's how we've beat a lot of teams, just getting out in transition and using
our quickness.  
  
Q. A'dia, was there a game this year in which you felt like after the game
in the locker room, the team felt like you had turned a corner and maybe you
were having a more special team than when the season first started?  
A'DIA MATHIES: I think it first started at the Louisville game, especially
since they had lost like five years previous in a row, and made that
turnaround and just a good performance by everybody that game. That really
showed everybody else what kind of season we could have and the season that we
thought we could have.  
  
Q. Victoria, you said this team feeds off of crowd energy and you're not
necessarily going to have a blue crowd the way you did at Freedom Hall. Is
that a concern? And then also, the 10:00 start, Eastern Time start, a concern
when you're trying to play with a lot of energy?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: It would be nice to have a lot of fans here, but whoever is
out there we're still going to feed off them. I know they're going to be loud
and really energetic. That's not something we can focus on as a team. We have
to concentrate on each other's energy and how everybody else is playing as a
team.  
And 10:00, it can be a factor, but we're not going to let it be. Coach says we
can't worry about when we're playing, whether we're playing at 10:00 at night
or 10:00 in the morning, no matter what we've got to come to play.  
  
Q. Victoria, in looking a little bit more at that match-up that you're going
to have with Griffin, can you compare any similarities in the way that the two
of you play? I know you both lead your teams in scoring and rebounding and
seem like pretty athletic post players. What kind of stuff when you watch her
play do you see that looks similar or maybe different to your game?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think similar, we get the ball at the high post. We're both
drivers going to the basket. I've seen a couple times where she's done a
little turnaround jumper in the paint. I guess we just have the versatility of
both of us, just being able to go off the dribble or shoot a pull-up jumper or
outside shot and just having -- the team relies on both of us to score to play
well. That's it.  
  
Q. A'dia, there were a lot of question marks before that Michigan State game
about how you guys were going to handle the game and a bigger team and that
kind of stuff. Did that game give you guys a lot more confidence that you can
play on this national level with some of the best teams?  
A'DIA MATHIES: I believe it did. This showed that we can compete with the
best, and they was a big, physical team. I think the edge factor was our
speed, and we just use our speed to our advantage. That's just the way we
play, and I think that's how we're going to play the next game, too, and I
think that's going to hopefully come out with the same outcome.  
  
Q. Victoria and A'dia, do you guys ever remember starting a game as late as
10:00 Eastern Time?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: In AAU maybe. That's the last time I remember playing late is
in AAU.  
A'DIA MATHIES: We have curfew.  
  
Q. A'dia, you guys don't have any seniors in your starting lineup. You have
one who comes off the bench who played quite a bit or started early in the
year. As a freshman can you talk about your mentality in this NCAA Tournament
when you have not had any experience in this event and just how you think the
team with the experience factor handles this, as well?  
A'DIA MATHIES: We have one starter, Amani Franklin, in our lineup. She's a
senior. But I think just coming out and playing as hard as I can is basically
all I really try to do, because since I haven't been here before, there's
really no pressure or anything really to me. I just go out there and play and
be aggressive like Coach wants me to. I think that really helps us out because
when there's no pressure, you can basically do everything you want to do.  
  
Q. For both of you, Coach talked about he thought the biggest fear for him
because you guys had felt like you had arrived because you were at the Sweet
16. How do you ward off those feelings and those thoughts?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: We just come out from the beginning. First it starts off with
us in practice and then in shoot-around just showing that we are in tune and
mentally focused about what we have to do on offense and defense and then take
that into the game in the beginning and play hard and not let up and not have
any false efforts or anything.  
A'DIA MATHIES: Yeah, I think we just -- we realize that we can go even
farther, that we realize that we haven't just arrived. We're going to make
this year even special-er (laughing). So I think he's keeping our focus and
keeping us grounded and letting us know that even though we have had a good
season, we can be even better, so we're listening to that.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, good luck, have a great game tomorrow, and we'll see
you tomorrow.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Coale has joined us up here at the head table. Coach
Coale, welcome and congratulations on a great season and your comments.  
COACH COALE: Thank you so much. We're honored to be here and excited about the
opportunity that awaits us and excited to be back in Kansas City. It feels
like we just left a day or two ago. Excited to be back here and ready to get
it going.  
  
Q. The last time you played Notre Dame, Whitney had just been injured in the
game before and didn't play. People probably didn't know their roles. How
different are you this time going against Notre Dame?  
COACH COALE: Completely different. You know, I think every team progresses and
changes throughout the course of a season and grows their own identity, but
particularly a team that changes personnel as emphatically as we did at that
point, because Whitney was our -- she and Danielle are really our returning
leaders who had had such experience in the previous season in the Final Four
run.  
Whitney had really become our heartbeat. She had become our identity. Even
last year I thought down the stretch in the NCAA Tournament that we played in
her likeness as a team, took on her personality and her demeanor. So to lose
her and have basically less than 24 hours to recover and play, I'm not sure we
had any idea who we were when we played Notre Dame in the Virgin Islands.  
We're just obviously over the course of the season, we've figured out how to
win games. It's not always pretty, but it's been quite effective, and guys
know the roles and have accepted their responsibilities and have done a
phenomenal job, and I'm really proud of our team. I think the great thing
about it is we're still getting better. We're still learning and improving and
evolving.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, you don't see a lot of rematches at this point. Are
you happy you had the chance to play Notre Dame before or would you rather
come in with a little element of surprise to it?  
COACH COALE: Well, when you play the free conference schedule that we do, we
were bound to play somebody that we had already played before. I don't know
that it matters at all. I think Notre Dame is a different team, and I think
they're better.  
Skylar was so young and trying to figure out what her role was as a freshman
surrounded by all those seniors. Peters didn't play when we met in the Virgin
Islands. So I think we're both different teams than we were at that time.
Maybe a little bit of familiarity, and excited about the opportunity -- we are
anyway, about competing again.  
  
Q. Just trying to get an idea of what difficulties Danielle presents for the
defense. What match-ups are difficult to handle her?  
COACH COALE: Well, Danielle is difficult for a lot of people because of her
quickness, and it's one of those things that's very difficult to judge.
Obviously Notre Dame has seen her before so they understand how fast she is.
It's a combination, she's very fast and she's also very quick, and those two
things together can obviously wreak some havoc.  
Skylar is quick in her own way, too. She's got fantastic hands and is a good
ball handler, as well. I don't know that it'll be necessarily any different of
a challenge than what perhaps Notre Dame has seen from some teams along the
way.  
  
Q. You've got three senior starters. Notre Dame has got a bunch of seniors.
When you've got a bunch of seniors in a game with both teams, how does that
sort of stamp a game at this level?  
COACH COALE: I think it depends on the team and the kids, also. I've seen
seniors try to hard and press and get in their own way, and then I've seen
seniors be so hungry and so unrelenting that they become super human. So I
think it can be an either/or or maybe a combination of. I always think that
underclassmen play a key role down the stretch. I think it's how your younger
guys handle themselves. They tend to play a little truer to who they are and
what they've been throughout the entire year, and if they can maintain that
consistency, I think that's maybe the little slice that sets the team over the
top.  
  
Q. The first game I think Notre Dame had a big run in the second half. Is
their transition game a main point of concern for you?  
COACH COALE: Well, Notre Dame does a very nice job with the ball in
transition. They take opportunities and take full advantage of them. But what
happened in the second half in the Virgin Islands is Danielle got into foul
trouble and we didn't have any idea how to play without her on the floor at
that time. So I don't necessarily -- I just think that situation is completely
different than what we're seeing now. I hope so, anyway.  
  
Q. Going back to the seniors, just talk about how your three seniors have
played here down the stretch as a group. It's been solid these past few
weeks.  
COACH COALE: Yeah, I could not be prouder of Abi, Ny and Amanda. They've been
phenomenal all season long, and the way they practice every day, their work
ethic, their continued willingness to learn, the glue that they've been for
the younger guys in teaching them how to be a team and how to work and how to
have high expectations. And interestingly enough, the three of them, or at
least a combination of two out of the three, have been really, really good
over the last month and a half, and in our game against Arkansas, Little Rock,
none of the three were very good offensively, anyway, against Arkansas, Little
Rock. And the other guys -- well, Abi was really good, I take that back. Abi
was really good in that game.  
When all three of those guys have really been sitting on all cylinders, then
some pretty magical things have happened for our team. I like the way our
three seniors' mindset is right now. I think they have a steadiness and
excitement about them that's really refreshing to see.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH COALE: You know, I assume you're referencing UConn. Okay. I understand
both sides of the argument, I really do. I get both sides of the argument. But
any time a team has done something as phenomenal as the University of
Connecticut has done, it takes not just the basketball world and the sporting
world but the world at large, it takes them by storm.  
And some people who maybe aren't even sports fans pay attention to the fact
that somebody has just done a phenomenal thing. I realize that I've heard Geno
talk about (inaudible), and I agree with that totally. But to a non-sporting
group of people, John Wooden's record has been surpassed, and that's
newsworthy. That's conversation at cocktail parties and at dinner. And if
they're talking about women's basketball, that has to be pretty good for
everybody involved.  
Yes, it's up to all of us to stop that streak and get right up there with them
and create streaks of our own. But at the same time, I think we'd be remiss if
we didn't piggyback on the audience that this is reaching and take advantage
of it.  
Back in the day, and I've said this many times, back in the day when we were
trying to build our program and trying to get a full house (inaudible), and
most of those people kept coming back when Connecticut left because they
wanted to watch Oklahoma. So for all of us to have this opportunity to share
in this broad light that Connecticut has brought on the sport of women's
basketball have an opportunity, and need to look at it as that.  
  
Q. In the game down in the Virgin Islands, you guys went something like
seven minutes without a basket. Do you chalk that up to Danielle not being on
the court?  
COACH COALE: I had no idea we did that. I'm not really surprised. A big reason
why would be Danielle not being on the floor. Again, being in the Virgin
Islands, the thing that was so disrupting was for the past entire year our
entire backcourt had been Whitney Hand and Danielle Robinson. Whitney and
Danielle were always on the floor. I can't think of a time when one of those
guys wasn't on the floor. So when you don't have Whitney in uniform and then
Danielle is in foul trouble so we don't have either one of them, we're just
trying to figure out how to get from point A to point B, so I'm not sure the
comparison is really relevant.  
  
Q. What do you expect out of the crowd in terms of support for each other?
Is there a chance if the Big Reds get together they can create a home court
advantage?  
COACH COALE: Well, I thought Nebraska fans were phenomenal. I remember
preparing for our game in the semifinal and being in the locker room, and I
could tell immediately, I didn't need to know the score and what was happening
because of the roar in the arena at Municipal. They turn out in record numbers
in Lincoln, and I expect they'll be here in record numbers, as well. What
we're hoping for is a little Big 12 love in the arena tomorrow night and we'll
figure it out on Tuesday if we're fortunate enough tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You made the comment prior to the Big 12 conference tournament that your
team would love -- maybe not you personally, but your team made the comment
that you'd love another crack at Nebraska, perhaps they might get one. You
also get another crack at Notre Dame here, and as you were just asked, playing
here in Kansas City where Oklahoma has had some success in the past, do you
see that as an advantage in your opening game with Notre Dame tomorrow?  
COACH COALE: You know, in a way I do, but I think we as coaches can look at
every situation, find an advantage in it if we try hard enough, and I think
the advantage here is the mindset.  
I think our kids feel comfortable here in Kansas City. I think we feel like we
left some business unfinished in the Big 12 tournament, and I'm sure Nebraska
shares that sentiment, as well. I think when you go through the NCAA
tournament, if you can find ways to get a mental edge, it doesn't even matter
if it's real. What matters is if your kids buy into it, and I think our guys
feel really comfortable about playing in the city.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about the balance that Notre Dame has
and maybe the problems that Skylar Diggins presents?  
COACH COALE: As I mentioned earlier, very, very efficient basketball team.
They share the ball well. They pass the ball well. They move without the ball
very well. I think, too, that their big guys, the fact that they can rotate so
many in, they have a very deep bench and very capable players who come in and
spell one another with really very little dropoff; on the guard play, the same
way.  
I think Skylar has just continued to assert herself, and the complexion of
their team has changed as her confidence and her comfort level has improved. I
don't think there's any doubt about it when you watch them play, it's Skylar's
team.  
  
Q. For Danielle, Coach talked a lot about losing Whitney and right before
the last game and how you've since rediscovered your identity. How
specifically did you guys kind of figure out who you were through the course
of the season?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: It started with her challenging us when we got back from
the Virgin Islands to step up that much more, each person individually, to
make up for the presence that Whitney had displayed on the floor.  
It was just about us maturing, though, night in and night out and every day in
practice.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about the match-up with Skylar Diggins?
I'm sure that as a true freshman she's changed since you last played her. But
talk about what you see and how her game has changed but also how your game
has changed since then.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Skylar is a great player, and she's done some great things
at Notre Dame so far as a freshman. You can just tell that her confidence
level is so much greater now, especially on the defensive end. I mean, that
really creates a lot of easy points for her, a lot of transition lay-ups.  
I guess you can say being a junior also pays dividends just because you've had
the experience and you've been here a couple times before.  
  
Q. Just looking at Notre Dame, a guard-based team, Danielle, how do you
approach a team like that and deal with the -- between the Skylar and Barlow
and Schrader and that whole group?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: We just have to play hard on the defensive end. Barlow is a
great shooter. Melissa does some great things at the point guard position, and
Skylar, of course, is pretty much all-around. So it's about guarding one-on-
one, really, and guarding as a unit on top of that.  
  
Q. Danielle, does Skylar remind you of yourself when you were a freshman?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Yeah, a little bit, except she's left-handed and I'm not.
But definitely. You can just tell over the course of a season how you've grown
and matured, and she's definitely done that.  
  
Q. I'm going to make Amanda talk. How exciting is it to have a chance to
settle some scores with some people, playing Notre Dame a second time, might
get a chance to play Nebraska again?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I think it's exciting, and it's good for women's basketball
in general. We've played them several times. I mean, a couple years ago we
played them in the same kind of tournament, and it's kind of like payback.  
  
Q. This is a question actually for both of you, but I'll start with Amanda
since, Danielle, you've had the spotlight most of the time here. I believe
this is your fourth trip in the last five years to the Sweet 16, and of course
you've been even further than that over that time. All of that time, those
last four years, were with the Paris sisters and others. What's it going to be
like this time as you come into this tournament without Courtney and Ashley?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: You'll just see a different team. We won't rely so much on
the post, and we have strength in all positions. You'll see a little bit of
transition, a little bit of defense, a little bit of offensive execution, and
just playing basketball. When you can dominate all those parts of the game,
that's how you go far.  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Like Amanda talked about, we're just a different team. I
guess we're more guard-oriented this year than anything, but we have
experience, and that's what we're going to have to use to win some games here
in Kansas City.  
  
Q. For both players, when you look back at the game in the Virgin Islands,
what jumps out at you about either how you played or how they played?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: To be honest, we played horrible. I wasn't going to say --
yeah, it was pretty bad. We didn't have any kind of effort at all. I mean, you
can give some of it -- we were kind of in shock that Whitney wasn't out there,
I mean, on the first game back, but we just played with no life, really.  
AMANDA THOMPSON: We just were a different team. I feel like we just -- she
said it earlier, we were in shock, and we didn't know how to make the
adjustment so quickly. We've learned a lot since then, and we took a lot more
pride in our effort and our toughness, and you can see that. We've seen that
over the last couple months.  
  
Q. Amanda, can you talk about the defense in last weekend's games down in
Norman?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: You know, our defense was pretty good. Our defense was pretty
good. We made key stops and we took a little pride in getting scored on or
just playing together, not just one-on-one, you know, helping each other and
blocking out and doing all the little things that count. Now we just need to
make that on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Danielle, you mentioned that Notre Dame game after Whitney's injury, and
you had foul trouble. Was that you trying to find a place and sort of figure
out what you needed to do, or can you just talk a little bit about that?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: Some of it was just dumb decisions. I mean, one of the
fouls I guess I ran over Schrader trying to get through a screen. It just
wasn't smart plays. Some were fouling in transition. So I guess it could be
out of frustration, could have been out of frustration. But as far as that I
know I need to stay on the floor, and since that game I've made a ton of
adjustments.  
  
Q. Amanda, could you talk about how you and your two fellow seniors have
played here the last few weeks? It's almost as if you don't want your college
careers to end?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Not at all. We're trying to make it to the end, to the very
end. We've worked a lot over the past couple years just developing our game
altogether, and I think it would mean the world to us and our teammates if we
make it to the last game. It would just be fun. You work so hard all year to
be at this point, and it's always nice to go out with a bang.  
  
Q. Danielle, did you run into Skylar at all before you played here? Was
there any USA Basketball experiences where you guys might have crossed
paths?  
DANIELLE ROBINSON: I've never played against her. I've been in Colorado
Springs with her this past summer when she was trying out for the U19 team and
I was trying out for the World University Games team. Even then I didn't
really get a chance to watch her play because we were on two different
schedules, and when they were practicing we had free time to eat and take a
nap, so it was different things like that.  
The only time I really talked to her was in the Virgin Islands after the game.  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, ladies, we're going to let you go. Thank you very much.
Best of luck tomorrow, and we'll see you tomorrow evening.

_KANSAS CITY, MISSOURI_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with the University of Notre Dame. Coach
Muffet McGraw is here, and, Coach, welcome to Kansas City and the second
round. You said you didn't care to make any comment; is that correct? We'll
just start with questions?  
COACH McGRAW: That's good.  
  
Q. There was a lot of talk with Oklahoma about how they have changed since
the last time you guys have faced each other. How have you guys changed since
late November?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, it was a long time ago, seems like a long time ago. You
know, I thought we played very well at the Paradise Jam. That was a great
tournament and great to see so many of those teams in the Sweet 16. I think
we've played a lot of people and at that time we were still trying different
combinations and we're still playing all those same people.  
I think we've gotten a little bit better just playing together all this time.
We've been tested a lot in a lot of different ways, seen a lot of different
things, and I'm really happy with the way we're playing right now.  
  
Q. How do you deal with the match-up with Danielle Robinson in terms of a
scouting report on what she does best, and how do you counteract that?  
COACH McGRAW: I don't know if you can counteract that. She's got incredible
speed. She is -- she played very well against us last time we played. She's
very hard to contain. You don't see people getting up in the backcourt and
trying to pressure her. I think people have just too much respect for her
speed. I think she's definitely a challenge for our defense.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how your bench will play a role in this game?  
COACH McGRAW: Well, our bench has been outstanding throughout the Big East
Tournament and the first two rounds. They've actually been leading us in
scoring on a couple of occasions, which is great to see. It's nice to have
that depth. We don't have to worry so much about foul trouble, and we can
really keep the pressure on defensively while we're resting some of our
starters.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how Skylar has improved even since the
last time you guys played Oklahoma, which was so early in her college
career?  
COACH McGRAW: She's had a great year. She has been -- done so many great
things for us. She's really changed our team probably defensively more than
anything. I think she sets the tone for our defense. She gets up and pressures
the ball really well. She's a great passer. She's had over 100 assists this
year. For a freshman that's not even playing the point, I think that's
outstanding.  
She does so many little things, intangible things. She's got the intensity,
the drive, the focus, the sense of urgency that you would think only your
seniors might have. So I think that she's really -- she's played well all year
long. She's been our leading scorer in almost every situation.  
You know, you look at our wins, losses, Big East Tournament, NCAA Tournament,
she's the leading scorer, something we didn't really expect from a freshman.
I'm so pleased with the way she's played all year long, and she's been very
consistent for us and continues to play well.  
  
Q. You didn't have Devereaux Peters the first time you faced Oklahoma. How
might she impact the game?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I think rebounding is going to be a big key, and
that's something that we hope Devereaux can do for us. We as a team, we just
need to rebound a lot better, and we'd like her in there because she is
somebody that can really go get the ball.  
But I think overall, all of us need to rebound better. She can help us do
that.  
  
Q. During your time in South Bend, your program has had so many
transformative players I guess you could say. Oklahoma is playing its first
season without a couple pretty transformative ones in Courtney and Ashley
Paris. Can you talk about from your perspective that carryover you've seen
from year to year, you lose a Ruth Riley, for example, how that carries over
and just sort of what you've seen over the years with that?  
COACH McGRAW: You know, I think that your program develops an attitude of
winning, and no matter who you have in the program, somebody is going to pick
up that attitude. And it's just generated from your best players, but it
really does transcend down to everybody on the team.  
You go through stretches where -- we missed Ruth Riley for quite a few years
after she left. She was really probably the best player ever to play at Notre
Dame. But we have had some very good ones, and I think Skylar is that type of
player for us now.  
But I think every program you go through those stages, and I think Oklahoma,
just what a fantastic year after losing two great players, they have really --
and without Whitney Hand, they have had just a sensational season.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could, what advice would you offer to Nebraska or Kentucky,
their coaching staff? You just talked about developing that tradition of
winning. These two programs didn't have any transition, this year they're in
the Sweet 16. Just what kind of advice would you give them?  
COACH McGRAW: It sounds like she should be giving advice to me. She's the No.
1 seed. I think they've had a great year. You look at seniors, and it's all
about the seniors. They're the ones, every good team we've had in the Final
Four has been senior dominated, and they've been able to just take our program
to places we've never been before, and I think once you get that tradition
started, you hope that the younger players pick up on it and just continue to
understand what it took to get there, and there's so much hard work, and that
next year they can't rest because people are going to be coming after them
without those seniors on the floor.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about the rivalry with Oklahoma? You've
played them a couple of times here, and they've been great games with a lot on
the line.  
COACH McGRAW: Well, they're a great team, and any time you play a great team,
it's going to be a big game. It's going to be an exciting game when you have
two guards like Danielle Robinson and Skylar Diggins on the same floor. It's a
lot of excitement every time they get the ball. I think the fans are going to
be on the edge of their seats, and hopefully it'll be a great game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Danielle Robinson and the unique problems she
presents?  
COACH McGRAW: Just her speed I think is something that you just don't see very
often. She's so good with the ball. She can go either way. She's got a great
jumper. You don't want to foul her because she's a great free throw shooter.
She can get to the rim really easily, and she's a good passer. She's got a lot
of assists. She's got a lot of steals. She's aggressive defensively. She's
that kind of an electric player, and you can see how the team really feeds off
of her.  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by the University of Notre Dame Fighting Irish
student athletes, Skylar Diggins, Ashley Barlow, and Becca Bruszewski. Ladies,
we're going to take questions from the floor.  
  
Q. Skylar, can you talk about Danielle Robinson and just how challenging of
a match-up she is?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Well, Danielle, she's a great point guard. She's very
athletic, very quick, and is definitely -- she poses as a problem for a lot of
defenders because she can get to the basket so well. She's great in
transition. She does a good job finding her teammates, and her mid-range can
also be dangerous.  
So I think just definitely trying to keep her in front, and it's going to be a
total team effort with that, and just kind of trying to slow them down in
transition.  
  
Q. For Ashley and Becca, for a team that's as veteran as you guys, what's it
like to have a freshman step in and play the way Skylar has played in
season?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: It's good for us. We need somebody to step up like that. It's
like our whole team, we've got people that can score, we've got people that
can defend. We've got a whole team of starters basically, so it's pretty good
that she can step in and pretty much do that.  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: She came out with a lot of confidence, really stepped in,
knew her role. She came into the game giving exactly what we needed. I mean,
for her just to add everything that we have to the team already, it's great.  
  
Q. Becca, can you talk about how the post position has developed for this
team through the course of the season and how your depth can affect other
teams?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: Well, we're not the original post players like big presence
inside, but we're quick, we're mobile, we're agile, so we use that to our
strength. The first game against UConn we really didn't have a post presence
inside. So the second and third we tried to pick it up, take them off the
dribble, stuff like that, and that seemed to work pretty well for us, so we're
going to go with that same attack this game.  
  
Q. Ashley, when you're dealing with somebody that quick as Danielle, what's
the philosophy? What's the big picture guard approach to that type of match-
up?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: I guess it's just trying to keep her in front. You've got to
try and just stay with her and not get too close up on her because if you do,
she's good at getting around you and finding other people on the block, and
her other teammates on the wing and things like that. We've just got to keep
her in front and not let her get going. We can't let her get confidence early.
We've got to stay on her from the opening tip.  
  
Q. Ashley, when you look back at the Virgin Islands games, what are your
memories of that, and when you look at the tape of it, what jumps out at you
about either your team or Oklahoma?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: I guess it would be that we were -- we were both different
teams, so that was at the beginning of the season. They got out in transition
on us. We made some big shots in that game. And I guess it's just the whole
thing that we're different teams right now. We're playing better. We're in
tournament mode. We know that this could be our last game, so we're just going
to go out there and continue to play the way that we've been playing all
season, and hopefully we can get our defense going first and get some
offensive things going, as well.  
  
Q. Skylar, since you guys have played in Storrs and Hartford, does that help
when you step into Big 12 country to play in what might be a hostile
environment for you?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: I believe so. Definitely the loudest atmosphere I've played in
would be Storrs and Hartford. But I think it's just a matter of just really
going in with the mindset that you're here with your team. You really try to
stay focused into the game and really not let the crowd get too involved or
affect you too much.  
  
Q. Becca, when you look at Oklahoma's post play now and recent game tapes
versus when they played you the first time, do you see a difference in
improvement there with Olajuwon and McFarland?  
BECCA BRUSZEWSKI: Yeah, she's definitely more comfortable going with either
hand in the post, so before it was easy -- it was better just to jump out to
her left side, but she's more versatile now going right and left, so she's
definitely going to be a post presence inside.  
  
Q. Ashley, you guys played Oklahoma a couple of years ago down at Purdue,
played them in the Paradise Jam. Can you talk about how these two programs
have kind of created a nice rivalry between each other?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: Yeah, I guess it's -- other people putting us together in these
situations, I guess. But we're both taking care of business when we get in our
respective games. So I guess it's been a good rivalry, and we've tried to pick
up the slack a couple years and this year, and we're just going after it, and
I guess it's a good run to kind of be a part of.  
  
Q. For Skylar and for Ashley, everyone talks about Danielle Robinson as a
tough match-up, but Amanda Thompson has got a unique set of skills, as well.
Talk about how you defend her.  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: Well, she's a great offensive rebounder. She's a great
rebounder. She's a match-up problem for lots of people because she's just so
big and so athletic. I guess you've got to approach her with just staying in
front of her and keeping her in front of you, as well, and boxing her out
would be a big key for us.  
ASHLEY BARLOW: And I think she's also developed her skills offensively as far
as her mid-range shot and now she's backing up to the three-point line, and
she's definitely developed there over the years. She's definitely a threat,
not only back to the basket or crashing but also in the mid-range game now.  
  
Q. I've got a question for you, ladies. Ashley, you're a senior. What do you
tell Skylar about what to expect in this round of games?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: You've just got to tell her to go out there and do what she's
been doing the whole season. We can't change what we've been doing all year
just for this one game. We've just got to go out and continue to play our
game, and I think we've been doing that pretty well the first couple of
rounds.  
  
Q. Skylar, I've got a question for you. As a freshman, did you think you
were going to go this far?  
SKYLAR DIGGINS: You know, I actually did. I think this team did. We've had
high expectations for ourselves since the first day of practice, so I mean,
just -- I knew it from the kind of heart that this team shows and how we push
each other in practice and really go after each other. I mean, it gets pretty
competitive in practice. We just all want to see each other do well. The fact
that we've come together and we know each other's games so well now, we're
playing -- we're kind of hitting on all cylinders now. We're playing some of
our best basketball, so hopefully that momentum just carries over into these
next couple rounds, particularly tomorrow.  
  
Q. For Ashley, you have a senior laden team. Oklahoma has three significant
seniors. When you get to this point in your career, one loss and it's over, do
you see this kind of being a battle of wills, who wants to keep their careers
going tomorrow night?  
ASHLEY BARLOW: Yeah, we've just got to know this could be our last game and
give 110 percent out there. It could be a battle of wills, who wants it more,
so we've just got to go out there and competing to the best of our abilities
like we've been doing the first couple rounds.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on a great season, and we'll see you
tomorrow evening.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  70  
Kentucky - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: We now have Kentucky. We'll take an opening comment from coach.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, want to congratulation Tennessee. They certainly played
a great game today. Made a lot of great plays. I just thought they played
really tough.  
We came here to win and came up a little short today. But I thought our
players battled against a really fine basketball team today, and I thought we
found out a lot about our team.  
One thing I do know is they wanted to win today, and it certainly showed out
there on the court. They played awful hard.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. They brought Williams off the bench. She had eight straight points for
them. Address that.  
COACH MITCHELL: Yeah, that was one of the few times in the game when we were
very poor defensively. That's what happens in these kinds of games. There's
two good teams going at it, and our margin for error is very slim.  
We did not need to let something like that happen. I thought she was
fantastic. Did not do a good job with her. She was able to get in there, get
into the lane, make some shots.  
But she's a good player. I thought she had some nice shot fakes and got us out
of position. I think she's a good player. That was a big, big run in the game.  
  
Q. Were you ever surprised that you got the momentum going your way? It
didn't really seem to phase them. They always knew how to come back. Is that
something you were expecting out of them?  
COACH MITCHELL: That Tennessee was able to respond? That was not a surprise to
me. They're a very good basketball team. They've lost two games all season.
They have a lot of experience in this situation. So I was not surprised by
that.  
I was more encouraged by how we responded. We were down eight in the first
half. Things were not looking good. I thought our players responded. So that's
what I was really happy with.  
To come out in the second half and play the way they did, made some really
fine plays in the start of the second half. I was encouraged with some things
that happened with our team today.  
  
Q. I know you didn't have the showing you wanted in Knoxville. Is this more
what you expected from them? I know it's a loss, but does it give you momentum
going forward into the NCAA tournament?  
COACH MITCHELL: I think what you need to do in these situations is you need to
figure out how to build on the victories you have in this tournament, and then
you need to figure out how to build on the mistakes you made. That's what we
just talked about.  
We played some very good basketball in this tournament. We played very tough.
We had kids play a lot of minutes. I just thought they performed at a real
high level for three straight days in what I think is one of the toughest
tournaments in the country.  
There's no question from my perspective right now, there's plenty that we can
build on. You have to understand, Tennessee did the same thing. We just got
done. These two teams just got done playing nine straight weekends of SEC
basketball. There's probably not two teams that are going to benefit more from
the time off because we didn't have that -- our bye came on the first playing
date.  
I just told our team back there, I think we will benefit tremendously, and I
think we'll be a very difficult team to play against in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Is it strange to have to wait a week?  
COACH MITCHELL: It's good for us; great for us. We need it badly. It will be
outstanding for us, help us get refreshed.  
I want to make this point: I'm so proud of our players for being able to -- we
finished the regular season on a real down note. We are not the healthiest
basketball team right now, and they found a way to come in here and really
play with tremendous energy three days in a row.  
So that's what I'm more excited about than anything, that their mindset was
able to come in and play at a championship level.  
  
Q. Victoria, could you talk about how physical it was inside.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: It was pretty physical out there. That's the kind of team
that's going to come in there and go hard to the boards. I think mentally we
weren't ready to really box them out. They got in there, got a couple boards
in the first half, and just mentally, as a team, we weren't able to box 'em
out, push 'em back, so they got a lot of rebounds, a lot of put-backs, but I
think we turned it around in the second half.  
  
Q. Brittany Henderson gave you some good really minutes today. Can you
discuss her play.  
COACH MITCHELL: I thought she did a fantastic job. We gave up 12 offensive
boards in the first half, four in the second half. So that's something that we
talked about at halftime. Brittany Henderson got in there and got some tough,
tough rebounds. I just am always impressed with her. She is a gritty player.  
We didn't have much going on the offensive boards. She had a big offensive
board and put-back that was a big play in the game.  
I like our team. I'm telling you. I like the character of these young women. I
like the tenacity they play with. She just embodies what we're trying to be
here at Kentucky. That's honesty, hard work, discipline. I was very pleased
with Brittany Henderson today.  
  
Q. For the players, can you reflect on how far you've come from a 500 finish
a year ago, and what has this week showed you about what you can expect from
yourself in the NCAA tournament?  
A'DIA MATHIES: Well, I wasn't here last year, so I can't really tell you how
it feels to be on a 500 ballclub. But I know this team we have this year, we
love each other. We're really looking forward to making a deep run into the
NCAA tournament coming up.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think compared to last year and the year before that, the
team chemistry wasn't really there. We had a lot of individuals doing their
own thing.  
This year people were willing to put in the time, put in the work, listen to
the coaches, be willing to play defense and get all the fundamentals right and
not worry about what they're doing personally. Just as a team we got together.  
I'm very proud of the team, of how we played in this tournament. Like A'dia
said, I think we're going to do a great job in the NCAA tournament and be
ready to go.  
  
Q. When you got down by seven or eight, it looked like it was over; you kept
going at them and cut it close. Can you talk about the not-quit mindset you
had.  
A'DIA MATHIES: We know every team makes runs. They made a run. We tried to
come back with another run. We knew we had to step it up on defense. That was
the only way we would be able to come back in the game. So we just tried to
make everything more aggressive, more tough, and just be ready mentally and
physically.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about Tennessee being the marquee program in the
SEC. What do you feel like you have to do in the future to continue to take
this program up?  
COACH MITCHELL: We just have made tremendous progress. Tennessee has a great
program. We have a lot of respect for their program.  
We talked today about, you know, what's Kentucky about and what do we want to
be about. You know, I think you see out there players that play very
aggressively, players that are willing to make some sacrifices for each other
and play hard together, and I think we just need to continue to do that.  
We need to continue to find the right kind of people to come in and understand
how special the opportunity is to play at Kentucky.  
Really encouraged with what the team is doing right now. We have a long way to
go this year. This season's not over, but the SEC portion is. It is time to
look back. They performed well. So we just need to stick to our core
principles: hard work, honesty. These kids hear this every day. I think if we
do that, we have a great chance to be successful.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Victoria and A'dia with big pressure coming on them
and they came in and performed and responded so well.  
COACH MITCHELL: It was really tremendous. First of all, when they received the
awards, it could not have gone to two better players, better people. So I was
not worried about those two being affected in a negative way at all, thinking
this was an individual award or anything like that. They are about the right
things.  
What I did want to happen was us to bounce back from a very unusual week that
we had had. I talked to both of them at different times about how important it
is to step up at this time. This is an incredibly difficult tournament.  
So you have to realize after watching them how proud I would be as a coach to
have the real good fortune of coaching both of them. They're tremendous
defenders. They are selfless, hard workers. You know, I don't know that there
are any doubts about their selections.  
But I think in front of the entire SEC and country, people can know both of
those players are the real deal.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  70  
Kentucky - 62

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Tennessee Coach Summitt and student-athletes.
We'll take an opening comment from Coach Summitt.  
COACH SUMMITT: What a game. Obviously it was hard-fought by both teams. I've
known Matthew for a long time. He worked my camp. He was a GI in our program.
I just kind of watched him grow as a coach. He has done an incredible job at
Kentucky.  
They have a toughness and are very relentless on the defensive end and on the
boards. So we knew we were going to have a real battle.  
Pleased with how our team never gave up. I thought we kept our composure for
the most part. We had some obviously players step up and make big plays.
Shekinna Stricklen was obviously the best player on the court, in my opinion.
It's just great to see her progress as a freshman, and now as a sophomore to
have the maturity and provide leadership. I thought she was a big difference-
maker.  
Obviously a lot of people stepped up. I thought Glory really stepped up for
us, as well. Kelley gave us some good minutes. All in all, Angie, it didn't
matter whether her shot fell in or not, she still stayed in the game and I
thought did a lot of good things for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Shekinna, I thought the team, especially yourself, played with so much
emotion, playing off the crowd, helping the crowd get fired up. Can you talk
about your emotions tonight and exactly this was a big game for you guys.  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: I think everyone was excited about this game. We all
worked so hard to get here. We felt like we were -- let's don't go home
without winning. We all just played through fatigue. We just encouraged each
other.  
We knew the only way we were going to win this game, we had to stick together,
and that's what we did.  
  
Q. Can you talk about this is a very different Kentucky team than when you
saw them down in Knoxville. Is this what you expected, or did they catch you
off guard?  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: I thought Kentucky did an excellent job of just putting the
pressure on us. You know, they really came out trapping and just very
aggressive. You know, I give them a lot of credit, because they didn't give up
the whole game. They fought all the way till the end. That's the sign of a
great team.  
I thought that's what our team did also. But, like I said, I thought they
really fought till the end and did a great job.  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: Going into the game, I didn't think it was going to be an
easy game. I knew they was going to go all the way to the end of a 40-minute
game. Kentucky is a great team. They play great defense. Sometimes they kind
of made us rush.  
But they're really great. But I'm very happy for me and my teammates. We stuck
together and we came out on top.  
ALYSSIA BREWER: Our assistant coacher, Dean Lockwood, he informed us before
the game they were going to be a completely different team, like the games
they had played before us. That's what they showed us tonight.  
Like they said, I'm just proud of our team for hanging with them like that and
being the ones on top in the end.  
  
Q. Angie, I was going to give you an opportunity to critique your coach. I
was wondering your review of her postgame song.  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: I've her Rocky Top from her once or twice, and it's great
every time. I didn't expect her to go -- I thought she was just going to say,
Thank you, fans, for coming out. Like she said, we have the best fans in the
country, hands down. They were awesome tonight.  
When she started singing, I just looked at our team and I started laughing.
It's great.  
  
Q. Talk about tournament MVP. Seems like the last month or so you've come a
long way.  
ALYSSIA BREWER: I was definitely shocked to be given this award, because I
feel as if there are other players on the team that deserve it more than I do.  
But, I mean, I wouldn't even have it without my teammates. Team MVP, they
should have that. I'm just going to stick it on the locker room and stay it's
the whole team. Because like I say, without them I wouldn't have got it.  
  
Q. Angie, as the junior, as the leader of this team, it's been documented
Kamiko has had a tough time this year. You see what she does tonight. What
does that mean to you?  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: I was so proud of Kamiko, how she responded. Coach got on her
a little bit last night.  
COACH SUMMITT: Most every day.  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: Most every day (laughter).  
Just how she responded, especially such a quick turnaround. She came in ready
to go. She attacked. She was being the scorer and doing what she does best,
and that's scoring.  
At the same time, she was playing great defense. You know, we all kind of gave
her a little talk after last night's game. I think that helped her. But it was
really just her coming in focused and having a whole different mindset, which
she plays like that, you know, it will help Strick out, the guards, our whole
team. So I was proud of her.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, players.  
We'll now take questions for Coach Summitt.  
COACH SUMMITT: Before we do, there's one thing that I'll tell you about
Kamiko. My son, Tyler, is obviously one of our practice guys. He came to me
last night, he said, You don't have to worry about Kamiko not playing hard
tomorrow and not being ready.  
I said, Really? He said, I spent an hour and a half with her. So I give Tyler
the credit. Coach Tyler Summit. So I'm not even gonna coach Kamiko anymore.
I'm gonna let my son do all the talking.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Pat, how would you compare this team in terms of balance to other teams
you've had?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, obviously we've had a lot of great teams. I think this
team, they rely on each other, not one or two go-to players. How about Candace
Parker on our team. We've got a really good inside game.  
If you look across the country, I don't know of anyone that's got bigger or
better size in the postgame. So with that said, we're just trying to get our
guard play as efficient as we can.  
I thought when the game opened up, we were on our heels, on our toes. A little
slowing down in transition. But once we got to halftime, I thought the
adjustments were really good and that they committed to our defense. We ran
some switching defenses, which I thought helped us keep people in front of us.  
But this group, they got a pretty good basketball IQ. I like that about them.
They're also invested. We can go back to the Ball State loss, which haunts me
daily, but it's also been a tremendous motivation for our entire team and
program.  
  
Q. Seemed like your offense really got going. You were down by two. You came
out of a timeout and got committed to getting it into Cain. She got a couple
of baskets. Was that something that you kind of tell them, We need to get into
the post?  
COACH SUMMITT: Oh, absolutely, absolutely. We are constantly trying to get the
ball inside to Kelley. Typically, she'll bring two defenders with her. I think
that she's done a good job. Look, she understands paint points. You know,
she's not going and posting up outside the lane. If she can establish and get
the ball at the rim, she is really, really very efficient.  
You know, tonight they bumped us some, kept her out from time to time, but she
just kept working. With her touches, she got some good things going.  
  
Q. I think it was after the South Carolina game you almost laughed at the
notion that your squad could get to San Antonio. What about now?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, it's a go. We got to get better all the time. Hope
they're not satisfied because they've had success in the regular season. You
know, only had two losses. But right now I think they're very committed and
very excited.  
The thing about it, they play well together. There's no dissension in our
team. There's no one jealous of anybody else. They're all committed to playing
well together. They're coaching themselves. I mean, on the floor it's amazing
to listen to their communication. It's not just Stricklen. It's Angie, it's
Kelley, it's Glory. It's across the board.  
I think that has been something that has allowed them to really get on each
other and also to motivate each other throughout a game.  
  
Q. How different was this Kentucky team than the one you saw in Knoxville?  
COACH SUMMITT: Oh, a different level, a real different level. I was like, this
is not the Kentucky team that I expected to see. That's what we told them
today. Guess what, get ready to have the best shot ever coming at you this
season. I said, I know Matthew; I know his staff. They have a toughness. They
didn't give up on anything.  
And I said, We're going to have to -- ball security was one of my biggest
concerns, because they really do get up in your grille and can turn you over.  
So with that said, you know, I was very pleased that we managed to get out of
it with a win.  
  
Q. Was this week all about the SEC and the goal of sweeping both titles, or
did you tell your team they needed to win this week to have a No. 1 seed in
the NCAAs?  
COACH SUMMITT: I told them we needed this tonight to make sure we got a No. 1
seed. We talked about that even during the game. We're not losing the No. 1
seed. If we do, I can tell you, it's not going to be good for us.  
But, you know, with that said, our focus was obviously on execution.  
  
Q. Free throws were big. You didn't shoot them well yesterday. May have been
the one thing that really didn't go your way. Today, 15 of the first 16 in a
tight game. Did you talk to them about that in between the two games or is
that a rollercoaster?  
COACH SUMMITT: No, but when we came in to practice, we just walked through
some sets. They spent the rest of the time shooting free throws, getting
focused. That's what it's all about.  
  
Q. I noticed in the start of the second half, you seemed to put a player in
each corner. Was that something conscious to break their pressure on your
players?  
COACH SUMMITT: Yes. We do that a lot because then they got to decide, are they
going to send players back or are they going to try to press us and take a
risk. So that's something we've been doing for a number of years.  
I think it's really forced teams to figure out what they want to do, make them
have to bring their defense back as well. That opens up the floor.  
  
Q. Just the idea that to Kamiko played a prominent role today, and two other
players, Brewer and Manning, who weren't starters to start the season, made
the all-tournament team. What does that say about this team?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think it says that we've obviously matured a lot on and
off the court. I think they understand they got to make time to get in the gym
and get in their reps.  
You know, I feel like we've got more players invested. They're working on
their game, and they're very serious about improving their skill set.  
I think that has made a change for our team.  
  
Q. Give you a chance to comment on the song. Did you make a promise to your
players if they won you would do that?  
COACH SUMMITT: I did that for the fans. I know I don't have a great voice. But
our fans love Rocky Top. The fact we had so many of them here, I just went
over, got the microphone and sang Rocky Top.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
COACH SUMMITT: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Kentucky - 76  
Mississippi State - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: Now joining us from Mississippi State, head Coach Fanning-Otis
and student-athletes. Coach, if you could make an opening comment, then we'll
take questions.  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: I feel like our team was ready to play. You know, a couple
of turnovers early and the game was going back and forth, but I thought we
adjusted and began to attack in the first half.  
Hopefully the success breeds success. But when you're playing a team like
Kentucky - and I had said this prior to the game - that they're tough and they
keep playing. I think, you know, that's their identity.  
Dunlap and Mathies, those two kids, I've just seen them rebound. If I look at
a Kentucky team, I mean, one thing that I think is an identity is just free
throws. When you're getting the number that they have, and usually 10 or so
more than an opponent, the number they have right now at the end of the year,
I think that's a real sign of a team that's won some basketball games.  
I thought down the stretch they continued to tip from behind. We did some
things to ourselves. When we got into foul trouble and you have five people
with four fouls, I think that mentally we lost focus. We lost focus a little
bit as we were rotating.  
Our defensive intensity has to be as tough when you're in foul trouble. So our
lack of focus and their continuing to play hard, rebounding, getting to the
free throw, it kicked us late. You have to be mentally tough to win these
games, and we didn't do that for an extended period of time.  
Turnovers, free throws, and we didn't make free throws that we needed to make.
So we had every opportunity for this to be a game that was going to be down to
the wire or to maintain the lead that we had. I felt like some of the things
we did to ourselves. But I felt like Kentucky's pressure had a lot to do with
some of those turnovers and us just not being focused on where the defensive
players were coming from behind.  
So we did some of those things to ourselves. Hopefully we grow from this and
hopefully we have another opportunity in a couple of weeks to play some more
basketball.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, was it lack of communication or was it kind of self-inflicted cuts
to yourself that added up? You handled it well in the first half. I know you
expected them to play like that in the second half and come at you.  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: You know, sometimes if we had the answer to this, I've
told you before, I think we'd be doing something else if we knew the exact
answer.  
I think when things are going well, people tend to focus better and
communicate better. And I think that, you know, a team as they mature
together, they're able to play through adversity, whether if it's you miss a
shot or you miss a free throw or you get a foul. Whatever it is, it's a
negative. You're able to refocus more quickly and communicate as a team,
encourage each other.  
We did not do that as well as we needed to. You look at the points off of
turnovers. That's just such a key relative to little things that they kept
attacking. Then, you know, you have to sprint to every huddle. You have to
communicate. You have to get defensive stops, positioning, all those things.  
But if there's a mental lapse there, all of a sudden if that leads to a missed
block-out, not taking a charge, all the things we talked about, they made the
play and we didn't.  
  
Q. Did you feel your team tired when you had the lead?  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: That's where you can't let yourself be mentally tired.
Both teams are in the same situation. They pushed and had to work to win a
ballgame, and we did, too.  
You just can't have excuses. We did look tired mentally. When we made
mistakes, we looked more tired mentally. We had more energy when things were
going our way.  
That's when we have to be a more mature basketball team. We have to be
tougher, tougher, and be connected with that toughness, where we pull each
other up. We have to learn from this.  
This is something we've been communicating with our team as the season's
progressed. We have a couple weeks now to get better. I feel like that, you
know, in this league you see teams up and down, you've seen crazy scores,
you've seen games where you're shaking your head.  
We've learned from lessons along the way. Right now we need to play our best
basketball. I felt last night was a part of that, as well as the first half
today. We made adjustments to a tough basketball team. Second half we didn't
make those. So now we find a way to finish. Hopefully we will have that
opportunity.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the second half. You guys did a very good job of
answering some of their punches, but it just seemed as it wore on, there were
more mistakes. Can you talk about how you sensed the game maybe losing some
momentum or some energy.  
MARY KATHRYN GOVERO: Uhm, I felt like we came out from the beginning of the
game ready to play. We started off the second half okay, and then pretty much
the difference in the game was we didn't take care of the ball for 40 minutes.  
They got a lot more shots on offense, a lot more free throws. If they have
that many more shot opportunities and free throw attempts and we're not taking
care of the ball every possession, then you're going to have the outcome we
had today.  
TYSHEKA GRIMES: I agree with MK. We got to take care of the ball better.
Kentucky is a good team, you know. Got to give them credit. They capitalized
off our turnovers. We just didn't finish like we were supposed to.  
  
Q. Did you guys feel you did a good enough job matching their energy level,
especially maybe midway point of the second half on?  
MARY KATHRYN GOVERO: I felt like we came out from the beginning and we did a
good job of that. Whenever we started turning the ball over and we had several
people with foul trouble, our intensity out there, we had a lull right there,
and they took advantage of that. We just weren't able to catch back up.  
TYSHEKA GRIMES: I agree with MK again. Sorry, but I mean, it's true. Not a
good game. A lot of forced turnovers and things like that. It's a
heartbreaker. It's hard for me to talk about it. It's a heartbreaker.  
Hopefully, you know, next game, we can make it through the tournament and
things like this. Hopefully be better.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Kentucky - 76  
Mississippi State - 65

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Kentucky, head Coach Mitchell and student-
athletes. Coach, we'll start with an opening comment and take questions.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, that was a big move we made there in the second half.
Really changed the game. Mississippi State played really hard in the first
half, being the aggressor. We just don't function well in a basketball game if
we're not more aggressive than our opponent.  
So they outplayed us in the first half. That was easy to see. Credit our
players. It was incredible turnaround of attitude, great energy, great effort.
Really proud that they found a way to win that basketball game, dug themselves
out of a big hole.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Early in the second, your team's body language was not there. Just as
quickly as it wasn't there, it reappeared. Was something said or what did the
kids do to rediscover it?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I thought that at halftime we just talked about that our
aggressiveness was nonexistent, so somebody had to step up and start making
plays. They were all plays we were capable of making.  
I just think that for our team, when Victoria can get in the press and get
active, when A'dia can be aggressive and attack the basket on offense and get
some buckets, it gives everyone energy.  
I think when your best players play the way they need to play, everybody else
will come on and get onboard and follow.  
You know, I've seen it happen with our team before. There's a tiny spark will
get it going. Today we were sparked. I can't really remember what it was, but
clearly you saw us in the press at our best. I just credit the players for
that. They just hustled really, really hard.  
  
Q. I think A'dia attempted one shot in the first half. In the second half,
she just really took it to them. Can you talk about what she's been able to
do.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I thought we did a good job early in the game. You saw
how important A'dia Mathies is to us. We were trying to set a tempo, it was
pretty clear. I thought we were doing a good job there.  
The thing that happens on the perimeter with us, when A'dia goes out, at times
we can become passive. A'dia is the player on the perimeter that when people
are trying to shut down passing lanes, she can get the ball to the bucket or
she can get it inside and dish it off.  
So it's very important for her to get involved. When she went to the bench
with foul trouble, that really sort of set us back some. We put her back in,
got it back, brought her back out trying to save that third foul. They went
down another run. She's obviously a big key to our team.  
It's a gutsy play for a freshman, a fifth-year senior, whatever you want to
say. She's a very talented basketball player. There's no way I could have more
confidence in A'dia Mathies.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the tale of two halves from Amber
Smith.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I thought that was a big key. Amber is an emotional
player, so sometimes your greatest strength can go into a weakness. I thought
that emotionally she really got down and shut down and was not leading our
basketball team in the first half. I was very frustrated with that.  
She was able to work herself out of that. I just think it shows some growth
and maturity out of our veteran players. She was tremendous. You can kind of
see how our energy flows through Amber Smith. She was a big-time player in the
second half, as well.  
  
Q. Victoria, it's the first time Kentucky has been in the final since 1982.
Can you talk about what you have been able to do so far, what you think about
tomorrow.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think we just showed a lot of people in the league that
we're a good basketball team. Just our energy is really good, and just for
tomorrow we have to come out for the beginning.  
Last time coach talked about us not being ready, not mentally ready. Tomorrow
we have to come out from the jump, shoot around in the morning, and just be
ready, be in the game.  
  
Q. Victoria, the run that you made early in the second half to kind of get
back into it, I think you had 8 of the 10 points. You weren't all the way back
as a team, but why did you sense that spark was going to turn into even
something more?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think just with our team, once you get something going, I
mean, it's like a spark. It just keeps going and going. Everybody feeds off of
it.  
I think that's just what happened. I was scoring. Amber was giving me assists.
She was getting back into her momentum of energy. Everybody was getting back
into it. That's just how it happened.  
  
Q. Coach, when the momentum kind of got going your way, it looked like the
defense and energy picked up on both ends. You forced 15 turnovers in the
second half. How big was that? The defense seemed to pick it up.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, what was amazing about the run is that we made some good
plays at the front of the press. It's not easy to do, but that's where you'll
typically see a team that's sort of just on an emotional high make some plays.  
But what was impressive, we were able to sustain it. We started making some
plays in their front court by coming back and fundamentally coming behind,
sweeping the ball, we got several plays there. That's exciting, because now
the press is working. It's not a phoney press. It's real, and you're starting
to see some things happen.  
Then you start seeing them make some passes. People are fumbling the ball. So
the pressure was able to turn the game around. You cannot do that if you don't
have five players really spreading the floor, laying it on the line. That was
as good as we've pressed all year there in the second half. That was
outstanding.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about as you get down to 10 points and you're huddling
up on the floor, what are you talking about to each other? How are you
coaching each other to get out of that hole?  
A'DIA MATHIES: We already know that if we get down that's not gonna do nothing
but hurt us, so we just try to keep a lot of energy and enthusiasm. We came
down from a lot of points before. We know we're capable of coming back. We got
to try to keep up defensive pressure, make runs, everybody make runs. We just
had ours. Ours came through for us.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think at that time we knew that we weren't playing well and
we weren't playing together as a team. We just kept saying to each other, Stay
together, stay focused as a team. It wasn't about personal mess-ups, but just
listen to the coaches and everything will be all right.  
  
Q. Amani was pacing behind the bench the entire game. Was that just to keep
her limber? Also, is Carly Morrow still battling an illness, because she
didn't play today.  
COACH MITCHELL: She was not good today. It's kind of been going through our
team. When you get here and you're all together, we've had several battling
that. She was not able to go.  
Amani twisted her ankle yesterday. It was swollen on her all throughout the
night and this morning. She did a whale of a job of fighting through that.
Just not able to stop. Got to keep going.  
So she got a little extra exercise back there behind the bench today. She did
a good job.  
  
Q. A'dia, when you took the elbow early in the second half, it almost looked
like something got knocked loose in your mouth. How were you able to bounce
back from that and stay focused?  
A'DIA MATHIES: I think it kind of gave our team the energy. When I was on the
bench, that's when everybody started. I think it actually gave us a little bit
of momentum, knowing how the game was going to be, getting tougher, coming
together as a team.  
When I got back into the game, it was already high energy. I just fed off of
them. I think it helped me to go out there and make plays and help my team
out.  
She like chipped my tooth out in the back and my mouth was bleeding. I didn't
lose the tooth. It's just like a hole. It's chipped, so...  
COACH MITCHELL: Will you be able to go tomorrow?  
A'DIA MATHIES: Of course, Coach.  
COACH MITCHELL: That's good news for us (laughter).  
  
Q. Anything from the Tennessee game in particular that you learned that
might help you in a rematch?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Our energy from the beginning for the whole entire game. We
can't go out there hesitant or looking down on ourselves. We have to go out
with the mentality that we can win the game and not worry about anything
except how we can play.  
A'DIA MATHIES: I agree with Vic. We just got to go in there and have a whole
lot of enthusiasm and just play the type of ball that got us here in the first
place. Just go out there playing aggressive, playing defense, converting to
offense. I think that's all we need.  
  
Q. Did you say something specific to Amber at halftime? What happened at
halftime? What was the exchange?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, the thing we're trying to do is we try to teach our
players how to function within their roles within the team. Amber and I have
talked about this many times. She has a special level of responsibility as the
point guard.  
So when things are going bad, it's sort of like special responsibility of head
coach; when things are going bad, generally if the leader gets down and
negative and doesn't fight through, then bad things happen.  
So you're just working with her, trying to get her to understand. We go as you
go emotionally, so you have to. I know it's frustrating. I'm frustrated.
Everybody's upset.  
I just thought that she did a great job of pulling out of that, 'cause it's
hard to do. That is an athletic, talented, tough basketball team that has us
14 points, and we looked dead in the water. She was able to pull herself out
of that, and she made some plays that were incredible.  
So I thought that we had a good exchange in the first media timeout. I thought
she was back then. She had gotten back solid and we went from there. So it was
a good, good turnaround for Amber Smith. That's something we need to build on.  
  
Q. I didn't see the first game with Tennessee. What will you have to do, any
specifics, in order to stay in this game with Tennessee tomorrow?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we did not play defensively sound enough early in the
game to have an idea of where we were stacking up right there. We allowed a
huge run there early.  
When you're playing them at their place, it's very difficult to let them go on
a big run and get a lot of confidence.  
Tomorrow we will have to be as mentally sharp as we can be. We'll have to be
in the right place at the right time. They're capable of doing that. It's
going to be a very tough task, but it should be tough in the finals of the
Southeastern Conference championship. I think this is one of the greatest
tournaments in the world. It's going to be a tough game.  
Our team needs to do and play as close to their identity as they can play to
give themselves a chance to win this championship. I expect them to do that. I
expect them to come out and play extremely hard and carry out assignments.
We'll see if it's a good basketball game. It should be.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  68  
Vanderbilt - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Tennessee, head Coach Pat Summitt and student-
athletes. We'll take an opening comment from coach and then questions.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I thought we did a much better job in the second half
across the board, especially on the boards. We separated ourselves. I thought
that Shekinna had to play a lot of minutes, but she did a good job pushing
tempo, getting the ball where it needed to go.  
I thought our post game stepped up, and we got some good balance overall. It
was just a good win for us because Vanderbilt, they know us and we know them.
Melanie does such a great job with all the sets. I mean, they run more sets
than I think I've run in maybe six years of coaching.  
But they do a great job. So we have to really talk our action and be invested.
For the most part, thought we did a lot of good things.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both players, could you address your defense today. Vanderbilt hurt
you guys on threes.  
ANGIE BJORKLUND: I just thought we really bought into our scouting report
defense. We knew who were the shooters, who were the drivers.  
I thought that was key for us, especially in our switching defense, which
helped us out really a lot. Getting out and switching the steal, getting out
on the shooters.  
I just thought our team did a great job having that sense of urgency to not
let them get the open looks that they got the last couple games we played
them.  
SHEKINNA STRICKLEN: I totally agree with Angie. Most of all we talked, we
communicated with each other. We knew who the shooters were, so we switched
and we like got out there, got at her before she could even touch the ball. I
think a lot of it had to do that we limited Marsh's touches, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Summitt.  
  
Q. Could you talk about that as well, too, because you shut them down from
three-point range.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think the reason being that we've worked a lot
defending Vanderbilt obviously, you know, having played them as much as we
have. I think this team this year really bought into our scouting report
defense. They know us and how to close it out when we play Vanderbilt.  
Obviously they shoot the three ball well. So when you have three-point
shooters, obviously you got to be mindful of how close you can get to support
your team defensively. A lot of times, you know, we don't get in the paint. We
cheat. We have what we call our cheat steps to close them out so we get defend
the three ball. We've got to arrive when the ball arrives.  
Just a repetition movement in practice and having had Melanie, you know, at
Vanderbilt, you just know that's what you have to defend. So it forces us to
have to work on it leading up to the time that we're playing them.  
The fact that, you know, we played them at home, we played them away, and
obviously playing them here, you know, we've had a lot of practice at
defending the three.  
  
Q. They got off to a good beginning. They kind of got hot shooting. The
first timeout, you came out an 18-4 run with a lead that you basically never
gave up. Were you able to make any changes at that point to get the team going
a little bit more? Was it a matter of you getting hot?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think we started a little slow, and we have in some
games - probably too many games. But, you know, when you've got a potential
championship on the line, you know, why would you not come and be ready to go?  
I think it's different playing Vanderbilt, okay, than some of the other teams
that we play. So when you play them, you have to really change your thinking
on what you're going to do. You know then that you've got to really close out
long. You can't have short closeouts against them. They make you pay.  
Where the other teams we play haven't been as committed to the three ball
overall. So it's just a matter of us having not defended constantly the three
ball.  
  
Q. Kelley Cain, are her knees bothering her a little more in this
tournament?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I've limited her play a little bit. The reason being -- I
mean, having back-to-back-to-back games, I've really tried to be mindful of
not playing her extended minutes. Because you get in that championship game,
Kelley Cain is going to have to play extended minutes.  
  
Q. Hannah Tuomi didn't have many points, but can you talk about her
defensive effort against you.  
COACH SUMMITT: She's really, really tough minded. I think the team looks to
her because of her toughness and how hard she plays. She's a player that's
going to get on the floor, she's going to come up with the loose ball, she's
going to come up with a big basket.  
You know, I just think she's had a great influence on the personality of their
team.  
  
Q. I thought Brewer played well. She seemed to get on the rebounds a lot.
Talk about her a little bit. Obviously when Cain does go out, you're giving
her a little rest, Brewer does a good job of filling in.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, she started a little bit slow, I thought, more
defensively. Obviously we discussed that and she responded. She's got a high
basketball IQ. You just tell her, Wait a minute, you know, you're not getting
paint points, and we've got to have you getting paint points. You're not as
passionate in the defensive end, so you have to pick up your intensity.  
But as a freshman, there's been very little change. Now she's very coachable
and she wants to help this team. So when we talk to her, I mean, typically
she's going to respond in a very positive fashion.  
  
Q. Vandy is a tough team. Does maybe some of that rub off when you're
playing them? I thought you played pretty tough, especially on defense
throughout the game.  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think because of how much we've played them we respect
them. We know they're not gonna take any possessions off. They're going to be
defending and rebounding. Even if they don't have the size that we have, they
don't lack for heart and desire and commitment.  
I mean, that's Melanie. I've known Melanie for a long time. She's a terrific
coach and a great motivator.  
  
Q. I apologize if this is a tired subject, but it's been 10 years since
Tennessee swept regular season and the tournament titles. What kind of
motivator is that?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think our team is very motivated. The regular season I think
gave them a lot of confidence and also inspired them. I think they want more.
I think they want to win here.  
Just the maturity, what a difference a year has been, just the focus of our
basketball team overall. They want to do this collectively. I mean, they're in
it together. It's their idea. It works a whole lot better when it's their
idea.  
  
Q. Talk about possible matchups with the players. They said, It doesn't
matter who we play. If we play our best, we'll win. Is that what you want to
hear from your team at tournament time?  
COACH SUMMITT: Absolutely. I think we have the best team. I wouldn't have
known that when the year started. But I think having played everyone in this
league now, and they're all good. Yes, obviously we have one loss, but just
rebounded from that one.  
I think that our team has invested, and they really have been the ones that
said, We have to do this, because they have really taken ownership. We watch
film. They do a great job of watching film and breaking the film down, knowing
what they have to do.  
So it's not like the coaches are spoon feeding this team on their scouting
reports. They are getting the DVDs and watching teams ahead of time. They're
bringing up the ideas that they have seen because of their scouting
commitment.  
So it's not just the coaches speaking to them like we did a year ago. They
didn't swallow half of what we gave them. Now they're invested, so that's a
good thing.  
  
Q. Pat, you always preach rebounding and defense. Does that make a victory
more pleasing to you when you do it that way?  
COACH SUMMITT: I love winning anyway. But I think the one thing is just giving
the passion, not to take possessions off, you know. And I think this team
right now, they're pretty passionate. They're very focused.  
I think when they are invested like that, it works a lot better. It works a
lot better because they are the ones to embrace what it is we want to do, but
they hold everybody accountable throughout the process.  
And our leadership is good. Angie has been a really good leader. Shekinna has
been a really good leader. Kelley Cain has been a great leader. I think
everyone feels the freedom to speak at any point in time, whether it's in our
film session, whether it's in the huddle.  
There isn't any dissension in this team. It's been an all cohesion, and that's
been a good thing.  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.  
COACH SUMMITT: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  68  
Vanderbilt - 49

  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Vanderbilt head Coach Balcomb, and student-
athletes. We'll take an opening comment from Coach Balcomb and then take
questions.  
Coach?  
COACH BALCOMB: You know, I just think today we lacked focus. We missed
assignments defensively. We gave too many open looks to their great shooters
and didn't defend and rebound, which is how you win games right now.  
It's tough because we know each other so well, and they played like Tennessee
and we didn't take their strength away. They did a better job taking our
strengths away.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jence, in the first two games against Tennessee, you really hurt them
from three-point range. They seemed more committed to taking that away today.
Was that kind of the case?  
JENCE RHOADS: I think so. I think that was definitely one of their focuses.
They probably worked on that. Coach Summitt probably talked about that in
their practices and preparation.  
So I'm sure that was one of their focuses, and they were pretty successful at
it.  
  
Q. Hannah, had 12 points tonight; great defensive effort. I wanted you to
comment on the crowd's reaction when you got the fifth foul.  
HANNAH TUOMI: I mean, no comment (laughter).  
I mean, fouled out. What are you going to do? Can't change it, so...  
  
Q. Can we talk about the defensive effort against Tennessee. Was it a matter
of two games in two days? Tired legs? Obviously No. 4 in the nation, but...  
JENCE RHOADS: That's not an excuse. I know playing two games is hard, but
that's not an excuse we can use for this game.  
Like coach said, we weren't focused. We had some lapses, and Tennessee took
advantage of those lapses.  
HANNAH TUOMI: Came down to whichever team showed up with more focus and better
game plan and executed all of it, so...  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2010

  

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Mississippi State  67  
Georgia - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining is Georgia head Coach Landers and student-athletes.
We'll take an opening comment from coach.  
COACH LANDERS: Well, we were pleased at halftime. We weren't satisfied, but we
were pleased. Thought we played reasonably well. We had done many of the
things that we wanted to do, knew that we had given up too many offensive
rebounds in the first half and left Govero in the corner open twice.  
But overall had done a reasonably good job. Came out second half -- actually,
at halftime reviewed with people their tendencies and what needed to be done.
Came out second half, and I thought that Rack really hurt us with penetration
early in the second half. Got the ball deep. We were very poor with any kind
of help to her. She got up some little chip shots from in tight.  
We turned the ball over on the perimeter. They laid all those up. That created
the momentum. They had two things going then: they were driving the ball the
way they wanted to drive it in the halfcourt, and they were running hard. We
didn't want any one of those two things to ever happen tonight, and they had
them both going at the same time.  
As the game wore on, we left Govero again in the corner I think for three
more, and that helped create the spread. When we got down in the score
situation, we weren't very good. We didn't seem to be able to check up full
court and guard our people.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Coach, did you sense any similarities to the first game?  
COACH LANDERS: No, not really. You know, they jumped us early down there. To
me, I mean, similarities, sure, they ran on us early. Tonight they ran on us
on turnovers. That's similar, but it wasn't the same.  
You know, we got down and we fought back. We didn't do that tonight. So not
that similar to me. You know, Govero doesn't score on us, Rack does, and
tonight Govero hurt us badly.  
  
Q. Seemed like you slowed down your tempo on offense in the second half. Is
that something Mississippi State was doing?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, we did run the ball well. I told the team at halftime
that that's when I felt we looked our best, was when we were running it.  
We didn't get it to where we could run it, and it's hard to run it after the
other team scores. They were scoring a good bit the second half. That slowed
us down a little bit. Then they were mixing in some zone trap. That slowed us
down a little bit.  
But, you know, when it looked to me like we were running, I was all for
running. When we didn't have a run, we tried to run a couple of sets, because
there was a time when we were settling for jump shots. You know, we went
through about four or five minutes where the ball never went inside.  
  
Q. I think Rack was 0-7 in the first half. You talked about how she got free
from penetration. What did you do in the first half so well that you liked?  
COACH LANDERS: Nothing really strategically any different than what we wanted
to do in the second half. I think she brought a little bit more determination.
I think her pride probably kicked in at halftime because she had a little bit
more zip to her, a little bit more attack mode.  
We did not play them defensively the same as we did in Starkville. She may
have been expecting some different defense coming off of those ball screens,
and it may have taken her to halftime, I don't know, for them to adjust and
make her understand because they're playing us like this, you're going to have
to do something else.  
But she got the ball deep. She got it in there. Like I said, she scored up a
couple from four or five feet. Hurt us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Renee Ladner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18026)

### [Kayla Melson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20523)

### [Bianca Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18025)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  76  
Ole Miss - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: We now have Ole Miss head Coach Ladner and student-athletes.
Coach, if you could make an opening comment.  
COACH LADNER: Tennessee was outstanding today. They dominated everything that
we tried to do in the first half, in particular the boards. Tennessee is
Tennessee because they prepare so well and they play at a different level once
tournament time starts around.  
I'm just sorry we didn't give them a better game. All in all, we fought till
the end.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. For both players. Having played yesterday, you don't have as much depth
as Tennessee does, did you think that was a factor? You played them close the
first two times you played them.  
BIANCA THOMAS: Fatigue is always going to be a factor when you play back-to-
back games. That's not an excuse. I don't think we came out and gave Tennessee
our best effort tonight. Have to credit them because they played great
tonight.  
KAYLA MELSON: Fatigue is not a factor and depth is not a factor. You know, our
coach always says it's about who wants it more. I think tonight Tennessee came
out and wanted it more than us. You have to give credit to that because they
prepared.  
I think that we just weren't able to counter what they threw at us tonight.  
  
Q. Alicia Manning is a player that's come on for Tennessee in the second
half of the season. Just as an all-around player rebounding and scoring, she
plays good defense. Are you aware of her? Does she stick out in your
preparation when you're playing against her?  
BIANCA THOMAS: We're definitely aware of her. The last time in Knoxville, she
got a double double on us. She's playing really well right now. She's their
rogue player. She picks up the trash, plays good defense. She does all the
small things for Tennessee.  
So we definitely recognize her.  
KAYLA MELSON: I think we do recognize her. She was the X factor in the loss
when we lost at Oxford. She was the X factor when we played them at Tennessee.
Of course we were aware of her. But give credit to her, because she's been
playing really well these last couple games.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KAYLA MELSON: Um, my ankles have been tweaked since I've been here. I mean,
sprained both ankles numerous times. You know, this time was kind of different
for me because I felt something that I usually don't feel. Thank God, it
wasn't that serious and I was still able to play for my team.  
  
Q. Would you describe it as a mild sprain?  
KAYLA MELSON: I'd describe it as a mild sprain.  
  
Q. Coach, same question I asked the players. I know they have a lot of
talent. Is Manning a player you take note of being a factor with them?  
COACH LADNER: Alicia Manning has kicked our butt both times we played them. We
were well aware of her. She's had a double double. She's outmanned us, out-
hustled and beat us on the board. Alicia Manning was somebody we took to
heart.  
Once again she came in today and got a double double. She is getting better
every time I see her play, in particular against us.  
You know they have the bigs, the perimeter players. But she is a hustler. She
makes plays for Tennessee. Kayla keeps calling her the X factor. She has been
our nemesis. She has beaten us every time we've played.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2010&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 5, 2010

  

### [Nell Fortner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13860)

### [Alli Smalley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20504)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Kentucky  65  
Auburn - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Auburn head Coach Fortner and student-athletes.
Coach, if you could make an opening comment, then we'll take questions.  
COACH FORTNER: Well, obviously it's a disappointing loss. But, you know, it's
a tremendous learning experience for our team. We were a little on the young
side. This experience will pay off for us next year. That's something to look
forward to, to have that experience coming back into this tournament, because
this is a tough tournament.  
You know, we just -- I think we ran out of gas a little bit in the game. But,
you know, we'll move on.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. For Morgan and Alli, what was the difference between this game and
Sunday's game? Kentucky just kind of come out playing a lot better than they
were?  
ALLI SMALLEY: Not really. I mean, we knew coming in the pressure was going to
be picked up. Both times we played them this year their defensive intensity is
really good, so we knew what to expect.  
They just picked it up to a whole 'nother level, and we weren't able to handle
it as well as we should have.  
MORGAN JENNINGS: Yeah, the same as what Alli just said. Great defensive
intensity the whole game pretty much. Kind of feel like we did run out of gas
at the end.  
  
Q. Was it tough to keep up with Kentucky when they finally established the
flow, running on fast breaks?  
ALLI SMALLEY: Yeah, because they press the whole game. Their pressure is whole
intense, even offensively. As soon as they get the ball out of the basket,
they're pushing it to the other end. It's definitely hard to keep up with
them.  
They're a great defensive team and they're a great transition team pushing it
up the court.  
MORGAN JENNINGS: Same as what Alli just said. They're a very quick team, very
fast team. They want to get you running. We tried to slow it down at times to
play our own game. They just kept running and pressing the whole game, and
that kind of broke is down a little bit.  
  
Q. Morgan, this conference has such a great reputation as being so
competitive. What is it like for a freshman player? Is it more challenging
than you thought it would be?  
MORGAN JENNINGS: The word I would pick is "exciting." It's a new experience. I
was excited to be here. It's a tournament full of great teams. The SEC I think
is the best conference in the nation. For us to be here is just exciting for
me.  
  
Q. Alli, with the way they run the tempo, did that kind of remind you of the
way you played last year?  
ALLI SMALLEY: Yeah, a little bit. They're kind of similar. But they just push
the ball and find open players, so...  
  
Q. Same question, Coach.  
COACH FORTNER: He just took our playbook and put it into his team.  
But it's a great way to play. If you have the players to play that way, it's a
great way to play because it's hard to defend. We experienced that last year.
It was hard for people to defend us.  
Then you got three-point shooters on your perimeter, you got a good post
presence inside with Dunlap. Even though she's undersized, she creates a lot
of problems for any size guarding her in there. She's a very versatile block
post player.  
  
Q. Anything you can do to stop them?  
COACH FORTNER: Yeah, we're going to get better over the off-season.  
You know, I just think their style of play, it's good, it's exciting, it's fun
for the kids to play. They want to play it. Got depth to play it. It's an
intense 40 minutes of basketball.  
I think that that's what we want to do last year, except they press a lot more
than we did last year. But pushing that ball, it's tough to guard.  
  
Q. What do these last couple weeks mean looking to the future?  
COACH FORTNER: I really think there were some real bright spots to finish this
season out. One of them being I thought our 6'8" freshman, P.J. West, kind of
came into her own the last three weeks. That gives her a good springboard into
the spring and the summer to do something pretty special next year. She's a
very versatile 6'8" player. I mean, saw some really good things in the last
few weeks.  
One of the neatest things, like Morgan Toles, Blanche Alverson, P.J. West,
those three coming back with great experience. They got a lot of playing time
this year. That will only help us next year.  
We have great leadership in Alli Smalley and Jordan Greenleaf will be seniors.
They played about every minute of every game since they've been at Auburn and
playing.  
I think we'll be a hungrier team next year and definitely a more experienced
team.  
  
Q. What did you do differently with Victoria than the last matchup?  
COACH FORTNER: Well, I think she played like the SEC Player of the Year. I
don't think she did that when she came to Auburn. I don't know what the
difference was, but she did not attack the basket like she did today. She did
not play as aggressively like she did today when they came to Auburn. She was
2 for 15 at Auburn. Today she was 10 for 19. That's a big disparity.  
So I don't know why. But she played like, you know, they definitely lit a fire
under her. She had a good day.  
  
Q. Kentucky kind of came out of nowhere this year. Looking ahead to the NCAA
tournament, based on your experience, do you think Kentucky is the kind of
team that can make a run in that, pose matchup problems with their style of
play?  
COACH FORTNER: I do. I really do, because their style is so fast. If they go
up against certain teams in certain conferences that don't play that style at
all, it's going to be very hard for that team to adjust to them.  
Kentucky to me can adjust to a slower style. They can guard that. But it's
going to be harder for a team that doesn't play that tempo. Boy, they're going
to be surprised.  
Now, I think where they'll come into problems is they are undersized in the
post. When teams maybe play them a little different defensively or have more
mobile, big people, that might affect them.  
  
Q. Morgan, how far have you come in this season?  
MORGAN JENNINGS: I think I've improved a lot. I've learned a lot over the past
games, especially these last few games. I learned how to be more consistent,
just to play every game like it's your last. It's been a great experience for
me, I guess.  
  
Q. How excited are you for the senior year, Alli?  
ALLI SMALLEY: Yeah, I'm really looking forward to our next season. Like we've
been talking about, the freshmen have gotten a lot of great experience this
year. They'll be coming back bigger and better than last year.  
We have a good freshmen class coming in. I think with a lot of work in the
off-season, we'll be able to really do some nice things last year.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Sharon Fanning-Otis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16876)

### [Mary Kathryn Govero](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20538)

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Mississippi State  67  
Georgia - 52

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Mississippi State, head Coach Fanning-Otis and
student-athletes. We'll take an opening comment from coach and then we'll take
questions.  
Coach.  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: Second half, you know, at halftime we talked about taking
better care of the ball, assist/turnover, just the fundamentals of the game. I
felt like we did a better job.  
I know they out-rebounded us by one. We had to get boards. We had to block
out. Five people in double figures and then 53% in the second half. That's a
huge stat for us.  
Free throws, neither team took a lot. But connecting on just about every one
you took is so very important. So I feel like those areas, those stats are
very important to us.  
There were some key buckets and key plays. Might have been a defensive stand,
it may have been Diamber Johnson taking a charge, it may have been Rack's
three; it may have been M. Kat's jump in the corner; it may have been Ty
hitting a bucket, going to the hole. Could have been any one of them.  
With those statements being made, you can say this was such a team effort for
us. We were able to change defenses a little bit. They do a good job changing
on you, play so hard.  
But we found a way to win. It was a great team effort. We had some foul
situations. Shot clock is going down. We just had some big plays. Very, very
pleased with this team win.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Does this victory kind of epitomize the connected toughness that you guys
have been striving to get back?  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: We're headed in the right direction with this. You know,
there were a lot of opportunities for a team to defer it or if there's a, you
know, a missed shot or a transition bucket in the first half, foul trouble,
different people in the lineup. In the second half when Ty had her foul, her
fourth foul.  
But, you know, we just found a way. Found a way to stay together. That
toughness, that connected toughness, I think that it is reflected in this
basketball game.  
I think that as we look to the next basketball game, you know, Kentucky is a
team that is very tough, and they continue to play.  
So this is gonna be an important, you know, element in each and every game. We
knew that coming into this tournament. Whoever it is you're playing, this is a
whole new season. You're going to have to play as hard as we played. You're
going to have to have a passion for it. You're going to have to leave it on
the floor.  
If we do that, as we came into this tournament, anybody can win it. It has to
be the team that's more determined and makes the play at the right time, and
that's what we were able to do in this basketball game.  
  
Q. Y'all shot a lot better in the second half than the first half. What was
different?  
COACH FANNING-OTIS: We just drew it up a little bit different (laughter).  
No, we just encouraged the young ladies that you have to believe in yourself.
You have to believe in yourself individually, collectively. You have to trust
each other. You have to keep taking great shots. That's just something you
have to believe yourself. You have to expect it to go in.  
So we emphasized extra passes. We emphasized touches in the paint get the ball
moving, inside, outside. There were some good screens set. They took great
shots. I think if you continue to take great shots, they're going to fall.
You'll get the numbers you need.  
I think that success breeds success. Once a couple fall, it becomes easier,
and it becomes easier for everybody else.  
  
Q. For the players, there was a point around 13 minutes left when Chanel had
an offensive rebound to give you guys the lead for good. From my perspective,
tell me if I'm wrong or tell me if you sensed it, it just seemed like the
light went on and you guys started to really play more together, you hit a lot
of really big shots, made the extra pass, and from there on you just kind of
got rolling. Did you feel that at that point?  
MARY KATHRYN GOVERO: Yeah, there was definitely a turning point in the game
whenever we were getting defensive stops. We were knocking down some shots
which gave us a lot of momentum and confidence to keep hitting shots.  
Like she said, success breeds success. I think we all kind of felt the turning
point in the game where we just put our foot on the gas pedal and didn't want
to look back.  
TYSHEKA GRIMES: I have to beg to differ, because I believe that we came out
with that intensity. I believe that we set our minds to it, you know, to come
out and to execute and block out and rebound offensively, stop them
defensively.  
We just came out with that mindset. I think we were prepared to do it and we
did it.  
  
Q. How much do you talk about the opportunity to do something in this
tournament that Mississippi State has not done before?  
MARY KATHRYN GOVERO: We don't necessarily talk about what Mississippi State
hasn't done before; we just talk about what our goals as a team have been all
season and how we can't look in the past. There were some games this year that
we didn't play so well. We just decided that this is going to be when we're
going to play Mississippi State basketball, how we know that we can play, and
that we're going to come in and play as hard as we can every game, have no
regrets, try to reach the goals we set for ourselves this season, which
include hopefully winning the championship this weekend.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

## March 5, 2010

  

### [Victoria Dunlap](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20528)

### [A'dia Mathies](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20529)

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Kentucky  65  
Auburn - 54

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Kentucky head Coach Mitchell and student-
athletes. Coach, if you could make an opening comment.  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, we're extremely happy to win. Auburn played well here at
the end of the season. A tough matchup for us. I was particularly pleased that
our players could come out and play a little bit closer to our identity that
we've been able to create this season.  
Thought we started with good energy. It was not a masterpiece by any stretch
of the imagination, but it was certainly a good performance. We were just
thrilled to win, and are just going to try to wake up tomorrow and stay as
close to our identity as we can and see if we can win one more.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Victoria, Coach Mitchell has a reputation as a good game planner. Did he
do anything different from the first Auburn game to this one?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: No. He just talked about how last game we didn't come out
with the right energy. Just told us that we had to come out and play. It was
nothing different with him. Just stayed intense with his momentum. Just
getting on us just about everything.  
Our mindset had to be right for this time for the game, and he was really good
with that.  
  
Q. Victoria, it seemed like you wanted the ball more when KeKe was out for
Auburn. Were you looking to take advantage when she was on the bench?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Whether on the bench or on the floor, I think my mindset was
just try to attack the basket anytime I could. That's what coach and them were
telling me.  
Last time we played them, I was hesitant with KeKe, with all the rest of their
post players. So this time I was just trying to have the mindset of just
relaxing, taking the ball to the basket or getting the ball to my teammates.  
  
Q. A'dia, how important was it to stop the losing streaks?  
A'DIA MATHIES: It was very important for us to do that. We knew that we had a
turn it around, because we didn't want to keep getting down on ourselves. We
knew we had to continue on what we started at the beginning of the year.  
I think this win in particular is going to help us when we move up to the next
tournament. Just taking it game by game. So this win was a story of just us
bringing back what we had at the beginning of the season.  
  
Q. A'dia, what are you guys going to do to give Alli Smalley a tough time
after she had such a big game yesterday?  
A'DIA MATHIES: We just had to stay with her everywhere she went. Whether
switching out, chasing over, just being aggressive with her. Just keeping the
ball out of her hands as much as we could.  
We knew if we could do that, it make other people score points and then we had
an even better chance of beating them. So we just tried to play aggressive and
stay on her all night.  
  
Q. How important was it for you to get a win and get over those last two
losses and refocus?  
COACH MITCHELL: Well, I think for our team's mindset, clearly you don't want
to experience any kind of losing streak. But after you've created so much
positive momentum -- and we really have not had a rough patch all season. We
have not had a losing streak all year. We bounced back from every loss with a
win.  
So we're concerned about their mindset, especially just the way that we played
at Auburn. It was not a good indication of what they're capable of doing.  
So I just thought it so important today, not only because we have a chance to
compete for this championship, which we have so much respect for, but just for
our team to be able to get back and play with some energy and effort and sort
of out play our opponent through hustle plays. That's our identity. That's
what we have to do.  
I thought this was a huge game for us today. We needed to come out on top. I'm
just thrilled that the players did.  
  
Q. There was a point in the first half where you called a timeout. I think
you said something to the effect that, You're giving it to them on the
defensive end. How did you see them respond from that?  
COACH MITCHELL: They did much better. When the ball would go in the post, we
were turning around and just standing and watching that. Auburn was doing a
great job of just cutting us to the lane. We were losing a good relationship
with the ball.  
It was just a fundamental breakdown. Our team has to play fundamentally sound.
We aren't going to make spectacular plays. We're going to try to wear you out
by just being in the right place at the right time all night long. That's what
we need to do.  
So they were getting a lot of easy looks. You cannot give Auburn a lot of easy
looks or they'll make you pay. So I thought they adjusted well. I thought that
A'dia and Victoria there in the last seven minutes of the first half, we went
from five down to seven up. I just thought both of those players sitting up
here now made some tremendous plays.  
Defensively, they're both so strong. We have a chance when they're really
locked in and doing a good job on the defensive end.  
  
Q. A'dia, I was wondering about your first experience here. Did you know
they were going to say, 'freshman of the year'?  
A'DIA MATHIES: I didn't know what to expect. Actually, I didn't know they was
going say it. I was just waiting for the 5'9" freshman from Louisville,
Kentucky.  
When they said that, it put a smile on my face, though. I think it helped us
all out, you know, in the tournament and being aggressive out there playing
today.  
COACH MITCHELL: We didn't know they were going to say it because they never
said it before. We didn't have any idea about that one. They never said that
before, so we just didn't know (laughter).  
  
Q. Can you talk about Victoria's performance today, especially coming off
the loss at Auburn.  
COACH MITCHELL: I did a poor job with Victoria last Sunday just when I got
upset with her and down on her. So I didn't help her last Sunday when she was
struggling mightily.  
I just told her today before she went to the center circle, to tip, she didn't
need to get down on herself, I was not going to get down on her, and I was
going to be there encouraging her as much as I could.  
She played like a Player of the Year in a very, very important time for our
basketball team. And so it was not Sunday. I just told her. She didn't score
four today. She did a great, great job. I'm really, really proud. As I said
many times about both these players, extremely fortunate to coach both Vic and
A'dia.  
  
Q. Coach talks about the identity and the hustle play. How much of his
personality carries over into how you play?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: It carries over a lot. We have a lot of energy with practice
and just him as a person. And just the feeling I just get. He just gives out a
lot energy and stuff, and he just passes it along.  
It's kind of hard not to get along with him. He just gives so much energy, so
you want to be energetic too just to have fun. So it's great.  
A'DIA MATHIES: His energy does rub off on us. He's very enthusiastic. It's
what he expects of us. He expects us to play our best. That's what we try to
do.  
  
Q. What are the plans for watching the game that determines tomorrow's
opponent?  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: I think the coach is going to watch the game. We're not going
to worry about that until tomorrow until the coaches get that settled in.
We're going to go back to the hotel and rest.  
COACH MITCHELL: Sleep.  
VICTORIA DUNLAP: Not just to rest, but to sleep. First we'll get food and then
sleep. I'm pretty sure the coaches got that covered, so we're good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Vanderbilt  63  
LSU - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from LSU, head Coach Chancellor and student-
athletes. Coach, would you like to make some opening remarks about this
evening's game.  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Out-coached us tonight, out-hustled us, outplayed us. I
thought Melanie Balcomb did a much better job with their team than I did with
mine. They played last night in overtime. They out-rebounded us. They out-
carried us.  
They did everything you ought to do. I'm fully responsible. We couldn't stop.
Marsh got what I thought she'd get. Rhoads was pretty good. The kid we
couldn't stop was 15. She did a heck of a job.  
Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, why do you think you guys have struggled to win close games?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I get our kids to realize that every possession counts. I've
struggled all year to get them to quit fouling jump shooters. That's poor
coaching. I can't get them to quit fouling jump shooters.  
We made a lazy pass over the press. We shot layups. I've done everything I can
to get them to understand that every possession counts. We can't keep our
focus. This is why we have struggled with -- we could have had a fabulous
year. We lost three overtime games, two games at the end.  
I think nothing but just lousy, pitiful, sorry, miserable coaching. And that's
putting it mildly.  
  
Q. 15-3, is that the point?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Same problem. 15-3, had Vandy right back on their heels,
could not score. All of a sudden we think we're going to become a three-point
shooting team. Oh, Lord. That's poor coaching, too.  
If you came into the conference tournament, don't know what you're trying to
do, it is pitiful on your part. They have no idea. We're out there jacking up
three balls, and we ought to have been getting it inside trying to draw fouls.  
We didn't turn the ball over. I mean, the most disturbing stat to me is just
at the end Vandy just out-rebounded us. Vandy had more heart, more character,
more of everything. And that's putting it rather nicely.  
  
Q. What did you think about Allison?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: I thought she was great. I've been trying for three years
with 17 seconds on the clock to get her to go get the ball. I can't get her.
They miss a free throw, I'm down two, and I got what I think is the best open
floor player in the conference. I'm out of timeouts. I can't get her the ball.  
Yeah, I'm a little frustrated with that.  
  
Q. Allison, at the end there, were you involved in the screen? And talk
about what happened with the jump ball.  
ALLISON HIGHTOWER: When she put it up, everybody crashed the boards. I think I
was on the floor with some Vandy players, and the ball went to them. So a jump
ball, I guess, went to them.  
  
Q. Katherine, could you talk about the close games you've been in this
year.  
KATHERINE GRAHAM: They're frustrating, but I agree with what coach said. We
just got to be more disciplined and listen to what he's saying, go out and
execute and try to win those close games.  
  
Q. Vanderbilt has a history of playing better in this tournament than in the
regular season. Is there any reason for that, do you think?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: Vandy? They got all the heart and character in the world,
and they play a matchup. But let me tell you this. I hate to say this. We
practiced for Vandy all freaking week, so that ain't an excuse.  
They come out and get in this conference tournament, and they just play their
heart out. Marsh is going to make shots; rhoads is going to play; and then
their post players were just rebounding.  
She just does a great job. That's why I pulled so hard for Arkansas last
night. They just play. They get in this baby and they bring it. They don't
overlook nobody. They play. They've had as much success as anybody in this
league in this tournament, compared to what I would say where they've been
seeded.  
They've never come in here seeded first much. They've been seeded three, four
and five. They're going to play Tennessee tomorrow night. Don't kid yourself.
They gonna play tomorrow. I don't know if they can stop the biggest giants in
the world playing women's basketball today, but they gonna play, man. Don't
worry about it. They gonna play smart.  
They ain't going to be fouling when they shouldn't be fouling. Their key
players get three fouls, they ain't taking any more fouls. They ain't going to
be trying to draw a charge. They ain't going to be blocking. They just play
smart. They play really, really smart, and they know exactly where they want
to get the ball to.  
We scored enough points to win tonight. 61 points should have won. That's
about as much as we scored, and didn't even shoot the ball really well.  
  
Q. You had such a good stretch toward the end of the season. This one game,
do you feel like you're seeing some bad habits that are coming back in this
one game?  
COACH CHANCELLOR: No. We played six great basketball games. Score is 15-3. We
played like we played the last six games. We went brain-dead somewhere in
here.  
You want to ask the players, ask them. I'm pretty frustrated.  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for the student-athletes? All right. Thank
you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Tennessee  76  
Ole Miss - 51

  
THE MODERATOR: We have with us Tennessee head Coach Pat Summitt. We'll take an
opening comment from Coach Summitt, then take questions for the players, and
then take questions for Coach Summitt.  
COACH SUMMITT: Obviously, this is the third time we played Ole Miss. I thought
we did the best job defensively. In the other two games, I wasn't as poised. I
thought tonight I thought we were much more committed to closing out long and
defending the three ball.  
Obviously we played a lot of players. We had some great possessions and we had
some ugly possessions. We got to be more efficient. I think our team
understands that.  
But overall a great win. It's hard to beat a team three times. I think we came
ready to do that tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Alyssia, you had a big scoring day. What do you attribute your scoring
production to? Why do you think you've become such a big scorer?  
ALYSSIA BREWER: I mean, I think it's been some of the confidence factor,
having confidence in my shot. Also as a team, whenever we start moving, it
opens different shots for each of us. I think we did a good job of that
tonight.  
  
Q. Alicia, could you talk about the team's defense against Thomas.  
ALICIA MANNING: Thomas is a great player. She uses her screens really well. It
makes it difficult to guard. And she has so many different calibers of her
game. She can drive, shoot.  
Our defense, we were really focusing on limiting her touches, keeping a hand
in her face at all times, getting in her shooting rhythm so she couldn't get
her shots off. I think we did a pretty good job of doing that.  
  
Q. Alicia, you have a nose for the ball. Every time the ball would pop into
your hands. How do you explain that?  
ALICIA MANNING: I guess I just kind of watch how the ball bounces off. You can
tell if it's going towards the left side, it's most likely going to bounce off
to the right. Just reading how the ball hits.  
  
Q. Could you address the physical nature of the game. Seemed to be a lot of
contact out there. Also you seemed to hurt your finger when you were going up
in the first half.  
ALICIA MANNING: It's fine. I just kind of got it tangled up.  
You know, Ole Miss is a really aggressive team. We just had to match that, try
to be more aggressive than them. So, yeah, there's going to be fouls that you
like and don't like, but you just got to stay focused on the game and stay in
the present.  
ALYSSIA BREWER: I mean, it's been tough for us for a lot of games. The SEC is
a tough conference, difficult battles practically every single night. You just
take it how it comes to you.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll release the student-athletes. Questions for Coach
Summitt.  
  
Q. It seemed like the game was getting a little too physical there for a
while. Does that concern you from maybe the injury factor?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, it was a physical game. Seeing that as a coach, coaching
staff, you don't want anyone to get hurt in those conditions.  
But I think both teams were very aggressive and played really, really tough on
the screens and all their actions. So it was a very physical game, I thought
more so in the second half than the first half.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think it worked to our advantage because we had talked
about, you know, the first two times that we played them, we didn't do a great
job at all on the three ball. Defended it better this afternoon than we have
at any other time.  
I mean, at their place, it was like we were giving up, you know, 20 threes,
and, you know, coming back to Knoxville we gave up a lot of threes.  
Coming here, we were committed to defending the three ball. I thought we had
more success today than in the first two outings.  
Obviously, they played a game yesterday. So, you know, that again was an
advantage for us.  
  
Q. You said after the last Ole Miss game you were looking for a sense of
urgency. In the first half you saw that. Going forward, how nice was that to
see?  
COACH SUMMITT: It was great to see us coming out and having the level of
commitment on the defensive end. We did a better job on the boards. I think
they understood by looking statistically at the last two games that we really
needed to be a great defensive team this afternoon, a lot better.  
  
Q. How much does it help the team motivation-wise when you look out there
and see that much orange? I only saw a little pocket of Ole Miss fans on the
side. Does it give your team a lift?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, there's no doubt. I mean, fortunately our fans travel
with us. They go on the road. They're passionate. They're very invested. They
know the team. They know the coaches. I'm sure they know all the sets that we
run.  
No, our fans are tremendous. Over the years, we've continued to build a fan
base. We have people come from all over the country. It's really neat. It's
something we don't ever want to take for granted.  
Joan Cronan is out here. She can tell you that we've recruited a lot of
people, too, to come in and be a part of our program in a lot of different
ways.  
  
Q. Pat, any reason why you can't get this performance and effort from Brewer
from here on out?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, that's up to Brewer. You know, I can kind of try to
motivate her a little bit. But I think she is motivated. I think she's really
at a good place with her post game. Just has done a great job of understanding
not only the post game, but she's becoming a better defender for us in the
paint.  
I think that helps to have Kelly and Alyssia. And Brewer, obviously her
athleticism, she came in and did some good things. With Alyssia, she's very
invested in helping this team win. You can see it, you can hear it. I'm very
pleased with that.  
  
Q. Players have come on for you in the second half. If they hadn't done
that, your team would be in a much different position.  
COACH SUMMITT: I think they've stepped up. I think Taber Spani stepped up. You
know, you can look at what Alicia has done. Yes, she got in the gym and went
to work, and that's made a big difference. I think Alyssia, she's got a good
feel for the game with her back to the basket.  
But those two have been very efficient for us, which has really helped us. I
think that takes a lot of pressure off of our perimeter game when we can get
inside and get results.  
  
Q. What's the tradition now as far as looking ahead to your next opponent?
Will you watch here? Will you watch on TV? Do you watch as a team?  
COACH SUMMITT: I think our team will come back and watch. I'll probably go
watch. I won't be in the audience. I'll go back and watch from the hotel, but
my staff will be here watching.  
  
Q. Looked like Manning was hitting the shot from the baseline today. Seems
like right now the only flaw in her game is when she drives. She doesn't seem
to have the same shooting touch as she does other times. Have you noticed
that?  
COACH SUMMITT: Well, I think when she's attacking the paint, sometimes she's a
little bit out of control. But she's got a good pull-up game I think. She's
got to have composure when she goes in there facing defenders. That's
sometimes when she'll get the shot blocked or be a little hesitant.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Vanderbilt  63  
LSU - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us from Vanderbilt, head Coach Balcomb and student-
athletes. Coach, if you make an opening statement.  
COACH BALCOMB: I just liked their defensive effort tonight. Thought we did a
great job knowing where certain people were, taking their strengths away, and
then rebounding. When we out-rebound people, we have a great shot.  
So (indiscernible) one shot and a tough shot, and I thought that kept us in
the game all night.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the coach or student-athletes.  
  
Q. Early in the first half down 12 points, talk about the team battling
back.  
COACH BALCOMB: Well, we've been struggling with leads this year. So I decided
to remind them it's hard to hold leads, and that they're probably going to get
tentative and start to hold leads.  
So I tried to put them in their shoes and say, Hey, they're going to be
tentative. We have to get aggressive, and the aggressor is going to win. I
thought every time we got down, we got real aggressive, and the two sitting
next to me got very aggressive.  
Jence was driving it to the basket or dumping it to Hannah down low.  
  
Q. Do you think the experience last night helped you down the stretch in
this game?  
COACH BALCOMB: Absolutely. I always think when you play a game on this court
it helps you because you've won a game on this court. So they have the first-
round jitters and we're already in the second round. I think mentally you can
have an advantage.  
  
Q. Coach, this is the fourth consecutive time you've beaten LSU in the SEC.
Do you have some secret of beating LSU now?  
COACH BALCOMB: No. But I do I think it's mental going into the game. I think,
you know, when you have any kind of mental edge at this time of the year and
they know that they've been beaten last year when we beat 'em and we beat 'em
in the final, and recently we've beaten 'em, so I think they know we've won a
lot of games in these tournaments.  
We're confident. Maybe they're a little more hesitant. It can never hurt you -
put it that way.  
  
Q. For coach and the players, could you kind of address the challenge of
having to play three games in a row, and against a team as good as
Tennessee.  
JENCE RHOADS: Well, I mean, obviously it will be a challenge because that's a
lot of games and a lot of minutes.  
But it's a tournament time. That's what you do. We came here to play. We're
excited. We'll be going off adrenaline, so I don't think it will be a problem.  
HANNAH TUOMI: I think it's going to come down to the toughest team who battles
the hardest will come out with the win.  
COACH BALCOMB: You know, I always look at it kind of oddly. We practiced a lot
for three hours, and I would say that that's harder -- and we do it every day,
day after day. A 40-minute game or a 45-minute game yesterday, I'd say it's
not as hard. The games are easier than practices. That's the way I always look
at it. They should be ready to go, because they had a shorter day than
practice.  
  
Q. This is for the players. You start out the season probably not clicking
on all cylinders. As the season goes along, when Vanderbilt gets into the SEC
tournament, they're dangerous. Why is that?  
JENCE RHOADS: This lady. She keeps pushing us all season. Like we said,
practice every day. We eventually start clicking. The younger kids get more
minutes, then people start stepping up. This one over here plays really well.
Just by tournament time, we're ready to play.  
HANNAH TUOMI: Of course, beginning of the season is going to be rough for
every team. Coach does a really good job of pushing us. Whenever we have a
slump in the season, she makes sure we get out of that and when we get out of
the season, make sure we can be the best team we can be.  
  
Q. (Questions regarding playing in Baton Rouge a few weeks ago.)  
JENCE RHOADS: Definitely. We talked about that before the game on the bus ride
here. We didn't want to come out like we did in Baton Rouge. We weren't proud
of that game at all. It was one of our worst games all year. We wanted to get
a little bit of revenge and show them what we were really made of.  
  
Q. Hannah, you had great positioning on the floor tonight, open under the
basket. Where did you develop your hook shot?  
HANNAH TUOMI: The hook shot? Well, I believe I was about like 10 years old or
something and my dad took me in the backyard. And it was like, Here is the
first move that I shot or that he practiced. So he just showed it to me, and
I've been using it ever since.  
  
Q. This is for coach. Did an article about prepping going against
Vanderbilt. How many offenses do you actually run?  
COACH BALCOMB: One year at Xavier I was asked that, so my players counted. Out
of bounds, halfcourt, out of transition, dead ball, quick hitters, side,
under, and we had 64.  
I could tell you right now, I mean, that's why Vanderbilt was a good place for
me to coach. I had to stay with the smart girls. Right now we don't have half
as many plays. This is the least amount of plays we've ever had.  
But I always take pride in being a very tough scout, which makes it very hard
for people to play us with 24-hour notice in tournament time.  
This year we have so many players playing multiple positions, I mean, there's
some plays Jence plays the post. Hannah never plays the point. But we have so
many people. I've never had a team as versatile as this team. So we have less
plays. We're playing different spots within those plays, which takes a lot of
time.  
We generally have players playing two spots, maybe three. We have a lot of
players playing three and four spots right now.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

### [Ericka Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19263)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Georgia  73  
Alabama - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Alabama head Coach Hudson. Coach, if you could make a
comment about tonight's game.  
COACH HUDSON: Well, I think both teams played awful hard. I thought we were
prepared. Couple things could have went our way. We could have been playing
tomorrow night. But Georgia did the things they needed to do at the end of the
game to win the basketball game.  
I thought it was a hard-fought game. Both teams played hard. I thought that
our team made a step in the right direction in the last two years coming to
this tournament last year; coming into it this year was a different flavor for
us. We came in here with the idea we wanted to play. We thought we could play
and be playing on beyond the first game, and we gave that type of effort.  
I thought it was a -- should have been a good basketball game, from what
everybody is telling me.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the adjustments from your previous two meetings
leading into this game?  
COACH HUDSON: The first meeting we had with Georgia, we actually led them at
halftime. We thought we had a chance to beat them over at our place. We went
to their place, they played awful well. We didn't have a chance to beat them
after the first 15 minutes in the basketball game.  
I thought the adjustments we made, what we tried to do tonight, was make sure
we attack Georgia instead of sitting back and letting them attack us. I
thought our team did a really good job of going after Georgia and committing
to playing hard and attacking the basket, doing those type of things.  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, could you make comments on tonight's game.  
ERICKA RUSSELL: I thought we played awful hard. We played as a team. We did.
That's what coach wanted us to do. Just hate we came out with a tough loss.  
DEDREA MAGEE: I feel the same way. I mean, we fought hard from the beginning.
We made a few turnovers. That kind of hurt us a little bit. I mean, we kept up
the intensity. We just suffered with a loss tonight.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

### [Andy Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13868)

### [Meredith Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20512)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Georgia  73  
Alabama - 66

  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started. We have Georgia head Coach Landers. Coach,
make an opening comment and we'll take questions.  
COACH LANDERS: Well, it was certainly a hard-fought game. I give Alabama a lot
of credit for coming to play and being very well-prepared to play. They did,
in my view, a lot of good things and adjustments from the other two times that
we had played them defensively, and were very, very good.  
You know, I kept thinking when we pulled ahead, I think three different times
by eight or so points, that we might spread it out. But invariably it seemed
like we then would turn it over and they would hit a three and it would go
back to being close again.  
But really, really proud of our players for hanging in there and making plays
down the stretch, then for hitting the free throws, particularly Meredith and
Ashley as they finished the game out from the free-throw line.  
And pleased with the way we executed versus the press late in the game, as
well.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Meredith, what was going on in your mind when you took those last free
throws in that last minute?  
MEREDITH MITCHELL: I knew I had to knock it down to get the win. We had to go
back down and try to turn them over, try to get us up.  
  
Q. Ashley, with a minute and a half to go, it looks like you took advantage
of them running into each other. How were you able to take advantage of
that?  
ASHLEY HOUTS: Well, I think I just tried to make a play, make something
happen. It was pretty close there down to the wire. Didn't really feel too
comfortable with it being so close.  
We all made some plays. We all hit some free throws. Ended up making some key
stops and got a win.  
  
Q. Coach, how hard is it to beat a team three times in one year?  
COACH LANDERS: Well, it's hard to beat a team in this league one time in a
year. And I think the thing that we all have to safeguard against - you, our
fans, coach, players - is the expectation that we're supposed to win again
because we played well the last time that we played them.  
But I just glanced at the stat sheet. You know, I don't remember exactly, and
you may, we're 1 of 11 from three in this game. In that last game, we were
like 8 or 9 of 16 or 17 something. Crazy. You know, to expect to go out and do
that again would be very hopeful thinking.  
But it's hard, you know. From a mental standpoint, it's hard. I didn't think
that we played with a great sense of urgency on the defensive end, and I
thought that we made some poor judgments on the offensive end.  
But, you know, again, we made a lot of plays. At the end of the game, we were
everywhere that we needed to be defensively, tipping balls, deflecting balls,
stealing balls, and rebounding, which we had trouble with, particularly in the
first half.  
But, you know, it's hard to get it done, it really is.  
  
Q. What did y'all say to each other when you had the lead most of the game
and they came back and took the lead, then it was back and forth?  
ASHLEY HOUTS: I don't think we ever got down and thought that it was over. You
know, we kept fighting, back and forth there for a while. Like I said, there
were some plays that were made, some free throws hit, some shots made. We also
went back down to the other end and got some rebounds.  
I think, you know, positive from the game, we can look at it as not getting
our heads down, getting down on ourselves. We fought back and tried everything
we could to put it away.  
  
Q. Talk about the steal late in the game with Georgia leading by two.  
ASHLEY HOUTS: Yeah, I just mentioned earlier that they kind of ran into each
other at the end. She had her head turned so I tried to take advantage of
getting the steal and just swinging the momentum a little bit.  
I don't remember if we were down or we were tied or up. But thankfully we hit
some shots and made some plays that sealed it for us.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Nell Fortner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13860)

### [Jordan Greenleaf](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18036)

### [Alli Smalley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20504)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Auburn  74  
Florida - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We have with us Auburn head coach Fortner. Coach, if you could
make an opening comment, we'll take questions.  
COACH FORTNER: I thought we shot the ball really well today. That definitely
makes a big difference in a game. But it was good to see us hitting over half
of our shots.  
I thought the second half was a really good defensive effort by us. Steffi
Sorensen had a really good first half. We talked about that at halftime, that
we didn't want that to happen to us in the second, and it didn't. Felt good
about our defensive effort in the second half.  
Alli Smalley had a career day. Jordan Greenleaf continues to be a warrior for
us. In the big minutes she plays, she just anchors us down.  
I thought it was a great team effort. Everybody contributed from the starters
to the bench on down. Just a good day for us.  
But it's just one game, and time to move on.  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions.  
  
Q. Talk about how you were able to still score points with KeKe getting in
foul trouble?  
COACH FORTNER: KeKe creates a lot of problems on the floor defensively because
she is always a scoring threat. Always. So you have to pay attention to her,
usually with more than one person. So it just allowed -- opened some things up
for us on the perimeter, but I thought she did some nice things for us before
she got into foul trouble.  
What she did for us helped us win the ballgame, even though it was early.
Hopefully she can continue to be that presence for us in the paint.  
  
Q. You really haven't been a three-point shooting team all season. Did
things open up differently?  
COACH FORTNER: I think we are a three-point shooting team (laughter). We have
three-point shooters in Alli and Blanche. Those two are dangerous all the
time. We might not have shot the highest percentage we wanted to shoot. If you
start shooting it now, I'll take that. So we'll see what happens.  
  
Q. Can you talk about tomorrow's game playing Kentucky, coming off a big
win, a lot of confidence going into tomorrow's game.  
COACH FORTNER: I mean, you know, in this tournament, every team is gunning for
each other. It doesn't matter if you played them the last regular season game
or the middle. It doesn't matter. Everybody is trying to play for the same
thing, and that is to win this tournament. Doesn't matter how you come in
here. Everybody starts from the same place.  
So it's a game that we'll prepare hard for. We know that Kentucky is a really
good team. They have Player of the Year, freshman of the year, coach of the
year. My gosh, they're tremendously talented.  
But we feel good about how we're playing. We'll get out there and see what we
can do.  
  
Q. Alli, talk about your game. Have you seen that many open three-pointers
all season?  
ALLI SMALLEY: Yeah, it was actually really nice. I did have some good open
looks. That can be contributed to Jordan. She sets some great screens for me.
I was able to come off. I had a lot of open looks, a lot of air. I was able to
get the shot off.  
  
Q. Jordan, were you happy to create those looks?  
JORDAN GREENLEAF: I'm always trying to create things for Alli because I know
she's our primary scorer. The ball needs to be in her hands. I'm always
looking to screen to make sure she's open.  
  
Q. What were they doing to allow you to set those up? Was it the matchups?  
JORDAN GREENLEAF: Yeah, depending on who was guarding who. When I don't have
the ball or whatever the play is, I'm always looking to find where Alli is,
where her man is so I can get her open.  
  
Q. Can you talk about tomorrow's matchup with Kentucky.  
ALLI SMALLEY: It's a huge game for us. We just came off a win from them.
Obviously going to be tough.  
They have one of the best defenses probably in the SEC. They're hard on you, a
lot of trapping. We'll just have to prepare for that and handle their
pressure.  
JORDAN GREENLEAF: I'm excited to play them again. I'm excited to play anybody.
I think it's going to be a good game. Our whole strategy is going out there
and having fun. That's what we've been doing these past couple games. They
have a great defense, but we have a good defense, too. It's going to be a good
game, a battle of the defenses.  
  
Q. Alli, what did you do different on Steffi in the second half?  
ALLI SMALLEY: Well, we had Parrisha on her. Parrisha did a great job of
blocking her down in the second half. We weren't switching off on her. She was
chasing her the whole way, was contesting every shot, and she wasn't getting
hardly any looks. P did a great job defensively.  
  
Q. Does your guys' offensive mindset change when KeKe gets in foul trouble
and she's not getting the calls that she sometimes gets?  
ALLI SMALLEY: No.  
JORDAN GREENLEAF: Everybody kind of has a green light. If we're in a set, it
takes two people to guard KeKe. If she has two on her, somebody else is open.
Whoever has the ball, has the best look, gets the shot.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the game Blanche has.  
COACH FORTNER: I thought Blanche, she's such a great complement to Alli
because it just gives you shooters on both corners. Blanche is back at home.
Buford is right up the road, so back in her old stomping grounds. I thought
she did a good job today.  
She is a very confident shooter. Some nights she's not on, but she's a very
confident shooter. Tonight it looked good.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Vanderbilt  65  
Arkansas - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We now have with us Arkansas head Coach Collen. Coach, would
you make an opening comment about tonight's game.  
COACH COLLEN: It was a tough loss for us. I thought we came down and battled
hard, got behind by a pretty good margin twice and battled back. Got a stop,
goes into overtime.  
It's hard. You get into these kind of games, and it's all about making plays.
I mean, so it's hard.  
Give Vanderbilt credit. They got good veterans out there to make plays when
they needed to. I'm proud of the kids I got, because all our kids were making
plays, even Charity Ford over here, our freshmen and sophomores. There was a
bunch of 'em, and that's really promising for us for the future.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Could you talk about your play tonight, Charity. You seemed to be a big
part of the scrapping.  
CHARITY FORD: I just tried to make plays for my team. I just tried to go out
there and play hard today. I just feel like the game was on the line. I felt
like I had to go out there and just play hard, and the plays would come to me.  
I just went out to look hard and play through it, and it just came.  
  
Q. Dominique, you came out and showed your three-point shot tonight. Were
you feeling that shot this evening?  
DOMINIQUE ROBINSON: I think when we came to the arena, I was just private
about the whole game entirely. I was just ready to play, show my team the
heart that we have, just try to be vocal, just step up and hit shots that I
knew I could make, so... .  
  
Q. Coach, this game typified the SEC this season. Your thoughts?  
COACH COLLEN: I told our players before the game, you know, when you're
playing a 12 against a 5, if you get a win you're probably gonna be on
SportsCenter tonight, because they like to talk about the 5-12 upsets.  
In the same breath, I basically said that, you know, if you think about it,
there's not a lot of difference between a 5 and a 12. I think we proved that
tonight. I think if you look at the last week of the season, the upsets that
happened, that scrambled the seeding.  
And when you look at, I don't know whether you call them upsets or not, but
two teams won today earlier in the day that were the lower seeded teams. It's
just how good this league is from top to bottom.  
I know every other conference in this country claims they're the best from top
to bottom. I just really believe in my heart -- I know we finished in the 12
seed, and I know how good we can be on any given night.  
You know, I feel like we can play with any top 25 team in the country, except
maybe Connecticut. It's just a great conference to play in. It's hard on
coaches, hard on players, but it's a great conference to play in.

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [Steffi Sorensen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20503)

  
_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Auburn  74  
Florida - 61

  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Florida. Coach, if you could make an opening
comment and then we'll take questions.  
COACH BUTLER: We have to congratulate Auburn on a fantastic performance. They
did a great job from the beginning of the game. I felt like they were more
physical than us, dominated some statistical categories, rebounding, had some
outstanding individual categories. Alli Smalley, Jordan Greenleaf, and Blanche
Alverson all did a tremendous job. It's obviously a very disappointing loss
for us, disappointing exit from the tournament.  
We had much higher hopes than the way we performed today.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like you did what you wanted with KeKe, getting her into
foul trouble. How did Auburn adjust to her being out?  
COACH BUTLER: The guards did a great job of stepping up. Alli shot the ball
really, really well. Blanche seemed to have such timely shots as well. It's
just disappointing because they really only have two true shooters, and those
guys got shots off.  
We did do a good job of really going at KeKe, trying to neutralize her size.
It was great to have Azania back on the floor again. We had too many turnovers
in the first half, empty possessions, poor decisions in the second half,
didn't play with enough toughness and fight. Auburn's never wavered.  
  
Q. Auburn had a three-pointer every time your team tried to make a run. You
had it close to four points.  
COACH BUTLER: It did. It seemed like they had a lot of them, which is an
indicator of us not doing our job on defense. Alli and Blanche didn't do
things that we didn't expect for them to do. They did a great job of hitting
open shots.  
We didn't do a good job of getting out to them and making them adjust to our
defense. They were open, and great shooters knock down open looks when they're
not guarded.  
  
Q. Question for Steffi. What did Alli do differently on defense in the
second half?  
STEFFI SORENSEN: Obviously she switched screens. I believe they played a post
number four. I think. They put it on me. I just didn't -- I wasn't as
aggressive. You know, I came out and I shot pretty well in the first half. I
mean, I was looking for my shot. Just kind of covered it up. Looked inside.
Either took a bad shot or we turned it over or forced something up.  
Offensively the second half we didn't execute like we needed to.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

South Carolina - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We have South Carolina. Coach Staley, if you could make an
opening comment about this afternoon's game.  
COACH STALEY: We'll just take questions.  
  
Q. The final shot, the three-pointer, was that the design play or how did it
turn out?  
COACH STALEY: It was one of 'em. She was wide open. We wanted to get the ball
inside to Kelsey, but they were kind of crowding her space. They left Ieasia
wide open.  
I'm satisfied with the shot. It was on the mark. She had her feet set. Looked
like it was going in. Unfortunately for us it didn't.  
  
Q. Kelsey, your viewpoint on that last play.  
KELSEY BONE: It was a good shot. You know, she's knocked that shot down for us
several times this year. The play was to come inside for me, but we expected
for me to be crowded. So that was the shot that we needed at that time, and it
just didn't go down.  
So, like coach said, we're satisfied with who we had taking the shot. Just a
bad bounce.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH STALEY: I mean, for us, you know, we didn't shoot as many as we usually
do. You know, when you get 56 out of 53 points in the paint, that's where the
ball needs to go. And that's what our concentration was.  
Unfortunately, we didn't shoot the ball as well as we average from three. I
think Mississippi took enough of 'em or hit enough of 'em for both of us.  
  
Q. What do you have to say about the season?  
COACH STALEY: I mean, it's disappointing in my eyes. You know, although we're
not where we're used to being, we're not where we want to be, there is
progress inch by inch.  
But certainly not for the players that we have, not for the talent that we
have. We're a better team than 14-15. We got our work cut out for us in the
off-season. You know, that starts next week.  
  
Q. Same for both the players. Kelsey, what do you think of the season?  
KELSEY BONE: Definitely not where we wanted to be at the end. But I think it's
better than the previous year. So we take the good; we observe the bad; we
move forward.  
We're all making a commitment to spend our summer in Columbia to get better,
be a better team so we can be one unit next year and make more improvement.
It's all about getting better and that's our focus.  
CHARENEE STEPHENS: Like Kelsey said, we just want to get better. Coach talked
to us about getting better in the off-season. We're going to work hard and
make an effort to develop our team over the summer and in the off-season to
just be a better team coming back next year.  
  
Q. You put a pretty tough schedule together. Do you look back on that and
say that was a good thing to do, even though maybe you could have had a few
other games you might have won? Is that still a part of building towards where
you want to go with this program?  
COACH STALEY: For us, you know, we're always going to play a tough schedule.
For us, I think you just have to measure yourself in November and December so
you can be prepared for the rigors of the SEC. We don't shy away from it. I
know it's a tough conference.  
But in order for us to get better, you know, to know that there's another
level of basketball being played out there besides our conference, we got to
play them.  
I don't regret the schedule that we had this particular year. We came out of
it pretty good. You know, minus some teams that we probably should have won,
you know, I thought the schedule was right on point.  
  
Q. What do you think is the area of progress you really need to make? What
do you think are the things that need to be shaped up, and what's good that
you're going to take out of this year?  
COACH STALEY: We got to become winners. We have to have a sense of urgency. I
don't think our team had that every time we took the floor. Whether it's
youth, whatever it is. At this point, you know, when you're playing in this
league, if you can't get up to play every team in this league, then obviously
your competitive juices aren't flowing in the right place.  
So, you know, you're going to have a difficult time playing for our coaching
staff. You're going to have a difficult time just in general. Life is just not
going to be great for you because we're competitive people. You know, we want
to win every single game we go out and play.  
At the same time, you know, we did get better. It's hard to see right now
sitting here right after a loss in the SEC tournament. But we got better.
We're more talented than we were last year. We want to get more talented in
the years to come. Hopefully, as I told our crowd in Columbia, we're going to
make what we experienced here right now just a memory at some point.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Ole Miss  64  
South Carolina - 63

  
THE MODERATOR: We have Ole Miss head coach René Ladner and student-athletes
Shantell Black and Bianca Thomas. Coach, if you could start with an opening
comment.  
COACH LADNER: Just feels really good to get a win under your belt in the
Southeastern Conference tournament, whether it was by one point or by ten. The
game could have gone either way. I just believe it went to the team that made
the last play. I think that was the difference in the game. It was a good game
for both of us.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Shantell, you have the rebound. Talk me through that play a little bit.  
SHANTELL BLACK: I was just determined to do whatever it took for my team. I
rebounded the whole game. You see I didn't score that much in the first half,
but I played the role. I rebounded. I did all the dirty work. I was a trash
player basically. That paid off for us in the end.  
  
Q. Coach, the final play, getting that shot after you had made a lot of
threes all day, but being able to be in the right place at the right time.
Shantell seemed to be able to do that, get it in. It was huge.  
COACH LADNER: She recognized it. She put it in the basket, and then made her
free throw.  
She made the play when she had to. You have six seniors playing for their life
right now. I think she understood the urgency. She just made a basketball
play.  
  
Q. Bianca Thomas, South Carolina got off to a 10-0 start, you hit that
three. Do you think that helped you settle down and bounce back?  
BIANCA THOMAS: Yeah, I think so. We came out very anxious. I think we just
needed to settle down, get focused a little bit. Our shots started to fall
early on.  
  
Q. Bianca, as a shooter, does it help you play in a second game in an arena,
having got this game under your belt, to come out here tomorrow and have some
familiarity with your environment?  
BIANCA THOMAS: It only just helps. We got our first game in.  
At the same time, playing Tennessee, got to play as hard as we did the first
game. Really excited to get back out again tomorrow and compete and play hard.  
  
Q. Bianca, could you talk about playing Tennessee again. The team has played
them. You played them tough, two games. How does that maybe help you going
into a third game with them?  
BIANCA THOMAS: You know, Tennessee knows our tendencies and we know their
tendencies. They know who we have, we know who they have. It's a matter of
going out, putting the game plan together and just going out and competing. We
played them two times already. We know what to expect.  
We know we have to bring it for a full 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just address that, too. You just played Tennessee, and
four days later here they come again. Are there advantages or disadvantages
for both teams when that happens?  
COACH LADNER: Well, I'll let you know tomorrow after the game for the most
part. It's size versus speed. They're big, and we struggle with them on the
boards. We're quick. They struggle with us in penetration. It will just
probably be the team that takes care of possessions and makes the most of
them.  
They, like any other team, make mistakes as well as we do. I thought when we
played them at their place, just recently, that we did not get off to a very
good start. I think a key in playing in any game, much less playing Tennessee,
is I think you have to start off well.  
We dug a hole early with Tennessee at Tennessee. Because we don't have a lot
of depth, it will be difficult for us to play at that level of energy for any
length of time, even though we did bring it back 50-all about the 11-minute
mark.  
What our team has to do is play consistently for 40 minutes. We have a
tendency to get an eight-point lead, rest 30 seconds, and the next thing you
know, the score is tied again.  
We have to play with consistency, regardless of who the team is on the floor.
It happens to be Tennessee. We have a lot of respect for their program, and we
are going to give it our best shot.  
  
Q. Back-to-back games, is that a factor depth-wise, or maybe that would wait
for three games in three days to be more of a factor?  
COACH LADNER: I think you just have to play. You can be tired next Monday. It
doesn't matter. You play a round robin tournament, you put yourself in this
position. You owe it to yourself to leave it on the floor.  
I'm sure we'll have some heavy legs, but it doesn't matter. We have to
regroup, reload, turn around, get ready to play the next game. Hopefully play
a third game.  
  
Q. Does it worry you today getting outscored in the paint?  
COACH LADNER: Have you been following my team?  
  
Q. I haven't real closely.  
COACH LADNER: We get outscored in the paint quite often. So what we try to do
is we try to counter that with perimeter play. So it's the norm. Rebounding
has been a source for me all year, so we've decided the best thing to do is
rebound by committee. If we can do that, we'll be in good shape.  
As I said last week at Tennessee, I looked up, there's an orange jersey with
four legs. I'm not sure where we'll be, but hopefully we'll be on the interior
and we'll have an opportunity. As Shantell said, kick it out, pick up the
trash, play extremely well and extremely hard.  
  
Q. Would you speak to the competitive balance of this conference? Seems like
the lower half of this league is stronger than it's ever been. It makes pretty
much where you don't have any easy games.  
COACH LADNER: We certainly found that out this year. There's so much parity,
so much strength. Coaches are doing an outstanding job. You can look at our
season. We came out of January and just were playing really well, won five
games, then teams got better. We got more scouted. Times got tough.  
I would not suffice to say that any team in this conference could win this
championship this year. And that is a credit to the league and to the coaches,
getting the right players here.  
It's been an interesting year. I really believe this is going to continue. I
don't think it's ever going to be real top-heavy again.  
  
Q. You talked about your team playing for their lives. Are you openly
talking about what they've got to do for the NCAA, or is that sort of a given
they know that's a tough thing right now?  
COACH LADNER: I am brutally honest. So when we talk, I talk exactly about what
is going to happen if we don't take care of our business. We have put
ourselves with our backs to the wall. We had to come out and play a very tough
matchup for us. South Carolina is a tough matchup. Very well-coached, very
tough team.  
We got past one hurdle. I believe I told them several months ago if we were
going to be Southeastern Conference champions, we were going to have to put
ourselves in the right position.  
Right now we're in the position to win outright, make a run deep in the
tournament to help is advance to the NCAAs.  
  
Q. Why don't you think it would be top-heavy again in the conference?  
COACH LADNER: Because I think we are recruiting extremely well. We're getting
great athletes. Kelsey Bone was number two in the nation last year. She
immediately changes South Carolina's program. We're getting good players, TV
coverage. Players want to play in the Southeastern Conference because they're
going to be seen on television.  
Again, we are the toughest conference top to bottom, as is evident in our
standings this year. I'm not sure that any other conference can say that.
Maybe the Big 12. We're comparable to them.  
I just think it's good coaches, excluding myself. I'm talking about those
others out there. And good players. We're very competitive. We have the
resources to be good and to bring great players. I just believe that it's no
longer just the LSUs, Tennessees getting the key players. Now you're seeing
teams on the bottom, quote unquote, rise to the occasion, as is Kentucky.
They've gotten an exceptional group of athletes. A A'dia Mathies is an
outstanding freshman to go with the others.  
You get one or two key players, they can turn a program in a hurry. I think
we're all getting that right now. I think that's why there will be more
parity.  
  
Q. Shantell, have you ever had a bigger rebound? What does this mean to you
coming home and getting a win like this?  
SHANTELL BLACK: I think that was the biggest rebound of my career playing
basketball. It just feels great to come back and do that in front of my home
state and family and friends.  
  
Q. Shantell, getting behind 10-0, what did the team do to keep together like
that to make the end possible?  
SHANTELL BLACK: I think we just stayed with the game plan. I think Bianca
sparked us with that three. We just took it over from there, never looked
back.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_DULUTH, GEORGIA_  
  

Vanderbilt  65  
Arkansas - 64

  
THE MODERATOR: We've got Vanderbilt head coach Melanie Balcomb. Coach, if you
could make an opening comment about tonight's game.  
COACH BALCOMB: I just felt it was a tremendous game on both team's part. I
thought both teams fought very hard on both ends of the floor and made big
plays when they needed it. It was a tough game I think for anybody to lose.
You hate to see anybody lose a game like that.  
But somebody has to move onto the next round. As even a game as I've ever been
in.  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, there's been a lot of talk about the parity in the SEC this year.
Did the seeding make any difference?  
COACH BALCOMB: No. That's the way it's been all year. When you look at the
scores every night, I can't believe this score and that score. Everybody has
been surprised all year. Nothing is going to surprise us.  
We had a really tough time at Arkansas, as well. I knew in a one-and-done
situation this might be the most exciting SEC tournament that we've
experienced.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what your game plan was for the overtime.  
COACH BALCOMB: Keep the ball in Jence's hands as long as I could.  
You know, really shutting down their three. They hit huge shots from three.
Then they went into the post, and the post was scoring. It was tough to make a
defensive game plan. When we doubled, they kicked out three. We were trying to
make game-time changes all night on offense and defense.  
I think we hit a spurt on offense where we couldn't make a shot and that hurt
us and they got the lead.  
I loved our fight back in that situation to get it to go to overtime.  
  
Q. How important is this game to LSU tomorrow?  
COACH BALCOMB: I'm always one of those people that thinks about the positive
not the negative. Going in, what I like is that we've already played on this
court, so this is our home court now and they're just playing their first
game. That's the way I look at it.  
We already have our feet wet on a neutral court and are comfortable, and a
victory on it. Sometimes I will take that, if you look at it in the scheme of
things.  
We take one game at a time. You always want rest if you can have it. I like
that we've won on this court already and feel comfortable on it.  
  
Q. Rebecca, your post play has improved considerably. Can you talk about the
change.  
REBECCA SILINSKI: It's just all about confidence in practice and being
prepared for the game-time situations, and then going in knowing that I'm
ready to be able to play and to contribute, so...  
  
Q. I haven't looked at the box scores yet. Jence, are you high scorer?  
JENCE RHOADS: Yeah.  
  
Q. High scorer again. What do you have to say about how difficult this game
was tonight?  
JENCE RHOADS: Arkansas battled. It was a battle from tip to end. They are a
good team. Even though they were the 12 seed, they came to play. They gave us
a good game, and luckily we were able to come out on top.  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.
