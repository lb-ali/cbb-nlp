# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 17, 2019

  

### [Kelvin Sampson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13715)

### [Armoni Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36870)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Cincinnati - 69, Houston - 57  
  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: Yes, we've had three terrific games with Cincinnati, at
our place, at their place, and today. Obviously, that's a difficult team to
have to beat three times, especially over the course of five or six weeks.
Watching how well they played today -- and you can see how well we played the
other two times when we beat them.  
  
But congratulations to Coach Cronin. I thought his kids really, really were
ready to play. You could tell that they were -- had a bit of an ax to grind. I
thought we got on our heels but we came back, you know. And when they elbowed
us, Corey went to the line and made two. I think that cut it to -- what did
that cut it to -- four. And then Corey had two great looks from the three-
point line, but I thought Corey played tired, you know, he just looked tired
today.  
  
But I think Cincinnati's defense had a lot to do with that, too. So, tough
game, we move on. I'm looking forward to five o'clock to see what seed we are,
what bracket we're in, where we're going. I'm a lot more excited about that
than I'm disappointed about this game.  
  
Q. Kelvin, sometimes it's a make or miss. Was it a lot of that today,
just make or miss for you guys?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: Yeah, they played good defense. But that's the third
time we've played them. I thought we were the two best teams in the league. We
would have liked to have won today. But Dejon and Nate -- we can play a lot
better than we did today. We didn't play very well.  
  
But I thought Cincinnati did. Mick he got us off balance with the way he
played Cumberland. Cumberland hit some tough shots. He hit some really, really
tough shots. There won't be a lot of days where Corey Davis goes 2 for 10, 3
for 13. He's a lot better than that obviously.  
  
Q. What was different in today's game that was different from playing
Memphis yesterday?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: What was different? I think any time you play three
games in three days, it's a bit of a crap shoot. Memphis played a lot of small
ball yesterday. The last -- I think the last two times we played Cincinnati,
we out-rebounded them. It seems like whoever out-rebounds the other team
usually wins this match-up. They out-rebounded us today. I think we out-
rebounded them -- we were plus 14 at their place, so they got the better of us
today.  
  
Congratulations and I hope Cincinnati has a deep run in the tournament, as I
do us.  
  
Q. Coach, when you took Corey out with 3:20 left, what did you tell him
at that point?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: I started to pull him at halftime. John was in there --
I knew he was hurt before the game. I didn't -- you know, Corey is not going
to complain. Maybe I didn't understand the extent. But when I went in at
halftime, he said, Coach, it is really sore. It was his hip, can't remember
left hip, right hip. But John was giving him a lot of treatment.  
  
I said, Look, Corey, this game is not near as important as the one next week.
I don't want you to run the danger of getting that thing hurt worse. Why don't
you just go ahead and sit out the half.  
  
Then sometimes coaches have to save them from themselves. I don't remember how
much time was left. I started thinking about taking him around the six-minute
mark, five-minute mark. Finally by the time the horn blew, I think there was
3:30, something like that. But I told him how much I appreciated him as I do
all our seniors Galen, Corey, Breaon, they have all been tremendous. We have a
lot to look forward to this next week.  
  
Q. Coach, in addition to that, you dealt with some other injuries in the
second half plus foul trouble, correct?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: Yes.  
  
Q. What were the other injuries you had at that point?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: Fabian had a knot about the size of a plum on his elbow,
so we sat him out. Somebody else got out, we had two or three injuries. Yeah,
Jarreau had hurt his knee, he sprained his medial collateral a couple of weeks
ago, and he banged it today. We were limping there. When you look at the
score, we got beat by 12, it felt a lot worse, but it was a 12-point game.  
  
Again, we've had a tremendous year. 31 and 3, getting excited about five
o'clock. I'm not going to spent too many minutes thinking about this game.
Just excited about what's coming up.  
  
Q. Armoni, what do you take away from this game?  
ARMONI BROOKS: We have to come ready to play each and every day. We can't use
three games in three days as an excuse on why we didn't come out and execute
our game plan and play the way we normally play. We have to use it as a
learning experience and try to move on and take whatever we got from this game
and don't let it happen again.  
  
Q. Are you concerned about any of these injuries having lingering
effects going forward?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: Not really, no. If you lose the first game, you go home.
Nobody talks about you losing this game. You lose the first one, you're done,
you go home and you rest. We won our first one. Then we won the second one.
Had we lost yesterday, and gone home, we wouldn't be sitting here. We came
here 29 wins and we left with 31.  
  
I think Corey's -- I'm not sure the extent of Corey's -- I haven't talked to
John. It might be a hip strain, which -- I'm hoping we don't play till Friday.
I hope we're in the Friday bracket. That gives us an extra day of rest. The
Thursday bracket means you have to leave probably, depending on where they
send you, Tuesday or Wednesday. Tomorrow's Monday. It's a fast week for us.
Those teams in the other conferences that lost the first day or second day,
they've been home resting for a couple of days, whereas we don't get the
benefit of doing that.  
  
Just proud of my team. Proud of them all year. Proud of them this week. Proud
of them Friday, Saturday, and proud of them today. We -- our kids kept
fighting. Cincinnati was a better team today. So hats off to them and
congratulations to Mick and his group.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 17, 2019

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Justin Jenifer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36831)

### [Jarron Cumberland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36832)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Cincinnati - 69, Houston - 57  
  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Again, congratulations to Houston. I wish them all the best
in the NCAA Tournament. They're an excellent team. Today showed us what we are
capable of when we defend and rebound at an elite level. To hold Houston to
30.6 percent is an unbelievable job by the kids defensively. And on top of
that, to be able to limit their second-chance points, that was huge. We tried
to take the paint away from them as much as we could and made some adjustments
with our game plan.  
  
The staff did a great job and the kids worked it out to perfection. We were
able to control the tempo and make it hard on them. A lot of communication to
play the way we played defensively. It's not an easy thing to do to play the
way we play and also, you know, it's hard to beat a great team like that. But
hopefully this shows our guys what we're capable of for next week.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you need to do better to go further and advance?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: You have to be able -- first of all, you have to realize
everybody you play is a good team once you get to March. And it's been that
way all week. What's helped us is our late season schedule was brutal. We were
really back-loaded in the American, and it taught us a lot about ourselves,
and it made us come together as a group.  
  
You could fall apart as well, but we got a lot of good kids on this team that
have got great character, and they played with a lot of pride. You can talk
about those things as a coach all you want, because really every coach talks
about them, but you have to have guys on your team that have it, that play to
win, that play for each other, that do hard things.  
  
But to really answer your question, you've got to be hard to beat, okay?
You've got to be hard to beat. You can't give up layups, you have to block
out, you can't make dumb fouls. And then you try to maximize your potential on
offense. Cane Broome had it going yesterday, Justin Jenifer had a great game
against SMU, Jarron closed it out, and obviously Jarron was off the charts
today. But Cane had his moments and knocked down a few big shots from the
three-point line; he's 2 for 2 from the three-point line.  
  
You have to try to continue to get better. The last thing I would tell you
that we have talked about as a team is that we have to be unsatisfied. We've
got to put this to bed. And we have a team dinner tomorrow night and we have
to make a pact that we've got to be hungry, and we've got to be the hardest
team to beat that plays in the NCAA Tournament. You can control that. You
can't control where the ball goes in.  
  
You have to have guys that -- Justin goes 6 for 6, Jarron is superhuman, but
you can control your effort. You can control your game plan and execution. It
doesn't take any talent to set a screen or to block out. It takes a lot of
fortitude and character when you are playing a team that plays as hard as
Houston. So, hopefully, we learn what we're capable of.  
  
Q. Talk about Bearcat Nation today.  
COACH MICK CRONIN: It's always great to have your fans here. We appreciate. We
have been on a great run as a program, and it's great to know that people
appreciate it. That's my stand, my side of it. I'm sure for these guys, it's
got to be motivating, right?  
  
JARRON CUMBERLAND: It meant a lot for us to have them there and hear them
cheering for us.  
  
JUSTIN JENIFER: Having our fans here is always great. It's like a home game.
At home games, they always give us goosebumps every time you make a shot, all
the fans going crazy and stuff like that. Having our fan base there, cheering
us on helped out with the win today.  
  
Q. Because of what left last year, you were written off before the
season started. How much does it mean to be back-to-back tournament champs and
to leave that stamp that you didn't -- there wasn't a letdown, you guys didn't
slide back, this meant something to you?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: It's meant a lot. Like you said, a lot of people wrote us off
in the beginning of the season. We always told ourselves we like being
underdogs, we give it everything we have. Today, no matter who hit shots
today, we focussed on defense and played with Bearcat toughness. We knew we
were going to get the win today.  
  
Q. Any of the adjustments you mentioned that you are willing to share?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Yeah, better job coaching.  
  
Didn't get the job done. You guys see me, what you only see is me on these
guys on game day. They know how much harder I am on myself than I am on then.
Thank goodness I have a daughter, so I have to soften up and let it go. I'm
not like that 24/7. We did a much better job of team defense today, and I just
always believe that although we might have had a good game plan last week, or
whatever we stressed, we obviously didn't get it done. Sports is a get-it-done
world. When you get into March, it is one-and-done. We tried to play better
team defense. When you are playing great teams -- I learned this in the Big
East. Sometimes you have to pick your poison. So, if you run around trying to
stop threes and layups, you end up giving up both.  
  
And today we wanted to make sure we didn't give up layups and do the best we
could at getting to their shooters and not let the court be spread out and
wide-open for them. Because they got too many guys that can carve you up in a
one-on-one. The last thing was not a secret. We trapped Corey Davis some to
try to get the ball out of his hands. You already saw that one.  
  
Better coaching, to be -- that is how I look at it. So, fans get upset we lose
a game, it doesn't bother me because I know I'm more upset at myself than they
are. That's just how I look at it. I always look at what I need to do to do a
better job and what the staff needs to do, so I always take responsibility.
And that's how you become a better coach. That is how I try to teach these
guys that is how you become a better player.  
  
And I'd like to add -- I told the guys yesterday, it is nothing against
Memphis, we need to root for Houston, because that will make us a better team.
If you win a title, you want to beat the best team.  
  
Q. Mick, did you consider wearing green today?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Don't own any. I will say it had to help a little bit,
right? Luck of the Irish -- they have no idea what you're talking about.
(Laughter).  
  
Although Jarron's mom is from Ireland, just so you know. What's your mom's
maiden name?  
  
Is Foster Irish? Jarron's mom's part-Irish. I don't own any of those, Scott,
to be honest, with you, I don't think.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 16, 2019

  

### [Kelvin Sampson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13715)

### [Fabian White, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36856)

### [Corey Davis Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36857)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Houston, 61 - Memphis, 58  
  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: I thought our defense was outstanding for most of the
game. You know, our biggest challenge was just keeping Martin off the free
throw line. He's a veteran, has a lot of moxie, is very clever, knows how to
get fouled, knows how to draw fouls. As we saw tonight, when you got to the
free throw line, it's important to make them. He scored 23 points but he was 5
for 24, but the total 12 for 14 was problematic for us.  
  
But most of our wounds were self-inflicted. We had some kids that just didn't
play with a lot of confidence, for whatever reason. You know, this isn't
rocket science. Sometimes that unguarded 15-foot shot can be daunting and
that's kind of what we made it tonight.  
  
But credit Penny's kids. Penny inherited a situation that I don't think's
easy. He inherited a really good team. You know, he's very fortunate to
inherit the five guys that started tonight. Usually when you have a coaching
change, you don't inherit a very good team, but he did. What I thought that
Penny did a great job was to integrate those young kids with those guys.
That's not always easy to take five seniors and five young kids and make them
a team and that's -- I thought Penny, I thought he was outstanding. We hadn't
seen Memphis since first week in January, I think. And it was obvious that
he'd done a really good job with this team.  
  
But proud of my team. I'm not going to sit here and overevaluate tournaments,
Conference tournaments, not when every time I go back to my room and
everybody's losing and being sent home and we won. So I thought it was a great
defense on that last possession. I didn't think about fouling. I've said, I've
had moments where I have thought about fouling, but not there. I wanted to
make sure we didn't foul them. So helps to make free throws, though.  
  
Q. Kelvin, was this one of your toughest games of the season if not the
toughest game especially that second half?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: Define "toughest game"?  
  
Q. In terms of intensity of the crowd (no microphone).  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: Yes. Usually when you get to Conference tournament, you
don't play a road game -- that's unique. If you look at the SEC, the SEC is a
national, the ACC is in Charlotte -- who am I missing -- Big East Madison
Square Garden -- who else am I missing? Big Ten. I don't know where they are
-- Chicago maybe, Indianapolis?  
  
That had a factor. The good thing about when you get to the NCAA Tournament,
you're on neutral courts. That crowd was a factor tonight. I thought they
bullied Memphis. We got up 13, I think we were at 13 with about five or six
minutes to go, maybe. And then that's when we started missing the free throws.
And, you know, like I said, if we're up 11, we miss two and they make two, now
it's nine, you know. We started playing that game way too much. You make your
free throws, you probably go and win by 10 to 12.  
  
But like we've done for most of the year, we had some games we had no business
winning. We're not -- it's not like we are some juggernaut. We never said we
were. We could have easily lost to St Louis, we were down 15 to LSU and came
back and won. Had those games been on neutral court, we probably would have
lost them, but we were at home. When you are at home, sometimes your fans are
a huge, huge advantage. And we beat LSU because we played them at home. Had we
played on neutral court -- the same with St Louis.  
  
So -- but that is why you have nine road games and nine home games in
Conference play. Next year when we go to Fort Worth, it will be a true
Conference tournament because it will be a true neutral site like this game
coming up, Wichita State playing Cincinnati in Memphis. That is a neutral
site.  
  
I told Penny after the game that I admired the job he's done. He really has,
that's not easy to inherit. He inherited a good team, I'm not saying he didn't
inherit a good team. To integrate those new guys with these veterans, he did
it seamlessly, so a lot of respect for him for doing that.  
  
Q. Coach Sampson, near the end of the game, you were running that five-
guard line-up before inserting Fabian back in. How do you think that five-
guard line-up performed while they were on the court today?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: If they made their free throws, it would have been
outstanding. Are you a golf fan? When a guy shoots 61 and 60, what does he
shoot the next day? 72, 69, 73. They're human beings. Nate Hinton yesterday
looked like, I don't know, you know, a lottery pick. Today he was in the
witness protection program. (Laughter).  
  
I couldn't find him. Where was he? But that's -- these are lessons. Basketball
is a hard game. It wasn't as easy as we made it look yesterday. We're not
nearly as good as we played yesterday. Connecticut is not nearly as bad. One
team is playing downhill, the other team is playing uphill, you will have a
score discrepancy like we had. Sometimes these kids think they are -- and the
good Lord will say, I'm going to humble you. Do not disrespect this game. It
will get you. But when you shoot 14 for 27 from the free throw line, you
usually lose those games. We found a way to win them because our defense was
good.  
  
Q. Two questions: One, did it feel like in the second half that the
other Memphis players kind of got caught waiting for Jeremiah to do something?
And then, secondly, they're not going to be on the NCAA bubble after this
loss, which means he will never get to the NCAA tournament. Any sympathy for
another guy that's got a great game, that is not going to get to experience
that?  
COREY DAVIS, JR.: To answer your first question, Jeremiah had it going
honestly from the start of the game, so they were nit-picking when he got the
ball and let him do what he does best because he is an amazing basketball
player. He can play out the dribble, shoot the ball, draw fouls, and he was
doing that very well tonight. I'm actually good friends with Jeremiah, so to
know that he won't be able to make it to the NCAA tournament, it is sad, but
not to -- I don't want to not go to the Championships. It's a win-win
situation.  
  
Q. Coach, Memphis never got over 25 percent shooting for the game, what
did you do defensively to keep them off track?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: Let's be honest. This was our third game in three days.
I'm sure that that played a factor. They had some shots that they would
normally make. That's why -- the Conference tournament is an outlier. I don't
know that we always crown our best team. Sometimes it's, you know -- Memphis
is a good team. They've been a good team for about a month and a half, maybe
two months now. You could see them getting better and better and better.  
  
But if you are one of the top four teams, it is difficult to win four games in
four days. Your kids play as hard as they play, it's hard for them to be good.
I'm not going to take credit for that shooting percentage. I think fatigue on
their part probably had a lot to do with it, too. Not to take anything away
from our kids, but they are a lot better than that.  
  
Q. Fabian, can you speak to how difficult -- when Memphis was coming
back down the stretch, how difficult it was to play in that kind of
environment especially at the line, when everything is going the Tigers'
way?  
FABIAN WHITE, JR.: Well, at the line, when the first one feels good and you
miss it, the second one kind of gets to you. But the crowd, the energy that
they had and the way Corey was going to the boards helped out with them coming
back. Because without those second-chance points, I don't know if they had
been in the same position as they were today.  
  
Q. Corey, I hope you don't mind the question. I wonder if you could
compare -- you got called for a charge in the last minute here -- compare it
to the charge that got called in the last second at the Temple game?  
COREY DAVIS, JR.: Honestly, I don't have an explanation for one of those. I
mean, that's a discipline thing on my part. Both times -- I've been told many
times in practices go vertical instead of trying to go forward, and they seem
to catch me in those positions a lot. So that is discipline on my part and I
have to do a lot better there.  
  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: We won one and lost one, that was good.  
  
Q. This is for Corey and Fabian. Whether you are active on the court or
sitting on the bench, do you think it is more exciting as a team or do you
guys get more excited about a great offensive play or a great defensive play
and whey is that?  
COREY DAVIS, JR.: Honestly, I don't think we weigh them any differently. Other
players are good players and we want to be successful. We like to see each
other be successful, so our energy never changes when it's offense or defense.
It is one of those things that we level out and treat the same.  
  
FABIAN WHITE, JR.: Same thing, of course. But we get extra hype when we got a
stop because that is what we pride ourselves on, defense. When we get a good
stop and we are able to go down the other end and get a good offensive play,
we pride it on defense so we get excited on that.  
  
Q. Coach, does Corey get enough credit for his efficiency? If you look
at the shots some other star guards need to have that kind of impact and what
he is able to do with his efficiency?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: Yes, it's been fun to watch Corey's improvement since
the first day he's stepped on campus. His personality is like his game. He
doesn't have any highs or lows. Some kids are so emotional, they are like on
the 85th floor and when things go wrong, they are in the basement. Corey is
the same kid and that carries over to his game. He's -- he never has a bad
practice or a bad game. Some days are better than others, he is a human being.
He doesn't force things. We try to get him the ball and keep the ball in his
hands because he's an 88 percent free throw shooter, but they were doing a
good job of denying him. Other guys have to make their free throws too.  
  
Corey is just solid. He is an outstanding player. I thought he was the best
player in this league this year, at both ends. He is an excellent two-way
player, plays both ends the same.  
  
Q. When you won as many games as you guys have, how hard is it to
maintain levels of consistency every night?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: That's a great question. You know, I think you focus on
who you are. I don't -- I was sitting here looking at our record, 31-2. That's
surreal. The Final Four team we had was 31-5, something like that. This team
has been so good, just about every night, at one end of the floor. We're a
good offensive team, but we're not a juggernaut. We don't have a lot of great
shooters.  
  
I think we focus so much on the process, you know, and the -- how we get good.
We never -- we have a ritual after the game. I go in and put a record on the
board, our overall record, our Conference record, and I put who we play next.
The one I focus on -- kids are going to get their cue from their coach. That's
the way it's always been. We just always move to the next game. Like, we're
going to play the winner of Cincinnati and Wichita State. So, nobody mentioned
our record or any of that.  
  
We've got to go back and get ready for the next game and tomorrow is also
Selection Sunday. We're in the same position last year. We played in the
Championship game and -- Orlando -- and went up to a suite in that arena and
found out where we were going and we will do the same thing tomorrow. We are
very much a process team. We focus on -- we've been doing this from day one.
Our first, our first big win this year was at BYU on the road. And ever since
then, it's the next game, next game, next game.  
  
That's why -- it's always amazing to me that finality of a season. You always
focus on the next practice, the next game, the next meeting, the next this,
the next that and all of a sudden it's over. I've got a great group of young
men, I'm very honored and lucky to be able to coach them every day and it's
been a fun ride and we'll ride it as long as we can.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 16, 2019

  

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

### [Samajae Haynes-Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36860)

### [Markis McDuffie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30785)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Cincinnati, 66 - Wichita State, 63  
  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: I think our inability to score at the beginning of the
second half -- obviously Cincinnati did some nice adjustments at half-time and
we went into a lull there and couldn't get a good look. And that was the
difference in the game, that run. You know, there were some -- we were one
play short against a very, very good team, against a well-coached team,
against a team that is going to go to the NCAA tournament and go very deep.  
  
I'm proud of my guys, how far they've come and how far they continue to grind
every day, to try to find a way to get better. And it's been very rewarding to
watch just the individuals as well as the team collectively improve to get to
this point where we were one play shy of playing for a Championship.  
  
Q. Coach, heading into next season, how do you use this run as in the
AAC Tournament as a positive and how do you run off of it?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: What we'll use as an impetus for us going forward is
what I just touched on, the improvement of our team. We were -- we played some
ugly basketball at times early this year. Our first game, we lost at home to
Louisiana Tech, they came in with a bunch of seniors, we played awful and they
played very well. And they, it wasn't even a one-possession game. They just
beat us. It wasn't close. I mean, even when we lose at home, usually -- and we
have lost at home -- we lost to Cincinnati last year on Championship Saturday
or Sunday. But usually it's a one-possession game just like today. But that
didn't happen. They beat us soundly and then we start the Conference play 1
and 6, but they didn't throw in the towel.  
  
They continued to work, they continued to believe that we could get better,
and we wanted to be playing our best basketball in March. So I'm going to
leave it up to my guys. There will be some type of post-season play. There may
be multiple offers to play in post-season. And if they want to do that, we'll
do it. If they want to hang up their shoes this time of year, that's up to
them. But it's been fun coaching them. They're a great group.  
  
And these two seniors to my left have been dynamic leaders. They never quit on
the young guys. They always were positive, despite the fact that there were
times when we didn't really see much to be positive about. They led by
example. But they were the impetus for us turning this thing around, just
continuing to grind and teach the young guys what can be accomplished through
hard work, effort, energy, passion and toughness.  
  
Q. I got two questions. You started talking about it at the end. In a
year with a lot of roster turnaround, Markis was the only returning player.
What has it been like to have Markis? And what legacy have you left looking
back on your years here?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Markis was a tremendous recruit from us, he had a lot of
good offers. He was a long way from home. Almost didn't make his recruiting
trip because of some plane issues. I think they were stranded in Cleveland or
Chicago. They almost turned around and went home; almost didn't make the trip.
We begged him to fight through those travel issues. Markis never has a bad
day. He's amazing and his joie de vivre is incredible. He is fun to be around.
He can engage anyone. He's got a huge heart. And it's been a joy to coach him.  
  
I've watched him transform from this skinny 17-year-old freshman that
resembled Gumby to a guy who has muscles in all different places. He's become
a better athlete and is ready to take his game into the next level. I'm
excited for where that is going to lead. So he's been a joy to coach and never
one time has he given us half effort. He's always given us complete effort, so
coachable, and he's got a very, very bright future and I'm going to be excited
to watch where that goes.  
  
MARKIS MCDUFFIE: Like you said, I just want to be remembered as someone who --
you know, as a role model pretty much to all the guys, all the people who
support me and appreciate me and just, you know, fans favorites. Even the guys
that I've led -- me and Samajae this year. I just want to be remembered as
someone who is always positive, always worked super hard and never let
anything get to me, you know. And I just continue to work and continue to
overcome adversity and just my enthusiasm and my energy pretty much. And who I
am as a person.  
  
Q. Coach, at the end of the season, how do you look ahead to next
season? Who is possibly going to be your leader heading into the 2019-2020
season?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: I don't want to assign captains or anything like that. I
like to let that naturally happen. Everyone will figure out who the leaders
are when that leader emerges. It's going to be a whole lot different. We won't
have these guys, but we've got a lot of returning talent. And these young guys
have got a lot of -- just like Markis was the Rookie of the Year in the
Missouri Valley Conference, we have a lot of guys that have played a ton of
minutes and I think we have a bright future.  
  
We're going to add several pieces to our nucleus returning and -- again, I
don't know what post-season play holds for us, but these guys will get back in
the gym at some point this spring, and we're going to go to work. We're going
to try to change their bodies and change their games and improve them as
individuals, and I look forward to what we've got coming back.  
  
Q. Markis, as I have mentioned in a previous press conference, sounds
like there's a lot of Wichita State fans out there supporting you guys. What
message do you have to the fans who have made the trip out here to Memphis?  
MARKIS MCDUFFIE: I want to say thank you so much. These fans are amazing. In
my four years, I don't regret anything, you know. These people have supported
me and this basketball team since I stepped down here and since Samajae
stepped down here. They are so amazing and we appreciate them, you know. And
no matter whether it's away or home, every game is like a home game to us
because they come out and support us. And that's one thing I'm going to miss,
and so is Samajae, just that unconditional love and unconditional support. And
we thank them every single day.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the depth of this league and it is getting
greater and greater each and every year? Can you talk about that?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: This is a tremendous league. For us being in our second
year -- obviously it wasn't ideal with all the turnover that we had in our
roster last year. But I think we -- it turned out okay. It looked dim and
that's why I'm so proud of this group because they kept fighting and grinding
and coming to work with the right attitude every single day.  
  
But this league, there's no night off. I mean, we go down to Tulane on the
last weekend of the season and they haven't won, but they gave us all that we
could deal with. We win on a buzzer-beater by Dexter Dennis and I was amazed
at how Coach Dunleavy had kept his team positive, through a 0 and 17
Conference record to that point. It was just outstanding.  
  
And east Carolina with Joe, they're going to get better. And the top of the
league right now is Houston, Cincinnati. UCF is like playing an NBA team with
their size, Temple, Temple Basketball stands alone. All you have to do is say
"Temple Basketball" and you've -- when we went in their place last year, they
are certainly in the top ten in wins all time in college basketball. And all
the Elite Eights they have been to with Coach Chaney and Coach Dunphy.  
  
And you have the guys like Memphis that's going to get better. They've had a
heck of a run this year as well with the new coach, and they're going to get
better. They're signing unbelievable talented players. South Florida was
emerging this year and doing better. SMU's coming off their probation and
they'll probably now be fully scholarshipped and Jank will get them better.  
  
Coach Haith and Tulane, that is a tremendous basketball program. I don't know
who I'm leaving out at this point. It's a great league. You can't have a night
off. You can't take a night off. And I think the middle has gotten better and
the bottom has gotten better. The top has always been good. You know, UConn
won a National Championship. But Coach Hurley will have them back there in
short order, so that is one I didn't talk about. Obviously, they're the only
ones who won a National Championship in the league, so it's just -- it's a
great basketball league with tremendous coaches and tremendous players and
some very nice venues.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 16, 2019

  

### [Penny Hardaway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36776)

### [Alex Lomax](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36858)

### [Jeremiah Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32941)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Houston, 61 - Memphis, 58  
  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: Yeah, it was a tough game for us. We understood what
they were going to do. They are who they are. They come out, play hard for 40
minutes. They play the same way every night, so, you know, going into the game
what you're going to get. We just didn't meet the challenge. We fought hard.
Very proud of the guys for fighting hard, staying in the game, and have an
opportunity to extend the play, going into overtime.  
  
But it was just -- made too many mistakes on the game plan today. And every
time we make that many mistakes on the game plan, we've come out on the losing
end of it. So especially when you playing these type of teams, great teams
like Houston. So, overall, I'm still proud of the guys and -- you know, for
fighting and staying in the game.  
  
Q. I know you guys -- for Coach Hardaway. I know you guys didn't reach
the ultimate goal, but how would you assess the season?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: I think the season was a success, especially the way it
started off. We changed so many line-ups early. A lot of things were going on,
new coach, new system. Took a long time for the guys to fully buy in as a
group. But overall, I think it was a successful season because we saw them go
from being an average team to being a really good team, honestly. We didn't
shoot the ball well today.  
  
But to hold Houston scoreless the last probably six minutes and to hold them
to 61 points. That was a defensive game. We just couldn't make enough baskets
to win the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you never -- your team never got over 25 percent shooting, but
you were always in the game. Coach Sampson said it was due to tired legs. Was
it something they were doing our your execution?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: Give them credit because they played so hard, but we
missed a lot of open ones as well. That could be due to all the minutes that
the guys logged leading up to this point. And three games in a row -- we don't
want to make excuses, man. We had to get it done. It is what is and we know
it's three days in a row. We fell short.  
  
Q. Coach, coming in in your first season, having Jeremiah, a senior like
that, how important has he been this year, and what legacy has he left this
year?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: It's big for us to have him because without him, where
would we have been? He's done a phenomenal job. I had him off the ball earlier
in the year. He didn't look like himself, and I put him back on the ball and
everything went back to normal. But it's been huge to have him because he's
been our saviour, honestly. He's put the team on his back and that's a
phenomenal thing. We've asked a lot of him. We played him a ton of minutes
this last month and a half and for him to get through that stretch and still
do what he did was phenomenal.  
  
And his legacy, I think he's in the top ten in Tigers in scoring, and he did
all of that this year. Being here for four years, he will go down as one of
the better guards we've had here. I'm hoping that his season isn't over.  
  
Q. What do you think are some of the positives you will be able to carry
over from this season to next season?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: We just learned a lot from the losses. The losses have
taught us the type of culture, the mindset you have to have, the attention to
detail, the seriousness of working on your own game, the seriousness of the
game plan. Everything that goes into what the great teams do on a nightly
basis, it can't be optional. It has to be a part of who we are. And we have
learned that from playing all the teams that we have lost to, if you are
serious enough about it, you have great leadership, everybody is believing in
the culture and not fooling around and messing around and then think it's just
going to happen in the games, I think that's what we've really learned is have
fun, but have fun doing the things the right way next year.  
  
Q. Penny, did you notice the crowd? As you left the last time, they
stood to applaud in appreciation and I don't know if you noticed that?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: I did.  
  
Q. Two open looks. What were you going for on both those? Was that the
way you drew it up?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: The first one with Jeremiah, definitely. But to the fans
-- I was out of it, I was in thinking mode, my head was down. I should have
gave a wave to the fans. They have been phenomenal to us. We love them just as
much as they love us.  
  
First play that we ran for Jeremiah was a play that we have run, or we have
worked on all year. It was wide open, he missed the shot. The second play,
Raynere didn't have the timing properly on it and it still ended up in Tyler's
hands and he got a good look at it. But it didn't happen properly. It was
supposed to be a back screen for Tyler to go to the corner. I think he went
late and then came back up to get the ball, and when Kareem tried to shoot up
and Raynere was supposed to slip toward the basket, and Tyler would have come
back into that spot, but Raynere caught the ball and just handed it to him. So
it wasn't a proper execution on the second one.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, the last shot, when it left your hand, did you think it had
a good chance of going in? Two, was Houston as about as physical with you
tonight as anybody has been all season?  
JEREMIAH MARTIN: Yeah, I thought I was going to make it. I really didn't have
a good shooting night. I haven't shot well this whole tournament. Yeah,
Houston, one thing we know, they are going to come with physicality every
night, no matter who they play against. They did a good job on me. I can't
make no excuses about any calls I didn't get. My shots just didn't go in.  
  
Q. Coach Sampson said your team has been improving since the first game
you played, and the last couple of months, that your team has been one of the
best in the league. From your observation, what improvements have you seen
between the opening of Conference play to now?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: All aspects of the game we have got better. You name it.
From preparation, to understanding, to how serious we take the game plan now,
to, you know, taking film seriously. It wasn't there early. You could tell.
That is what happens when you come in, you have a new coach, new system, takes
a while. And I didn't expect to have Rome built in a day when I first started.
I wanted to gradually get better and around this time be as good as we can be,
because this is where you want to be gelling and peaking and that's what's
happened.  
  
The guys have really grown a lot. We're more defensive minded even though we
didn't get the stops we needed to today all game. Got them at the end but not
all the game. The mindset is so much better, so definitely proud of him.  
  
Q. Kyvon Davenport said he was injured in this game today. How much did
that affect him and how much did that influence your decision to go small down
the stretch?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: I wasn't aware of the injury that Kyvon had. Once I
found out, like right before jump ball. I kind of watched him and the coaches
were telling me to take him out of the game because he couldn't jump or run. I
let him play a while to see if it would loosen up because I didn't know what
the injury was. And he played decent, he just wasn't boxing out and wasn't
playing to the level that we needed him to. And the last tame we brought him
out, it seemed like he just -- he couldn't go. And then I think the coaches
asked him if he could go back, he said no. He would try, but he wasn't
confident that he could go.  
  
And that affected us -- that's our second-leading scorer and our leading
rebounder. You can't have that, those minutes played on the court against a
team like Houston, then it is much tougher.  
  
Q. This question is for Lomax. You have had a three-pointer in the last
three games and you have been one of the dirty work players. How do you use
that confidence going forward into next season?  
ALEX LOMAX: I have to keep working this summer, keep having confidence. My
coaches and teammates have been believing in me lately. I have to shoot the
open shots and my mindset is always to play defense, go out there and if the
shots come to me, take it with confidence.  
  
Q. Coach, just the energy from both the team and the crowd was at a
different level in that final five minutes. Can you tell us from what you saw
what flipped that switch to get you guys within three?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: They tried a couple of times earlier when we got within
10 and we got under 10, they got loud because they were trying to motivate us
and get us over the edge, over the hump. And we couldn't get there until
really late. The energy from the crowd was phenomenal. I always liken it to a
play-off game in the NBA, that magic you get where you need the crowd to give
you the energy to make a shot, make a winning play, it was crazy.  
  
I felt -- it was very nice to feel that and we got back into the game, had a
couple of chances to extend the game. It didn't happen but the fans were great
all tournament.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, you guys knew you probably had to win the whole thing to
get into the NCAA tournament. Corey Davis said you guys are friends and he is
sad you are not going to get to have that experience. Has it hit you yet that
there's all the great things you have done, that experience isn't going to be
part of it probably?  
JEREMIAH MARTIN: Kind of. Everything happens for a reason. I'm don't question
God, he knows my path. It is what it is. I'm going to go out -- if we are in
the NIT, I will play hard just like it's the tournament to try and win it.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, optimistically, there is more basketball to be played but
if not, how do you want to be remembered as your time as a Memphis Tiger?  
JEREMIAH MARTIN: Somebody who was loyal to the city, came out and played hard,
got better every year. And just loyal, to be honest. I stayed home, could have
done anything else, but I felt like this is where I wanted to be and give my
all to my city.  
  
Q. Penny, you mentioned you were walking off the court in thinking mode.
What do you think you will remember about this game, not just next week, but
as you go in the off-season? As you build this program, what will you remember
about this one?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: That we had opportunity. I thank God for the opportunity
to be in a game like this. We didn't seize the moment, but we put ourselves in
a position to beat Tulane and to come back and beat a good UCF team, to play a
top-ten team in the country. You know that is what I want to remember. And I
want to take that energy that I felt going into this game and leaving the
court both into next season.  
  
Q. This question is for Alex. Alex, how much have you grown as a person
from when you first stepped foot on the University of Memphis campus to
present day? How much have you grown?  
ALEX LOMAX: I came a long way from day one. Mindset totally changed. More
mature after being around Jeremiah and other seniors all year. They taught me
a lot of different things, and I'm going to take something from each one and
hopefully can put it into the team for next year. And I will keep trying to
guide the guys in the right direction and be a leader and, hopefully, we can
just get the job done for the rest of the season and keep trying my best.  
  
Q. Penny, do you want and expect an NIT bid? And would you like it to be
home? I gather Tuesday might work.  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: For sure. I definitely want an NIT bid. I want these
seniors to have an opportunity to still win a Championship. We want our season
extended and we definitely want one. We feel like we deserve one. We played a
tough schedule and really didn't fare well against bigger teams. We are
playing the best basketball we can play, one of the teams that are playing the
best basketball in our Conference. With beating UCF a couple of times, beating
Temple, teams that are going to be in the NCAA, I think we deserve it.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 16, 2019

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Nysier Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36861)

### [Tre Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36862)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Cincinnati, 66 - Wichita State, 63  
  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Well, I want to congratulate Wichita State. Their effort is
always tremendous. Their growth as a team this season is really unbelievable.
Credit to their two seniors, Haynes-Jones and McDuffie, and Coach Marshall is
one of the best. They always complete. They never give up. They are always
physical. They play the game the way it's supposed to be played. And to have a
winning record with what they went through and all the players they lost -- I
was telling Gregg the other day, they reminded me of my first year. To
literally have eight guys playing that didn't play for you last year and I
know how hard that is, so a lot of credit goes to them for the season that
they had. They have been a great addition to our Conference.  
  
But obviously, you know, at this time of year, you're not into splitting
atoms, you win and move on. Really proud of our rebounding. Obviously, these
two guys sitting next to me did a great job on the glass. But I look down and
I see guys getting rebounds where they were getting none or getting two and
four, and that was -- that's the only reason we really won today when you
really look at it.  
  
When you shoot 47 percent from the foul line and the other team shoots 85,
it's hard to win. It's really hard to win. So I think to advance in the
tournament, somebody told me one time you've got to be able to dance to every
song they played to win the trophy. You can't just have one dance. I know Nys
can only slow-dance, Tre and I can dance to a lot of different stuff. Nys
don't have our footwork. Yesterday we won with offense, today we won with
defense and rebounding. Again, though, that team's got a lot of heart, man.
They would not quit. So I give them a lot of credit. Our guys sucked it up.  
  
Big basket obviously for Cane Broome down the stretch; Jarron Cumberland set a
great screen. Win and advance, survive and advance.  
  
Q. Coach, do you expect Bearcat Nation to come out in full force from
Cincinnati since that's drivable distance, and how does a win like this over a
great Wichita State team down the stretch get you prepared for March Madness
coming up?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Well, I wanted to get to the Championship game. But I told
our guys, the thing about it, SMU's at full strength. This shows how good our
league is, to watch them play yesterday and realize that they were a 10-seed.  
  
But playing a team that gives you a fight, where you don't build false sense
of security because you're not going to advance in any tournament if you don't
play well. And whether it's today, or this week obviously, or next week, teams
aren't going to be alive. The next team you play, anybody that makes this
tournament obviously won their Conference tournament or they qualified. I keep
telling our guys the layups are over. So, it makes you better when you have to
play against good competition.  
  
I wanted to get to the Championship game. I told the guys because in my
feeling Houston is as good as anybody in the country. So it gives us an
opportunity to play against -- obviously you don't want to -- you want to
right the fact that they beat you twice. That doesn't happen a lot around
Cincinnati, and you're playing for the Championship of our Conference. But
this third part is you get a chance to play against a team that's good enough
to win a National Championship.  
  
So that tells you where you are at, what you need to do, what you are capable
of and what you need to improve on. It was really important for us to win
today.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about this league and the fact that this is
one year where people are finally starting to realize that it's had a better
season than leagues like the Pac-10 or the Big East, in terms of their top six
or seven teams. You mentioned SMU as a tenth seed. What does it have to do to
get over the hump? Is it just winning?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Open mind by I think others helps. Winning is a big part of
it. You've got to remember, Hoops, our first year in The American, we won the
National Championship, UConn. So a lot of it is preconceived notions, but, you
know, hey, at the end of the day, everything's about money, Hoops. So, if a
certain network owns the NFL's rights they're going to talk about them the
most. You are going to talk about the teams that you've got the most money
into. There is a reason they are talking about Zion Williamson, they're being
told to. That is the way it is now, Hoops. Whether it's a network, or the
Sheakley Group back home or the Wyler Group, the University of Cincinnati, you
know what kids follow, they follow -- marketing people that follow social
media.  
  
And so they tell them talk about this, talk about that. So, you know, we will
probably get talked about. Memphis had a really good team, but they will get
talked about more next year because of James Wiseman. He might be the number
one pick in the drift. I don't read it. Other than your stuff, I don't really
follow it too much. (Laughter).  
  
I try to tell my guys, man, to find success for yourself, that's what we try
to do, we try to worry about ourselves. Our league's been great all year. What
I will tell you outside the ACC, our league has been as good as any other
league, it really has been this year.  
  
Q. You had some foul trouble, Jarron goes out, you put some guys in that
aren't in all the time and they really seized the moment.  
COACH MICK CRONIN: That was awesome to see. Really happy for those guys.
(Applause.) We have great guys on this team. When you see Mamoudou make a big
basket, Rashawn making plays, the more you develop those guys, the more
weapons you have the better chance it's going to give you to win games, you
can't just win if Jarron has a great game and lose if he doesn't. You have to
be more -- nobody can play that way. You've got to be able to beat people
three ways: Win with your offense -- we did it yesterday. Today we won with
rebounding and good defense, not great. We had great rebounding today.  
  
So you win with offense, defense and rebounding. Whenever kids have success,
man, especially guys that haven't had a chance to contribute maybe as much as
some others -- obviously these guys are more happy for them than the rest of
us, I trust. We have really good kids on our team.  
  
Q. Guys, what do you tell each other heading into the season game, I
know they beat you twice this season. Is that rematch on your mind?  
NYSIER BROOKS: We focus on ourselves, we make sure everybody is on the same
page, on how hard this game is going to be, how hard we need to fight.  
  
TRE SCOTT: Like he said, we need to make sure -- whatever our coaching staff
tell us to do, we need to make sure we are on our Ps and Qs from offensive and
defensive standpoint. Be ready, don't come out half-stepping. We have to come
out with tremendous energy, have more effort than Houston for us to win. That
is what we have to do. If we don't, we won't get the job done.  
  
Q. You won the boards today, what do you have to do to out-rebound
Houston? They are a tough rebounding team.  
NYSIER BROOKS: Numbers, numbers. Crashing the glass.  
  
TRE SCOTT: Numbers, crashing the glass and boxing out, keeping them off the
glass. It goes both ways, you have to keep them off the glass and impose our
will more than them, especially on the offensive end. Get second-chance points
also.  
  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Numbers means amount of people we have on the offensive
glass. You can't rebound if you have one or two guys going. We've got to have
a third or a fourth guy. It is all about numbers. That's why Houston's a great
rebounding team. They send numbers, multiple people. They get the third and
fourth guy there, so we've got to box out the way we did today. You have got
to use your body, you can't use your arms. They go too hard.  
  
Q. Tre, that last deflection, what did you see as far as the pass they
were trying to get across?  
TRE SCOTT: I saw me playing football in high school.  
  
COACH MICK CRONIN: This is an inside joke. Here we go. (Laughter).  
  
I'm checking the huddle tape. Do you believe he played...  
  
NYSIER BROOKS: I believe my guy.  
  
COACH MICK CRONIN: You played wide-receiver. Did you really play defense?  
  
TRE SCOTT: I did.  
  
COACH MICK CRONIN: You're the tallest defensive back in history. I'm checking
the huddle tape.  
  
TRE SCOTT: Coach Cronin always tells us to read up, when our guards in the
front line giving tremendous energy, making sure the guards up front --  
  
NYSIER BROOKS: You have to show your energy in the back.  
  
TRE SCOTT: We can't make the guards up front work hard and we rest. He tell us
to read up, and that's what I did. I just bathed in the tour like I wasn't
there, and as soon as the ball left his hand, I ran through it. The buzzer
went off.  
  
COACH MICK CRONIN: It's a great play. I'm still checking the tape. (Laughter).  
  
TRE SCOTT: I'm telling you...

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Kelvin Sampson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13715)

### [Galen Robinson, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35104)

### [Corey Davis, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35103)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Houston - 84, UConn, 45  
  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: I thought our defense was solid. You know, we watched
the first half yesterday. Our coaching staff went to work and just watched a
lot of film. We have only played Connecticut once during the regular season.
That was in Hartford. When you do that, you have a feel for the personnel. You
know, you're playing a team yesterday that made 13 threes, and they got X
amount in transition.  
  
I thought our kids really paid attention to details. Very scouting report-
specific. Thought we were -- especially Corey and Galen, I thought they were
very cerebral in how we wanted to guard their guards. And then our depth, I
thought we wore them down. We wanted to come out in the second half and be
ultra, ultra aggressive in everything, whether it was defense, rebounding. And
when we did get the boards, wanted to push it, play in transition. We went for
threes, obviously. I thought Corey and Armoni got good looks and our offensive
rebounding, I thought was solid. So, you know, a good win, move on to the next
one.  
  
Q. How important was it for your team to maintain its focus and
intensity going into this tournament, knowing what is still to come, that this
tournament is just as important to you guys for what you want to build this
year?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: I think that goes back to our culture and the things
that we emphasize. I think that's an overused, misunderstood word. It seems
like in the last ten years, everybody talks about culture. But, you know,
culture's the way you do everything in your program. I thought our kids
tonight played -- whether it is getting on the floor after loose balls, being
enthusiastic for each other's success, just played as a team. And I don't
differentiate what tournament or what game. Whether we're playing Alabama A&M
or Oregon, LSU, St. Louis, whoever we play, my approach is the same.  
  
It is nice to know that we're going to be a pretty good seed in the tournament
but we've earned that. Our next game is tomorrow against UCF or Memphis. We're
going to try to win that game. Whether we are good enough or not, we'll see,
but we're going to do our best to try and win it.  
  
Q. What was the key to limiting them to just hitting 3 three-point shots
over the entire game?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: Everything evolves around three actions. They usually
get their pick-and-rolls -- their shots out of pick-and-rolls. If you squeeze
in tight from the weak side and take away the roller, Jalen especially does a
good job of skipping it to the open man on the weak side. What we really
worked on was -- we call it back pressure. Once we get him dictated and headed
in the right direction with our big, I thought Jalen did a great job of being
active with his hands, and he forced a ball with a little air under it or a
hump, if you will, and that allowed us to get there and make them drivers
versus shooters.  
  
These two guys are seniors. This is our 32nd game. Our game -- how we guard
pick-and-rolls vary from game to game, but we don't have a million ways to do
it. We look at the team strength and it says we're going to guard this team
this way. But Jalen Adams makes it a little bit different, because you can't
go underneath ball screens on him. You have to chase him and get your big up
to the line of scrimmage.  
  
I thought the key to defending their shooters was five people guarding the
ball screen. I thought all five guys did their jobs.  
  
Q. Coach, what does Galen give you as a floor leader which sometimes
goes overlooked in setting up the offense?  
COACH KELVIN SAMPSON: One of the things that Galen has learned to do over his
career is play to his strength. Everybody has a strength, something they're
good at and something they're not. If you let what you don't do good get in
the way of what you do do good, then you've gotten away from your reference
point. We all have a reference point. What was the name of that movie that
Will Smith -- that guy couldn't dance, he was trying to show him how to dance
-- you know what I'm talking about?  
  
Remember that? That is who we are, that is who Galen is. That's that guy that
stays right here. Don't be doing all that crazy stuff. He is right here. He's
learned to be a solid point guard, and he's really good at being solid. And
there's a lot of guys in the NBA that are the same way, they're solid. That's
a huge gift for our team. We need solid. Dejon comes in there and he's all
over the place sometime. But Galen gives us stability and that is important
for our team. That is why our first team tonight was so good defensively,
because our point of attack.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it means to you personally to be playing at
such a high level in your last conference tournament?  
GALEN ROBINSON, JR: It means everything because if I'm at a high level, that
means we are usually playing pretty good. I want to give my team the best
chance to survive an event, so my main focus is on just playing my heart out,
just playing as hard as I can and just taking whatever comes with it.  
  
Q. Corey, how would you describe your guys' mentality knowing what is
still at stake, what you want to accomplish this year, and how important it is
to finish the tournament the right way as well?  
COREY DAVIS, JR: If I had to find a way to describe, it would be "desperate".
I mean, we have to have a sense of desperation. This is us playing to our
culture. We treat every team the same and we play our hearts out. That goes a
long way to us winning.  
  
Q. Galen, you jumped on them early. How important was it to set the tone
coming right out of the gate.  
GALEN ROBINSON, JR: It was extremely important to me because Jalen Adams is a
tough match-up. He's the head of their snake. And I knew that I would have my
hands full with him. But I knew if I outcompeted him, outworked him, I knew I
could get my team a chance. If you give guys like us a chance, that's all we
need.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Tim Jankovich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20496)

### [Jarrey Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36791)

### [Jahmal McMurray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30581)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Cincinnati - 82, SMU, 74  
  
COACH TIM JANKOVICH: Just that the last game of the year is always the
hardest, you know, unless you happen to be that one team that is really,
really happy at the end of the year. It's hard, the season ends, but probably
hardest because you have to say goodbye to people that you spent a lot of time
with and that you love and that you respect and you don't get to be around on
a daily basis anymore. So, for me, last games of the season are really very
sad. That's the long and the short of it.  
  
I could dig into how many rebounds, free throws and this and that, but right
now I'm not all that interested in that. The feeling of the disappointment for
our team, for our seniors and I don't know -- I think if we got in a contest
of a team that was faced with the most adversity in history, I think we could
be a player in that, and that's why I respect these guys so much. Nobody on
the outside has any idea what they went through, what we went through on a
daily basis and for them to keep fighting and fighting and fighting and never
giving in, I really respect them.  
  
Q. It's been a tough two seasons for you. Now it's finally over, can you
put things into perspective?  
JARREY FOSTER: I've been blessed to have this opportunity. My four years here
have been amazing with amazing people, amazing coaching staff, amazing
teammates, amazing support. I couldn't ask to be anywhere else. The past two
years were really hard for me. But, I mean, you've got to run with the
punches, you know. And I tried to do my best to make the best out of it. I
didn't ask for the past two seasons to happen. I didn't ask to have no post-
season in my freshman year. I didn't ask for these things to happen.  
  
But as a man and growing up into a man, you have to learn how to find the best
route to get through these things and to continue to push forward, and that's
all I pretty much did. So it's been a blessing. I'm just glad that I finished,
that was the hardest thing. In the middle of all of it, you don't know what
you want to do, confused -- it's a hard time. I've finished the race and I've
finished it for my teammates and coaches and for everybody that's supported
me.  
  
Q. Now the season's over, can you go into more detail about your
injury?  
JARREY FOSTER: Not too much. I can't go into too much detail. But moving
forward, I know I do want to continue to play basketball. Just going to see
where it takes me. I'm blessed to still be moving and playing, so I'm going to
take it and run with it.  
  
Q. Coach, you stayed up with them until the final few minutes, and had
done a good job with the game plan. What worked and what changed in those last
few minutes?  
COACH TIM JANKOVICH: I'm not sure. They hit a lot of shots they normally
wouldn't make. I give them credit for that. But they continued to shoot the
ball. We did a fantastic job the first half, rebounding. They had four
offensive rebounds, four or five the first half, which we would take in every
half against Cincinnati. I think we wore down. They bring waves, particularly
their front line, they bring guys in waves, they keep them fresh. We are
leaving our guys out there an awful long time and I totally understand that.  
  
They got a lot of offensive rebounds the second half and Cumberland played
great down the stretch. He was tough to score, he made baskets, he made fouls.
But I don't fault anything that we did. They're a great team. There's nothing
negative in my mind. It just -- the last three or four minutes -- what sticks
with me, they stretched the lead on us. We had, you know, a lot going against
us at that time and we fought our way back. I want to say, what, down one, if
I'm not mistaken. I'm not sure if we tied or took the lead, but we fought
right back to down one and gave ourself another chance and we couldn't finish.  
  
Not as an excuse, but I know that we got some guys on fumes out there, and,
again, I don't mean that as an excuse. It's tough, it's tough to have the same
bounce you do in the last three or four minutes when some guys are playing as
many as they are. And I want to say in case I don't get a chance that Jarrey
has been through -- I have coached over 30-some years, Jarrey has been through
more than anybody I have ever coached by 100 times.  
  
His freshman year, he finds out there's no post-season, there's a probation,
we are not going post-season. Can you imagine -- for nothing he did, he just
happened in September to find that out. His next year goes great, he was
great, we win a ton of games, it's fantastic, lots of great things happen. The
next year starts, we are right back in it, we in position February 1, we're
another NCAA team, we're going to make a run at another Championship. Boom, he
tears his ACL. Shake goes down, Everett goes down, others go down, the season
goes down. And now he's up in a second rehab, second ACL of his life, his
senior year of high school. So now he's staring down that barrel.  
  
This season starts, we have optimism but he can't play at the beginning. And
so he doesn't practice all through the beginning, finally getting back. You
saw what happened when he came back to our team. I think we won eight out of
ten. We started the league great, we looked like a contender. And then he gets
hurt in the Houston game. I don't know anybody that's gone through all of
that. And I look at Jahmal, he chooses another school early on, you know.
There's firings, there's allegations, there's all kinds of a mess that he
didn't sign up for. So he leaves the school and he works like crazy, and he
does a lot of academic work and he comes to us with hopes of playing in a
great team.  
  
Sure enough, the year starts out fantastic and he gets eligible and he helps
us and we are winning like crazy. We have 3 top-15 wins and it's rolling, and
the next thing you know, he looks beside him and Jarrey is out, Shake's out,
and Everett is out. We are down two scholarships -- or three -- for sanctions
and that's -- he didn't do anything, you know. He was just hoping to play on a
great team. And then again this year, we're down to begin with with the
sanctions and we get injuries and a bunch of injuries. And what I feel -- for
him, what bothers me is he, for me, has turned into a winner, you know. And he
deserves to win. I wanted him to play in a NCAA tournament, I wanted him to
experience that. He should have played in three or four of them, you know.  
  
And that's a lot of stuff, you know. You don't get 17 careers. A coach gets
many more years. I have been doing this a long time. I've had a lot of great
things happen to me. I don't need that like they need that. They just get one
and I'm just -- that's what hurts me so much that they are going to be
leaving, and we don't have another chance together to do all the things that I
believe that could have been done had it not been for a lot of circumstances
that none of us had any control over.  
  
Q. After a big win last night, and a really close competitive game
tonight, can you describe what that experience was like for you?  
JAHMAL MCMURRAY: It was a great experience. I'm just blessed to be a part of a
great team. I still think we are a great team. Like Coach said, we went
through a lot of stuff this year, But we never made excuses. We fought and
fought and fought, and a lot of people counted us out, especially in the first
round, I'm sure. And we came out and fought again and got a win against Tulsa,
against a very great team. And we came out tonight and really fought hard and
put ourselves in position to win a game. And a few things happened in the game
that didn't go our way.  
  
But at the end of the day, I'm a really blessed individual to be a part of
basketball, college basketball, period. And I want to thank Coach Jankovich
for giving me the opportunity and giving me the chance to play basketball. I'm
thankful as a whole to be a part of what we were able to be a part of. And we
got one win and we tried to get another one and we fought hard, that's all you
can ask for.  
  
Q. Coach, you have talked a lot about your future, but have you been
told anything regarding your job status for next year?  
COACH TIM JANKOVICH: It's all good, yeah. Thank you for asking. It's all good.
Appreciate the question. How's your status for next year? Pretty good? So, we
are both in good shape. Thank you.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Dan Hurley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26699)

### [Jalen Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30590)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Houston, 84 - UConn - 45  
  
COACH DAN HURLEY: Obviously, crushing, crushing loss, perfect storm, you know,
out there. Playing obviously, you know, an incredible team, deep, incredibly
well-coached. Obviously Final Four caliber team, and it was kind of the
perfect storm. We were probably, you know, at our worst offensively, which had
obviously something to do with the level of defense that they play and depth
and everything. But just, you know, a really tough way to end a year where,
you know, we felt like we were making progress. And just a tough way to -- a
tough way to end the season, and now obviously several, several months to stew
over this and what happened, so several months to stew over this.  
  
Q. Coach, you pulled everyone in with about 8:40 left when they were
reviewing for Josh. Can you talk about what you told everyone at that time?  
COACH DAN HURLEY: I'm trying to think about that. (Laughter).  
  
There were a lot of things said in those second-half huddles. There were a lot
of plea-ing, obviously. You know, that was like a tidal wave that hit us, you
know. They were, you know - listen, they were playing at such a high level,
ten high-level players rotating in-and-out of the game there. We just talked
about continuing to compete. Obviously, we couldn't match the level, winning
was out of the equation. We just talked about not quitting.  
  
And today wasn't quitting, today was being completely overmatched and being
outplayed at the absolute highest level. If you watch the game and you felt
like we laid down and played dead, then you know nothing about sports or
basketball, and you should stop watching it. We just got completely, you know,
demolished, and I just think we just got demoralized by the level that they
were playing at.  
  
Listen, you know, we -- let's try to finish this game in a manner where we can
look at each other when it's over in terms of how we compete. That is all you
can ask at that point when it is getting like that.  
  
Q. A lots of ups and downs and a roller-coaster season to the last two
days, where yesterday was a feel-good moment and today not so much. You saw
the team that is setting the bar for this conference. What do you take away
from your first season in terms of what you are able to accomplish and setting
the foundation for reaching that level?  
COACH DAN HURLEY: Houston is where we want to get some day. The message after
the game was -- like 1 through 10, that's how good we've got to get. I mean,
at times out there -- put it like this, Jalen is a talented player and can
play at the level of just about anyone. It was just kind of a humbling
reminder of how far we have to go, both from a recruitment, development
standpoint, and it's going to take us some time.  
  
There are no delusions of grandeur with this coaching staff. Throughout the
year, we've known exactly where we are at. If we don't have the injuries --
you know, with Alterique and Jalen, obviously could have represented ourselves
maybe better throughout the course of the year. We've known where we're at,
how far we have to go. And, again, like you want to get to the level -- we
want to get to the level where Houston's at. That's a Final Four contending
program, Championship-caliber program. That's where UConn is used to being. We
just saw how far the distance is we have to go. When it's --it's vast. It's --
again, it's recruiting, player development, culture, character.  
  
Q. You kind of just answered what I was going to ask in terms of when
you look at Houston, that is what you want to be in a few years. And not just
in terms of talent and depth, but the way they were playing hard even when
they had a big lead and just not kind of -- relentless out there?  
COACH DAN HURLEY: Yeah. Listen, that's a pick of wolves. Those guys, that is a
pack of wolves, 1 through 10. No let-up. I mean, they play with incredible
confidence, toughness, intensity, joy. The depth, they just kept coming and
their second group they put in, it would have finished in the top four -- that
is a Final Four caliber team.  
  
So, yes, I mean, we know -- we knew what it was. For us -- listen, we had to
go all in with our preparation for South Florida. I'm not making excuses for
these guys, but having basically a half a day prep to prepare for that team
was not a very good recipe for us either coming in. But, yeah. No, that's
where we want to get to, and it's going to take us a little bit of time.  
  
Q. What will you remember about your career the most and what do you
think about all your senior season win?  
JALEN ADAMS: Just my time here, the connections I've made on and off the
court. Some of them will last a lifetime. And just -- on the court, I feel
like I have learned so much about myself, so many lessons, how to handle
adversity when things aren't going my way. I kind of have to go with it. You
can't get too high or get too low on yourself. You have to stay balanced and
keep a level head. That's really what I have learned from being here.  
  
And I think my senior season has been my biggest season for me mentally. I
think since Coach has got here, he's pushed me to limits I haven't been pushed
before, and that is why I have had my best season since I have been in college
basketball. So, appreciate you.  
  
Q. Jalen, what went through your mind as the game was winding down and
the finality of things and your career is coming to an end, the coach pulls
you out, you had a moment with him on the sidelines. What went through your
mind and what transpired there?  
JALEN ADAMS: A whole bunch of emotions. But I think mainly -- I tried to think
about the good things more than the bad things, so seeing all my brothers
standing up for me. I don't know, just -- it is definitely, it hits a soft
spot in your heart, all the love that you see on your team is different from
-- college basketball to the next level, it is different, you are never going
to have the same -- people will never have that same genuine love for you. I
don't know. I was just -- I don't know, I can't tell you what I think. There
is a lot. It is feeling the love for my teammates.  
  
Q. Congratulations on everything you have accomplished. Can you talk
about your experience at UConn, a reflection on it overall?  
JALEN ADAMS: As I look back on it, coming in, I was a young child, an immature
kid. I think as I have progressed throughout my time, I became more mature and
I kind of looked at things, looked at the bigger picture. I think a lot of
people go through different things and I think adversity was probably the best
for me. I think it's turned me into a man. I think it will help me in my
future career, so I think all ups and downs that I've experienced at UConn has
been beneficial for me.  
  
Q. Coach, from your perspective, how have you seen Jalen progress from
when he came here in the beginning and convincing him to stay and until the
end of the season now?  
COACH DAN HURLEY: He's grown a lot and I'm not sure if -- listen, he's had
incredible bad luck in terms of the timing of a player of his caliber coming
into the program. I just -- my heart kind of breaks for him because of the
conditions that he's had to play through. And he's had an amazing career
playing through it. But just -- there's not many players of his caliber that
have come to UConn that have had to play and go through the career under the
conditions that he's had, you know, the program sliding, coaching transition.  
  
Obviously, not being surrounded by what some of the great players in the past
have been surrounded by, so, you know -- I don't think a guy could have
handled it much better, you know. I don't think somebody could have just kept
such a positive attitude and been such a good guy to be around while having
kind of everything around him kind of not be what he signed on for.  
  
So, I mean, I'll always admire that about him. And, you know, I hope to stay
connected with him through what I think is going to be an amazing professional
career.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Penny Hardaway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36776)

### [Isaiah Maurice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36824)

### [Kyvon Davenport](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34876)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Memphis, 79 - UCF, 55  
  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: Yeah, unbelievable game for us. When you play a team
three times in one season, we split the regular season. Both teams know each
other well, and it comes down to will, making shots, and making game-winning
plays and our team did that for the entire game. I'm proud of them. It was a
timely game we needed -- of course, it's win or go home. But it's timely and
it's appropriate because these guys have been working their butts off all
year, been continually got better as the season has gone on and all the hard
work is paying off now.  
  
Q. Mid-season you instituted the hustle board. How can you hustle the
players you had today without people diving on the floor going forward?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: That just fits the eye test. You don't even have to go
to the hustle board for that one. Honestly, doing whatever it takes and
playing desperate because it's where we are right now. We know the road we
have to take. And we understand that every possession counts and we are out
there playing like it now.  
  
Q. Talk about the energy that the crowd brought today. How much of a
pick-me-up was that for you guys?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: It was huge. Our crowd understands we need the energy,
they understand the situation we're in. And they're going to do their part and
they've done their part all year of letting us know they have our backs and
that they want to support us and help us win and they're doing that.  
  
Q. Which coach scouted this game and is that the same coach that scouted
the game the previous time?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: Mike Miller was the scout in this game, he was the scout
for the other two games. And he's done a phenomenal job all year on giving a
game plan and having the kids understand what's going to happen, how we stop
it, what to look for, play calls, everything. Phenomenal job by Coach Miller
all year on the scout on UCF.  
  
Q. The momentum seemed to shift after that first timeout you called and
that's when Isaiah came out and kind of got in his bag. Was there anything you
said in particular to him or was that when it took off? The same question to
Isaiah.  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: We understand what this team can do. They can strike
fast. They got really good players, and we couldn't get complacent and we had
to keep attacking them and we had to make shots. We were doing a good enough
job defensively to feel like we have to make shots to push away and that's
what happened.  
  
ISAIAH MAURICE: My main focus was just coming in to produce, you know. We
played this team twice before and my main focus was not to make the same
mistakes that I did. So just go out there and make shots. I know how Tacko's
going to play me and maneuver off how he plays me pretty much.  
  
Q. Coach, always say, everyone says, when Kyvon plays with intensity and
plays like he played today you all are hard to beat. Do you feel the same way
and talk about your attitude coming in to today's game?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: I have stated before -- what Peso did in February,
points-wise, he did in November and December, honestly with his play -- he
played big. I said at that point there was no small forward, power forward in
the country that can stop him. He's makes his mind up to go and he's knocking
his jumper down, he's almost impossible to guard. I mean, it is what it is.  
  
And I put a lot of pressure on him and I have challenged him publicly a lot,
but I mean, he's taken a challenge for this tournament. He's showing up at the
right time for us. This is the time we need him to show up.  
  
KYVON DAVENPORT: I knew we had to come in and stay focused, get after them
early, and we couldn't let them get off to a huge start. Even though they got
off to a good start, but we had to keep fighting the whole time. We had to put
him away early. We knew if we got up, they were going to fold. They struggled
to score and we were staying silent and making them shoot over us the whole
time, and I thought we did a good job. They only had one guy in double
figures. Congrats to the team.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about Jeremiah Martin a little bit. With the way
the front court is playing, what does that mean going forward?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: It's there for both of these guys, both these guys are
extremely talented. Isaiah to me is the best five -- one of the best fives in
our conference. He just hasn't been able to get his game out. Him and Mike are
two totally different guys. Mike is a pounder, and he's more of a skill player
and he hadn't been able to get that talent out. And today, of course, is his
best game of the year. That's always on time when you are playing well during
tournament time.  
  
These two guys playing like this, Jeremiah hasn't had a great scoring game,
but he's gotten to the free throw line and made winning plays. So we get
Karim, Jeremiah, and these two guys continuing to play the way they're
playing, it will be tough to stop us.  
  
Q. We saw a shimmy and saw you play a guitar a bit today. Were you kind
of embellishing the match-up with Tacko Fall. Or was it in the heat of the
moment?  
ISAIAH MAURICE: I was just in the moment. I do those things to keep myself
going. It is a confident-raiser for me. I go out there and have fun. I play
the game like I know how to to.  
  
Q. Is this the toughness you have been looking for?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: For sure. We have been playing tough since the South
Florida game. Ever since that game we have been playing way tougher. We made a
little pact at that point going to ECU that we weren't going to allow anybody
to get up on us that big anymore, and we were going to fight to the finish.
And from that point forward, everybody drew a line in the sand and said that's
it, we are not going out like we did at Temple, at Tulsa, and South Florida.
The team is playing much tougher.  
  
Q. Coach -- Kyvon first, then Coach. It seems like the team finally
followed the game plan from the beginning to the end. Is there something that
-- when did that click to get them to stop varying from the game plan?  
KYVON DAVENPORT: We just knew that the only way that we're going to win is to
follow by the game plan, and if we don't, we go home. We have to keep
following the game plan because that's what's helping us win and helping us
get wins like this and helping us know how to play everybody in the conference
and how to play a certain player. And it's helping us out a lot, so we have to
keep following the game plan and do what we do and it's going to result in a
win.  
  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: It's been a maturation process of all the guys because
they wanted to be individuals early. And they thought they could do it on
their own without the game plan, and that bit us in the butt. That's why we
have 12 losses. But as the season has gone on, you can tell, when we put our
foot down and start playing tougher, everybody started buying more into it.
And I said if we buy into this, we will win games. I said that going into ECU
and that's what's happened. They're starting to buy in from that point with
the game plan all the way through.  
  
We made some mental mistakes in some games, but for the most part, we are
sticking to the game plan.  
  
Q. Coach, how quickly do you hit the reset button? Houston is a
different team and how do you prepare for them?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: We hit the reset button as soon as we leave here. We
want to enjoy this. The guys deserve to enjoy this. As soon as we leave, we
are in the mode of we have Houston and we understand what -- that's the beast.
They have earned everything they have gotten, the best record in our league,
first place, the top coach. He got the award for the coach in our Conference,
we know what it is. As soon as we leave here, we focus on them. It's a
different game. They are relentless and we understand that.  
  
Q. Did you hear the fans chanting your name as you walked off the floor?
You stopped and said hi, and what did that mean to you to get that attention
is?  
ISAIAH MAURICE: It was a special moment for me, obviously. I want to keep that
going. Carry it into next year and have that moment again, so that is pretty
much it.  
  
Q. I want to know from all three of you if there were any songs in
particular that helped you get into the game for today?  
KYVON DAVENPORT: Not really. I listen to everything. I was listening to a lot
of stuff in the locker room. We listen to everything, so there's no particular
song for me.  
  
ISAIAH MAURICE: I don't have any particular songs that get me hyped up before
the game. I just listen to whatever my teammates list to, and we get pumped up
to the same music.  
  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: I will do something Memphis, whether it's Yo Gotti or
something. This is -- we're at home, you have to get that feel, all Memphis
right now.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Dexter Dennis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36843)

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

### [Markis McDuffie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30785)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Wichita State, 80 - Temple, 74  
  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: That was a great college basketball game against two
very similar teams. Before I start talking about our team, I want to talk
about Temple and my hope is that they will get in. I've been hoping and really
prayerful that they will get in all along. They beat us back in early January
and we kind of gave them the game. They made the plays that they needed to
make, obviously, but we were so sloppy with the basketball with an 11-point
lead and a little over three minutes to go, and it looked like it was headed
that way tonight. But I really want to say that I hope they get in, they are
deserving to get in. That is a quality team. It is really, really hard to
guard.  
  
Our guys just -- to my left and other guys in that locker room, were
tremendous tonight. Markis McDuffie was playing like a man possessed, shooting
the basketball, getting to the free throw line and offensive rebounding like
crazy. Dexter Dennis was tremendous in the second half. It was a team effort,
but we had some wonderful performances by these gentlemen to my left.  
  
Q. Coach, in that first half, Shizz Alston was on fire. What were the
adjustments you made at halftime?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Well, my staff just said, look, he's on fire, he had 18
at the half. Samajae was playing pretty good defense but he's one of those
players in this league like Markis McDuffie, Jalen Adams and Jarron
Cumberland, and Corey Davis that can make shots and make plays even when well-
guarded. So we elected to try to eliminate his touches and if we couldn't
eliminate them, we wanted to minimize them. And Samajae Haynes-Jones did a
wonderful job and everything was based on forcing him to his left hand. He's
elite going to his right.  
  
Q. It's been quite a turnaround from the first half of the season to the
second half of the season. How do you explain your guys' uptake in play?  
MARKIS MCDUFFIE: It is working hard every day in practice and we want to play
better going to February, March, the second half of the year. I knew this team
was going to improve because ever since I have been here, we've always got
better towards the end of the year and that's because of the hard work we put
in and just the focus we have and the -- willing to go that extra mile.  
  
Q. Here's a question for both players. Seeing how that game ended in
January with a loss, what were your thoughts tonight when the game got two
down the stretch?  
DEXTER DENNIS: We can't give this one away too. In that game in January, we
had a lot of unforced turnovers so we kind of kept it up and finished this
game.  
  
MARKIS MCDUFFIE: It got shaky towards the end. I've been with this basketball
team and I've seen an improvement, you know. As a group, we have been getting
better so much and that was the second game of the Conference, and we've got
extremely much better than that. So I knew we were going to win the game, just
us being smart.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Can we get your thoughts on the match-up with Cincinnati
tomorrow?  
  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: They got us at our place. We didn't play very well.
There were some other extenuating circumstances which I will not get into.
They kicked us at their place. They are a great team, tremendous athletes,
they have a tremendous defense and we'll have to play much better than we
played the first two times to win.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Johnny Dawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22741)

### [B.J. Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28541)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Memphis, 79 - UCF, 55  
  
COACH JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, you have to give Memphis a lot of credit. I
thought they played with a sense of purpose. We ran into a bustle. I thought
their guys played well. They beat us in most areas of the game today. I look
at all the stats sheet and I'm looking at the different areas, and they
outperformed us in each one of them. Disappointed with our guys and how we
played, but I give them a lot of credit because they played with a sense of
purpose, with a sense of desperation and it showed. They won the 50/50 balls,
they beat us offensive rebounding, they were able to get extra shots, turned
us over and they played real well today.  
  
Q. Coach, coming out at half-time down ten in the second half, it seemed
like they were able to take the energy to another level and got on the boards
at lot -- got off the boards a lot. Why weren't you able to match that?  
COACH JOHNNY DAWKINS: We had to be better. I think you give them credit
because they were very active, and sometime the ball bounces funny. The ball
takes some interesting bounces and it may bounce closer to a player than other
times. And so I think some balls bounce well, bounce in areas where they were
able to grab them a little faster than we were.  
  
But the main thing is they were coming to the boards quite a bit, and that is
something we have done a good job most of the season, keeping guys off the
boards, giving up second and third shot attempts. Tonight was not a night for
that. They made a concerted effort to get in there, some balls fell their way
which always helps and we have to do a better job.  
  
Q. B.J., how did that crowd make a difference? It was almost deafening.
Could you hear each other on the court?  
B.J. TAYLOR: We could. We knew coming into this game it was going to be like a
home game for them in their building. So like Coach said you have to give them
a lot of credit for the energy their players played with on the floor. They
played hard the entire night. So, you give them credit.  
  
Q. A loss like that heading into possibly the NCAA tournament, do you
still think you're comfortably in the NCAA tournament or do you think the
possibility for NIT?  
COACH JOHNNY DAWKINS: That will be made by people on Sunday. All we do is go
out and win games and put ourselves in the best position to play in a post-
season. We will see what happens, but I think we've had a very, very good
season. We have proven that. We won in hostile environments, we have beaten
top 25 teams, I mean, and we finished in third place -- tied for third in our
conference. That is a very good conference. Thinking of all the things we did
well, I think that we've had a very good year.  
  
Q. B.J., you were here in the same situation last year. I wonder if this
feels a little different because you probably do know that you have more
basketball to play after this?  
B.J. TAYLOR: Losing never feels good in any situation. So, in terms of the
game, we came with a 1 and 0 mentality for us. We weren't looking ahead to
what's after this, so it hurts. It hurts a lot to lose a game like this. We
wanted to leave here with the Championship and we didn't achieve that goal.
So, this loss hurts a lot.  
  
Q. Aubrey really struggled. Talk about -- was it something in their
defense, or was it one of those days where he wasn't getting shots to fall?  
COACH JOHNNY DAWKINS: He's gonna make shots. He will have nights where he
misses them. That is the life of a shooter. It was a tough night for him. They
did a good job. They stayed with him on the floor, so they made a lot of his
catches difficult and put him in positions where he didn't normally get the
looks that he normally gets. So you have to give them credit for staying
locked in and focused on him for the period of time they guard him.  
  
Q. What does this team need to do over the next week to prepare for
what's next?  
B.J. TAYLOR: We need to remember this pain from this game. We have to keep
this pain. You can't -- you know, you can't forget about it, you know. We do
have more basketball ahead of us. But we've got to remember what happened out
here tonight and we got to use this to push us going forward.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Jarron Cumberland](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36832)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Cincinnati - 82, SMU, 74  
  
COACH MICK CRONIN: I want to congratulate SMU, I thought their effort tonight
was tremendous. They've been a couple of years with decimated injuries. We
played them last year in this tournament, Shake Milton didn't play. We played
them this year, both times, Jarrey Foster didn't play during the regular
season. Just happy to see him back out there. They have been through a lot
playing short-handed.  
  
So I knew after watching them play last night, it was going to be a tough
game. Them at full strength, Coach Jankovich does a great job and they've got
five guys that play together on offense. They can all shot, they share the
ball. They all play smart, they play to their strengths. The drivers drive it,
the shooters shoot it and then they can make guarded shots. And teams that can
make guarded shots, they're dangerous. You can play great team defense, a guy
just jumps up and makes really a pro shot, because pros have to take those
shots with the short shot clock.  
  
So really proud of our effort. We had to win with offense tonight and our
passing was excellent, 15 assists, 8 turnovers. And obviously these two guys
with me made big-time plays which they've been doing all year. And I thought
Tre Scott was probably the key to the game, we were down 29-21, and he started
imposing his physical will on the game. He looked like number 5, Justin
Jackson, who used to play for Cincinnati. And I have been trying to challenge
him to embody Justin and his effort was awesome. His effort on the glass, he
hit 17-12 tonight, so he really changed the game for us.  
  
And then obviously Jarron does a great job closing the game out. He's been
doing it all year for us.  
  
Q. Justin, what was it in that first half that was able to get you going
and help you propel the offense for the first 25 minutes?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: Just being ready to shoot. The coach has always emphasizes
everybody being ready to shoot. My teammates did an amazing great job of
getting in the paint and drawing the defense so I could get open shots. Kudos
to Ted because he got me a lot of shots today.  
  
Q. You pride yourself on passing a lot, so eight assists, what does mean
for you to just get guys good looks.  
JARRON CUMBERLAND: It means a lot. Actually I knew Justin -- I knew SMU was
going to help off of me -- well, help off of them, and I knew they'd be open.
I knew Coach was telling me all week to find a open guy and we got guys open
shots. So eight assists, I'm happy about it.  
  
Q. Justin, you had a rough day on senior day, you come out and you don't
miss tonight and momentum is so big. Tell me about that shot as it goes in,
how you feel.  
JUSTIN JENIFER: It feels great when it goes in. I always -- I get on myself
for missing shots. And today it was going in. Today was my day. And it looked
like I didn't miss today. Perfect games don't happen like that. They don't
happen often. So, you know, coming in from -- my senior night, I didn't make
any shots and coming in making all my shots today is just -- shooting comes
and goes. Coach always emphasizes that as well shooting comes and goes, but as
long as we can control our effort, that is what is going to win us games.  
  
Q. How much of a challenge do they present because you can play great
defense on them for 29 seconds and they've a couple of guys that can step up
and hit shots. Is it difficult to keep that intensity up when they do that?  
COACH MICK CRONIN: You have to give our kids credit. We were adjusting the
entire game trying to figure out different things. We were talking with the
guys, these two guys made some things happen on their own, defensively in the
second half. Trying to take a few things away that SMU was doing to us.
Because if you don't switch and you double the pick-and-roll, the guy they
have popping is Isiaha Mike and Ethan Chargois, who are both great shooters.
We were trying to dictate the guard, because if he is defending and going on
one-on-one, it eliminates him from the defensive glass.  
  
We change defenses quite a bit. We actually went straight man down in the
first half -- we were down eight -- and continued to adjust. The guys did a
great job communicating with it. We started limiting them to one shot. That
was the key to the game, our defensive rebounding.  
  
Q. SMU kept it really close until two minutes left. What would you say
it says about the composure of the team to be able to still pull away at the
end?  
JARRON CUMBERLAND: The guys that we had from last year and the people from the
bench that started this year, they really stepped up. And Coach told us we
have to keep our calm, we have to stay calm and just do what we had to do to
win games. Because at the end of the -- at the final score, that's the only
thing that matters.  
  
Q. I know you have to watch Temple and Wichita State here, but the first
two games, are you surprised they were blowouts, the Houston game and then
Memphis, the home team, obviously, has a lot going for them.  
COACH MICK CRONIN: Houston -- to me, Houston is one of the best five teams in
the country. You know, our league does -- if you watch SMU played tonight at
full strength and realized that they were the 10-seed in this tournament, that
ought to tell you how good the American Conference is this year. And for
Houston to be 29-2 -- I thought this year 14-4 would tie for the league. I
can't believe they went 16-2. That is how good they are. They're an elite
basketball team so anything they do doesn't surprise me. Memphis is at home,
and so much of this is about match-up. They beat Central Florida 20 the time
they played here before. The only two teams that have beat Memphis in this
building all year is Tennessee, who's been in top five all year, and
Cincinnati. So it doesn't surprise me at all how well they have played today.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Ernest Aflakpui](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36846)

### [Shizz Alston, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32883)

### [Fran Dunphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18225)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Wichita State, 80 - Temple, 74  
  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: Hard-fought, of course. I thought McDuffie made a couple of
huge plays in the game, not the least of which -- I thought we had a run-out
late, and he just got himself back into the play and made little plays like
that. Obviously he also made some big shots. I think we fouled him twice on
jump shots that cost us a number of points as well. So I give them great
credit, give McDuffie great credit. I appreciate how our guys fought until the
end, and we've had a lot of really close victories. I was just hoping at the
end of this one that we would make it another one tonight, but it didn't
happen.  
  
Q. Coach, since Wichita has joined the conference, it's been five points
decided on average every time you play Wichita State, what is it about them
that makes it such a tough match-up every time you play?  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: They were a different team than the one we played a couple
of months ago in our second league game. A little more poise, a little more
understanding of who they all are. I think Gregg does an unbelievable job as
evidenced by today, and as evidenced by -- I think they're 11-0 their last 13.
So they're coming on. It's a good team, well-coached, and a very good
basketball time.  
  
Yes, we have had a number of very close games with them.  
  
Q. Shizz, there were about 25 fouls called in the second half. At some
point was it frustration you got that T?  
SHIZZ ALSTON, JR.: I got a little frustrated, yeah, but as a leader, I got to
keep my head in those situations. But yeah, I got a little frustrated.  
  
Q. Shizz, 23 wins, third seed in this tournament. What is the level of
confidence about hearing your name on Selection Sunday?  
SHIZZ ALSTON, JR.: At this point, I don't know, man. We're just hoping for the
best. I mean, like Coach said, I felt like we did enough to get in, but you
never know in these situations, so we're just sitting and watching and hoping.  
  
Q. Coach, can you briefly touch on the impact that Shizz will have left
on the program?  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: That will take a long period of time. He is a tremendous
guy, a great player. I don't know where we would have been without him all
year-long. The last four years, he's been a terrific guy to coach, and we will
continue to play basketball together over the next couple of weeks, I hope.
But I'm grateful for having the opportunity to have coached him. It's been a
treat.  
  
Q. Were you aware that you tied Mark Macon tonight?  
SHIZZ ALSTON, JR.: No, I wasn't. I was just trying to win. I didn't know that.  
  
Q. Can you comment on Ernest's game? He had a career-high in rebounds
tonight?  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: He was terrific. I don't know what else Ern could have done
in addition to the 19 rebounds and the 16 points. He had a terrific block that
I thought would change our fate as well in that first half, and we did go out
-- we got a decent lead and then we lost it a little bit towards the end of
the half. And then Shizz rescued us with a great three at the end of the half.
I thought Ern was terrific all game long and I'm very proud of him.  
  
Q. You guys came out, you scored, you forced a turnover, you scored.
When you missed a rebound, what is it? You started so strong, was there any
loss of -- what along the way changed what was like a real fast start on both
ends?  
ERNEST AFLAKPUI: I just thought we started off pretty well, as you mentioned.
I just thought in some spreads of the game, we just lost focus. I think we
have -- we should have, like, worked hard and then keep boxing out. That was
one of the main things, like, that hurt us tonight. And the coaches have been
pushing every day, if we rebound, box out, and give them only one possession,
we will be good. It is more of losing focus during the game than basically
anything else.  
  
Q. When you look at the numbers, is there anything you immediately think
you could have done differently just in terms of McDuffie and Dennis, how much
they hurt you?  
COACH FRAN DUNPHY: We left Dennis in a corner one time in the second half. We
helped off the strong side corner which we talked about. Also the offensive
rebounds hurt us again. That probably was as big a detriment to us as
anything. We also turned it too many times that second half. We got a little
careless with the basketball. But I think, again, in fouling McDuffie when he
was shooting a jumper, we didn't need to do it.  
  
I thought they had a number of shots that I thought was going to be tough for
them to finish and we bailed them out with fouls and they shoot 22 from 24,
which is pretty impressive.  
  
Q. You talked about how you don't know if you are in the tournament or
not. Can you describe what the next 40 or so hours are going to be like? Is it
going to be hard to wait for the selection show on Sunday?  
SHIZZ ALSTON, JR.: Not really. There is nothing we can really do now. We are
going to get together as a team and enjoy the moment together with the family,
but there is nothing we can do now, just sit and wait.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Tim Jankovich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20496)

### [Jarrey Foster](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36791)

### [Jahmal McMurray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30581)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
SMU - 74, Tulsa, 65  
  
COACH TIM JANKOVICH: Well, first of all, is it me or do you have to be like
Ferdinand Magellan to find your way up to this media? That was an experience.
Happy to be here.  
  
The first half could not possibly have gone better. I didn't really like the
first four minutes. I thought they were a step quicker and a little more
aggressive as the game opened up and that worried me. Right after that, from
15 minutes on in the first half, I -- couldn't have been better. At both ends,
in all areas, I thought we played fantastic and probably built a big enough
lead to win the game.  
  
And then second half, as you know, defensively, could not script that any
better. I don't know how many minutes it went without a field goal that they
did, so we solidified our defense. The one thing, I thought we were a little
sloppy. I think we missed two dunks and a lay-up early to stretch it, which
could have maybe put it out of hand.  
  
So we're in great shape. But Tulsa did a fantastic job, I thought, of staying
aggressive, staying with it. Wore us down a little bit and made a great
comeback. But the games are won in the last five or six minutes, and we were
able to stay strong and finish it.  
  
Q. It looked like you were making shot and shot in tough situations,
Jahmal, in the second half. What was your mindset on those possessions?  
JAHMAL MCMURRAY: To stay aggressive and take the good shot. I know I'm a
scorer, so making big shots is something I can do. But just really stayed
poised and not rushing in my shots, not getting sped up is what allowed me to
play good tonight and make shots. And just like I said, stay patient and
moving the ball, and we were getting good looks and shots in, and they were
falling for me.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned that stretch in the beginning of the second half
where you held them scoreless for more than seven minutes. What were you doing
right with your zone defensively to go on that run?  
COACH TIM JANKOVICH: I don't know. Did we do anything different? It didn't
look different. I think maybe we were a little more aware of the guys we
thought were key guys, maybe. After a game starts going a while, sometimes you
get a feel. On different nights, different guys are cut in a little
differently, their confidence is higher, their determination -- they're human.
And we felt like there was a couple of their guys that you could really feel
that were capable of having a big night, and we made sure to try to be on
point and be in their area.  
  
So if anything, maybe we were a little more aware. But we didn't really make
adjustments, really. We just kind of stayed the course. It had been working
pretty well, but not as well as it did for the first six or seven minutes of
the second half.  
  
Q. Jarrey, ten points today, it's the most you've had since coming back
for the second time this year. How did you feel out there?  
JARREY FOSTER: I would say felt great. At this point in the season, just
Championship basketball. In my four years here at SMU, this is my second time
playing in a conference Championship, and I just wanted to finish this off the
right way, you know. I was kind of putting my injury and everything that's
been going on this year in the past and kind of play for me and for my
teammates, and play to win and see how long we can keep this going.  
  
So, I mean, I'm proud of myself for doing that. I'm glad that we got a win
today and advance in the next round.  
  
Q. Jahmal, every time Tulsa went on a run, you were there to answer with
a bucket. Is that sort of on your mind as you're playing offense and maybe
stop their runs, or is it more in the flow?  
JAHMAL MCMURRAY: I would say it's more in the flow. I did start noticing that
they made a nice little run, and we weren't making -- you know, a few shots
missed. And I just felt like I had to take advantage of a shot attempt, and I
knew I would knock it down. I just felt really strong that I would knock it
down, a little mid-range jumper if I got inside the paint.  
  
So I just tried to answer their run with a good shot and just keep us alive in
that game and just advance. But other than, I'm just out there playing my
game. I'm not really looking or thinking too hard.  
  
Q. Cincinnati, in the conference tournament, you have a chance to face
them tomorrow night. Does that bring extra motivation for you all?  
JAHMAL MCMURRAY: It is going to be another great game. We got to stick to our
strengths, rebound the basketball, and I feel like the battle will be a great
battle between both teams.  
  
Q. Cincinnati, a team you have played close but lost twice to this year.
How do you feel going into the match-up against them?  
COACH TIM JANKOVICH: They are hard to play against, you know. And Tulsa's hard
to play against. Tulsa runs, they're switching defenses on you a lot, they
play the match-up. Cincinnati has gotten famous for, if you want to call it, a
match-up. I don't know what to call it -- switching five, whatever. They are
not an easy team to get rhythm and feel comfortable. You have to manufacture a
lot of baskets by making plays for each other. You have to rebound and get
extra possessions. You can't turn it over. They always make you play really
pure. They are hard to play against. They're tough. They've had a tremendous
season, so any time we play them, it's a great challenge. And on zero day
preparation, it makes it even tougher. We have played them twice before, and a
lot of things will come back to us quickly and we'll be ready in a day.  
  
Q. They are a physical team, with a limited bench and having a game
today, does that make it harder not having 100 percent fresh legs?  
COACH TIM JANKOVICH: We're not going to be tired at all. Noone is tired. We
will be less tired tomorrow than we were today. We have made that decision.
Normally, you would be right, but we've already made a decision, that's not
going to be the case. So, it will be a challenge, you're right, yes.  
  
Q. Nat Dixon's minutes have slipped this year, he's out the last couple
of games. Is there a reason why you are playing him a bit less?  
COACH TIM JANKOVICH: He's been out, he's been less than 100 percent, and I
don't know that I'd call him 100 percent right now. And when you've been out
and start to lose some conditioning and the more you miss practice, the more
you miss your rhythm, your confidence, those kind of things. He certainly
didn't do anything wrong. But he has missed a great deal, so really that --
the long and short of it is he's missed a lot, and I'm not sure I'd call him
100 percent.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Dan Hurley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26699)

### [Christian Vital](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32996)

### [Tarin Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32831)

### [Jalen Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30590)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
UConn - 80, USF - 73  
  
COACH DAN HURLEY: Thrilled, obviously thrilled to advance, really liked the
way we guarded, you know, really liked the way we played the game completely,
especially the first 35 minutes. We were in complete command of that game up
until when Jalen had that sequence where Christian got knocked to the ground
and then Jalen fouled out. And then things obviously got a little sketchy for
us out there. But I thought until that point, we did everything we wanted to
do.  
  
Our guards played great, Tarin got off to a great start. Christian and Jalen
played at an incredibly high level. Tyler was big for us in the second half,
too. We did what we needed to do in terms of keeping the ball out of the
paint, especially the first 30-plus minutes. And from a rebounding stand
point, we were at least able to hold the fort there.  
  
So thrilled to advance. Obviously, winning that first game, getting a chance
to play in the quarters is exciting for us.  
  
Q. What was the feeling like in that first half when you guys were on
fire, hit 9 of 11? What kind of feeling was that for you? What was it like
experiencing a run like that?  
JALEN ADAMS: It was a great feeling. I was out there having fun with my
teammates. Especially when it is do or die and you see everything going in the
hoop like that, it's a great feeling, you build so much confidence. So I was
happy for my teammates.  
  
Q. What did you have to do to close the game out?  
CHRISTIAN VITAL: Just be solid on both ends, you know, execute our defensive
match-ups, make sure that we are in the right spots and make sure we rebound
as well. We know they are a tenacious rebounding team. They beat us on the
boards in our regular season game, so we knew if we took that from them, that
we had a pretty good chance.  
  
Q. The contributions you got from Isaiah, what can you say about that?
And how hard has it been to get him playing time with the way the roster is?  
COACH DAN HURLEY: It's tough. He is our most improved player in the conference
and he is a guy we are trying to build with, short-term and long-term. Eric
earned that back-up spot. Isaiah was hurt a lot pre-season and even in the
early part of the season, he was dealing with a high ankle. And then Eric
obviously got off to that great start at the Garden, and you want to give the
senior their crack. You want to be loyal -- or that opportunity. So we've
stayed with Eric as kind of the back-up behind Josh.  
  
But Isaiah is a such a high character guy and he's a pretty smart player and
we tipped him off the last couple of days. I know these guys have been talking
to him. I know Jalen talked to him about being ready, and Pork Chop was ready
today!  
  
Q. Christian, in that first half, you made four threes in a five-minute
span. You have been shooting the ball well all year, but did you do anything
different?  
JALEN ADAMS: I think the game is just slowing down for me. Coach has put
emphasis on not taking just any shot, taking the right shot, you know. So like
I saw how my teammates were hot in the first half, so I didn't want to take
any extra shots where they could get one. And when the shots came to me, what
I knew I could make, I put them up.  
  
Q. Tarin, early in the game they might be leaving you open a little bit,
and you hit those three shots right away and then that seemed to change a bit
with that. Is that the way you saw it?  
TARIN SMITH: Yeah. I knew they were going to leave me open, but I was ready to
fire. My coach had confidence in me, all the assistant coaches had confidence
in me, my teammates were saying -- Jay say yesterday if you're open you better
shoot it, and I've been shooting the ball well in practice, make a couple, and
that got us on the run.  
  
Q. You guys have dealt with a lot of adversity this year with guys being
out. Did that help you when you got Josh in foul trouble and Jalen to know you
could still do it because you have been used to making adjustments on the
fly?  
CHRISTIAN VITAL: Absolutely. I didn't panic at all. My teammates didn't panic
either. We know everyone has worked on their game a lot, and throughout the
year has become more confident each game and each practice. So when I was out
there, I just knew that the other four guys were confident in themselves as
well, and we were going to win that game no matter what.  
  
Q. You guys had lost six in a row. You've now won three of four, you
have advanced, you have a daunting task tomorrow. I'm wondering your thoughts
on confidence, playing the top team in the league and kind of having built
some momentum leading into this, the importance of that?  
COACH DAN HURLEY: These guys have helped us establish a work ethic, character,
culture, and we stayed in the fight. And young players kept developing and
Tarin and Christian while Jalen was out kept things together. I don't know if
you know this about Christian, but he's got a lot of confidence. I don't think
anyone ever gave in.  
  
Quietly on the side, they saw Jalen working and rehabbing, and I'm sure they
knew he was going to get back out there for us. So I think, you know, that
South Florida win at home was huge for us and to get Jalen back, you could see
the way offensively in particular things have changed. He just gets so much
attention, and he just makes the right play so often. And when you have a guy,
a player of his caliber on your team and you have a guy shooting the ball the
way Christian is and some of the other pieces we have, you always have got a
chance. When you have the most talented player in the conference on your team,
you always have a chance.  
  
Q. For anybody really - the challenge of Houston tomorrow, what do they
bring to the table and how tough will that be for you guys?  
JALEN ADAMS: It will be a tough challenge. We are ready for it. Our guys held
their own in the first match-up without two starters, and I think the
confidence is going to go through the roof with me coming back. And I don't
know. We'll see what happens.  
  
CHRISTIAN VITAL: We got Jalen back so I like our chances.  
  
Q. Christian and Jalen, how much difference does this feel than the game
last year with SMU? Ironically the score was the same 80-73 only the reverse.
How much different this feels like from last year in this tournament?  
COACH DAN HURLEY: We should have won by more. I'm sorry...  
  
CHRISTIAN VITAL: The main difference is we are not thinking about going back
to Storrs right now, to just be honest with you. We're thinking about Houston,
our next match-up, and going to the next round. And with a lot of confidence,
with a good group of guys who feel confident, not only in themselves but in
each other. We have been through a lot this year. And now it's March, now it
is time to lay everything out on the line.  
  
JALEN ADAMS: I think the difference between last year and this year is just
the team is so much more locked in. We are not worrying about other things,
outside things. Everyone is locked in on the team in front of us, the match-
ups, all of that stuff. So now that we've got past USF, we are all locked in
on Houston, so outside things are affecting us.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Penny Hardaway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36776)

### [Kyvon Davenport](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34876)

### [Jeremiah Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32941)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Memphis, 83 - Tulane, 68  
  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: Well, it was one of those games where Tulane to us had
nothing to lose because they didn't win a game in conference, so we knew they
had a week to prepare for us. We knew they were going to have something going
with Jeremiah where they were going to try to make someone else beat them. And
we prepared really well for them and got into the game, started off slow. Kind
of pushed away and then kind of got lax, and being up 20 and -- just went away
from our game plan. Luckily for us, we got the game back under control and was
able to pull a win out.  
  
Q. This question is for the coach. Going into the game, was there any
specific plan as far as minute distribution? And as several guys went over 20
minutes tonight, did it exceed what you thought you had to play guys into the
second half?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: Well, we felt like we had to do what we had to do to win
the game. Because if you lose this game, trying to manage minutes, then you
don't play tomorrow anyway. It is what it is. It is an early enough game for
the guys to get hydrated, get off their feet, and be ready for tomorrow's
game, even though it's an early game. We would have loved for everybody to
have played under 20 minutes. I mean, we are not disrespecting Tulane. We felt
like if we came out and took care of our business in the first five to ten
minutes that we could push the game away. But we could never push the game
away, so that's why the starters had to play so many minutes.  
  
Q. What did you see from the sideline that allowed their defense to slow
you down a little bit in the second half?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: All they did was load up on Jeremiah, and it was up to
him to make the right decisions and for the others to capitalize on those
double teams. Every time he got the ball -- we're going to watch on film --
people were open, they just have to make plays. We had a lot of turnovers in
the second half as well. When you give that ball to those guys, they've to
make plays. We should be used to this by now.  
  
Q. Was that something you planned on or was that more of a result that
he took what the game gave him?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: Yeah. Mike came out and played phenomenal, his best game
of the year. 13 rebounds is his high on the year, 14 points. I might have sat
him too long trying to get Isaiah Maurice going because we're going to need
both guys for the entire tournament, but he played a phenomenal game.  
  
Q. How important was it for you guys, not just today but for the rest of
this week, to get Kyvon, get Mike, get guys like that going, how important
will that be moving forward?  
JEREMIAH MARTIN: It's been important all year. The one thing Coach said, we're
going to need everybody. So everybody he put in, we will need from the guys on
the bench that don't even play. So it's great when you get production around
the boy because he's only going to make stress less on the people that need to
make plays.  
  
Q. Yesterday, I wonder if you felt snubbed about not winning Conference
Player of the Year?  
JEREMIAH MARTIN: No, I didn't feel like I did enough. It is out of my control.
I will play hard every game.  
  
Q. Did you tell Tyler coming off the bench that he had the green
light?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: Tyler does have the green light. We want him to
understand time and score for sure, but we want him to always have confidence
that he can take -- because he feels he can make any shot that he takes. We
want him to stay smart about what he does and give him that green light for
sure. He needs to look for his shot because he's a weapon. He's going to a
draw double team pretty much like -- or definitely a face card like Jeremiah
does. And that helps us out. That helps us really spread the floor, because
when he comes on they have to really respect that. He does have that green
light.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to UCF, what challenges does it bring, trying to
prepare for a team for a third time in a season and what kind do you expect
from them in this game?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: Yeah, we felt like, you know, in both games, we had a
good game plan, so we feel they will make adjustments on what we did to them
to affect them. Here, we had a really good game and beat them by 20 down there
and went to the wire. They have a really good team. They might be the hottest
team in our league right now, the way they finished the season and put
themselves in the top 25.  
  
The challenges are going to be that this is the third time. The things that we
were successful at, they've had a chance to work on them. Because out of us
and Tulane, they probably figure Memphis will probably win that game, so
they've had a lot of time to prepare. And then they watched us today, so
they're going to make some more minor adjustments. We will have to be hitting
on all cylinders tomorrow.  
  
Q. Obviously, physically, it's tough to possibly have to play four games
in four days, but how do you prepare for a game every day like that if you had
to play four games in four days, how tough?  
JEREMIAH MARTIN: We just day to day with it. We are taking every game one at a
time. We are not looking past the game that we have right in front of us. We
know that we are up for four games, but we are taking it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Kyvon?  
JEREMIAH MARTIN: He says the same thing.  
  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: Honestly, with us as coaches, we are always
brainstorming and we will take each game, like Jeremiah said, one by one. And
we've already played these teams, so we know what they're going to run. Even
though they had a week to make some wrinkles, there's only so many changes
you're going to make right before the conference tournament. We're familiar,
so mentally, we have got to get ready -- we know they're going to do something
to take Jeremiah out of the game. Physically, we have to get rest and hydrate
for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, this is your first conference game, what jitters -- you said
you had no nerves all year. What jitters did you have coming into the game and
what did you think about the ovation when you walked on the court?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: I was shocked. That was great. They showed the
appreciation and it shocked me. It was a warm welcome. It got my juices
flowing when I got that ovation. That ovation to me -- we know how serious
this is for you guys and we are here to support you. First part of the
question?  
  
Oh, no butterflies today. I feel like when it is this time of year, that's
when I really -- I look forward to this time of year. I try to stay as calm as
I can because I feel like I have to think the game out, the entire game. I
haven't got any butterflies yet. They weren't there today.  
  
Q. Penny, Kyvon held you guys through in the second half, how was he
able to keep you guys going and keeping that lead?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: He made some big shots, made big plays, penetrated. They
had a five-man guard on him and he was too quick for that. There was not
enough spacing for Kyvon to get going. We didn't really recognize just to get
spacing and allow him to work more because he could have done more things. But
the things he did in the second half was basically knock down his jump shot
and then he took advantage of his speed against the five man and made plays
because they tried to take Jeremiah out of the game.  
  
KYVON DAVENPORT: Yeah. They was taking Jeremiah out of the game, so like Coach
said, they had a five man, so it was basically about making plays on him. So
just driving past and knocking down open shots, I can help out the team.  
  
Q. Penny, the whole city and the fan base have been talking about this
tournament and maybe winning four games in four days for a while. How do you
-- it sounds like you have got these guys focussing on one game at a time. Has
that been something you have struggled with, keeping them focussed? How do you
keep what the noise that is going on here playing the tournament in the city
from your locker room, basically?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: I think the Tulane game to me was a trap game because
everybody was saying you're going to win when you guys play UCF, and that's
when you get into trouble. More so towards that game, they know UCF is ranked
top 25 team. We played them twice and we know how good they are. We're not
going to come into the game complacent against those guys even though we
didn't today. But hearing that about Tulane could get you to fall asleep a
bit. But UCF, you don't need much to get up for those guys. You know that they
are good, if you don't come to play, they will blow you out.  
  
Q. Coach, the Memphis uniforms, was that we're going to do that because
it works so well with the enthusiasm the last time you wore them out?  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: We kind of talked about that. We wanted to wear them as
much as we could. After today we might fall to the away team uniforms because
of the bracket how it falls. And this will be the only time that we would have
been able to wear them the way the bracket goes.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible).  
COACH PENNY HARDAWAY: Yes. That's Nike. That's Nike family around the country
that we wear those shirts. That was all about Nike. That wasn't our own doing.
Nike gives all the teams. They had the same ones on and their colors are jut
-- it is about family with us as well.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, you and Mike were in sync in the first half. What were you
seeing with him and his presence inside especially earlier in the game?  
JEREMIAH MARTIN: The coach tells me every day -- like before the game, he told
me to be looking out for the team to be trying some different stuff. And Mike
was in the right place at the right time. The coach always tell them, you will
be open. He trusted what coach said and trusted the guy playing because we
knew he was going to be open.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Frank Haith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18342)

### [Jeriah Horne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36790)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
SMU - 74, Tulsa, 65  
  
COACH FRANK HAITH: Okay, thank you. Obviously, I thought we struggled shooting
the ball. We took 33 threes, and we don't want to take 33 threes. But I though
we had opportunities to throw the ball inside more. We didn't. We just
couldn't buy a basket, and then we couldn't guard McMurray. I thought he was
fantastic. Those two things really did us in.  
  
Q. For you, once you guys got it down to 6, their lead, did you feel
like, having come back from 20 points, you guys could make it close and come
back all the way?  
JERIAH HORNE: Yes. First and foremost, I would like to thank my Lord and
Savior, Jesus Christ.  
  
Yeah, I did. I think we had a lot of momentum going into that little stretch
there. We gave it all we got. We continued to fight, even though it wasn't
going well for us at that point in time in the game. But I did feel like we
gave ourselves a great chance to win that game.  
  
Q. It was more than seven minutes at the start of the second half you
guys didn't score. You weren't out there for all that time. What was going on
with that?  
JERIAH HORNE: Really it was both teams that were struggling to score, you
know. I think, at least from our perspective over on the bench, we were
looking at is as we have our opportunity to come back. And we -- you know, we
took a good chance at that opportunity, and I feel like we fought hard.  
  
Q. You have had games where you have shot really well. There have been
games where you haven't shot well. When it is happening like this in a game
like this, what can you do during the game?  
COACH FRANK HAITH: During that stretch there, I think we went seven minutes
without scoring and I think we missed the first 10 threes in the second half.
I thought we were pressing. We were trying so hard and we had some really good
looks. It just didn't go. And we were getting stops. I think we stopped their
first five or six possessions. If we could have scored a little bit, it would
have made it interesting. I will commend our guys. We kept fighting. We had
open threes, we had shots in the paint. They blocked a couple of our layups
around the basket.  
  
It's tough. All you can do is continue to encourage your guys. We were a
little stressing and we were a little tight and I felt we were competing and
trying really hard.  
  
Q. Lawson had a ton of rebounds. Your guys were fighting, but it wasn't
resulting in points?  
COACH FRANK HAITH: There are games like that where we were competing -- we had
ten offensive rebounds and he had five of them. So we were doing things. That
is easily an indicator of how hard you are playing when you are getting loose
balls and getting second shots. I thought we were doing that. We couldn't put
it in the hole. I thought we were executing offensive, we got some good looks.
Then, McMurray hit some big shots. We couldn't score. We cut it to six.
McMurray hit a big shot on the right-wing. He made some big plays for them
when they needed him. Our guys kept fighting. We couldn't put the ball in the
hole.  
  
Q. It's always tough when a season ends. What did you say to the guys in
the locker room?  
COACH FRANK HAITH: We want to congratulate and thank our seniors, Alex, Daquan
and Lindsay, Tap -- they have had great careers. We wish them well. We are
always here for them. And to our returning guys. We have to have some huge
improvements between now and next year and then we have to continue to
recruit. I didn't say that to them, but we have to continue to recruit.  
  
Q. Being one of those returning guys, do you see some things to improve
on and positives to take from this year?  
JERIAH HORNE: I feel like the coach said. Everybody has to work and looking
forward to the next season, since this one is behind us now. And just
continuing to work on us coming together even more as a team and working on
some things off the court as well will be very important.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Brian Gregory](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19617)

### [David Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34880)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
UConn, 80 - USF, 73  
  
COACH BRIAN GREGORY: Give UConn a lot of credit in terms of their first half.
Their run, and their transition offense really put us in a bind. We are on our
heels in transition. They made some threes in that, which kind of set the tone
for the first half.  
  
I thought in the second half we played a lot better, just couldn't get that
lead under 10 until the last four minutes. Our guys, as they've done all year-
long, continued to fight the whole game, just didn't make enough baskets to
cut into that lead earlier in the second half.  
  
Defensively, we didn't play as well as we need to play to beat a team that is
as explosive offensively at the guard spot as they are. A big key for us was
to do a good job on Carlton because he's been playing so well. We got him in
foul trouble and we kind of eliminated him from the game. But, you know,
they're a different team when Jalen Adams plays because he creates shots for
other people and he's able to make shots.  
  
We weren't as aggressive as we needed to be in the first half, so played
better in the second half, but in this league, against that type of
competition, not good enough.  
  
Q. Coach Gregory, UConn was 0 of 15 in that game and then they go on
that huge run. What was the difference between those two games?  
COACH BRIAN GREGORY: We were very good defensively and they missed some open
shots, so we had them off rhythm a little bit. When you've got a team that can
shoot the ball, if you give them some open ones and they get it going, they
start making some tough ones and that's what we did. Tarin Smith got them
going early. We let Vital get loose a bit as well. They made some tough ones
that were contested. They are a good shooting team that can really get going
at times, volatile scores in Vital and Adams, and that is what you saw today.  
  
Q. David, after being down big in the first half, what does it say about
the resiliency of your team to come back and make it close in the second
half?  
DAVID COLLINS: That is one trait that we have, we always fight, that is what
we are going to do to carry on, that is our identity.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the success of the season and where you started
from the beginning of the year till now?  
COACH BRIAN GREGORY: We are disappointed right now. We wanted to do another
thing that had never been done in our program and that's winning this
tournament. We've never done it. So our guys had an opportunity to do that.
When you have an opportunity like that and you don't make the most of it, it's
disappointing. And you're in the midst of the season and you want to keep
winning and you want to win games and all those different things.  
  
But if you told me that this program and we'd have this type of success at
this point, little less than two years ago when we took over the job, I didn't
think we'd be here, you know. A lot of credit goes to the guys and a lot of
credit goes to my staff. We talk about recruiting and developing because
that's how you build a program. And in two recruiting classes, we have two
guys that have made the all-freshman team, two guys have made all-league
defense, defensive player of the year, and freshman of the year. That is
recruiting and developing and bringing in guys that want to be developed and
want to work so the future is bright.  
  
At the same time, we live in a "now" society, so we wanted more right, and we
didn't play well enough today to do that. But, at the same time, as I said,
the building process is never a linear line, where you just, everything builds
on top. There's peaks and valleys to it, and you have to stay consistent and
resilient, and our guys have proven that all year-long that they have done
that. We're going to be able to use some of the disappointments and adversity
that we are facing right now in order to build.  
  
You look at UConn and what they did today. Tarin Smith led them off and he's a
fifth-year senior. Jalen Adams is a senior, and those two guys dominated the
game. And, again, you have to get to that point where you are playing upper-
classman, and they have been through this stuff before. And we're just not
quite there yet, you know.  
  
At the same time -- again, I'm not going to lie, we're disappointed in that.
But not discouraged and there's a big difference between the two.  
  
Q. Coach, you have often described Laquincy as a rhythm player and
missing out on the last two games was hard for him. Did he get back in that
rhythm today?  
COACH BRIAN GREGORY: I thought he was better. He was better. You can see out
there he is not at 100 percent. I thought there were times where he had 7
assists, David had 4 assists. You saw a little bit of what we were before he
got hurt in the first Central Florida game. So, again, the rest definitely
helped him. But because of that out of rhythm, that we are not able
defensively to play the same way we were playing before in terms of our
initial pick-up and stopping their break in the back court as opposed to when
they're in their front court. So it's - you've got to pick it up in some other
areas and just not quite able to do that today.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Jaime Echenique](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36801)

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

### [Markis McDuffie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30785)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Wichita State - 73, ECU - 57  
  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Well, I thought we were very workmanlike tonight,
building the lead to double-digits in the first half and then ultimately, over
20 in the second half, and then we were trying to finish the game and not tax
these guys too much physically in terms of minutes, and we were able to do
that. But I think the key was our bigs, getting the ball inside and being very
effective.  
  
Q. Coach, and both players, I know it's only been a few minutes. Could I
get your impressions on Temple who you will be playing tomorrow night?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: A very good team. They're in form all year, other than
when they came down to play us. But at the same time, we are trying to make
the NCAA tournament as well, so we will be trying to win the game. I've got
great guards. Shizz Alston was tremendous last time and Quinton Rose and
Pierre-Louis, they are ball hawks, they can shoot it, drive it, and they are a
well coached team.  
  
MARKIS MCDUFFIE: Same as coach said. They are a really good team. They are
from Philadelphia, so we're going to have to guard the ball one-on-one and
help the hooker and play more smarter and more aggressive, so we could pull
out the win.  
  
JAIME ECHENIQUE: We lose that game and we did a good job, but we didn't get
the result that we wanted, it is a really talented team and a physical team.
Everything will be determined tomorrow, so I hope we do a good job tomorrow.  
  
Q. You said that you have been rooting for them all year and you have
spoken highly of Fran Dunphy. Is that the reason why?  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: I would like to see Coa h Dunphy him in the NTA
tournament in his last year. I hope they are solidly in. They have both done
enough to be in, but we are both trying to get to the NCAA tournament and our
only way is to win the next game and then the two subsequent games.  
  
Q. As far as the fans go, it sounds like there was a big Wichita State
following out there. Does that help you out at all, does it give you extra
adrenaline?  
MARKIS MCDUFFIE: Most definitely, to see the fans' support and I have been a
part of it for four years, so I'm not surprised at all. But I know these guys
are, considering it is their first time experiencing an American tournament, a
Conference tournament and it helps us. As soon as before the game starts, they
all surround us and support us, and show us a lot of love and give us a lot of
energy before the game. That's how amazing this Wichita State community is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Much has been made about your relative lack of experience
coming into this season. Are we at the point now where that is out the window
and you are peaking at the right time with seven straight wins?  
  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Well, at this point, you know, these guy, these freshmen
especially and a couple of JuCos, we had ten scholarship guys that had never
played a second of Division I basketball and two more that had played very few
minutes in their careers of Division I. So other than Markis McDuffie, it was
12 newbies and they have to consider themselves veterans. They have logged a
lot of minutes, more than they probably should if we weren't in that
particular situation. They've handled it well, they have got better, they have
allowed us to improve, and that is what we try to do in this program, get
these young men better so that we can win more games and then ultimately, they
can have better pro careers.  
  
Q. This being your last Conference tournament as a senior, do you think
that puts more pressure on you personally?  
MARKIS MCDUFFIE: Not at all. We have to handle business. This is something
that I'm used to. I'm used to being in a Conference tournament and playing in
the play-offs, used to being a Wichita State basketball player and winning in
a winning program, so it doesn't put no pressure on me personally. It makes me
cherish the moments I have left.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Mike Dunleavy, Sr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32895)

### [Caleb Daniels](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36775)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Memphis, 83 - Tulane, 68  
  
COACH MIKE DUNLEAVY SR: Yes, obviously disappointed we lost the game. First
half for us I thought, you know, we let things get away from us, mainly a lot
of loose ball opportunities and some of the turnovers that we made against
their pressure, we righted that in the second half. The overall theme for us
was the fact that we missed a lot of opportunity baskets right round the hoop
that we didn't finish on, that they did. Their bigs were able to shape up and
make scores and then, of course, at the end, we cut it back to seven, but we
went to fouling and the game got away from us.  
  
Q. Coach, you have played this team several times this year. There's
been talk in different reports, what has it been like on your end preparing
for a Penny Hardaway-coached team?  
COACH MIKE DUNLEAVY SR: He runs a lot of good stuff. We did a good job on
Jeremiah Martin today. He got 43 against us the last time we played here, he
had a 41-point game the second half. We did pretty good. He had 21. Probably
eight or ten or those, we had a foul. He is a tough customer. His ability to
take you off the dribble and how he stretches the floor, it's tough. You know,
their size, and I thought their guards made some nice plays and drop-off
plays. Parks was 6 for 6 and all layups and 13 rebounds.  
  
But overall, I thought they are a well-coached team and things they run, you
know, puts pressure on your defense to do things correctly to give yourself a
chance to stop the players.  
  
Q. Final question: What do you - how are you and your team are able to
offer this experience right now?  
COACH MIKE DUNLEAVY SR: It's been a terrible year, if you don't win a game all
year in conference. Part of it is circumstantial. We got caught in a perfect
storm. Our starting point guard from the last two years Ray Ona Embo has been
out all year. We penciled him in to play 30, 35 minutes a night. We didn't
recruit another freshman point guard because we had a transfer, Jordan Walker,
who sits one and plays three. Jordan Cornish, he's really a wing player,
having to play the point, Caleb would have to play some point for us. Shakwon
Barrett, red-shirt freshman played some point for us.  
  
That's one of the areas where for the year, we turned the ball over a lot. The
good news for us is we had -- we got a lot of freshman with great experience.
Three of our freshmen, real freshmen had great experience. They got game
experience tonight. Coming into the season, we were ranked 330-something out
of 350 as far as experience. We got a lot of freshmen with a lot of good
experience this year. A red-shirt freshman, Buay Koka, our seven-footer, who
broke his hand, he was starting for us and playing well. Our nucleus of what
we have coming back next year is really strong.  
  
We will have a major turnaround and I'm excited about who they are and what
they have been doing at home in practices and just us to get the depth that
those guys will bring to us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Caleb, if I could ask you -- this was a game that was a
23-point game early in the second half and yet you make it a run towards the
end, hold them without for a field goal for the last five minutes, what does
it say about the character of your team and giving you hope going into next
year?  
  
CALEB DANIELS: Although we are a bunch of young guys, we just never quit
fighting, never give up. You keep playing hard, you don't know where the chips
are going to fall. That is something that we have been priding ourself on all
year. We just play hard. It doesn't look like that in the record column. For
the future, we'll be something special for sure.  
  
COACH MIKE DUNLEAVY SR: The growth of our team, being led by Caleb, his jump
of game from his freshman year to his sophomore year right now, and the way
he's finishing up 19 points today with a whole defense that's geared towards
him. He had 36 the other night against Wichita State. The difference is last
year having two guys on his team that were NBA players, you didn't see the
attention. Now he's had to deal with double teams and traps and guys putting
their best defender on him.  
  
So, again, I thought he had a great year for us and his growth was, you know,
something that for us going forward -- the type of player we know he can be in
terms of being able to carry the load, he got some great experience of doing
that this year.

# [AMERICAN ATHLETIC CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=AMERICAN+ATHLETIC+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Joe Dooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30634)

### [Jayden Gardner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36806)

  
_Memphis, Tennessee_  
  
Wichita State, 73 - ECU, 57  
  
COACH JOE DOOLEY: I thought obviously Wichita wore us down in the paint, and
we didn't respond very well. We gave up a lot of points in the first half off
of second shots and off of our turnovers, and that was the difference of the
game, especially in the first half.  
  
Q. Obviously, not the outcome that you would have liked to see. What
positives do you think you could take away from the season as a whole?  
JAYDEN GARDNER: I mean, at the end of the season, you always have to look back
and look what you can do better. Obviously, we have some down time so I will
be able to get back in the gym, work on my craft, and work on my game, and
start getting ready for the next season as soon as possible.  
  
Q. Coach, maybe if you can talk a bit about the progression of the
program from a year ago when you took it over to where you are tonight.  
COACH JOE DOOLEY: There's -- we've got a long way to go and we know it. I do
think -- I was disappointed with the way we played tonight in a lot of
regards. For the most part, the latter part of the season, we've been very
competitive and this wasn't what we've been doing. I think we have a lot of
work to do. We need to do a lot of recruiting. We need to -- we have a long
way to go, and we've got to get after it.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the gentleman sitting next to you and what he
accomplished this year and all that he proved this year in this league.  
COACH JOE DOOLEY: One thing about it is his effort is consistent, and the
reason his effort was consistent is because his attitude was consistent, his
work ethic was consistent. And one of the things about Jayden -- this is a
compliment -- he does have a long way to go. He will put the work in and he'll
continue to get better.  
  
Q. Can you tell us what it was like for your first Conference
tournament? Would you say the level of competition was higher because of a
one-and-done situation?  
JAYDEN GARDNER: I mean, every Conference tournament has a high competition.
Unfortunately, Wichita State played harder than us tonight and they wanted it
more than us tonight.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 17, 2019

  

### [Mark Schmidt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23402)

### [LaDarien Griffin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34917)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Saint Louis 55, St. Bonaventure 53.  
  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, I thought it was a great college game. I thought we
played extremely well in the first half. You know, both offensively and
defensively. We rebounded the ball well.  
  
The second half give Saint Louis credit. They came after us. They are a very
good halfcourt defensive team. They took away some of our actions and really
made it a one-on-one game.  
  
I thought going into the game, if someone was going to tell me we were going
to hold them to 55 points and 57 percent from the field and 18 percent from
threes, and we're going to out-rebound them by three, I thought we'd have a
great chance of winning. And we did. You know, we had three shots at the end,
two really good ones, I think, good looks that we missed. But give our guys
credit. We were down, whatever, eight, with a couple minutes left and we have
a chance to win the game.  
  
So disappointing, but at the same time, you know, where we came from, it's
pretty remarkable what these guys have done. But give Saint Louis credit. They
played well. I thought Goodwin was terrific and to me, he was the difference.
I thought we did a good job on Isabell, on Bess, but they got a lot of good
players, well-coached, and we wish them luck.  
  
Q. Congratulations on a remarkable season and advancing to the A-10
Tournament. That you can about that start that you had going on that, I think
it was that 10- or 13-2 run.  
LaDARIEN GRIFFIN: Early on we knew it was important for the first five
minutes, they were going to come out strong and we needed to come out strong
and set the tone. I think we did that well. It was just hard for us to kind of
maintain it throughout the game, so yeah.  
  
Q. You guys have been such a good second half team lately. What is it
that they were able to do that knocked you guys off your game?  
LaDARIEN GRIFFIN: Kind of like Coach said, they took away some of our actions.
Made us catch the ball further out and just made it tough on us. We just -- we
missed a lot of shots in the second half. We weren't getting -- we didn't get
to the free throw line enough, and we didn't get enough stops at the end. When
you can't play defense at the end and get your stops, it's going to be hard
when you don't score and you're going to fall behind like we did.  
  
Q. Courtney Stockard fouls out at the end of the game. Do you feel like
that was a difference-maker once he went out?  
LaDARIEN GRIFFIN: We played without Courtney before. I don't think it was that
much of a difference. He hit a nice shot. We missed him out there, yeah, for
sure, but guys stepped up and we just missed a shot at the end.  
  
Q. You and Courtney are so tight. What did you guys talk about in the
locker room after the game?  
LaDARIEN GRIFFIN: We didn't really talk. We'll probably talk more about it
later, but probably in this moment, we just let it sit in and we talk about it
behind closed doors.  
  
Q. I know it's certainly difficult right now after a loss, but can you
guys as players even take a moment right now to just reflect on the fact that,
you know, that you're even in the championship game today; that you're 20
minutes from making the NCAA Tournament, after everything you went through
earlier this year, can you appreciate that now?  
LaDARIEN GRIFFIN: Yeah, for sure. A lot of teams would have folded in that
situation, but these guys didn't. We stayed tight. We worked on everything,
kind of back from the beginning, the basics, and we just started running --
when we started getting confidence and running off wins, just the run we went
on, winning, what was it, 10-1, 9-1 in the last ten, I'm proud of these guys.
These guys are going to be really, really good, but just to be part of that is
something special. I don't think anybody would have thought we would have been
in this situation.  
  
Q. You've got a heck of a freshman group that played as well as they did
with Osun and Kyle and Welch. How high would you say the expectations are
coming into next season?  
LADARIEN GRIFFIN: I mean, I hope they win it. They are good enough. Those guys
are going to work. They are going to use this as motivation. As long as that
group stay together, they going to be special and I'm going to be rooting for
them from wherever I'm at.  
  
Q. Congratulations on advancing to the championship game. It's been such
a thrill working with this program. Tell us about what you're looking most
forward to about for next season with this freshman class.  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, it's hard to answer. You know, we got talented guys,
but you know, we're disappointed. You know, we'll give them a couple weeks off
and go back to work, but we've got a good group. The future's bright. We've
got to bring in some more guys, but they are a talented group of guys that are
going to continue to get better.  
  
Q. Tremendous run here over the second half of the season. What do you
say to guys like Courtney and LaDarien, seniors who have been with you for
years, when you go out like this?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: It's hard. It's devastating. You put so much into this,
you know, and not in the last couple years; a lifetime. These kids have been
dreaming about this since they were a little kid playing in their backyard or
shooting hoops on the street. They have been terrific for us. They have had a
lot of wins. They helped bring the program back, and what they did this year
was terrific. You know, LaDarien alluded to, things weren't going well and
they just kept on fighting, and you know, it's disappointing that we lost, but
if somebody -- we were talking to one referees before the game and he worked
our Cayman Islands game, and he goes, if I had to bet that you guys were going
to be in the championship game after what I saw down there, it's a miracle.  
  
So all the credit goes to our players and those two seniors, and Nelson, too.
They helped lead us back from 4-9, 4-10, to having a chance to -- one shot
away from going to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Considering everything you guys have accomplished over the last
several years, winning an A-10 Championship, making the NCAA Tournament,
winning an NCAA Tournament game, what you did this year in getting this team
to this game today, how do you view that in a larger context?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: It's not about me. It's about our players and our staff.  
  
You know, when things aren't going well, as a coach, as a coaching staff, you
reassess and you can either stop working and give in and say, this is going to
be an off year, or you know, you can go to work and work harder, and that's
what we did.  
  
But no matter what we did, we can work as hard as we want; it's about the
players, and they have to buy into it, and they did. That's the thing that I'm
most proud of is that those guys, they were coachable.  
  
They understood that they were making mistakes; they weren't good enough and
they needed to get better. Kids nowadays, it's always someone else's fault,
but they took ownership and they understood that we weren't playing well and
part of this was the injuries, but they kept at it, and they didn't give in
and that's why we're here today.  
  
Q. Obviously the rebounding category wasn't strong enough today. How big
of an aspect do you think that played in the fact that Saint Louis was able to
get so many offensive rebounds and get second chance buckets?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: We out-rebounded them by three, so going into the game, we
got out-rebounded at halftime at our place by 14, and we were out-rebounded at
our place by nine -- totally. So our goal was if we could keep it within five,
and we were plus three.  
  
So as I said in my opening statement, if I was going into the game and someone
said we were going to out-rebound them by three, that's a great effort by our
guys, and they had 14 offensive rebounds and we had 13. So it wasn't the
rebounding part of it that lost the game for us.  
  
Q. My question to you is: How did you feel about the fan turnout today?
A lot of St. Bonaventure fans in the building.  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: It's always amazing. They travel. They are so passionate,
and if someone's never been up to Olean. You need to come up. It just is
passionate fans. They love basketball, and that place was three-quarters
Bonaventure people and we've got 29,000 alums, one of the smallest schools in
the country, and for them to show up like that -- that's not unusual. That
happens all the time wherever we go and that's why I'm so proud to be the
coach.  
  
Q. You said rebounding wasn't the problem.  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah.  
  
Q. Is there any one specific area that you think contributed mostly?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, we couldn't score. Like I said, we held them to 55
points. They were 37 percent, 18 percent from threes. We out-rebounded them.
We couldn't score. Give Saint Louis credit. They did a really good job of
taking away some of our actions and making it a one-on-one game, and we don't
have one-on-one type players.  
  
But it was more offensively. We scored 19 points in the second half. But our
goal was to hold them under 60 points and I think this is the first game that
we lost when we held an opponent under 60. You know, it was more offense, but
at the same time, as I said, we had a couple shots to win the game, you know,
and that's just how it goes.  
  
From a defensive standpoint, from a rebounding standpoint, we did what we
wanted to do. We just didn't play well enough offensively in the second half.  
  
Q. We talk about the grown men that Saint Louis has, and even with how
good the freshmen have been for you, do you feel like they were overwhelmed a
little bit today?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: I don't know if overwhelmed is the right word, but they
are physical, you know, and they are -- sometimes, you know, they had 30, 40,
50 pounds on us. That's no excuse. They have 30, 40, 50 pounds and we still
out-rebound them.  
  
You know, so it wasn't an effort thing. Just they are a good defensive
halfcourt defensive team. They couldn't get much on the open court, so we were
attacking them five-on-five, and it's hard, French is back there blocking
shots. So that was, from a physicality standpoint, it was defensively, they
got into us and did a good job of getting into the gaps, and as I said, taking
away our initial action, and part of it was that physicality.  
  
Q. Obviously Courtney wasn't on the floor of that last possession, but
what was the plan for you guys in that last 14 seconds?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: We were playing to win. You know, with Courtney out, I
thought if we went to over time, it would be difficult for us to win. You
know, so we were -- we were trying to win it, and like I said, we had three
opportunities that we missed, but they were -- they were good shots, and you
know, sometimes they go in. It's not because we don't work at it. You know,
it's just the way it goes. Some jumpshots don't go in.  
  
Q. What do you think the postseason opportunities might be, NIT,
anything else?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: I have no idea. I have no idea.  
  
Q. Would you guys accept a bid into --  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: NIT? Yeah, I would assume, yeah. We'd accept the NIT. The
CIT and all that stuff, probably not, but if the NIT came, yeah.  
  
Q. I think Nelson had two last shots at the end,?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: He had the last one.  
  
Q. Are you comfortable with him taking the shot at the end?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, it's two seconds left on the shot clock, on the game
clock. If that goes in, we win. You know, he's hit shots in his career, and
you know, it's hard. He came off the bench. He didn't play for two hours, and
for him to come up and try to make that shot, it's hard.  
  
And I know he's disappointed, but at the end of the game, you can't really
choose, you know, who is going to take that last shot.  
  
Q. First of all, congratulations, even though you lost, after going
through the season that you went through, toughing it out with some tough
wins, one shot away from winning the A-10 Championship, what did you learn
from this team?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Life lessons. You know, when you're down, you can either,
you know, stay down or get up and fight, and our guys got up and fought.  
  
We had tough-minded kids that didn't listen to the noise, and just went about
their business. You know, they earned the right to be successful. They didn't
quit. They worked at it.  
  
Could have been easily -- you know, everybody talked about what we lost last
year and then we get off to a bad start. It would have been easy for them just
to throw in the towel, but they didn't do that. You know, they will be better
for it.  
  
Q. Is this something, what happened today, sort of what comes from
relying on freshmen? You had three guys, young guys, who played so well this
year, but in a big stage.  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Like I said, you know, Saint Louis is a heck of a team.
They won 23 games and we had the shot to win the game. You know, if someone --
when I woke up this morning and someone called me and said, you're going to
have a shot to win the Atlantic 10 Championship, you going to take it? And I
said absolutely, so we're right there. No matter freshmen, sophomores,
whatever, we had an opportunity to win, and we missed the shot, but at the
same time, like I said, give Saint Louis credit. They fought and they played
good defense and they deserved the win.

_Washington, D.C._  
  
Saint Louis 55, St. Bonaventure 53.  
  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: First off, just we have a lot of respect for St.
Bonaventure and Mark Schmidt, and what a great, great job he's done this
season with his team, and what a championship game. What a competitive game.
You just saw some guys, both teams, really, really competing, very much
competing.  
  
You know, we've -- in the tournament, we came back in the first game. The
other two games, we were right there. We haven't really dug our defense too
big a hole or been down -- I guess we didn't get the lead until late or the
middle of the second half. So I was proud of our guys.  
  
You know, I knew, I thought we made a few adjustments and talked about a few
things at halftime. I was just hoping with he had enough in our tank. I'm
thinking, we've played three games, they have only played two and we're the
team that's going to have to make this comeback. We're going to have to dig,
dig deep, and these guys were amazing. They dug deep. They found something and
just said, we're going to refuse to give into this.  
  
We kept talking about rebounding. Now, I really thought if we just changed the
rebounding, things would go our way. Rebounding is an indicator for our team,
it's an indicator, and it was not going the right direction for probably about
25 minutes. It wasn't in the right direction for us for how we need it, and
then it switched.  
  
And I thought we went on a run that changed the game, and I thought we went
from being the team on its heels to the team that was being the aggressor, and
just really proud of how these guys finished the game. They just finished
really, really strong, and to me, that's pretty impressive on these guys's
parts for being their fourth game in four days. That's not easy to do.  
  
Q. To what do you attribute your slow start to? Is it more than
rebounding? Was there anything else? And what did the coach say to you during
halftime to help make the adjustments?  
TRAMAINE ISABELL: I think sometimes in a championship game like this, I think
there's jitters. We messed up on -- well, I messed up on a couple things that
I wouldn't necessarily mess up on. Like underneath, out-of-bounds, I think it
was their first basket, I think they were struggling to score and they got an
easy three in the corner.  
  
When you have give teams momentum like that in a championship game, things can
go either way, and I think that's what happened to them. We started getting on
a run, the tide starts to shift and changes the game where everyone is so
riled up, you never know what can happen; so you kind of want to see even keel
and do what you do, you know, every day, which is not give up easy buckets.  
  
And if you start the game like that, then you're going to play offense, like,
you know, pressing the pedal too much, doing too much. I think like Coach
said, we just did the right things and ended up bringing the game out.  
  
Q. Take me through that final play.  
TRAMAINE ISABELL: Final play, yeah. Only thing that was going through my mind
was Houston.  
  
JORDAN GOODWIN: Yeah.  
  
TRAMAINE ISABELL: We were up at Houston, and Corey Davis hits a huge three,
and we were just all, just running around trying to make sure we didn't allow,
you know that, to happen again.  
  
I think the basketball gods were with us. They got about three open looks.
Yeah, I mean, you don't really want to live like that, but I mean, sometimes
it's basketball. I'm just happy all of them rimmed out.  
  
Q. I asked Jordan this on the court, this has been a season where you
were supposed to win the conference, had some rough go of it and turned it on
at the end. Have you got where you felt like you were supposed to be, despite
the rough ride and how did you get through the rough ride?  
TRAMAINE ISABELL: I do believe we are supposed to be here. I think we are a
very good team. I've been a part of three teams, and we have tremendous
athletes.  
  
We have tremendous competitors from top to bottom, from coaches, you know,
down to the managers. Everyone wants to win, no matter how much we're down.
We're down 15 in a championship game, some guys might quit, you know what I
mean.  
  
I'm just happy to be here. I think we could have given it in. I don't remember
how many games we lost straight in the conference, but you know, guys could
have quit. I mean, some locker rooms might.  
  
But Coach just told us to keep pushing; we could do something special. I don't
think we're done yet. I think we've still got a lot to prove.  
  
Q. For both players, was there a point at all in this game where maybe
having played four games in four days was starting to catch up with you and
that was entering your mind at all?  
JORDAN GOODWIN: I don't think so. I think for me personally, when I was out
there on the court, I mean, the adrenaline running, it's a championship game.
Everything like Coach Ford say, every possession counts, especially today. I
don't think -- nobody was fatigued because the adrenaline just kept you up and
not want to let your teammates down.  
  
So if you was tired, you couldn't be tired. Because that one play, that one
mistake, will cost you the game.  
  
Q. You guys play loosely in the first half, making a lot of mistakes.
Second half, you guys was more calm, had swagger. At what in the game were you
guys, like, we got this, we going to win this game, because all of a sudden
you guarded the perimeter, got them off the baseline, shrink the paint. What
was going through your guys's mind?  
JORDAN GOODWIN: I think when Dion hit that three in the right corner, I was
like, here we go, I was like, here we go. And then I think I got the steal,
got fouled, came back, we let 45 slip, Tramaine passed me, I made one more,
Dion hit it again, another three.  
  
So then right there, I was like, okay, everybody's locked in. I looked in my
teammates eyes and I seen it. I seen Has, he was blocking everything,
challenging all shots and we rebounded. I knew when Dion hit that three in the
corner, we was good.  
  
TRAMAINE ISABELL: For me, I think the possession was I think -- I don't
remember what it was, but we made -- there was like a media timeout or
something, and we made a simple adjustment which we talked about before the
game, which was if not force the ball, move.  
  
J.B. or whoever was guarding Stockard forced it back to the baseline sideline
side, and ever since that little adjustment, it was hard for them to get into
their rhythm and they started shooting shots at the end of the shot clock. And
I felt we were six, seven --  
  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: All it took is 30 minutes to grasp that concept (laughter).
Only had about an hour shoot around or walk-through this morning.  
  
TRAMAINE ISABELL: Yeah, that media time-out and after that, I just felt more
connected with everybody on the court. I mean, look at us. Coach knows what
he's talking about.  
  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Every once in a while.  
  
Q. Can you just elaborate and talk about the experience playing in this
tournament in Brooklyn?  
JORDAN GOODWIN: This experience is, like, I can't even compare it to any other
thing I've been a part of. I think for me, having extra years under my belt
and winning this, this year, is going to make me and my team like way better
next year, because I know, and I learned a lot from Tramaine, still learning.
Just watching him handle all type of ball screens and just being a playmaker.  
  
When we've got guys like Javon Bess that lead with his work ethic and
everything, he just make everything better and easy for us, and we got a lot
of good freshmens this year. We got a good class next year. So this experience
is just going to help this program go up.  
  
Q. You know, of course, we go back to the days when you were playing at
Drexel University and you come here to the Atlantic 10 and you win the Most
Outstanding Player. Take me through, I guess, from the Drexel to now being
here at Saint Louis.  
TRAMAINE ISABELL: I mean, a lot's transpired. The decision to leave Drexel was
hard in itself. The coaches there have done a lot for me. Coach Fortier has
known me since I was a kid. He coached at University of Washington. Coach
Packer (ph), great coach, the entire staff, love them to death.  
  
But Coach Ford told me I would be a part of something special, you know what I
mean, and I believed him. I mean, just sitting here as the A-10 champion, I
wouldn't change anything. I think here, I'm not asked to do as much. Like I
said, I've got a guy sitting next to me that will go 16 points and four
rebounds with six offensive rebounds, that's six -- what are you, three?  
  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: And what's amazing about it is every team is trying to not
let him rebound. That's what's amazing. Their whole game plan is don't let him
rebound. I mean, that's what's amazing about it; that he still does it and
that's what they are trying to stop. It's amazing.  
  
TRAMAINE ISABELL: But I'm happy to be here.  
  
Coach Ford, speaks for itself, the basketball resumé, his, you know -- he's
what you want, as a point guard, who inspires, who wants to be like a
professional basketball player one day.  
  
So just being in practice with him and seeing how much he dedicates himself to
the game, whether it's on the court or, you know, watching film, things like
that, has definitely been a learning experience.  
  
Q. What did you do defensively to slow them down the second half, the
matchup with them?  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Well, in the first half we were changing defenses a lot,
and it wasn't working, and it's been working the last couple Dayton games, it
was working.  
  
As you saw, the 1-3-1 has been -- was dominant last night. They picked it
apart first two possessions and I got out of it.  
  
You know, we tried a couple -- you know, I came into the tournament, and this
is not something we've done, at all, until we got here.  
  
We came into the tournament wanting to change defenses and figuring out which
ones are would being and then go with that the rest of the game for a couple
reasons.  
  
To try to conserve energy, if we're going to win four games, we had to figure
out five to six minutes in the game where can we conserve a little bit of
energy, and then try to keep teams off-balance a little bit.  
  
And tonight, we started out changing defenses and none of them were working,
except for our man-to-man, and so we just stuck with that.  
  
And at halftime, we made a few adjustments, we reiterated, don't give up the
middle and how we're going to guard ball screens. How we wanted to guard them,
I thought would work. We just weren't doing it and we just kind of, in a
forceful way, at halftime, this is the way it needs to be done. If you'll do
it, it will work.  
  
And these guys, they have a competitive nature about them that's fun to watch
and fun to coach. I've said it all year long, we're not the prettiest team.
We're not going to go out there beat you with a best of your memory of shots,
you know, but there's something that clicks about them at some point in the
game -- and made a good point.  
  
At some point in the game, we gain ultra-confidence and it takes off. Now,
we're playing good, but there's something about every game that we have
success in that something happens, and we just take off.  
  
Last night's game, we did it for 40 minutes. I hadn't seen that from us in a
while, for 40 minutes. Tonight, we had a teammate who did not get in the game
last night, who is a senior and won -- they all get along great, but Dion,
everybody loves Dion in our locker room. Just a very mature -- he's like the
father figure probably in the locker room and everybody loves him, and I
thought last night's game was a little bit of a tough matchup the way Davidson
cuts and all that.  
  
Dion is the first guy in breakfast this morning. He walks in first before
everybody else. Didn't play a minute last night. Comes over, small space, pats
me on the back, shakes my hand. "Coach, let's get this one today."  
  
I thought, he's ready. So I went with him early in the second half because of
his experience, and he made a couple big shots, and I think our guys fed off
it, not just because that, but because he made them.  
  
And I think it might have been the eight-minute time-out. We made a run back
-- I do know this. We can cut it to four after being down quite a bit and I
always make an effort to kind of watch the other team during a time-out, how
they go to their huddle.  
  
I sat our guys down and said, "Guys, we've got it. We need to step on it now."
They were hot. One thing I told them early in the game, is this is the best
thing that could happen to us, them jumping out on us. I'm trying to keep our
guys confident and ready to go. "But this is great. I've seen this a hundred
times guys, this fine and let's them get this out of their system. They are
playing unbelievable. They are jacked up. They are excited. They are a good
basketball team, but our time will come. Our time will come if you just hang
in there."  
  
But at the eight-minute mark, I think it was, I told them, all right, now
let's put the pedal to the metal. Let's let loose a little bit and let's get a
little more aggressive on defense. Let's try to get a steal somewhere. And
Jordan made a big steal.  
  
I can go on and on, on why -- first half, they got every 50/50 ball. I was so
upset with our guys about not putting our head in. Second half, guys were
overdoing it. They were literally reaching and scrapping for every single
play, but how we won the game is who we are.  
  
You know, we are just a hard-playing physical aggressive basketball team, and
sometimes I play six and sometimes I might play seven.  
  
Q. I would have loved to have been in that locker room for that halftime
speech. Second half, you were saying earlier, that you guys was guarding the
perimeter, stuck to the hips, you know --  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: You were in that locker room it sound like.  
  
Q. How did your mentality -- because anybody can draw up X's and O's,
but the mentality of your guys emulates on the court, how did you translate it
to them?  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: One adjustment. I thought Stockard was getting loose a
little bit, even from the top of the key off ball screens. So we switched. We
started switching a little bit in the second half. We started switching some
ball screens with certain guys.  
  
I was taking a little bit of chance, because I was like, you three are going
to switch, you who are not going to switch, what we call tracking it, you're
going to track -- we had everybody doing something differently.  
  
But the common denominator was give them zero space. They need to feel -- they
need to smell your breath. When they go on a ball screen, they come off a
stagger, they come along the baseline, if your man is along the baseline, he's
coming out there somewhere. He's not down there hanging out. Any time your man
cuts to the baseline or is coming through, he is coming out somewhere. He
could come back, he could come back the other side, but there needs to be no
space. It's the only way. We've got to gain physicality. We have to gain
aggressiveness somehow, because they had it.  
  
And the defense, we always gain our confidence on defense. It's not going to
happen on offense. We don't even worry about that. We don't even think about
that. We think about defense so much because we know -- and rebounding, that
that dictates everything else that we're going to do.  
  
If we happen to make a few shots, uh-oh, because that even gives us that much
more energy and confidence to play defense. And there was a stretch, that
stretch that I mentioned, I told our guys, "Guys, every shot they are taking
is coming up short. Every single shot they are taking is coming up short.
You've got to put -- you've got to put the pedal down, right now. Right now
you're going to have to make your run, right now."  
  
And I thought if we could get a little decent lead at about the two- or three-
minute mark, with the way we shoot free throws, you never know, but we were
able to finish it out, and it was close there at the end. We gave up shots
there that we obviously are not supposed to be giving up, but worked out for
us.  
  
Q. You mentioned yesterday about how you are a team that didn't get a
whole lot of sleep, you were up to 3:00, 4:00 in the morning; the coaches and
players didn't get to bed until 1:30 or 2:00. I just have to ask this or I
wouldn't be doing my job. How in God's name did you pull this thing off, with
the lack of sleep you've had and the lack of time to prepare, I guess.  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Yeah, I think our team's been through a lot of adversity
this year. You look at injuries, different things. I didn't -- I never did
really buy into that, you know, all that stuff. We only had like three or four
players even returning off last year's team.  
  
Because this all goes to answer your question: We've been through a lot of
adversity that toughens you up a little bit. And when you're picked first and
you don't really go through the league quite the way you wanted to, even
through all that; we let some games go that maybe we thought we shouldn't
have.  
  
So you come to a tournament with something to prove, something to prove. You
know, something to prove. When you're out to prove something and you get a
little taste of it, and when I mean a little taste, you beat Richmond. Then
you beat Dayton. Now you feel like, wait a second, here. Now you want more of
it.  
  
And when you're focused in on the game plan, I only mentioned it after the
game last night very briefly about the NCAA Tournament, about what an
incredible event it is, and then I was done talking. Then we had to focus on
the game. Don't focus on the outcome. Focus on what you need to do to get the
outcome. So I didn't talk about -- beyond that point, I never talked about
what this game meant, other than what do we need to do to beat St.
Bonaventure.  
  
You don't worry about being fatigued when you're laser-focused and you're
focused on doing your job. You don't -- you don't have time to think about
that and I don't think these guys had time to think. I think they had more to
prove than -- and what we didn't want is if we weren't successful, that we
look back and say, oh, we were tired. That wouldn't have been an excuse.  
  
But when you're focused on something, you don't let outside things distract
you. We've had enough things like that that have toughened us up I think a
little bit.  
  
And as I told our guys, our team is made up of a lot of different guys coming
from a lot of different areas. We all came here, you know, and three years
ago, we were picked dead last in this league, dead last, over a program that
was struggling. Picked dead last three years ago.  
  
I told these guys, they put a lot of work in it, they put a lot of time in it,
and my pregame talk tonight was totally about how much we've worked every
single day competing against each other in practice. You competed with each
other in practice for opportunities like this.  
  
I don't think we gave ourselves time to think about it. We prepare so much. We
over-prepare; that I don't give our guys time to think about anything else. We
have a lot of guys from New York, now. We've got a lot going on, and trying to
keep these guys focused, thinking about the game plan and thinking about what
we need to do to win the game and nothing else.  
  
Q. I know coaches really don't like to put any focus on themselves in
this situation, but you're coming into this job three years ago, nobody likes
to get fired. Do you have any sort of satisfaction of coming into a new
program, getting another chance, and bringing it back to the NCAAs?  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Well, I'm excited for our university. I appreciate we've
got our president, Fred Pestello, and our athletic director, Chris May, here.
These guys have been very committed to this basketball program and committed
to helping us be our best. Helping us be our best.  
  
And you know, I said this as soon as we won, I'm so happy for the University
and for the City of Saint Louis. Guys, I've been doing this for 22 years. I've
been a college head coach for 22 years. I'm happy for these kids.  
  
I love staying up till 2:00 last night. I love it. Absolutely love it. I lose
myself into it and I don't -- my wife says I take losing too hard and don't
enjoy winning enough, but I enjoy the process that goes through to building a
program.  
  
Every job, this is my fifth or sixth college job, every single one I've taken
over they are a challenge, every one, they are wanting to do something better.
I enjoy that process.  
  
When I have people that I work with every day in the administration like I
have that makes my job enjoyable, I've said that a lot since I've been at
Saint Louis University, I enjoy working with the people I work with every day.
I enjoy the environment. I've been -- I've coached at Campbellsville
University, and every step of the way, I've been in this league before, and
I'm excited for the university. I'm excited for the city, but more, I'm
excited for these young men who all came.  
  
Like I said, Tramaine Isabell was getting recruited by everybody in America. I
told him, you're going to play on a good team. I'm going to be very, very hard
on you, very hard on you. If you don't want to be coached hard, don't come
here.  
  
And boy, he and I have battled, a lot of times this year. And I told him after
the game, he's made me a better coach, a lot of these guys have. They have
made me a better coach.  
  
Hopefully we've helped them some, as well, but they have all come from
different areas, and I want success for them. A lot of them came because we
believed in what we were doing. We believed -- you bring them to campus -- we
have one of the most beautiful campuses in the country. I think one of the
probably hidden gems in the country. If you've never been to our campus,
beautiful campus. Great facilities. Incredible support. I think we average
7,000, 8,000 people a game, average. Great support.  
  
So all these guys, they like that, but they want to believe that they can win.
They want to believe that they can get better and they want a chance for after
college. And senior night, I said it after the senior night, we had senior
night after the game and I was addressing the crowd in front of seniors. I
said, I promised all these seniors, my job is to prepare them to leave Saint
Louis University, that's my job and along the way, to win a few games.  
  
But my job is to prepare these young men to leave. Better men to be husbands
and fathers. Get them better at basketball and prepare them when this thing is
over with, what are you going to do, and that's our job.  
  
It's fun when you're winning games along the way. This is just like, this is,
you know, a bonus. This is great. But we take that very, very seriously. Very
seriously. And these guys, I'm hard on them, very hard but they respond.
Jordan Goodwin and I kind of got into it last night; that gets us both going.
He knows I love him and I know where he's coming from. He got a technical;
hey, don't get it. He wanted to say his two cents. I let him say it, I don't
care. Get it out of your system and let's move on.  
  
But we have that bond. You can't coach guys like I coach. You can't coach like
I coach if you don't have a relationship with players, you don't have a
relationship with them, you can't do it. These guys know I love them.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 16, 2019

  

### [Mark Schmidt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23402)

### [Kyle Lofton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36826)

### [Osun Osunniyi](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36853)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
St. Bonaventure 68, Rhode Island 51  
  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: We got off, and give Rhode Island credit. They came after
us. For the first ten minutes, we didn't play very well, and they had a lot to
do with it.  
  
We were, you know, a little bit nervous. You know, down, I think 22-12, maybe
22-10, but give our guys credit. They persevered. They fought through it, just
like it's a microcosm of our year, as I said yesterday. We started 4-10, 0-1
in the league and things weren't going well and we had a lot of adversity with
injuries and so forth.  
  
The kids never felt bad. They never got down. They kept on working and that's
what we did today. You know, you're down 24-12 or whatever it was, and things
aren't going well, and we've got a young team. It's easy for them just to lay
down and say it's not our day. We found a way. The last five minutes of the
first half were critical.  
  
We got some momentum, went into the locker room, talked about it. We needed to
come out and make that first run and our guys answered. They played, and
that's a heck of a team. I think 5-0 in the last five games, and big, strong
guys, and our guys met the challenge and really proud of the effort. Now we
move on and hopefully we can play well tomorrow.  
  
Q. Playing alongside a guy you know more than just at St. Bonaventure,
turns in a big time double-double, what's it like being teammates with this
guy and being the fact that you two go back to the Putnam Science days?  
KYLE LOFTON: It's great. I've got a lot of trust in him. I know how hard he
works, and like you say, going back to the Putnam days, we have like a good
connection. I know, like he's going to do rebounds, take charges, do all the
dirty stuff for us. He's just a hard worker.  
  
Q. At one point you were down 15 points to Rhode Island with four
minutes left, and you had only 14 points as a team. What were you thinking as
the point guard to get the offense going and stay calm?  
KYLE LOFTON: I just told my teammates, we have to worry about defense. Shots
are eventually going to fun. Basketball is a game of runs, and eventually our
run will come. And the crowd gave us good momentum towards the end and that's
what happened.  
  
Q. Towards the end when you guys looked like you had it in hand, it just
seemed like you were really enjoying yourselves out there and you had that
thing after the game where you ran off the floor at the same time. How much
fun are you having making this run? Still another game, but as of now, how
much fun are you guys having?  
OSUN OSUNNIYI: We're having fun, but at the same -- like you said we know
we're not done yet and we have one more game to win, hopefully get a chance.
We play well tomorrow, we can go to the NCAA Tournament. We're going to enjoy
this one, but now we have to focus on who we're going to play tomorrow and
comeback and keep the same energy.  
  
Q. We talked yesterday about the battle with Langevine. You didn't seem
overmatched or overwhelmed at all. How good was that for you to be able to
have confidence going up against one of the best big men in the league?  
OSUN OSUNNIYI: I had a slow start in the first heart. I wasn't really hitting
my shots, rebounding and blocking shots. Coach just told me, just keep
confidence in myself and keep going, so I just trust in myself. My teammates
trust in me.  
  
Q. I think it certainly starts with making shots, the way you guys did
down the stretch in the first half, but from that last four-minute mark of the
first half through the end of the game, what just changed for you guys that
you were able to turn a double-digit deficit into a double-digit lead.  
KYLE LOFTON: Our coach, he always preaches, taking the first hit. I feel like
we took the first hit, instead of giving it and then towards the end, like we
got more comfortable. People gained confidence and we just played tougher.  
  
Q. I think Courtney and LaDarien were 0-for-10 to start out. They were
struggling early. I mean, we talked yesterday about how you guys aren't here
without the freshmen. What do you say to the seniors when they are having a
tough game? How do you help drag them along and get them back into it?  
OSUN OSUNNIYI: We know that they have been here before. They have been to the
NCAA Tournament so we just tell them to keep heir heads up and don't get do
you know on themselves. Because you know, when we don't know what to do, we
lean on them to lead us. So we just tell them to keep their heads up, shots
are going to fall and things are going to happen.  
  
KYLE LOFTON: You want me to answer?  
  
Q. Yeah, please. What do you say, when he's struggling like he has
been?  
KYLE LOFTON: It was actually the last time-out, media time-out before the
first half. I told him, "This is not going to be the last game of the season,"
and from there, they just picked it up and got more aggressive. Like they
understood what I meant.  
  
Q. Kyle, we talked yesterday about the matchup going into Fatts, Russell
and Jeff Dowtin. How did you manage to shut those two down?  
KYLE LOFTON: Those two are good players, but with any good players, you've got
to take easy shots away and just make them take difficult shots, and I think
we did that.  
  
Q. Congratulations again. How did that happen? Dumb question, but what
do you attribute that kind of a turnaround?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: You know, as I said it was a microcosm of our whole year.
We've been down. We've struggled. You know, things weren't looking good, but
the kids, they believe.  
  
We have, you know, Courtney and LaDarien were terrible especially in the first
half. Osun wasn't much better.  
  
But they just -- they rebounded. And I say it all the time, it's a great
lesson. You're going to hit adversity in life, and things are not going to go
your way all the time and you've got to figure out a way to get it done and
that's what we've done. We couldn't have played better in the second half. We
always emphasize: Defend, rebound take your other basketball and make your
foul shots.  
  
You look at the second half, and we couldn't have played better. We missed one
foul shot the whole game, and going into the game, you know, Dowtin and
Russell are really good players, and we needed -- they were the knowns, we
needed to do a good job on them. They shoot, you know, 8-for-27.  
  
You know, in Game 1, they annihilated us, you know, defensively. It was almost
like the first ten, 12 minutes of this game was what happened in Game 1.  
  
But we've grown. The freshmen don't play like freshmen. Kyle in my opinion was
the best guy on the court. You know, the veteran guys, we win, we beat Rhode
Island, a heck of a team by 17 and our best player goes 1-for-11. It says a
lot about the other guys on our team.  
  
Osun didn't play well in the first half. Comes up with a double-double and did
a really good job on Langevine who has probably 40 pounds on him. We just
fought, and I'm proud of our effort, and hopefully we can play well tomorrow.  
  
Q. It's another team that you guys held below 60 points. Just given the
way that you've defended, especially down the stretch, today, on the biggest
stage of the season, where does this team just sit defensively in the grand
scheme of things of what you've seen as a coach?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: It's the best defensive team that we've had since I've
been the coach. They sit down; they guard; they do a good job on the ball.
Osun does a really good job of being a rim protector, but we're connected.
We're committed at the other end, and for the most part, we're disciplined.  
  
And when you do that and you have a should beer back there, Kyle is a really
good defender and can really move his feet and Courtney has got great length
and LaDarien can switch ball screens, and when you have a 4-man that can
switch those ball screens, it makes it harder for the offense get the ball
below the paint.  
  
And that's what Rhode Island tries to do, they try to get the ball below the
paint and attack the basket. And when you can move your feet and keep guys in
front, we took charges -- to be able to out-rebound Rhode Island by six is a
testament to our guys.  
  
Like I said it's a mindset. We are not a great offensive team and we have not
been a great offensive team all said, but the staple -- and the kids have
figured it out, in order for us to win, we have to defend and they have taken
that and they have run with it.  
  
Q. You just partially answered my question a little bit, but Rhode
Island was really getting downhill on the first half, patrol, in addition to
that. What changed for you guys in terms of being able to go up in the second
half?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: We played ball screens a little bit different, a little
bit harder. We stayed a little bit longer.  
  
I thought in the first half, we call it shocking the ball screen, trying to
knock the ball back but we would release it a little bit too early and they
would hesitate and then go, you know; and the adjustment at halftime was to
try to stay another second, so our guy that's guarding it can come back and
square the ball up, and that's what we try to do.  
  
Believe me, it wasn't perfect, but that was the plan in the second half.  
  
Q. Similar to the regular season finale against Saint Louis, you guys
got out-rebounded in the first half but were able to come back and out-rebound
the second half. What do you attribute that tale of two halves rebounding
to?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: I thought we got comfortable. The last four or five
minutes of the first half were critical. Gave us a lot of confidence. If we
went into that halftime down double-digits it would be a different ballgame,
but I thought we got a lot of confidence.  
  
Like I said, our guys, they didn't give up. They persevered. They understood
that we didn't play well for the first 15 minutes of that half, but we were
still in the game, down by two.  
  
You know, if we can play that poorly in the first half and still be in range,
it gives us -- gave those guys confidence and we came out and played -- like I
said we could have played better in all facets.  
  
To be able to shoot 54 percent against Rhode Island, that's pretty good.
That's hard to do. You know, to defend 35 percent, or 28 percent, 22 percent
from threes, that's how you win games, especially in tournament time.  
  
Q. Considering the young talent on both teams, how much might this be a
start, a first chapter of some high-stakes games between these two programs?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: We had good games last year. We had a great game at the
Rally Center (ph) at the end of the year.  
  
Rhode Island, they do a great job, great players, well-coached, and we feel
like we have really good players and yeah, it's two teams just going at it
competitively. You know, hopefully -- everybody's a rival, in this league,
everybody's a rival. You have to play well in order to win a game in the
Atlantic 10.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Luka Brajkovic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36854)

### [Jon Axel Gudmundsson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36830)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Saint Louis 67, Davidson 44  
  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: Congratulations to South Carolina. They played an
outstanding game. They did everything they had to do offensively and
defensively. They were outstanding in the way they broke our rhythm
offensively with their changing defenses, and that's a credit to Travis Ford
and his staff.  
  
Q. For either one of you, another rough start offensively, shooting like
yesterday, was there any feeling like, hey, it's going to turn around and the
shots are going to start falling?  
JON AXEL GUDMUNDSSON: I think we were getting open shots in the beginning but
I think if we had played defense the whole game like we did in the first half,
we would have been fine. But we were just making our offense -- in fairness
with our defense, and it -- they allowed us -- they didn't make us play
defense well enough.  
  
Q. For either one of you, Kellan again struggled offensively. When his
shots aren't falling, how does that change things, if anything, for you
guys?  
JON AXEL GUDMUNDSSON: I mean, he was just getting open shots. He was just
unlucky today. Kellan is one of our best players and I mean, when one of us
has an off-day, it's just someone else got to step up, but it didn't happen
today. Everyone were making mistake on offense, but like I said, us, I think
it was the defense we didn't participate well enough today.  
  
Q. I know it's tough after a loss, but you guys have had a good season.
What's next for you guys, and do you feel like NIT, certainly, is in the
offering for you guys?  
LUKA BRAJKOVIC: So we're going to analyze the game, see our mistakes and from
there on, we're going to see what we're going to do.  
  
Q. It seems like when they changed to the 1-3-1, it went downhill from
there for you. Just threw you out of your rhythm or you just couldn't adjust
to it? Because you were going so well, and then boom, they switched and you
never could get the flow back.  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: Yeah, we were 27-20 I think and had gotten in transition
and had gotten some stops, and they did switch to the 1-3-1, and I thought we
got a couple of good looks, but they didn't go down. And when they didn't go
down, the 1-3-1 becomes even more lethal because it's a mental aspect, as well
as the technical, physical aspect.  
  
But we allowed that mental, technical aspect to impact our defense. I thought
our defense in the first 16 minutes was superb, was out standing, our work on
the glass and our, would defensively was superb.  
  
And then when we started missing the shots, we carried it down into the
defensive end, and you know, you look at our numbers, even in the first 16
minutes, we got some superb shots and they made a block here and a block
there, but we did get some really good shots.  
  
And as their defense started to play chaos with our mind, much like Pete
Carroll's offense plays chaos with the mind of an opponent, and they come down
and they shoot quick shots and now Pete holes it, it's sort of that in
reverse, because that 1-3-1 -- and you don't see it very much, and as you
prepare for a tournament, you knew -- we knew it was going to -- possibility
for it coming.  
  
But we had not seen it all year, other than against them back in January, and
when we're preparing this week, you know, you're preparing first of all for
either Saint Joe's or Duquesne, and then you're preparing either for South
Carolina or Dayton.  
  
So you're trying to prepare for four teams, but you don't get the number of
repetitions against a 1-3-1 as you normally would get if it was a 2-3.  
  
Q. About a minute when you took out the players, you called them over to
the players and you said something to them. Do you want to share that?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: Yeah, I told them they have had a magnificent season. A
lot of the teams in the country would be very proud to have 24 victories, to
finish second in the Atlantic 10, so I told them how proud I was of what they
accomplished this season.  
  
Q. You guys lost on A-10 Player of the Year last season and you've got
one of the youngest teams in the country this year. I wonder what your
realistic expectations were and just how you thought these guys did, and
you're obviously sitting up with a freshman and a sophomore in the A-10
semifinals, I just want to know.  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: KiShawn Pritchett has not practiced three weeks, four
weeks. We tried to save him for a game and put him in for two and a half
minutes, and have to take him out and put him in for two and a half minutes.
He's an incredibly talented player that is half of what he was, and he's had
to develop an old man's game because of what his body has done to him.  
  
We missed Kellan Grady when we lost to Temple, we lost to Wake Forest, we lost
to Carolina, without Kellan Grady, and Kellan never really regained the
fluidity that he had prior to his torn meniscus. You know, it led to I think
an inconsistency in his confidence more than anything, and when you're dealing
with two players like that, then you only have a short bench, you could see
the impact it has, and of course, we had 12 scholarship players.  
  
Nathan Ekwu, who started for us as a freshman, played three minutes, four
minutes the whole year. Mike Brown, another freshman, played three minutes,
four minutes the whole year. Mike Brown, another freshman, tore his ACL in an
exhibition game.  
  
So my expectations were that we were going to have to really nurse our way
through this season, and I'm always the optimist. I thought we could have a
20-plus win season, and we did, and that's a credit to them. They were -- our
guys and our assistant coaches were outstanding.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on what's next for you guys for postseason?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: Well, we're hopeful that an NIT bid comes our way. You
finish second in a great conference like the Atlantic 10, you win 24 games;
three of the games that you lost were without arguably your best player, so I
should think we should have an opportunity to compete in the NIT.  
  
Q. I don't think there's been a repeat tournament champ here since 2010.
How hard is it to repeat in this tournament, in the A-10, do you think?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: This is an incredibly challenging conference. And what's
interesting about this conference, check the number of freshmen, sophomores
and juniors that are playing. Yes, you alluded to the fact that we have a
young roster. There are a lot of teams with a young roster.  
  
Look at St. Bonaventure is going to be in the Final tomorrow with one, two,
three freshmen I think starting, and two seniors.  
  
So the future of this conference is very, very bright, and I think it needs to
have some national attention for how many good freshmen and sophomores there
are in this conference.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

### [Javon Bess](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36840)

### [D.J. Foreman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36855)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Saint Louis 67, Davidson 44  
  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Well, we got off to a really good start, very good start
and I thought our energy was right. And you know, when you get -- and you get
a start like that, you know the other team as good as Davidson is, you know
they are going to make a run back at you.  
  
They are a really, really good basketball team. The second half we come out
and really were just locked in. Really locked in. Just made a lot of defensive
plays that led to good offense.  
  
I thought it was -- we're usually not the, you know, complementing ourselves a
lot of times on offense tonight and tonight, our offense was helping our
defense a lot.  
  
But you know, I just thought we competed at a very high level, very high
level. The guys stayed locked in. I don't think they ever, you know, looked at
the scoreboard and ever rested, and that's out of respect for Davidson and how
powerful they are.  
  
We knew we couldn't relax at any point in time, but just a really good second
half. Really about second half. Especially defensively.  
  
Q. 24 points, talk about it just seemed like you got out to a little bit
of a rookie start and then just started hitting shots. Do you feel like you
were in rhythm?  
JAVON BESS: Yeah, I definitely feel I was in rhythm but Tramaine and Jordan,
they was making us go. They had the ball a lot and they was finding me.  
  
Q. Are you guys feeling now like that 1-3-1 or the 13 defense, whatever
you want to call it, is really a key to what you're doing in terms of just
totally disrupting opposing offenses?  
D.J. FOREMAN: It's just one of our many defensive sets, and we just change
concepts to just keep the other team like on edge and just keeping them
confused for the most part. You know, going from man to five-hedge to 13 to
two, just mixing it up. So it's not just like our strength -- like 13 is not
our strength; we have different sets.  
  
Q. You have put together a couple of really huge games on the boards
lately, especially with the offensive rebounding. Can you just talk about
what's been going into it, with sort of the rustle and everything?  
D.J. FOREMAN: Yes, playing with players such as Javon Bess, Jordan Goodwin,
Tramaine Isabelle, Hasahn French, those are guy our guys on offense.  
  
So my role is play defense, stop their best post player and then do anything
that's physical. We are a very physical team. So the more physical I can be it
makes it easier for players like Tramaine, Javon and Jordan to play their
game. I just go out there and try to play my hardest so I can make it easier
for offensive threats.  
  
Q. What does it mean, actually, to have someone like Tramaine and
Hasahn? I'm on the third row and I can even see far away the intensity and
presence of someone like Tramaine and someone like Hasahn. What did that mean
to you?  
JAVON BESS: They mean a lot. They mean a lot to our team just like everybody
does on our team. We say that since the beginning. We need everybody out here
to go out and try to win a championship, we need all 15 guys, and those are
two important pieces that we need.  
  
Q. How are you guys feeling now with three games in a row, all the
minutes. Are you just running on adrenaline or are you that well-conditioned
at this point?  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Very well-conditioned (laughter).  
  
JAVON BESS: Definitely.  
  
D.J. FOREMAN: Yeah.  
  
Q. Can you comment?  
JAVON BESS: Very well-conditioned. (Laughter).  
  
Q. How the legs are?  
JAVON BESS: We feel good. We feel good. Like I said, we're here playing for
something. We're playing for a championship. All that other stuff goes out the
window. It's them against us.  
  
D.J. FOREMAN: Yeah, one game at a time.  
  
Q. Congratulations.  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Thank you.  
  
Q. On what has been a week with almost no rest playing these nightcap
games at about 8:30, if I'm correct, the two games, and now this one at
3:00.  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Probably about 8:45, 8:50 when we started.  
  
Q. How focused are you now being one win away from going to the NCAA
Tournament?  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Well, you have to change gears. You put so much into every
single game. Like you said we've been getting back to the hotel the past two
nights, 11:45-ish, getting to the hotel and then the guys got to eat.  
  
And it's been -- and we don't even really talk about basketball until the next
day, except for the coaches stay up till 3:00, 4:00 in the morning the last
two nights, trying to figure out a game plan to present to the guys the next
morning.  
  
So right now, we've put a lot of time into Davidson, a lot of time in a very
short amount of time. That was a concern for me going from our guys getting in
bed at probably 1:00, 1:30, and turning around and playing a 3:30 game.  
  
But I thought our guys handled it really well. They were focused this morning
at our walk-through and really focused and attentive to the game plan.  
  
So now you've just got to switch gears. You know, you do have to exhale for a
second. You've got to exhale for a second and gather yourself, and you know,
prepare for a really, really good St. Bonaventure team that's playing very
good basketball, very well-coached, and you know, we'll get back to the hotel
and get started.  
  
Q. You said after a couple games this season, you would comment on the
defense being, you know, maybe best effort of the year. Where does that one
rank, especially the second half?  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Second half, I don't know if it gets -- you know, just look
at the percentages, was as good as it gets.  
  
It really helped us scoring to be able to get into certain defenses for us.
But yeah, the defensive effort, and then rebounding. It's one thing to play
defense, then you've got to rebound the ball.  
  
If you get a team missing a bunch of shots, you know, and I kept telling our
guys: You're getting them to miss; now let's reward ourselves. Let's reward
yourself for doing something good by rebounding the ball.  
  
And I wasn't happy at halftime with our rebounding. They had more offensive
rebounds than we did, and that's usually not the case, and that's not how we
play.  
  
And I thought we did a great job second half of defending and rebounding,
defending and rebounding, holding them to one shot, making them take tough
shots. And then we got them to take 20 -- 20 seconds off the shot clock off
almost every possession, which is a big key.  
  
Q. Continuing off the defense, Gudmundsson and Grady, you hold them to 7
and 27. What were you doing particularly to those two to take them out of
their rhythm a little bit?  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Well, I challenged our guys this morning, in our scouting
report, in our game -- walk-through game plan. I gave Davidson -- I was
pumping Davidson up as they deserve to be, and really giving them respect, and
I said you've got to give respect where respect is due. They are a very, very
good offensive team, very, very good. Very, very good defensive team, look at
their numbers. They have very good offensive weapons.  
  
I told our guys, if we could just hold Grady and Gudmundsson below their
average, they are averaging 17; if they are just one point below their
average, I think that would be good enough, just one point. I'm not asking you
to hold them to seven or six, I'm not asking that. I'm asking just hold them
below their average, and then do the job on everybody else and I think that
will give us a good chance for success.  
  
I think we accomplished that. And that's out of respect for those two. I mean,
they don't get much better in our league. They are two as good of players as
there is.  
  
Q. Tomorrow, facing Welch and Lofton, Lofton is one of the top freshmen
in this league. What's the game plan going into, and also, I was going to say
with 00 himself, what's going to be the game plan, a guy that had 11 rebounds
today.  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: They have a lot of good players, really well-coached. They
had some really good senior leaders. I think Stockard and Griffin are really
good senior leaders for them, and they have really got good talent. Fresh has
had a heck of a year. Lofton has had a heck of a year, Welch, I can go down
the line. Center is really good and they have guys coming off the bench, very
well-coached.  
  
So you're looking at, you know, St. Bonaventure, Stockard played in the NCAA
Tournament last year. Griffin played in the NCAA Tournament last year, a few
other players, so they have had a little bit of experience and know what this
is about.  
  
So we've got a lot of respect for St. Bonaventure and how they are playing.  
  
Q. Now that you're three for three with one to go, do you allow yourself
-- do you start thinking about what you're playing for, or is it a focus on
just a regular game preparation?  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Yeah, I don't think we need to talk a lot about that. I
think they know. You've just got to prepare and get focused in. You've got to
be laser focused, laser focused for the next game. Get some rest, but get
laser focused for the next game and the opponent, and prepare.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 16, 2019

  

### [David Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36756)

### [Tyrese Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36852)

### [Cyril Langevine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35055)

### [Jeff Dowtin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33200)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
St. Bonaventure 68, Rhode Island 51.  
  
COACH DAVID COX: I guess I'd like to start by giving all credit to the Bonny's
staff, Schmidty in particular, and those players. Thought they played a heck
of a game today. They earned that victory and I wish them well moving forward.  
  
It's always tough. This is the end, you know, this is the end, not only of a
great run but it's the end of a year, and I think the overall theme that I
shared with these guys and I'll share with you is that in over 20 years of
coaching, I've never been prouder of a group of young men, for all the
adversity they fought through, for their resiliency and for staying together.  
  
I thought that they went out this weekend and they represented themselves very
well. They represented the University of Rhode Island and they represented the
basketball program with great -- with great pride.  
  
I'd also like to thank all of the fans, again, who came out and supported us
today and have been here throughout the entire season, as well as our
administration. Specifically, our athletic director, Thor, who is here now and
who has been with me every day, every step of the way, through all of the ups
and the downs.  
  
There's not much more to say than that, other than the fact that these three
gentlemen up here in particular left it out there on the line today, as they
have all season, and I guess the next step is regrouping, getting our bodies
together and then getting back to work because we fell short of our ultimate
goal this year of winning another conference championship and making it to the
NCAA Tournament.  
  
But the life lesson will stick with us and that is in times of adversity, you
know, you have two choices: You can either quit or you can continue to fight,
and this group continued to fight, and that's why I'm so proud of them.  
  
Q. Jeff, you said yesterday that you felt that you were being a little
bit disrespected by the other teams, maybe overlooking you. Do you think
you've earned the respect back from the other teams in the conference after
the run you guys have made the past three days?  
JEFF DOWTIN: I would hope so. I felt like we're one of the top teams in this
league. I've got a great group of guys that come out and fight hard. They
never fold. Always step up when we need it. Always fight through challenges,
fight through adversities, and I guess one of our main goals was just prove
that we can handle with the big dogs in this league and we can put our mind
to, whatever we want to accomplish, we can accomplish.  
  
So I hope we gained those teams' respect.  
  
Q. Tyrese, aside from the result, obviously, which wasn't what you guys
wanted today, how much do you and the other younger guys gain out of the three
days here in Brooklyn, winning two games and playing in a semifinal here in
this tournament?  
TYRESE MARTIN: Biggest thing we gain is probably experience now. I mean,
coming into this, we didn't know what it took as freshmen, so all we could do
is look up to the older guys to lead us here and try to follow, like, if we
didn't know what to expect.  
  
But now I feel like we've got experience and we know what it takes, and now we
just got to do more so it doesn't happen again.  
  
Q. What does this run you guys have been on mean for you going forward,
in terms of building off it and having some motivation, too?  
JEFF DOWTIN: For me just all about getting experience, like Tyrese said, sure,
we've been in situations like this before. We have been to the A-10
Championship and we've been to March Madness. Now it's just focusing on
getting those guys, the freshmen ready, and giving them a taste of what's
bound to happen next.  
  
Q. During that five-game losing stretch, what did you do learn about
yourselves as leaders, because of course, last couple years, you were able to
lean on some of the upperclassmen. Now you're in the spot of being
upperclassmen. What did you learn about yourselves in terms of leadership?  
CYRIL LANGEVINE: It made us become even more leaders because we didn't know
what it took to be leader because obviously we were behind E.C. and Jarred and
them, and it was our turn to step up during that five-game losing streak and
that's what we did.  
  
Q. Jeff, after yesterday's win, obviously an emotional one, maybe the
most emotional of your season, were you particularly mentally exhausted for
today's game? How much did yesterday take out of you for today?  
JEFF DOWTIN: I don't want to make excuses. I guess you can say I was mentally
exhausted here and there but every time I step on the court I have to give it
my all and everything I've got. I've got to lead the team.  
  
I'm not going to say I was exhausted. I've just got to push through and find
different ways to help my team win.  
  
Q. Also for Jeff and Cyril. Just your thoughts on the job that Coach Cox
did this year, obviously an adjustment for a first-year head coach, but just
kind of the last couple games, last six games, seven games, what did you guys
take away from his first year?  
CYRIL LANGEVINE: I just want to say, the guy to my left, Coach Cox, he's like
a father to me. He let's me know when I'm right and when I'm wrong, and I
accept it, and if it's his first year, I think he did a great job. He always
keep everybody on their toes.  
  
I just thought that he fought with us and he kept trust in us, and we got to
this point. You know, obviously we didn't get to where we wanted to get, but I
think he did a great job.  
  
JEFF DOWTIN: For me, one of the main reasons why I decided to stay at the
University of Rhode Island was for Coach Cox. I knew the type of vision he
had, the type of plan he had. I knew he wasn't going to sugarcoat anything. He
was going to give it to me straight up, tell me what I needed to hear.  
  
He's always pushed me. Me and him have gone through multiple battles this
year, just been fighting at each other. But I know -- I just know he wants the
best for me, and he's always looking out for me and I respect him a lot.  
  
Like Cyril said, he's like that father figure for us and without him we
wouldn't be here to this day.  
  
Q. You feel like the guys kind of ran out of gas there, especially
offensively in the second half? Looked like a lot of guys were flagging at the
end?  
COACH DAVID COX: Yeah, not to make any excuses as Jeff mentioned, but yeah,
they were tired today. To be honest with you, so was I. I was fatigued today.
It finally hit me. I don't think I had the juice. I obviously didn't have the
juice that I had yesterday and.  
  
I think those guys needed it, so there's a part of me that is, again, very
proud of these guys and their run, but there's another part of me that says,
man, if I had a little bit more left in the tank myself, maybe I could have
got these guys over the hump.  
  
Yeah, we were all -- we were all fatigued.  
  
Q. You mentioned that this is basically the end of the season. Does that
mean you won't accept a postseason bid, whether it be NIT, CIT, CBI?  
COACH DAVID COX: We would more than likely -- we would definitely accept an
NIT bid. As far as the others, that would be a conversations that I'd probably
have with my athletic department.  
  
Q. During that five-game losing stretch, what did you learn about
yourself as a coach? You just talked about the adversity that the guys
overcame. How proud were you to see them bounce back and what did you learn
about yourself in terms of pushing players and being able to fight through
that kind of adversity?  
COACH DAVID COX: There were a lot of lessons this year, not just in the five-
game losing streak, but probably took everybody, team, staff, to a dark place
and what you learn, you learn is if you have enough resolve; if you're cut out
for this particular business and I think I learned that I do have the resolve
and I'm cut out for this particular business.  
  
Again, I've experienced life in general, you know, that's prepared me for
these moments. Winning and losing obviously is very important. That's why I'm
hired, to win games, but ultimately, you know, again, I'm an educator, as
well, and a father.  
  
So the growth that those guys showed, you know, over the past month and a
half, will stick with me forever. So I'm very proud of them, and I think that,
you no he, there were probably some times where we all questioned whether or
not we were cut out and made for this because it was so hard. We had not been
used to losing, but we fought through it.  
  
We stayed together and like I said, I've never been prouder of a group of
guys.  
  
Q. I'm sure it's hard to think about the future now, but what does this
run maybe mean in terms of a springboard for next year?  
COACH DAVID COX: Well, I mean, I think it sets it up pretty well. I mean, it
should be a confident group of young men. Now they know what it takes to win,
to compete at a very, very high level.  
  
So that bodes well for the future. But with that being said, you know, the
team we just played, they have some young guys, too. They will be back. VCU
will be back. Dayton will be back. The league will be very, very strong next
year.  
  
So we've got to get to work. We've got to get to work right away, and we've
got to get better. I've got to get better as a coach. These guys have got to
get better individually, and I do -- I do look forward to -- without looking
too far into the future, I do look forward to season two.  
  
Q. Hearing the answer that Jeff and Cyril gave to their last question
about playing for you, what does that mean to you, and what's your reaction to
that?  
COACH DAVID COX: Oh, man. That's a hard one to answer. It means the world to
me, you know. It means the world to me. You know, as a coach, whenever you
have -- whenever you can -- whenever you can have kids trust in you enough,
particularly through tough times, to stick with you, to follow your direction,
particularly since I haven't proven myself as a head coach, you know.  
  
And then we get to this point where we make that sort of run and we play on
this grand stage, and then they -- you know, when asked, they give you the
credit, it means -- it means the world to me. Those are like -- I've got two
kids of my own, but I also have 15 additional sons, and so that makes me -- it
makes me feel good.  
  
It makes me proud, and also makes me determined; determined to come back next
year even better and even stronger.  
  
Q. In terms of your players and their health going into the off-season,
do you have any guys who are going to need to address some things, maybe over
the next couple months, before the next season, and if so, what are they?  
COACH DAVID COX: Not surgery-wise. At least I don't anticipate that at all.
They all just need rest. I've played those guys so many minutes. Think about
Cyril, Fatts and Jeff, in particular, the minutes that they logged for this
season, the beating that they took, and then, you know, some of the freshmen,
even Tyrese, I think they just need rest and they will be reevaluated.  
  
But as far as anything, you know, as far as surgery or anything really
serious, no, I don't anticipate any of that at this point.

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Mark Schmidt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23402)

### [Dominick Welch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36825)

### [Kyle Lofton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36826)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
St. Bonaventure 68, George Mason 57  
  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Going into the game, our goal is to try to get to the NCAA
Tournament and the only way we're going to do that is if we can win this
thing. We've got to take it one game at a time. I thought these two guys,
these from freshmen up here played extremely well.  
  
Dom hit some huge shots. Kyle had hurt his ankle, had not practiced in three
days and came out and played extremely well. You know, when we defend, we're a
really good basketball team. I think we're 15-0 when we hold teams under 60
points, and our guys, you know, we knew going into the game, George Mason, two
really good guards, and we have to have at least one of them have an off-
night, and I thought Kier played extremely well. I thought we did a really
good job in Livingston, and that's the key. We kept them off the foul line. It
was a good victory.  
  
Now it's on to Rhode Island, on to a team that's playing exceptionally well.  
  
Q. You guys were in control throughout the entire game and didn't lead
by any less than seven in the second half. Seemed any punch they gave you, you
responded back. What do you credit that resiliency of not relinquishing the
lead at all?  
DOMINICK WELCH: I just -- I just felt comfortable out there. I didn't really
get splitted (ph) up at any time in the game. I know how me and my team plays,
so we just know like how we play and stuff. So we just -- I just felt
comfortable out there. That's pretty much it. We felt comfortable out there.
That's pretty much it.  
  
Q. You know that we go back to the PSA days back at Putnam Science. What
is it like coming back to Brooklyn and New York and play in front of your
family and friends and play against a tough team like George Mason.  
KYLE LOFTON: It's great. It's a great experience. Knowing I'm from New Jersey,
growing up, I always watched the Barclays Center. It was like a childhood
dream to play in, it, and I played in it. We got a victory and I got a lot of
support from my family. Like you said, a lot of PSA people came, which is
good.  
  
Q. Kyle, can you talk a little about your freshman season so far and
playing in your first tournament?  
KYLE LOFTON: My freshman season so far, I think I've been doing good, but all
the credit to my teammates and the coaches. I've just been listening,
following the older guys and just taking it day by day getting better each and
every day.  
  
Q. As far as freshmen go, you and Osun have gotten a lot of the
headlines this season but how nice was it to see Dom have the game that he did
today.  
KYLE LOFTON: It was very nice. I knew he's capable of doing it because in prep
school, I played against him a couple of times because I just know what type
of player he is because it's good that he wrung it out.  
  
Q. You guys missed your first six shots today and seemed like you
couldn't miss at all. Why did you -- why were you able to turn things around
and why were you feeling so good today, particularly from long range?  
DOMINICK WELCH: I just think we have to get used to the hoops in the arena.
It's our first time playing here. We only got about like 20 minutes to get
some shots up, so I think we just had to get a feel of the rim and everything.
And I've been feeling good for a while, now shooting the ball, so I just knew
after that first one went in, I just felt good every time I shot the ball.  
  
Q. For Kyle or Dom, even when you guys have slumps like you had at the
start of the game, your defense has always kept you in it. How important to
you guys is it to not let your offensive slump affect the defense?  
KYLE LOFTON: Like you said, coming into the game, we're a pretty physical
team, and the goal was -- one of the keys was take care of the ball and make
them score on the halfcourt. Like I said, even though our offense was missing
shots, we started two for eight or something, we could always align our
defense.  
  
Q. You always talk about playing for good coaches. I remember watching
you play for Tom when you were at Putnam. What does a guy like Mark Schmidt
instill in you? And Dominick, feel free to chime in, as well. What do you
learn from a guy like Coach Schmidt?  
DOMINICK WELCH: He just pushes us every day. Makes sure we don't play like
freshmans because we know they lost last year. So just make sure we play like
juniors and seniors. He just want the best out of us every day so he with just
wants to play hard.  
  
KYLE LOFTON: As you all know, he's passionate about the game, and then every
day he just preaches hard work, dedication and just you follow those and
you'll become successful.  
  
Q. You've hit 23 threes against George Mason in the last three games. Do
you think those were more isolated games or was there something about the
George Mason defense that you've been age to exploit?  
KYLE LOFTON: I'm not sure. We just got good shots. I think that's one of the
reasons because the way they play ball screens is different. So we just got
like open looks and just better looks instead of contested shots.  
  
Q. Great to see you as always, congratulations on tonight victory. I
know that George Mason is a very tough team, as you mentioned, with guards
like Justin Kier and Otis Livingston. What was the game plan going into
today?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: They have good guards. They are really well-coached. You
know, we have a saying, no paint, no foul. In the league, I think they make 70
more foul shots than their opponent.  
  
So the key was to try to keep them off the line and try to keep them above the
foul line, above Kier and Livingston are just so good off the bounce. We
thought maybe we could survive if just one of them played well. So the key was
the knowns (ph). We knew we had to do a good job on the knowns.  
  
I thought Kier, whatever he got, 20 points, but I thought we did a good job on
Livingston, and you know, we have to take care of the basketball. We have to
defend in the halfcourt, try to keep them out of transition. We took care of
the ball, 17 assists, seven turnovers, so they didn't get any points off of
our turnovers and I think if we keep them in the halfcourt, we're a good
defensive team. We held them to what, 38 percent, 25 percent from threes and
those are great numbers, and when we win, those are the numbers that need to
be. You know, we were really successful in the half short. I thought Osun does
a really good job of making our defense that much more difficult with him back
there blocking shots. LaDarien did a really good job, he had a double-double.  
  
Going into the game, they are well-coached. They play all that ball screen
stuff. We try to keep the ball out of the paint and try to make them take
contested shots and do a decent job on the backboard. In Game 1 down there,
they beat us by 20 on the backboard and beat us by nine today, but we can
survive that. We can't survive if we get out rebounded by 20.  
  
Q. Dom scored the most points by a freshman since at least 2010. How
unique is it to have freshmen go out there, him, Kyle and Osun with so little
fear.  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, Kyle, he had 22, so I guess both of them broke a
record.  
  
But yeah, our freshmen, we struggled early in the year. You know, with
injuries, trying to rely on guys, young guys. But those guys have really --
you know, the reason why we're where we are at is because of the freshmen. We
get good leadership from will he Darian and Courtney when they got healthy but
those three young guys have really blossomed into really good players. Dom was
a little bit behind because he lost eight or nine games because of injury, but
they play like veteran guys. They are not caught up in the environment. They
just play -- all three of those guys love to play. They compete. They are
Bonaventure players, not highly recruited guys, per se. Osun got a little bit
at the end but guys that have a passion for the game and guys we feel have a
great ceiling and they just love to play. They are good guys. They are humble.
I'm lucky to be able to have the opportunity to coach them and hopefully for
the next three years. They are special players.  
  
Q. Just given the way that Dom had been shooting the ball with more
confidence of late. Did you feel like this kind of game was going to happen at
some point?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: You just never know. He's playing -- he's practicing
better. Dom's defending better. He's got a really good sense of how to play
now. You know, if there's anybody that made the most strides this year, it's
Dom. He just defensively, you know, he caught on. We run a lot of stuff. He
really did a good job of learning the stuff. He's playing with more confidence
and as you saw that stroke, he's got a natural stroke and when you have a
natural stroke and you put confidence on top of that, good things are going to
happen.  
  
But to know that he's going to come play the way he did today, make 6-out-
of-12, I wish I knew that.  
  
Q. What's it mean to get this team into the semis for the second year in
a row, given that now you're relying on a bunch of freshmen and your backs are
against the wall in a way they weren't last season?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: Yeah, we started off -- if anybody would have said that
when we were 1-5 and 4-9 and 4-10,0-1 in our league, one, that we would get
two byes and then win our quarterfinal game, you know, probably most people
would say no.  
  
But our guys really did a good job of persevering. They blocked out the noise
when everybody said that we stunk and just kept on working. We got healthy and
we got some chemistry. The freshmen got a lot of confidence and we just
started playing. You know, you watch us play and I think we played with an
enjoyment, a fun, and it's just they are a special group of guys. You know,
being able -- especially young guys when you get hit, it's easy to get knocked
down and lay down and feel sorry for yourselves, but those three freshmen
didn't -- and the veterans, you know, with LaDarien and Courtney, they deserve
a lot of credit. I sit up here as the head coach, you know, get all these wins
-- I haven't really done anything. It's those veteran guys. They lead this
team. They help us. They helped us win. Even though the freshmen scored 40
points or 47 points, without Courtney and LaDarien out there giving, you know,
great leadership, we're not winning, you know, so we've come together, and
hopefully we can continue to come together and get better because we're going
to have to play better tomorrow if we're going to beat Rhode Island.  
  
Q. Both you and Kyle both mentioned Mason's ball screens. Can you
specify on what you see?  
COACH MARK SCHMIDT: We call it owning. You know, it's like they own it really
hard and they get out and they get into the passing lanes and get their hands
up. They do a really good job and makes it difficult. You can't really get
slips against it. It was hard, trying to get the ball to the high post and so
forth, but they are a really good defensive team.  
  
Coach Paulsen is terrific, and they play hard. I think they have got a great
record when they keep teams under 65 points, but they are a really good team
and they had a great season, and we're just lucky to move on.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Mike Rhoades](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34346)

### [Marcos Santos-Silva](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36817)

### [De'Riante Jenkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34358)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Rhode Island 75, VCU 70  
  
COACH MIKE RHOADES: Tough loss. Proud of our guys's effort. We battled but we
just didn't get enough momentum there in the second half to get some things go
our way, and we were fighting uphill. Credit to Rhode Island. They made some
plays when they needed to and they scrapped some plays out, and you know,
that's how it goes.  
  
I thought our guys down the stretch got enough stops. We just didn't convert
enough. We had some opportunities, some free throws, and that's how it goes
this time of the year. We have had a really good non-conference schedule. We
won the regular season with a 16-2 record. Really, really proud of our guys.
Came up here to play for three days; we didn't. That's how it goes. We've got
to take it, no excuses, and we'll be ready to play when we're called on this
week.  
  
Q. Marcus, when Marcus went down, what did you guys say? What did you do
to rally everybody?  
MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA: We just talked to each other and told everyone, let's
pick it up, let's do it for him, keep on going. Stuff like that does affect
and hurt the team because he's one of the leaders and our guy, but we kept
telling our guys, let's go, let's go, let's pick it up.  
  
Q. Obviously they were going to you kind of heavily. Can you talk about
your day, 26 points, 22 rebounds, having that kind of day today, what was
working well for you today?  
MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA: Just did my role: Defend, rebound, just let everything
else come to me and just owe it to my guys.  
  
Q. To be on such a wing streak and have this setback, where does it put
you guys emotionally heading into the Tournament?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: Same thing. Just get back to the gym. Work hard and come
back and try to start another one. It don't affect us. We learn from it and we
just move on from there.  
  
Q. What would be your mentality moving forward, especially as a leader,
telling the guys to bounce back, how you guys have been able to bounce back
well from these kind of things well in the past, so what are you going to be
telling the guys in the week leading up to the tournament?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: The feeling of winning a championship and just having that
feeling versus this feeling of losing and knowing that it's one and done.  
  
I don't think no one want the season to end and I think everyone going to
remember this feeling and just work harder when we get back to the gym.  
  
Q. Where is Marcus at right now? What's his status at this point?  
COACH MIKE RHOADES: Doctor told me it was a bone bruise. Felt the knee was
stable. Thought it was a pretty deep bone bruise, and when we get him back in
the hotel, we'll reevaluate it and go from there.  
  
Q. The 75 points given up were the worst since December. Other than
Marcus being out, what do you think sort of -- how did that get away from you
guys?  
COACH MIKE RHOADES: We had some really good defensive possessions, and then
the ball got knocked around and they had too many offensive second-chance
points.  
  
I think in the first half, we gave them ten points on the foul line, and ten
points on second-chance points, and you know, we've been cleaning that up.  
  
Now, they have something to do with that for sure. Credit to Rhode Island. I
just thought we didn't redirect the ball enough. I thought we got beat off the
dribble too much today and we knew that coming in.  
  
Down the stretch, we had some really good possessions where we guarded the
ball, took a tough two, found a way to come up with it and we didn't
capitalize down at the end.  
  
I think it was three times we had the shot clock under five, get a stop, they
put one in and Jeff hits that router from 22-feet. I mean, that's part of the
game.  
  
I think the more -- yeah, they did have 75 points. We put them on the line too
much early in the game and that gave them some confidence. You get some
freebies like that and they made them.  
  
You get enough consecutive stops; we didn't get enough hands on balls today
and deflections.  
  
Q. You guys have been involved in a lot of games like this this season,
where it comes right down to the wire, it's very physical and I know in the
immediate aftermath, obviously it's a loss and it stings, but what kind of
positives can you take way from a game like this moving forward as you get
ready for the Tournament?  
COACH MIKE RHOADES: You might have to ask me that one tomorrow. You know, any
time you're in a battle it reveals character. You know, I want to win every
time we come out, our guys do, we all do.  
  
But really, the battle itself and the competition -- and when you have tough
ones like this, it reveals character. It reveals what you're good at. It
reveals what you've got to get better at. You see guys that step up.  
  
You know, our leader goes down and we didn't sulk, and he we just kept
fighting. I was really proud of our effort. Really proud of our togetherness.
They were upset for deuce but we had a game to play and we played it. We just
didn't make enough plays down the stretch, which we've been doing, especially
in this winning streak.  
  
Q. Marcus had a career-high 26 points and 22 rebounds. What do you see
from him today?  
COACH MIKE RHOADES: He's pretty saw some today. He just played so darned hard,
and when he plays really hard and plays with a clear mind -- I mean, he's only
a sophomore, too, so he keeps getting better and better. I was impressed by
the way he went after the rebounds today.  
  
He kept fighting. I just thought he played really hard. He ran the court
really well. I just -- he just gave us great energy and when you play harder
than the people you're playing against, it usually puts you in a good position
to get results, and he did that today.  
  
I was really proud of him. He had a great voice today. He's playing really
hard. I'm really proud of him.  
  
Q. During most of the season, you guys have three to four off-days, but
in this case, it was more of a week --  
COACH MIKE RHOADES: Yeah.  
  
Q. \-- until you played your last game. Do you think that made your guys
feel a little bit uncomfortable, or did you guys have to approach this game a
little bit differently?  
COACH MIKE RHOADES: No, not at all. Honestly, I thought we needed it. We
played so many games, quick turnarounds, and we were playing the Friday games,
I thought we had some quick turnarounds. I thought we needed it, I really did.
So I don't think that was -- the guy were really chomping at the bit yesterday
and this morning to play today, which is what you want to see, even when you
have a period of time off like we did.  
  
Now at the end of the year, guys don't want to practice, they want to play,
but I thought we did a good job as a staff of keeping practices short,
intense, gunning on what we needed to do.  
  
The one thing about this group, even though we had a week there in the gym,
man, these guys are in the gym all the time. They are always getting extra
shots up, getting to the free throw line.  
  
I can't fault that time off at all. The other team, they played a little
better than us. We lost our leader. That happens to a lot of teams, and we
didn't make enough plays down the stretch. That's how the game ended. I really
believe that was the difference.  
  
And credit to Rhode Island. They made plays. Jeff made plays down the stretch.
We didn't make enough of them.  
  
Q. You said games like this reveal character and obviously it's not our
first loss, and it's fresh, but wondering, were there some things you saw
immediately after the game or during the game that were specifics on character
revealed?  
COACH MIKE RHOADES: Yeah, you know, I thought our fight -- like the positive
part of it is like our guys were fighting to win the game. They weren't down.
There was no complaining. We haven't been at that a ton in the last month.
That was great to see.  
  
That's the character, just keep battling, keep fighting. We talk about that
all the time.  
  
Another one, down the stretch, I think you've got to finish plays, and we had
a couple drives to the basket where we've got a finish through contact. We had
two two-on-ones; you've got to finish two-on-ones and get to the free throw;
and that stuff, as upset we all are that they didn't go our way, those are
things we can still keep getting better.  
  
Some young guys made some plays we wish we had back. Hopefully we'll have
those opportunities sooner than later. We have to cash in on it and take
advantage of it.  
  
The character of this team all year long probably surprised a lot of people
but one thing that didn't surprise is they are not afraid to work and they
took ownership of the team. They will take ownership like the coaching staff
will in this loss and see where we can go from it.  
  
As upset as I am and feel for our guys, this is why you play the games and
we're not going to make one excuse, and let's see if the character that we
need all the time continues to get better and better.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Dave Paulsen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22000)

### [Jordan Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36827)

### [Justin Kier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36764)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
St. Bonaventure 68, George Mason 57  
  
COACH DAVE PAULSEN: I think first of all, just want to give credit to St.
Bonaventure. I thought they played really, really well. I thought we actually
defended hard and well, and made them get to, you know, second, third, fourth
options, and they made some tough shots, and they made some shots late shot
clock and banked in a three, and sometimes those things happen.  
  
So you give them a lot of credit and I think they also defended exceptionally
well. They have become, in any opinion, an elite defensive team.  
  
From our perspective, I'm proud of our guys. You know, we didn't play well
offensively but we fought and competed and dealt with adversity of three
starters in foul trouble in the first half, and fought and scratched and
clawed and got back in the game.  
  
And that's kind of the way our season's been, you know, with a lot of injuries
and a lot of adversity, and every step of the way, I think this group of guys,
they have been a lot of fun to coach. This has been 25 years as a coach, the
best group in practice that I've had. They work hard. They are coachable. They
bought into the team. They deal with adversity and we came up short tonight.
We're disappointed, but -- but really, it's an honor to coach these guys.  
  
Q. If you can reflect on the season a little bit, obviously you came in
with high expectations with the whole team back. How do you in the Wake of
this game judge the season? Do you see it as a success, failure, and now going
forward with most of the team back?  
JUSTIN KIER: First, I want to credit to St. Bonny's, great game. They played
really hard and have a great coach and they got it done, so credit to them.  
  
And also, with the season, I mean, there's not a group of guys I would have
rather played with. And you know, a big shout out to Otis Livingston, he took
me under his wing when I came in and he showed me, no one's ever worked
harder. I've never seen anybody work harder than Otis. You know, big shout out
to him.  
  
Throughout the season, we had some injuries, and I guess we didn't, you know
-- it didn't look like the beginning of the year, guys thought that we were
going to, you know, go undefeated and non-conference and all that kind of
stuff.  
  
You know, things happen and I wouldn't want to go to battle with anybody else.
You know, we had some ups and downs, but we had a lot of ups and those are the
things and those are the things you always remember at the end of the season.  
  
So you know, great group of guys and I'm excited to spend the time with them
in the spring and stuff like that, and enjoy it.  
  
Q. I believe you had 14 of Mason's first 15 points out of the break
after halftime. Was there a point in the game that you understand that you've
got a good match up and you're going to have to do the work there?  
JUSTIN KIER: I don't think it's about the matchup. I think it's about energy.  
  
You know, we weren't really hitting shots, and I just wanted to bring energy,
and if that was scoring or rebounding or defending. It was whatever I needed
to do. I got it going a little bit and try to get everybody else going and
stuff like that, but we just came up short.  
  
Q. You're constantly cleaning up around the basket. Is that a skill set?
Is that effort? What gives you the ability to constantly be grabbing offensive
boards?  
JORDAN MILLER: First want to give credit to St. Bonny's team. I wish them luck
in the future.  
  
No, I just want to impact the game any way and give my team positive energy,
and if that's like Justin said, rebounding, scoring, boxing out, anything,
really. That's what I just try to do, so yeah.  
  
Q. How do you look at this group, this team, coming back for most of the
guys coming back for next year? What's your outlook about this group?  
JORDAN MILLER: It's a great group of guys. I'm excited. We just have to work
hard in the off-season and try to get better.  
  
Q. It kind of came, you know every punch you gave at them they responded
seamlessly. What were they able to do to make sure that the lead never got to
a one-possession, two-possession in the second half?  
COACH DAVE PAULSEN: I think there were a couple things, you know, Welch, every
time you turn around, he hit a back-breaking three, and some of them, you
know, maybe weren't as defended as well as we'd like, but most of them I think
were challenged pretty well.  
  
You know, Lofton hit some big shots. That's the mark of a good team when
you're kind of on your heels a little bit, and getting punched, you know, to
counterpunch.  
  
And there were a couple possessions where we got the ball deep in the paint
and they were able to really block and alter shots. That's an athletic -- an
athletic front line, so looking at nine looks. So Griffin, Osunniyi; Welch
blocked some.  
  
So every time, I don't know, we had a break away lay-up that we missed. So
every time we were going to try to cut it to, I don't know what we got to,
maybe as low as five, but like, you know, they came down and hit a big shot,
and they had the ability to really block and alter our shots.  
  
You know, they got really good length defensively. They play really hard
defensively. So I think that's what they did.  
  
Q. I believe you took 26 shots in the first half, 17 of them were from
three. Did it feel like the Bonnies had you out of your game plan a little bit
there?  
COACH DAVE PAULSEN: Yeah, they did. And part of that is how they play. I mean,
they really do, you know, statistically, teams shoot a lot of threes against
them because they really pressure; they really rotate; they really help in the
paint.  
  
So to some degree, you're going to have to shoot some threes and make them to
beat them. They are going to make it very hard for you to score because of
their help on dribble penetration and because they have an elite shot blocker,
and then other guys are pretty good, as well.  
  
But it did rattle us, like we talked about that at the half; that we've got to
touch the paint. I thought Justin did a good job of really attacking the paint
in the second half. Not only the score, but find some guys.  
  
We left some bunnies on the table off penetration and passes on side that
we've got to finish those. Part of it, part of it was they took us out of our
game plan a little bit. Part of it is against them, you're going to have
drive-and-kick and you're going to have to knock down some of those threes,
and that has not been -- you know, that's been a weak spot for us throughout
the season.  
  
Q. Going into this season, expectations were pretty high. Can you
reflect on the season and just kind of what we can expect going forward?  
COACH DAVE PAULSEN: Yeah, I mean, expectations were high. I think that's a
good thing. That's better than expectations being low.  
  
I think initially, those expectations put our guys on their heels because none
of them had been used to those expectations, and that's unfortunate, but
possibly that's part of the learning progression. Possibly that's part of the
progression of a program.  
  
To our guys, great credit when we came back from Florida from the -- whatever
the name of that tournament was we were in. You know, they really bought into
like really becoming -- forgetting expectations and turning off the outside
world, if you will, and just embracing the process of getting better.  
  
And from that point on, really attacked practice and stopped worrying about
their own productivity, and I think when they were worried about their
productivity earlier on, it wasn't out of selfishness. It was out of, I have
to fulfill these expectations.  
  
So I'm hopeful that that process of going through that process will put us in
better stead. You know, at the end of the day, I think that was a big factor.
I think certainly injuries and the impact it had on our depth and our
positional size at the wing positions, you know, certainly -- you know,
certainly had an impact.  
  
At the end of the day, we have won more conference games than we've ever won,
and you saw this team tonight, and it wasn't always pretty, but every single
possession, every single second, that team fought, and I think that's a real
tribute to our guys.  
  
Q. What did you see from Justin today, over the entire year, his
performance, becoming assertive when you needed it today and now pivoting
ahead to next year when Otis is gone, Justin will have a greater status with
the club.  
COACH DAVE PAULSEN: Yeah, you know, Justin, the first eight games of
conference play, he was playing like a Player of the Year player, and he's
also got to guard that team's, oftentimes, best offensive player. I think that
took a toll on him a little bit physically. I think it took a little bit of
toll on him mentally. So he had a lull, if you will, in terms of productivity.  
  
And then the last couple weeks, you know, and in practice, he just kind of
refocused, recharged and so yeah, 26 last night, I think it was, 20 tonight,
but he guarded Stockard, and did an amazing job on Stockard after guarding
Maceo yesterday. So he has that ability.  
  
Now to guard another team's best player, go score, rebound, assist, that's
exhausting. That's why I push him so much because he has a chance to be I
think one of the best players in the league, and again, we don't want to
burden him with undo expectations, but also get him to see what he's capable
of when he's completely locked in like he has been these last three, four
games.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Bob McKillop](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18277)

### [Jon Axel Gudmundsson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36830)

### [Kellan Grady](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34946)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Davidson 70, Saint Joseph's 60  
  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: We know how good a team Saint Joe's is and how incredibly
well-coached they are. We played two very difficult, challenging games during
the season and they added Lamarr Kimble, who was not there in those two games.  
  
We realized the challenge that was in front of us, and I was absolutely
thrilled with the way our guys fought from the opening tap. Never got down
when they were down 9-2 early, and it looked like we got knocked on our heels,
but we never played on our heels throughout the entire game.  
  
That's a tremendous credit to this particular group of guys who have worked
very hard to get to this point in the season.  
  
Q. Just sort of talk about that rough start, shooting-wise, for the
team, and how you guys persevered through that.  
KELLAN GRADY: Yeah, we couldn't throw it in the ocean for the first 20 minutes
of that game, but you know, the reason why we stayed confident was because we
were getting good looks, and we were also getting downhill and getting good
shots at the rim. We had the confidence at halftime to know that they were
going to start dropping in the second half, and we just stuck to our
principles and we moved the ball; and when we executed, we ended up getting
good looks and they eventually fell.  
  
You know, just credit to our resiliency.  
  
Q. Can you talk about that sequence towards the end of the game, the end
one -- following that up with the slam. What was going through your mind when
you started to take over during a key part of the game?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: Shock. When he dunked? Shock. (Laughter).  
  
JON AXEL GUDMUNDSSON: I had not been playing well up to that point. I had been
rushing some shots and taking shots early off the shot clock, and at that part
of the game, it was just -- it was just letting the game come to me. And I saw
they switched on a ball screen and put, I think it was 21 on me, and I knew --
I had an awareness of him on him. I just took it to the rim and it went in.  
  
Q. I remember when you were playing over at Church Farm for a year with
Mark Turner. You knew Fresh, Lamarr Kimble, and Charley Brown and Chris Clover
pretty well. Did you have a specific plan going into tonight against the three
of them?  
JON AXEL GUDMUNDSSON: I mean, they are all great players, and like Coach said
earlier, we played them twice in the season and without Lamarr Kimble, and we
knew coming in it would be a really tough game, especially when they add
Lamarr Kimble to the squad. I mean, it's hard to come with a set game plan.
Just do your best to stop these players and I thought we did a decent job
today.  
  
Q. How much does the confidence of last year's tournament run help you
guys, and also with VCU being out as the No. 1 seed, does that give you more
motivation, as well?  
KELLAN GRADY: I think last year's run, we have a veteran group of guys this
year, so you know, we know what it takes, and I think we're prepared to play
three games in three days and really buckle down and just show some toughness
and resiliency, because that's what it takes to win an Atlantic 10
Championship.  
  
Q. Gentleman, I, of course, remember especially you, Kellan, when you
were playing for the great John Carroll at Northfield Mount Hermon. What's it
like transitioning from a guy like you, and for you to play like a guy like
Mark and to play for someone like Coach Bob McKillop?  
KELLAN GRADY: I was blessed to be very well coached in high school, and I
think that prepared me for college and I've been blessed to play under Coach
McKillop and he's done an awesome job with me and the rest of our team so I'm
very fortunate.  
  
JON AXEL GUDMUNDSSON: Yeah, being coached by Mark Turner was amazing. Just
unfortunately it didn't work as well as I would want it to. But he was a great
coach. It's a great school out there.  
  
Then to transition to Coach, it's just a different level. He's one of the best
coaches in the nation, and he shows it every year.  
  
Q. It seemed that in different parts of the game, you liked going
download and feeding the big men. Was it a result of the outside shots not
falling or feeding the hot hand?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: We're really an inside-out team all year long, and many
times our outside shot is a result of it going inside first.  
  
I thought Luka and KiShawn and Dushone (ph) were tremendous catchers inside
and when they catch, they deflate the defense and it gives us spacing, and it
allowed, you know, not just the scores from Luka, but some drives, some
slashes to the basket to Kellan and it even allowed that offensive rebound for
Carter, which was such a big part of the game when he got that offensive
rebound. It's a typical process for Davidson to play inside-out.  
  
Q. Looked like Jon took a fall there. How will he be tomorrow?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: Jon is one tough hombre. I have had very few guys who are
as tough as he is. I think we're very lucky that this team has a lot of very
tough guys. So Jon sets a standard for toughness that as a coach, you really
applaud and you celebrate.  
  
Q. You talked about toughness. Kellan struggled in the first half a lot.
What is it about Kellan, in particular, that gives you the confidence that
he's going to get it going eventually?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: Well, we called a number of plays for him; that gives him
confidence that we do that. And he has a capacity to make threes at the most
vital time of the game. As you saw, he made those two big threes in the second
half.  
  
In fact, you know, we made three three-pointers the whole game, and Kellan
made two of them in almost a back-to-back sequence, or close to it, in the
second half.  
  
He's very tough-minded, and give his parents credit for that. Give John
Carroll tremendous credit for that, and we're lucky that he's wearing a
Davidson uniform.  
  
Q. You mentioned, like you said, a game of toughness, and you called a
time-out, I think you were down by about four with about maybe seven or six
minutes left to go -- two, I'm sorry. What changed after you called that time-
out?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: We regrouped and realized, and Kellan made the comment in
the huddle, "We're only down one basket."  
  
We've done a lot of talking in the last week, and we've done a lot of growing
up in the last month. We played Saint Joe's a month ago, and they shot ten --
made ten threes in the first half, and they had us back pedalling.  
  
We went up to Philadelphia and played La Salle and put us on our heels and
made us back pedal. I think the growth of this team has been, it's fighting in
the center ring going forward, not fighting in the center ring going backward.  
  
It's a sign of maturation. It's a sign of getting better. It's a sign of these
kids doing such a great job preparing and practicing, and they give me great
peace knowing what they have done practice-wise and preparation-wise. I'm at
peace.  
  
Q. Off the beaten track, but not for you, Swarthmore just got to the
Division III Final. What do you make of your man doing that?  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: He's had a magnificent career at Swarthmore, though it's
only short of, I think four years.  
  
For anyone to go into an institution of academic rigor and excellence like
Swarthmore is, and turn it into a Final Four team, is one of the most
extraordinary coaching performances I've witnessed at any level, high school,
Division I, Division II, Division III. We're so proud of Landry Kosmalski. I
think he's playing tonight.  
  
Q. They won the semis tonight.  
COACH BOB McKILLOP: They won the semis? That's absolutely sensational. Who did
they beat? By what score? Great. Very, very proud of them.  
  
Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

### [Charles Brown, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36785)

### [Chris Clover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32810)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Davidson 70, Saint Joseph's 60  
  
COACH PHIL MARTELLI: The people that regularly follow know it's always the
same with me. It's a numeric game, and it's not shooting percentages, but it's
the other numbers. The numbers scream at you.  
  
So we had 11 turnovers; we just don't turn the ball over like that. And they
had 17 offensive rebounds; they don't offensive rebound like that.  
  
So those two numbers, in kind of, you know, that was a grinding game. It was
just a little bit rough around the edges and unfortunately, like just those
couple of plays, I think it was 60-60, we got caught in a switch. Then they
had an offensive rebound, I think when it was three, and then they had an
offensive rebound in the last stretch of time.  
  
These guys were really tight over this stretch of time, and they just talked
about playing till your exhausted and that's what I think every guy that
played for us played till they were exhausted. Just didn't play well enough.  
  
Q. You talk about playing basically a full 40 minutes right to the end.
Do you feel like you gave -- and this is for both Charlie and Chris. Do you
feel like you game this Davidson team everything you could handle or
everything you could give them?  
CHRIS CLOVER: Yes, definitely. Everyone went out there and played hard. They
gave it their all, and we just wasn't good enough today.  
  
CHARLES BROWN, JR.: I mean, this group of guys, we gave everything we had
every day. I mean, whether it's practice, film, walk-throughs, anything like
that, we's all in or none at all. It's kind of tough losing, but we gave it
all. We gave it all we had, so yeah.  
  
Q. For both of you, for Chris, it seemed like in the second half, you
found a little bit of a path to the basket as a team. Was that kind of what
you were trying to emphasize?  
CHRIS CLOVER: Yes, definitely, getting downhill on some of the guys that had
slow feet; so we wanted to attack them and get to the rim and try to get foul
calls. That was kind of the game plan going into the second half.  
  
Q. Flipside, obviously, 2-for-19 on threes, it was that kind of game. Do
you give credit to them on that or just wasn't falling?  
CHARLES BROWN, JR.: To be honest, I think it plays both parts. I think we
missed shots and they are a great defensive team.  
  
Q. Coach mentioned last night that you would probably be going up
against an NBA backcourt with Kellan and Jon Axel. What is your take on these
two? I guess that's really the question to ask.  
CHARLES BROWN, JR.: I mean, they are two great players. Great at what they do.
I don't know what to say -- emotional.  
  
CHRIS CLOVER: Like Charlie said, they are two great players and showed up
tonight and did what they was supposed to do and got the win. We did what we
could against them. We tried to limit Grady and GUDMUNDSSON but they were a
little too much for us tonight, but we definitely gave it our all and did what
we could.  
  
Q. Coming into this game, obviously you knew this was a short rest
before you got ready for a tough team. What were some of the highs and I guess
what were some of the lows? I know you mentioned the three point shooting was
probably the throw, as well as the rebounding, but do you still feel like the
foul shooting was one of the highs, I guess?  
COACH PHIL MARTELLI: No. I actually think the high for us in the game was we
started out the second half slow. They back-cut us. We turned the ball over
inbounding the ball to start the half. Then they back-cut us. They had three
lay-ups. That was on top of the two lay-ups to finish the half. We took a
time-out.  
  
We were down seven, and that would be the time when fatigue could enter in and
all of the sudden we're breaking balls loose. We created a lot of -- we
created a lot with defensive hands, and then we went too fast. It's not a game
for the fast; it's a game for the quick, and we had a couple of transition
plays that were not fulfilled. And I think in at least two of the cases, had
the ball going in the basket; that would have given us the lead, but
unfortunately we didn't -- we didn't do that.  
  
You know, I'll go back and look, and I'm wondering if the offensive rebounds
had anything to do with just that beat off. We had a sharp day. We did our
scouting report at nine o'clock. We did our walk through at one o'clock. We
came to the building. I thought -- I'm always looking at body language, and I
thought we would be ready to compete. We just weren't -- we just weren't good
enough for 40 minutes. We were good for a long stretch of time but not for 40
minutes.  
  
Q. Did it seem like in the first half the guys had a quickness advantage
and were trying to take it to them a little bit?  
COACH PHIL MARTELLI: Well, we always wanted to play at them, and not around
them. Because their shot challenges on 3-pointers are exceptional. They play
with very high hands, not 2 for 19, but we wanted to play downhill as much as
we could, and we didn't have the balance. You know, like we didn't get
everything across the board.  
  
I think at halftime we had four guys that had scored. We only had four bench
points, not from lack of trying. We didn't have the pop in the first half.  
  
I think we came out, started the game 9-2, had a good feel there. But then we
went a long stretch there and the ball didn't go in, and that's been the case
for us all year. When the ball doesn't go in, we have a tendency to just
think, well, the next jumper, when really it's the next penetration. We wanted
to try to touch the paint as much as we could and find our teammates from
there.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Anthony Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19553)

### [Jordan Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36836)

### [Jalen Crutcher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36837)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Q. Those last five minutes, what happened?  
JALEN CRUTCHER: I think we just didn't go in, get second-chance points. They
got a lot of second-chance points in the second half. We should have blocked
out. They got a lot of second-chance points, so I think that's what happened.  
  
Q. How did you feel about your performance tonight?  
JALEN CRUTCHER: I think I did pretty good. I could have did better for my
team. I had five turnovers, so I didn't play my best game. So I think I did
pretty good overall though, but I could have did better.  
  
Q. You know Obi pretty well. He really couldn't move too much in the
second half, right, or he just seemed like he was pretty still hobbled yet?  
JALEN CRUTCHER: I think they did pretty good in their 1-3-1 zone taking away
our bigs. Take my hat off to them.  
  
Q. How frustrating is this, you're playing so well last week and I know
you wanted to make a run here. To lose your first game, how does that feel?  
JORDAN DAVIS: I mean, it hurts. I mean, we wanted to win the whole thing. We
wanted to come and win the whole thing, so it hurts.  
  
Q. Same question. You guys, same thing last year, lost that first game
and I know it's going to be talked about all off-season now. Is that a little
tough to handle right now in?  
JALEN CRUTCHER: Of course. Like Jordan said, we tried to come in and win the
whole thing. You know, last year, this happened, we lost the first game and we
tried, we went out there and we tried our best not to lose, but we got to live
with the results.  
  
Q. What were they able to do, whether defensively, offensively, during
that last run to turn that two-point deficit so late?  
COACH ANTHONY GRANT: I don't remember every play, but obviously I thought Bess
really stepped up and made some big-time plays for his team.  
  
You know, we had some opportunities from an offensive standpoint that we
weren't able to capitalize on, either turnovers or missed shots that led to
obviously them being able to maintain that lead and build upon that lead.  
  
You know, we had some defensive breakdowns there, so give them credit. They
played well.  
  
Q. What do you think about their 1-3-1 zone? Do you think that hurt you
a lot?  
COACH ANTHONY GRANT: Yeah, it hurt us. It was a big factor in the game. You
know, they have done it throughout the year, but obviously tonight, they found
a defense that was working.  
  
You know, we've seen a few different defenses out of them from man to 3-2 to
2-3 to press to 1-3-1. The 1-3-1 today was the defense that they were able to
have sustained success with, so they went with that.  
  
Did a good job. They have got great length, physicality, athleticism and it
bothers; so yeah, give them credit.  
  
Q. Obi came back in the game and seemed to give a great effort, but
didn't seem to be a 100 percent. What did you see in his injury?  
COACH ANTHONY GRANT: We were hoping that the second half it would loosen up on
him a little bit. He did -- he went out there and he battled and he tried but
obviously he wasn't what we're used to seeing out of him, and you know, but at
the end of the day, our guys went out and competed at a high level all year,
and like I told them, they got nothing to hang their hat about.  
  
You know, it didn't go our way today, so you've got to give Saint Louis
credit, and you know, we've got a great group of guys in there, and I'm proud
to be their coach.  
  
Q. Do you expect to get an NIT bid? Do you think this team is looking
forward to that, now that the NCAA --  
COACH ANTHONY GRANT: That's completely out of our hands. I would love to get
an opportunity for us to continue to play, so hopefully, you know, with what
we've been able to accomplish over the course of the year, that opportunity
will be available to this group.  
  
You know, there's a lot of good teams out there, so we'll see what the weekend
brings, but hopefully we'd love nothing more than to be able to continue to
play.

_Washington, D.C._  
  
Saint Louis 64, Dayton 55  
  
COACH ANTHONY GRANT: Just proud of our team, the effort from the get-go and to
be honest with you, we've really been playing in spurts as far as our effort
is concerned and our aggressiveness. We've kind of been turning it off and on.  
  
Tonight I thought we had it turned on from the get-go. Wasn't always pretty,
but you know, when we play hard, we always give ourselves a chance. We weren't
playing aggressive and to our identity, then we just give ourselves a chance.  
  
Tonight, I thought we did that from the get-go. We made plenty of mistakes,
but I kept telling our guys in time-outs, that hard work, being aggressive,
being active make up for a lot of that.  
  
We never really relented on the effort. We never relented on how aggressive we
were from the get-go, and I thought our 1-3-1, our 13, was really good the
second half.  
  
Q. Start with you, Jordan. Things weren't working well offensively in
the first half, but you had eight points all on put-backs. What was the
mentality that was different tonight, rebounding in the first half, as opposed
to last night?  
JORDAN GOODWIN: Just being aggressive. Coach told me before the game that last
game, made an emphasis on trying to block me out. And my guys have confidence
in me and I have confidence in myself that I can't be boxed out. Just playing
relentless. That's what I've got to bring for my team. My team knows I've got
to do that for them.  
  
Q. What was the difference offensively in the second half, as opposed to
the first half, just a 180-turnaround?  
JAVON BESS: We just started moving better and we started cutting and diving
and that's what we made an emphasis on the halftime, we get on the highs, or
Tramaine driving the ball, just everybody cut, keep cutting, keep moving
because they like to watch the ball. I think that's what we did in the second
half.  
  
Q. Do you want elaborate on the offense in the second half, the
execution?  
TRAMAINE ISABELL: I mean, I think we played inside-out. I think they went
zone. We hit the short corner. Got some kick-outs. I think gentleman Van made
some huge baskets. You know, he's seen a mismatch, had a big man on him, we
let him go, and he's pulling up, knock down. I think we just rose to the
occasion. I think things, the second half, I don't remember the tide turned,
but Coach told us to keep pushing, keep pushing, and we ended up getting the
win. So I'm happy with the outcome.  
  
Q. Can you talk about playing so much zone now and how comfortable are
you guys are getting with playing that way?  
JAVON BESS: We work on everything. We pride ourselves on defense and defense
is not just man-to-man, it's zone, 1-3-1, everything. We work on that stuff so
we confident in it.  
  
Q. Tomorrow will be your third game in three days. What do you think the
benefits are of having two games under your belt, and what do you think some
of the disadvantages are with your team playing two intense games in a row?  
COACH ANTHONY GRANT: Well, you can't make any excuses. We don't have time for
any of that, really. We understand it's a quick turnaround tomorrow. Our team,
we've laid it out pretty hard the last two games, and you've got to dig deep,
man. You've got to find it. You know, you see how hard our guys have played,
so we've just got to get them back, get them back to the hotel, get them some
rest, and you know, we didn't get back hotel until 11:30 or a little after
last night, so we're probably about on that schedule as well.  
  
We've just got to get some rest and prepare in the morning. We don't have much
time.  
  
Q. Travis, with 13 defense again, it seemed to create a lot of energy
with the players. How careful do you have to be with them playing so many
minutes and just how many possessions you can even go with doing that?  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Well, we didn't go deep, obviously on the bench but when
you're trying to win and move on, you worry about winning that game. You worry
about doing whatever you can to win this game, and we were talking about it
over there on the sideline a little bit trying to get -- do we change
defenses, do we do some things to try to get some rest to win the game.  
  
Because I thought we went through about a three-minute period in the middle of
the second half where we fatigued and we gave them a mini-run. I called time-
out and discussed it with the assistants: Do we want to change; what do you
think about maybe getting some other guys in.  
  
And everybody said, listen, we got to roll with these guys. We're going to
have to roll with these guys. Let's just figure out this game and worry about
the rest later.  
  
13, we played hard. Playing a zone is harder than playing man-to-man,
sometimes, because you're trying to cover so many different spaces. So I don't
-- you know, whether you're playing zone, whether you're playing man, as hard
as we play, I don't think it really matters. You know, I think we left it all
out there tonight. We're just going to have to find it again because we're
obviously playing a really good team.  
  
Q. Today, I think seven-eighths of the team scoring just left the
podium. Going up against Davidson, do you have any plans to get the rest of
the team more involved scoring-wise?  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: Say that again?  
  
Q. The guys on the podium were responsible for I think 56 of the 64
points. Do you have any plans or ideas --  
COACH TRAVIS FORD: I don't care how we score to be honest with you. We'll take
-- whoever can put that ball in the hole, we'll take it. We don't have a plan
on who gets shots.  
  
We know we kind of -- you know, we know different guys have different play
that is we run for, things like that. We know who gets hot, we get back to
them. We don't care who scores, so from that standpoint, no, it can be
anybody.

_Washington, D.C._  
  
Rhode Island 75, VCU 70  
  
COACH DAVID COX: Well, that win right there was a testament to the strength
and the culture of this basketball program and obviously these two individuals
up here on the stage with me. Our guys have gone through a lot of adversity
this year. They have shown a tremendous amount of resiliency. They have
continued to play hard and they have continued to play together, and now we
are reaping some of those benefits. That was just an outstanding effort today.
We took some big shots from that team, particularly in the first half, and
then the way they started off the second half on a nice little run, but we
closed the gap. We stayed together. We trusted in one another, and just I'm
awfully proud of this group of young men. Looking to ready to tomorrow's
semifinals.  
  
Q. Jeff, I saw you on the court after the game. You were emotional.
Where did those emotions come from after this win?  
JEFF DOWTIN: Just from being disrespected throughout this whole season. Nobody
really counted on us. Everybody counted us out, but we stuck together as a
family. You know, this is a brotherhood for us. We're one small little group
of family that just trust in each other and that just shows on the court.  
  
Q. How did you get that shot to go, the late shot clock, 3-pointer
there?  
JEFF DOWTIN: 8:30 workouts with Coach Sutton (laughter).  
  
Q. Gentlemen, talk about this win tonight. You come in here riding high,
and Jeff pretty much just mentioned this as the team that really has been kind
of at the bottom, and you're now two wins away possibly from an A-10
Tournament, what do you have to say about what you've overcome this season.  
CHRISTION THOMPSON: We went through something this season that most thought
that we wasn't going to come back from and we needed to go through that and
that just brought us together as a family; and we were already a family, that
just brought us so much closer and that really end us and got us to this
point; and right now we take it one day at a time, one game at a time and we
going to continue this run we're making right now.  
  
Q. I just want to follow up with Jeff. Were you hearing heckling from
the VCU fans throughout the game or from players? Because you did seem pretty
pumped up there, and I know that you had to be just escorted away from the
handshake line. SO if you could give a little more context to that, it would
be appreciated.  
JEFF DOWTIN: They have a great group of fans and they heckle us a lot, try to
get us out of our game. That has to do with my mentality, just staying focused
on the game and keeping all those emotions inside until after the game. Once
the clock hits zero and we won the game, those emotions just come out.  
  
Q. How powerful is that chip on your shoulder right now and how much is
it motivating you through those games? Do you feel like you're playing with a
chip on your shoulder, and how much does that motivate you?  
DANA TATE: Definitely feel like we're playing with a chip on our shoulder.
Like these guys have said, we've been playing through adversity all year,
counted out, disrespected and we just stuck together. Coach believes in us and
we believe in ourselves.  
  
We carry those emotions and that disrespect every game and go out there and
give it our all.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, do you feel that there was any sort of a change
in momentum when Evans went down with his injury?  
CHRISTION THOMPSON: Start out by saying, I hope he get better soon. We just
stuck to our game plan, that's just playing hard and staying together. We knew
what we had to do. We knew we had to come out and play hard and keep the pace
of the game and stick with the game plan and stay together. That's what we say
every huddle, every time, stay together, and that's what we did.  
  
Q. They say that a team is a reflection of their coach. Now, how were
you all able to withstand the pressure that VCU can put on teams and how were
you all able to fight through it and keep your composure?  
JEFF DOWTIN: Just the pressure that Coach Cox put on us as a team, as a
collective group, that just us being able to just withstand our own and just
fight through adversity and that just helps out with that VCU pressure. It's
kind of like a mental thing. You know, once you fight that battle with
yourself, your mentality, that just translates on the court and makes
everything a lot easier.  
  
Q. The four freshmen have had impacts all season long but probably none
bigger than this game. What's allowed you and the other three freshmen to have
such an impact on the team this season?  
DANA TATE: Coach and the guys giving us confidence, letting us go out there
and play our game, just telling us the right things to do on the court, don't
do too much, stay within yourself, just play confidently. You know, these guys
are my big brothers, they are with me through practice and through the games
every day. They believe in me and makes me believe in myself even more and
makes me go out there and give it my all for this team.  
  
Q. This is the third year in a row you've knocked VCU in the tournament,
when you see them in the draw, not that it's going to be easy, how much
confidence do you bring into a matchup with them knowing that history?  
JEFF DOWTIN: When I see us against VCU, I get that smile on my face. I know
that's going to be a big game for us. You know, they are very competitive. You
know it's going to be a dogfight. Like I said, we've played them these last
two years and we've been able to come out with wins each of these two times.
We just have to keep going.  
  
Q. Congratulations on what was probably one of the best games I think
I've seen all week, and I know there's more to come. With Fatts and Cyril kind
of not playing the way they were yesterday, how big were these three that just
took the podium?  
COACH DAVID COX: They were huge, obviously, I mean, Jeff kind of controlled
the tempo, obviously when Fatts went out, he was our ball handler and our
scorer and our defender. Take him off the bench, and it gave us 12 big points,
six big rebounds, just a lot of energy and he played very, very solid defense.
Probably his best defensive performance of the year.  
  
And then obviously Christion Thompson is known as a defensive stopper, but to
step up and step to the line and go nine for nine in a game as big as this,
you know, it was huge.  
  
Q. You've been around this game for a long time, but as a player and a
coach, have you ever experienced anything like VCU just experienced in losing
a top player and your team, as a player or coach, responded to that
adversity?  
COACH DAVID COX: I've experienced it before. It's part of the game. I mean,
when it happens, you've got to -- it's next man up. They are a very talented
and a very deep team, so they have to respond. I guess we responded. We lost
our guy with four fouls early the second half, and other guys had to step up
and that's what we did.  
  
Q. In the second half, was there any point, any play in particular,
where you could sort of feel your guys taking control of the game and really
putting your noses in front?  
COACH DAVID COX: Not any particular play, no. I thought our guys were in the
game the entire time. I thought we just fighting not matter what. When we went
down eight in the first half, our guys kept continuing to fight. Went down
eight again, our guys continued to fight. Started the second half with a
turnover and a layup for them, went down early and our guys continued to
fight.  
  
No, there was no particular play. I just thought our guys showed a lot of
togetherness tonight, and as they have throughout the year and they fought
through adversity and showed a tremendous amount of resiliency.  
  
So yeah, no particular play but just all night, 40 minutes, it was a battle, a
man's game, hand-to-hand combat, and fortunately we came out on top.  
  
Q. Coming into this one, it seemed like you guys circled this one on the
calendar. Did you sense that, and what did you sense pregame coming into today
that showed you that maybe a little extra confidence?  
COACH DAVID COX: We were excited about this game. You've got to understand,
the last time we played them, they literally wiped the floor with us, and you
know, that was hard to take, hard to swallow.  
  
And what it did, as Christion Thompson said, it was almost necessary. It put
us at the bottom and we had to come together or separate, and what we did is
we came together; we had meetings; we had some very tough practices, and the
guys responded very well.  
  
And I think that's what you saw today. They wanted to -- they wanted the
opportunity to get back kind of at VCU and that's what you saw today.  
  
Q. You mentioned there wasn't really one particular play, but how big
was that 7-0 run you had to protect the lead in the early portion of the
second half? After that, it seemed like you had a big confidence boost. How
big was that stretch right there?  
COACH DAVID COX: I'll be perfectly honest with you: It's all a blur right now.
The 7-0 run, I'll have to look at the film. I'm not sure exactly what 7-0 run
you're talking about.  
  
I know Jeff had a big shot, but I just thought that our guys kept fighting. In
all honesty, I was paying attention to the score as a coach, but I really
wasn't paying that much attention to the score. I was paying attention to how
hard our guys were playing and how positive they stayed with one another and
how well they were communicating.  
  
Again, that's the fabric of a strong -- of a championship culture. We might
not have necessarily championship talent or championship depth, I'm certainly
not a seasoned, veteran, championship-calibre coach, but that culture is so
strong and that's what you saw today.  
  
Q. A couple times I saw that you even took in the atmosphere a little
bit, turning around and waving your hands towards the fan base. What's that
like, turning around, seeing a lot of yellow everywhere, but behind your bench
is that Keaney Blue?  
COACH DAVID COX: I've said this throughout the year, and I want to give a lot
of credit to all the fans, all those Rhode fans who made the trip down here.
They have been tremendous for us the entire year.  
  
You know, we laid some eggs in that Ryan Center, and those people have
continued to come back and continued to support and now they make a two-and-a-
half, three-hour trek down here.  
  
So I wanted them to know that I appreciated them, and obviously I probably got
a little caught up in the emotion of the game, but you know, that's what it
is. It's a big game. It's March, and you know, again, thank you to all the
roady fans. Hope to see you guys tomorrow.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Dave Paulsen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22000)

### [Otis Livingston II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32898)

### [Justin Kier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36764)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
George Mason 61, George Washington 57  
  
COACH DAVE PAULSEN: You know, we're really excited about that win. I think you
get into conference tournament play, you know, you've got to win a game like
that, a grind-it-out game.  
  
You know, where maybe we weren't as sharp offensively as we needed to be. You
have to give a lot of credit to GW. They really played an inspired game.  
  
But I thought our defensive effort, especially in the second half, even in the
face of some adversity offensively. I think we were down 52-47 and really
stepped up defensively. We went ten-deep. Every guy who played really gave us
a key contribution, even Boyd who has really been hurt came in for a minute
and had a nice assist for a three-point play.  
  
This is survive-and-advance time, and we're excited about having survived and
advance to tomorrow.  
  
Q. What kind of troubles were you having with GW's defense, particularly
in the halfcourt set? Seemed like a lot of one-shot possessions, and obviously
some misses.  
JUSTIN KIER: No, we made the adjustment. Their zone kind of made us shoot
quick shots, so we knew if we moved the ball, get it in the paint a little
bit, and just find the open shot instead of the first perfect one, that we'd
start making shots, and, you know, we'd start doing good against that zone.  
  
Q. Great to see you again and congratulations on a nice win today. Talk
about, I guess, the three-point shooting. That just continues. We saw that
back in Philadelphia when you beat St. Joseph's and seems like it's getting
better and better. Do you feel like this team is progressing a lot on
threes?  
JUSTIN KIER: Yeah, that's a good thing about this team is we all have talent
and we all played really good together, and we trust each other into making
shots and all that kind of stuff.  
  
So nothing better, no better feeling than, you know, seeing your guys happy
and, you know, we just found, you know, we all shot good today. We didn't
shoot very good, but we shot decent and Otis and Jamal, Javon, guys that, you
know, don't get enough credit, really knocked down shots tonight. You know,
credit to them.  
  
Q. Otis, they were without their leading scorer, DJ Williams. When did
you find that out and how did that change your approach offensively or
defensively?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: I would say right when we got out for warmups, but that
didn't really change anything. We wanted to come out hard and just play fast
and make good plays on both offense and defense.  
  
That didn't really change anything. We were still going to play how we played,
regardless of who was on the court for the team that we're playing.  
  
Q. You have a proximity to two schools and being in Fairfax county
Virginia and them being in Washington, D.C., the I-66 rivalry. Do you pretty
much throw out the records when the two of you all play?  
You all being close together, you all being relatively, like maybe within
miles of each other, the two universities.  
  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: What's the question? (Laughter).  
  
COACH DAVE PAULSEN: It doesn't matter records. It's going to be a tough game.  
  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: For sure. They have tough, tough players. You know, great
coaches. You know it's going to be a dogfight whenever we play them, so much
respect to them.  
  
You know, yeah, they are a great team. They play hard for a full 40 minutes,
you know, so we know that going into it, it's going to be a dogfight.  
  
Q. Did you see anything different that they did today that they didn't
do last week when you played them?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: They had Terry Nolan today, and he's a great player. He
gives them that scoring option that I don't think they had last week. But I
mean, they are going to play tough, though, regardless of who they have.  
  
JUSTIN KIER: I don't think they played any differently. I think, you know,
they played -- I think they played harder, and also, I think their big man,
32, he had a pretty good game. You know, they have Terry, who is a great
player, and just we got to lock in on him, too. He's a great shooter outside.  
  
I don't think they played differently, but they just had more pieces and more
guys step up-and-coming off a good win yesterday, I think they had a lot of
confidence and stuff like that. We just had to come out and play our game.  
  
Q. Can you quickly pivot now and think about St. Bonaventure? You played
them a few weeks ago. Didn't go very well in Olean. What are your thoughts on
facing them again now?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: You know, great team. A lot of great players. Great coach.
So they are going to come out hard and ready to beat us, so we've got to come
out, too. We're going to watch the film tonight, you know, scouting report,
and we're going to be locked in and focused and ready to go.  
  
Q. Otis, I've known you since you were playing as a Linden Tiger
probably five or six miles from here. What does it mean to come back to New
York and to the metro area and to play in front of your friends and family?  
OTIS LIVINGSTON II: It means a lot. They support me a lot throughout my career
here at George Mason. It's always good to come home and play in front of them,
and yeah, I mean, I just want to thank them for their support. But when I'm
playing, I'm locked in on us and what we've got to do and hopefully we can win
and keep winning games.  
  
Q. You mentioned a couple players have been injured. Ian Boyd has been
injured and Mar hasn't played a lot of minutes recently. How do you think
about giving those guys minutes heading into the game? Do you have a plan for
them?  
COACH DAVE PAULSEN: Well, so Ian for the first time in, I don't know, a month,
whatever it was, didn't have extreme pain in his wrist. So he played a couple
of games where we had to play him a little bit, but you know, he can't shoot.
He shot a left-handed free throw against VCU. So he's showed glimmers of it
being okay. So we said, we've got to get through this first day. Got him a
minute or two. He made a great pass play.  
  
Goanar, I've never in my 25 years of coaching had a guy attack rehabilitation
as quickly as he did. There was no way that that kid was going to be ready to
play this season except for he just willed himself to do it.  
  
You know, again, he's not -- you know, he's not anywhere near full strength,
but if he can give us a presence -- I just said, we need one good game out of
each one of you guys this weekend. You can choose which day. They did fine;
they didn't have a great game. So now one of them has to give us a great game
and one has to give us a great game hopefully the next day.  
  
But we need that depth. When we were really off to a good start, our depth was
a strength of our team.  
  
Q. With the team down five with about five, six minutes left, did you
see something in them that -- because there have been situations where
adversity has set you back a bit at times this year. Did you notice something
that sparked that late run?  
COACH DAVE PAULSEN: You know, I think -- and I think for the most part, the
adversity our guys have responded to, certainly a week and a half ago, not so
much, at all, and we really challenged our guys. Guys, that's not who we are
and that's not who we've been -- and I liked their response, getting ready for
last week's GW game was phenomenal.  
  
We just talk about, we're supposed to be built to win a game, we tell them all
the time, 52-50, 82-50, but the 50 has got to be the common denominator.  
  
Last Saturday, we shot the ball great. We attacked their zone. You know, you
asked, did they do anything different. They are doing the same thing.  
  
We just missed some of those same shots. So last Saturday, we won by 16 and
really looked good offensively, and then this is a progression of them, like,
okay, you're not playing great offensively, still defend, show toughness, make
the energy plays.  
  
And a microcosm of it for me was Javon Greene who has played really, really
well. You know, didn't play great today. Got three fouls. He came to the
bench. He had that ashen look on his face like, oh -- and I'm like, you've got
to get it together. This is where you need toughness.  
  
And so I think he came back and defended and then the offensive rebound, with
a few seconds left and then the free throws, that's the mark of a team that we
want to be in terms of toughness.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to tomorrow, last time you played St. Bonaventure, you
didn't have Greg Calixte, and I think Jarred Reuter struggled with the matchup
against Osun, who is awesome. How much does having Calixte change the core of
the front matchup tomorrow?  
COACH DAVE PAULSEN: One, St. Bonnies is a tremendous team, and they run -- and
it's a tough prep with no day of practice because they run more sets than
anyone, maybe in America.  
  
Having said that, not having Calixte, he does so many things that don't
necessarily show up in a box score defensively. You know, Jarred has been
banged up, is really hobbled. Ian Boyd, that was the game when we took one
free throw, and I'm like, oh, my gosh, the kid is in unbelievable pain, we
can't play him. Otis sprained his ankle.  
  
So we were as depleted as we have been. So that's going to help, you know, and
-- but we've got to challenge and we've just got to really go out and fight
for 40 minutes and then left whatever happens, happens.  
  
We might shoot it great. We may not, but if we fight and defend like we did,
especially in the second half, we're going to have a shot.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Chris Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16304)

### [Nathan Cayo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36716)

### [Grant Golden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36797)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
St. Louis - 71, Richmond - 68  
  
CHRIS MOONEY: Well I thought we played a great game. I thought it was super
competitive, very physical game. I thought we did many things really, really
well. I thought we defended well. Obviously they're a tremendous offensive
rebounding team, that's a weakness of ours and they were really able to take
advantage of it, which was the difference in the game. But I thought we
handled the end of the game situation great, got the quick 2-point shot, still
had time to maybe get a steal or a foul. And did a lot of things really well.
Really proud of how we played, how we finished the season and sad to see
Julius and Keith Oddo go. I wish we had a few more points in us.  
  
Q. For Grant and Nathan, what are your guys's emotions just as you see
the season come to an end here?  
GRANT GOLDEN: It's tough. We had a tough year. We were expecting to have two
guys Khwan Fore and De'Monte Buckingham with us and they decided to transfer.
And then Nick Sherod goes down with an ACL. It's obviously tough, up-and-down
year but I'm super proud of everybody in that locker room. Coaches, players,
we all fought through, nobody gave up, nobody quit, and, yeah, I mean wish the
outcome was a little different today, but.  
  
Q. Was tonight maybe emblematic of that, that you guys were very much in
it the entire way with a good basketball team.  
NATHAN CAYO: I thought we fought the whole game. I obviously gave them too
many offensive rebounds at the end but I think we gave ourself a chance the
whole game and fought the whole time.  
  
Q. Where do you guys go from here? What are your next steps?  
CHRIS MOONEY: Well we're in the midst of spring break, so we'll go back and
have some time to relax. And for us, for us I think we get started right away
as coaches in terms of reviewing this season, recruiting, preparing for next
season. Hopefully the guys can get a couple of days at least to relax and
unwind and then get back to class and give them a couple of weeks off from
basketball.  
  
Q. Am I correct, I assume you guys won't pursue any post-season
opportunities?  
CHRIS MOONEY: No. No.  
  
Q. Chris, talk about the rebounding edge you rebounded well with them
the first half. And in the second half they really dominated the boards. Did
they just wear you down or did they do anything differently?  
CHRIS MOONEY: I think they really, they put their head down and drove the ball
in there, and then sent everybody to the glass. We didn't have an answer for
it. We were hoping -- we're fighting in there, but they're built to rebound,
even Goodwin plays point guard a majority of the game and he has over a
hundred offensive rebounds on the season. French and Foreman are, those guys
are built to be offensive rebounders and we need to make sure that we do
better at that, but also keep scoring on when we have the ball. And I thought
defensively they took away Jacob as well as most teams have. So and we didn't
attack it well enough. Not terribly, finished the game with only five
turnovers, I think we had 10 turnovers in two games in the tournament, so I'm
proud of that, but we just didn't keep scoring enough.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Phil Martelli](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16280)

### [Jared Bynum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36784)

### [Charles Brown, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36785)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Saint Joseph's 92, Duquesne 86  
  
COACH PHIL MARTELLI: Well, right away, the six turnovers, it was sensational.
I thought the balance of our team, Fresh hit a big shot. Charlie, early.
Jared, when it got rocky in the beginning, we were down ten with seven minutes
into the game.  
  
But I thought -- it sounds crazy, but give up 86 points, but our defense was
really good and guys that you don't really expect to be defenders gave us
everything that they had.  
  
There was a little bit of panic early, being honest. Everybody wanted to have
a suggestion. But that was because they wanted to play Friday. That's all
we've talked about is playing Friday, and I'm happy for the players. I'm happy
for the families.  
  
You know, you see the families behind the bench, so looking forward to
competing against a great coach and an NBA backcourt tomorrow.  
  
Q. Charlie, Jared, first off, congratulations on a hard-fought win.
Jared, tell us, what was just going through your mind when you went to the
foul line.  
JARED BYNUM: My teammates and coaches, they have been on me all year about
making free throws, you've got to make your foul shots. It just comes down to
confidence at end of the day, it's just you and the basket.  
  
Keeping those guys in mind, got to help them out, help them to win and only
way I can do that is making my free throws.  
  
CHARLES BROWN, JR.: We just wanted to make it comfortable for him. He's doing
very well as a freshman. It was just hung him as much as we can, best as we
can, so, came through.  
  
Q. Charlie, your coach mentioned contributions up and down the roster.
How close did you feel like this was sort of peak offensive efficiency from
the total group?  
CHARLES BROWN, JR.: I mean, from the jump, we picked the shots we wanted to,
the people we wanted to get shots to, they got shots and they made shots, and
we came down the stretch and second half, we did the same thing, you know.
Picked shots, like Coach said, we can pick any shot we want and we just got to
be confident and knock it in.  
  
Q. Late in the first half, you took it into the lane about four straight
times. Were those marching orders, trying to get fouls?  
JARED BYNUM: It was just playing through the offensive flow of the game,
wasn't really trying to force anything. All my teammates and my coaches keep
telling me, play your game, play your game, play downhill.  
  
When I realized they couldn't stop me going downhill, either get in the lane
and make a play, whether that was finishing, a free throw, finding an open
man, whatever it was. At the end of the day, it ended up being something
positive.  
  
Q. Williams is a great player, as you know. What are some of the
adjustments you made second half against him?  
CHARLES BROWN, JR.: He kept me on my hooves. He's a great basketball player
and he's unpredictable. I had to sometimes push up, sometimes relax off of
him. It was kind of like 50/50 with him, so, yeah.  
  
Q. You had 28 points in the regular season against Duquesne, and now you
get 28 tonight. Do you feel like there's like any similarity, like maybe you
want to start playing Duquesne a little bit more?  
CHARLES BROWN, JR.: No, man, we got a W. That's all I worry about.  
  
Q. This is for both of you. When Duquesne came out and they started
seven of eight from the floor, what were you saying in the huddle at that
first media time-out?  
CHARLES BROWN, JR.: Stay with it. Stay would it. Keep going. Keep going. Keep
pushing and just have confidence in ourselves, coaches, and yeah.  
  
JARED BYNUM: Yeah, they were a little bit too comfortable in the first four to
six minutes and I just thought we got to make them uncomfortable. They were
catching them too low in the post, and we made some adjustments there.  
  
At the end of the day, it comes down to how much heart we have and how much we
want to play the next day.  
  
Q. The first half, guys (ph) was letting them shoot a lot of perimeters.
He wasn't guarding the perimeters or the baseline, second half seemed like the
defense shrunk, paint shrunk. What adjustments did make defensively?  
COACH PHIL MARTELLI: Well, I thought in the beginning of the game, we played
without trusting each other, and they were rhythm shooting. I mean, that young
man came in shooting 31 percent, freshman on this stage. Had 13 points in the
first six or seven minutes. The kid, Norman. We knew Eric Williams was coming
in here having scored 61 points in his last two games.  
  
So we had a game plan for the low post because in the last game in Pittsburgh,
Michael Hughes wore us out. He just wore us out on the low post.  
  
We had a way of playing -- we adjusted that, and then is the second half I
thought we came out like we were trying to catch our breath. Well, you can't
catch your breath now. It's March. You've got to take every play like it's
your last breath.  
  
So they got back and tied the game, and then we had a flurry. Charlie hit a
three-point play. Taylor Funk had a three-point play. We broke the ball loose.
We wanted real active hands, and we had much more active hands in the second
half, in the second part of the first half and even the second part of the
second half.  
  
Q. Taylor Funk, did his offense fuel his defense? Did his defense fuel
other things? What did you see from Taylor today?  
COACH PHIL MARTELLI: One of the things is he was in a position where he was
playing in the low post a lot defensively, and we just asked him to compete.
You know, the last couple of games, we're starting to see Taylor come back a
little bit. Like he hit a bomb in the first half, and he's had some blocked
shots. I just want him to play, you know, and quit -- quit psychoanalyzing
every single play.  
  
But that was a concern with Anthony with four and Lorenzo with four, and
running Taylor's offense in the game we weren't concerned about his ability to
guard in the low post because he's been bulldozed all year long. But he did a
great job hands, activity, six rebounds, so hopefully he's coming out of it.  
  
Q. Would you care to comment on --  
COACH PHIL MARTELLI: Sorry. Would you identify yourself?  
  
Q. Sorry.  
COACH PHIL MARTELLI: I've seen you around.  
  
Q. Yes, thank you. Would you mind commenting, 23-of-26, I know you
always preach on foul shooting, 88 percent. Your thoughts?  
COACH PHIL MARTELLI: Well, I like the fact that they were pressure-free
throws. It was brought up early like Jared, Jared's free throws at the back
end of the first half, we scored and that was important.  
  
At the end of the game, you've got to go to the line and knock it in; so if
you miss an assignment like we missed an assignment, and they cut it from nine
to six, had that been a 10-point lead now you're playing a three-possession
game; and when it's six, it's only a two-possession game.  
  
So you know, we work on it. We haven't been ultra successful, but I did see
the stats. We were, I think fourth in the league in free throws. You know, and
for us to be fourth in anything, coming in tenth in the regular season, is
something.  
  
We hang our hat on -- if we can hang our hat on making our free throws and not
turning the ball over, we'll give ourselves a chance.  
  
Q. It was a tough grind for you to win the game you won today. What did
you learn from your team from a physical standpoint going on to Friday?  
COACH PHIL MARTELLI: Nothing physical. But just us, not to be shared with
anybody, if somebody said to me: What has surprised you this year, it's been
-- we've played in the sunshine a lot.  
  
So when the sun is shining, I've got a lot of guys that feel good. But when it
gets a little cloudy and you've got to dig your car out of the -- you know,
dig your car out to get on about your day, we haven't been able to do that.  
  
Today, we did it. So I'm not going to spend any time wondering about where
it's been for the last four months. I'm going to say it was here for 40
minutes and can I get it back for 40 minutes tomorrow, because we're going to
need it.  
  
Q. In that second half, it seemed to be you would get a lead, they would
make a charge and you would respond. How do you think you were able to do
that?  
COACH PHIL MARTELLI: Defense. I thought we broke some balls loose, and we had
some guys step up. Like Fresh Kimble did not have a great offensive game.
Chris Clover sat most of the first half. He made a big jumper. Chris Clover
made a -- Fresh made a big jumper and then we broke a ball loose. There was a
really big play where we broke a ball loose and Charlie got a run out. We
broke another ball loose, and Taylor Funk got an M1.  
  
I just thought our defense the second half -- and that sounds crazy, we gave
up 43 points but it was clearly our defense.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Maurice Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20779)

### [Armel Potter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36770)

### [Javier Langarica](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36771)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
George Mason 61, George Washington 57  
  
COACH MAURICE JOSEPH: I want give them credit. I thought we came out, played
really, really hard. We executed the game plan almost to a T. So I give our
guys a lot of credit, down our leading scorer going into this game with his
head injury, it would have been easy to kind of cash in the chips and just
say, you know what, let's lay down.  
  
But our guys didn't do that. We have a resilient group. I'm proud of my guys.
I thought these two guys played their tails off, and to come down here with a
bunch of guys who haven't played in the A-10 Tournament, a bunch of
inexperienced guys, no seniors, injuries, all that kind of stuff.  
  
I'm proud of the effort and I'm proud of the two games we put together here.
Something to build off of and I'm looking forward to continuing to grow with
this group.  
  
Q. You had 14 assists on 21 made baskets. What was going right in terms
of ball movement, being able to get your team open shots that may not have
been happening in games past?  
ARMEL POTTER: It was in our game plan. We knew George Mason was going to be in
the gaps heavy, so we just locked into the game plan and we wanted to get in
and kick the ball out to the open player and trust him that they were going to
make the right play. We made a lot of right plays tonight. Unfortunately we
didn't end up with the win.  
  
Q. This game was really tight throughout, seven ties, eight different
lead changes. To close out your season, despite the loss, how does it feel to
really make George Mason work for this win and not make it easy for them?  
JAVIER LANGARICA: I think we proved that we could have won the game. There was
a stretch where we were up, but George Mason played really good, and like many
other games, I think we were very close, but we didn't finish the game.  
  
ARMEL POTTER: The good thing about having a young team is these last two games
we played, I think we played extremely well with our energy and effort, and we
can grow from this and we can take it into next year.  
  
So that's a positive way to look at things, and we're going to keep our head
high and keep working.  
  
Q. This is the second game in a row I think you have double-digits
rebounds and you had a really strong game underneath the rim. What's clicking
for you, especially in these last two games, when it's win-or-go-home?  
JAVIER LANGARICA: Well, these last two games, I just tried to give everything
I had for the team, and now I know that I just have to get more physical, and
just keep improving to help the team win.  
  
Q. Is it on that late free throw, which they grabbed, what happened on
that miss there? Seemed everyone boxed out, did the right thing.  
JAVIER LANGARICA: The guy, I don't know who was next to me, I felt like he
grabbed me. It wasn't the first time during a free throw someone was grabbing
me. So I felt like he grabbed me. I kind of fell, and so he made me be out of
position and someone else of George Mason team grabbed the rebound, I don't
know.  
  
Q. I think in the last game you played against them, you mentioned that
George Mason plays in spurts and they get their points in spurts and runs and
things like that. When you guys were experiencing some scoring droughts, how
do you think your team handled that on defense, just limiting George Mason's
point production when you weren't scoring?  
COACH MAURICE JOSEPH: I thought we handled it really well. Coming into this
game, with D.J., obviously our leading scorer with a head injury, we had to
make sure we controlled tempo, controlled the pace for 40 minutes, and then we
have to executed -- we have to execute in the halfcourt.  
  
So we kind of slowed it down a bunch today and pumped the brakes so that we
could make it more of a halfcourt game. Because we said, hey, if we keep the
game in the low 60s, you know, mid 60s, we're going to have a really good
chance of winning. If we get to the 70s or 80s, we're probably going to be in
a sufficient spot.  
  
And I kid you not, almost everything that we talked about in our meetings last
night as a staff and this morning as a staff and with our entire team, we
executed. We played really well, and I thought our guys played hard.  
  
But it comes down to basketball is a game of inches. I thought we missed two
bunnies that -- up three, could have went up five. They come down and hit a
shot. So when we went through those little droughts and weren't scoring, the
good thing is, in these last two games, we really defended and played hard and
just bit down and showed some grit and toughness and resiliency, and that's
encouraging for me.  
  
So I'm proud of our guys for our effort in that regard.  
  
Q. What did you think, you got up to a five-point lead late, five
minutes left or so. Was the maturity of a team -- you have a lot of young
players obviously. Does that come into play in a situation like that? Did you
see that come into play?  
COACH MAURICE JOSEPH: I think that always comes into play, but the bottom line
is, our guys played hard. You know, it wasn't -- you know, we didn't lose that
lead due to a lack of effort.  
  
We had that drive on our left-hand side, ran a play to Mace, ripped to his
left hand because we were sitting on his right hand to get him to the cup, and
he just missed a great shot. I told Mace, I'll go to my grave with you on that
shot, you know what I mean. Like I have all the confidence in the world in you
making that shot. It rimmed out today.  
  
You know, he's beating himself up because he's a good kid and he works hard,
but he can't hang his head. He cannot hang his head. Then we had another layup
a little later after that and the free throw at the end you mentioned, and
little plays here and there.  
  
But I thought for 40 minutes we played really, really well and we played hard.
Again, we're just proud of our guys.  
  
Q. It seems like Javier was a big part of the game plan offense. He got
a ton of touches inside. How does that help the other guys get open and give
them lanes to drive and then kind of do some of the things that you want to do
on offense?  
COACH MAURICE JOSEPH: Well, playing to the post against Mason has always been
something we wanted to do because they often either double straight from the
passer or from the ball side slot. So we knew that if they doubled and we
played through the post; that if we flattened our guys out through the strong
side, we would get kickouts, drives, all that kind of stuff.  
  
They didn't show the doubles today, so when Javi got the ball he had one-on-
one coverage and he's able to wheel and deal and get in there and get some
shots and get to the free throw line a little bit. Got there once. I thought
he got fouled a couple times.  
  
He was able to get off some pretty good looks there, and then on the glass on
the other end, I thought I was a monster the last two games. He really, really
battled. And he knows he's not the biggest strongest most physical guy, but
he's in there sticking his head in every bar fight there is to stick his head
in.  
  
So I give him a lot of credit because he was thrown into the fire to play this
role at that position with our lack of depth at that position and he did a
monster job to finish the season averaging six and five, whatever it was, I
guess from where he was at last year, he's made unbelievable strides.  
  
I couldn't be more proud of him. No one's harder on him than I am; I think
he'll tell you that. But it's because I see that he's capable of these things,
and now going into his upperclassman years, I think this year is going to be
-- is going to prove to be a really, really valuable experience and learning
lessons for him, because he got so much better with the opportunity he was
given.  
  
Q. You mentioned this at the very, very beginning of the season, but you
have your whole team coming back next year. So when you just look at how the
season went overall, and the high points and the low points, too, what do you
want your team taking away, just in terms of what they have learned this year
going into next?  
COACH MAURICE JOSEPH: Yeah, you know, our team is young, like you mentioned.
For us, it's just a process of understanding the standards that we need to
live by every single day, and I think young guys don't quite get that because
they don't -- and when you have the season that we've had, they don't really
-- it's harder to buy into that because hey, you're talking about the stuff
we're losing and all that kind of stuff.  
  
But for us, it's a process of understanding that winning is a byproduct of the
things that you consistently do every single day, and that sitting in the
first third of class correlates to winning. Being on time in study call
correlates to winning. Showing up to practice ten minutes early and doing your
pre practice shooting and all that kind of stuff, those things correlate to
winning. It's not just throwing the ball up in games and hey, let's go try to
outscore a team and let's try to win a basketball game. It's not about that.  
  
Obviously this year we didn't get the results we wanted throughout the course
of the year. We're disappointed with the season we've had overall obviously
but I'm incredibly encouraged by the growth that our players have shown and
the experience that they got and how this can make their development and our
program a lot better.  
  
We're going to continue to plug away at the culture. We're going to continue
to get our guys better on and off the court. They are going to continue to
remain stellar students in the classroom, great representatives of their
families and of our great university.  
  
We are going to continue all those things. We're going to make sure that we
understand that our culture is going to be bigger than any one person and any
one thing. We're going to continue to plug away at that, and again I'm
incredibly encouraged by that because of the people in our locker room.  
  
We have really good kids. You know, we had, what was it, seven Dean's List
kids. We have great guys in our locker room. I couldn't be more proud of them.
They didn't complain that they were young. I complained a little bit they were
young, but they didn't complain. We just came to work and did what they needed
to do on a day-to-day basis.  
  
We are going to take these experiences from this year and told our guys, we
have nowhere to go but up. We have got to go get better and we've got to
hunker down. Our guys did that, and now we have to take it up a notch, now
that our guys have gotten some valuable experience.  
  
So I'm looking forward to seeing their growth because it was a joy to watch
them grow this season.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Tramaine Isabell,
Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36798)

### [Travis Ford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18471)

### [Hasahn French](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34896)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
St. Louis - 71, Richmond - 68  
  
TRAVIS FORD: Wasn't exactly how we drew it up. But let me first just say what
a great job by Richmond. Chris Mooney had his team really prepared, ready to
go and he does such a great job and his team really played well. I just
thought first half we, if you've watched us play we're probably the most
physical, maybe not the most physical, there's some physical, but as physical
a team as there is in our league. And for us to only have one foul at halftime
and only one free throw that just goes totally against who we are. I'm not
talking about, I'm talking about we didn't play to our identity, we weren't
playing physical and aggressive enough in the first half. We had a lot of
opportunities in the first half around the basket. We'd either drop, we had a
charge, walks, and just gave up too many points in the first half. Second half
we changed it up, we changed up our defenses quite a bit and went to our more
aggressive defenses to try to, more than anything try to get ourselves going
is one of the reasons I did it is to try to get ourself going. We never could
get away from them. We just couldn't get away. I thought we were playing
pretty well second half but you look up at the scoreboard we're still down
five, still down six, still down seven. And it took a couple big shots by
these guys, making our free throws down the stretch. And just a massive effort
on the glass, just a massive effort rebounding. I think you saw a group of
guys when it got under that 10-minute mark that just let it all hang out and
it was a very impressive effort by these guys so we got to get back and get
some rest.  
  
Q. Hasahn, great to see you again. Always going back to the days of you
at pro scholars athletes. What what's it like coming back home here in New
York?  
HASAHN FRENCH: It always feels good. I love playing in New York. Happy my
family was able to come to the game and I just want to make sure that they get
to keep coming back to the game all the way to Sunday.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. It looked like from the beginning they were intent on getting you the
ball and then you got the fouls obviously and had to sit for awhile. But you
looked determined when you came back out for the second half to really get
things going with the offense?  
HASAHN FRENCH: Yeah I just tried to play aggressive. I know my team needs me
to play aggressive on offense and defense and I just tried to keep doing that.
And when I got inside I knew that if I got them on my back most likely they
can't guard me. So just tried to attack and make sure I'm getting these guys
assists.  
  
Q. Hasahn, it kind bottled you up, was real physical early. Second, like
the first half five minutes left to go seemed like you were feeling it. What
was the change of mentally or physically of them?  
HASAHN FRENCH: I noticed that I just really tried to play aggressive. I just
tried to do that the whole time. And I knew if I kept doing that they really
couldn't keep up. I know some of their guys would get tired, I knew their big
would get tired if I stayed running up and down the floor and attacking them
so I just kept trying to do that and it worked for me.  
  
Q. Tramaine, I've been able to cover you from your days at Drexel. Would
you talk about what has been the best part of your transition from the CAA to
here, the A-10?  
TRAMAINE ISABELL JR.: A lot. At Drexel, we played hard, we were in some games,
got some big wins. But here I'm playing under a point guard in Travis Ford who
holds me accountable to a level that I don't know necessarily I've been held
accountable to. I'm playing with great athletes, like this guy next to me,
Javon Bess, go down the line, Jordan Goodwin. It's a totally different
atmosphere in the locker room, in practice. But I'm thankful to be here, I'm
thankful to get this win and hopefully like Hasahn said we'll be playing until
Sunday.  
  
Q. Tramaine, so you're able to get sort of your scoring going more. But
how, like how has it been sort of like how have you been able to fit into the
offensive set while still like scoring more like in the past like seven, eight
games?  
TRAMAINE ISABELL JR.: Coach Ford told me it was going to be a transition. I
had a lot of ups and downs throughout the season like losing confidence,
whatnot. But coach told me that to stay confident and he got confidence in me,
most importantly, and not lose confidence in myself. And he said around this
time was when things are going to start clicking. And I think I'm getting, I
mean we're 30 games in, coach said before the game like we had 30 games of
preparation of practice of understanding each other and I think things are
clicking. I'm understanding my teammates, I'm understanding where coach wants
me to attack from and I think the game's just kind of moving a lot slower than
it was when I first got here.  
  
Q. You had to feel like that game was unfolding very much like the first
meeting in St. Louis, almost identical with Golden getting off.  
TRAVIS FORD: Press brought us back in the first game, press brought us back
this game. We just did it with a little bit more time this time. I think even
at home we had a shot to tie it at the buzzer after being pretty much like
this, after just playing not very well at all. Playing on our heels. We knew
this was a tough matchup for us, I knew that, we knew that. Every team has
certain matchups, Golden gives us problems. He has, always has, we have tried
every, double in the post, digging the post, his length, it just gives us some
problem and his size. But we decided, I decided at halftime to go to a defense
we didn't try at all first half, which was our 13 defense. And it's an
aggressive half court trapping defense. And I told our guys here's what we're
doing and we're going to roll with it. On every made shot we're going to be in
13. On every missed shot this is what we're going to do and we're going to
take some chances and gamble. And it was more for our benefit than actually, I
worried about turning them over. I wanted to get our guys going. I thought if
we could get our juices flowing a little bit then good things would happen
because I just kept, first half we were just on our heels, and we could never
gain any momentum because they were scoring at such a high rate. We actually
both were scoring they just made a few more threes than we did. But difference
in the game was rebounding. Obviously I wasn't too happy at halftime. And
there's certain stats we live on. And rebounding is one. And we were not even
close to the margin we needed to be at against a team that we feel like that
we should have some numbers on. I kept telling our guys we missed 14 shots in
the first half and only rebounded four. So if you're not going to play our
basketball we might as well start the bus and head on out he here right now,
just go and tell them we're not coming back out. Because that's not who we
are. We know we're going to miss, hey, you know, but we usually rebound the
ball. I mean we really pursue the ball. Second half you saw a group of, they
were hungry, I mean it was like, all right, and the rebounding brought us
back. But rebounding brings a mentality for us as well. It's a mentality. It
gets us going.  
  
Q. Good win. Foul or defend, did you think about that on the last
possession?  
TRAVIS FORD: Say that again.  
  
Q. Foul or defend, did you think possibility of fouling the last
possession or you just wanted to the defense to play it out?  
TRAVIS FORD: Play it out. I was ready to play it out. You get a feel for a
game, play it out. We wanted to get, we got size on Gilyard, we put Javon Bess
on him. I had Fred Thatch guard him most of the second half but I changed that
last possession and put Javon on him for size. And then we wanted to switch
everything. And we picked him up full court just to try to take some time
which is a little dangerous with his quickness. But we had been so aggressive
and had so much success with picking them up that we just stuck with it and
said let's roll with it.  
  
Q. For comebacks like this I think something that comes to mind is the
concept of Team Blue. Could you kind of just like that sort of as a family
sort of as how that kind of fuels the team?  
TRAVIS FORD: Yeah, I think that Tramaine alluded to it a little bit, I think
Tramaine Isabell has been one of the best players in this league the last
three weeks. But I told him that back in November, I said you're not going to,
you're probably going to struggle until February and March. I told him that. I
told him that, doesn't mean you can't play hard, you need to learn to do all
the other stuff, you learn to do all that other stuff, it will all come. And I
think it's the first time he's had an opportunity to play with some pretty
good players around him that kind of compliment him. He's one of the more
skilled guys on our team. The other guys, we're a little bit of some bullies
on the other side, he really compliments these guys. But these guys have
embraced him and Team Blue's something that we really believe in, it's
something that I talked about a lot at halftime, and it's first thing I wrote
on the board when I walked in, that's Team Blue basketball. How we played the
second half. That's how we play and Team Blue has a standard that we all know
as a team we know what those standards are, we know what they mean, we know
what Team Blue stands for, it's just not a name, it's just not something we
say, it stands for something, we have a culture behind it and values behind it
that are written out and if we play to those, we always give ourselves a
chance. We may not win every game, but we'll give ourselves a chance. And
every year Team Blue may mean something different, but this team knows what it
means. We have been through a lot. To have 20 wins under our belt, this team's
been through more injuries than people have any clue about. And then losing
players, different things, be sitting here with 20 wins and come back like
that, we got to get back to the hotel and try to get another one.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Ashley Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36753)

### [Pookie Powell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36754)

### [Saul Phiri](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36755)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Rhode Island 76, La Salle 57  
  
COACH ASHLEY HOWARD: You know, all the credit goes to Rhode Island today. I
thought those guys played like a team who had been there before, today. And
obviously Langevine did a phenomenal job around the basket, on the offensive
glass, and then late in the game Fatts Russell was able to get it going. I
thought he made some really difficult shots that our guys made him work for.
But you know, when you get into a rhythm and you know, the ball just starts to
bounce for you, and Fatts has had it going for the last couple weeks now.  
  
So just unfortunate that we weren't able to pull out a win just because I
think our team has come a long way. I'm proud of this guy sitting next to me
here, Pookie Powell, his leadership for these young guys has been
unbelievable, just starting the season 0-10, and then making the strides that
we made throughout conference play.  
  
I'm disappointed that we lost but I'm proud of the growth in this team
throughout the course of this first season.  
  
Q. Pookie, obviously not the way you want to go out. That's a tough loss
there. But what did you see out there that didn't work for you guys and that
did work for them?  
POOKIE POWELL: I just feel like we didn't follow -- we didn't execute the game
plan. We had a specific game plan that we needed to follow and we didn't
follow it.  
  
We didn't make shots. We all just got down on ourselves and everybody just
kind of gave up. Unfortunately we got the loss but I felt like the effort
going towards the end was there, but it was just too late.  
  
Q. There were a lot of threes but not a lot of open threes. What do you
think was going into the contested threes?  
SAUL PHIRI: I think they did a good job of closing out all the way. They know
we like to shoot a lot of threes. We're a very good three-point shooting team.
They emphasize running us off the line, definitely, so I think they did a good
job of that. But that's really it.  
  
Q. Where did you see the improvement of this team over the year? Where
do you think you improved the most?  
SAUL PHIRI: As a team, I think we're all connected more this year compared to
last year. I think we all share the ball definitely better. I think anyone
felt like all the pressure was on them. I think we all realized as a team we
can be a very dangerous team. I think that's definitely the biggest
improvement.  
  
In terms of focusing on our defense and our scouts and what we do, I think we
definitely improved in all that.  
  
Q. Looking forward to next year, you're going to be kind of in Pookie's
shoes. You're going to be one of the few upperclassmen on the team. Do you
feel like you're ready for that leadership role?  
SAUL PHIRI: Yeah, definitely. I think I'm ready to take the leadership role.
This year was a transition for me to be one of the bigger leaders for the
team.  
  
So I think this year is definitely going to help me next year just be the best
leader I can for the team.  
  
Q. I'll start off with the negative, I won't stay on it too much. Not
much to stay about it. But like Pookie just said, the hustle and the effort at
times tonight was just not there from certain guys. There was one guy that I
believe you told to go sit at the end of the bench if he's not going to play
hard. What can you say about that?  
COACH ASHLEY HOWARD: You know what, it's been a microcosm of our season. It's
been up-and-down. We've always -- this group, what I've been trying to get
these guys to understand is, whether you make shots or not; if you play with
effort, and you follow the game plan, you'll always have a chance to win.  
  
What happened tonight was we struggled to make shots. I felt like we got some
open looks. I thought we were wide open. Didn't make them. And then it
affected our energy on the defensive end, not springing back on defense, not
communicating.  
  
We had a lot of easily correctible mistakes to happen on defense that I felt
like set the tone for Rhode Island, especially in the first half where they
got that double-digit lead.  
  
So, you know, that's one of the things that we really focused on. It was
disappointing that we still, you know, went in that direction in March. But
you know, it is what it is. It's something that our guys, I'm sure, will learn
from next year.  
  
Q. I heard you talking to the players about taking charges and how that
was a big part of the game plan and getting on them for not getting there. Did
you see something with Rhode Island that told you, yeah, that's going to be a
way we can beat them getting our nose in there on defense?  
COACH ASHLEY HOWARD: Yeah, we knew what they were going to do. We knew that
Langevine is an aggressive roller off a ball screen set for Jeff Dowtin and
Fatts Russell, and the game plan was for our guys on the help side of the
floor to be loaded, and when they throw the ball to him, be ready to step up
and sacrifice your body.  
  
One of our goals was to take two charges by the first media time-out. So we
knew by the first media time-out that, you know, we had not, you know, come to
set the tone the way we planned.  
  
From that point forward, it was us just trying to play catch up in terms of
just doing the right inks this, playing with the right effort, and you can't
not bring it from the start against a team like Rhode Island who has been in
the NCAA Tournament multiple years, and has experienced players like
Langevine, Fatts and Jeff Dowtin.  
  
Q. How much experience is a factor today? You mentioned they have been
there before. How much did that play in here?  
COACH ASHLEY HOWARD: I mean, we don't -- we haven't had any of our players,
any of our older players, none of those guys have won a game in the Atlantic
10 TOURNAMENT, and then other than that, it's a transfer and then freshmen,
right.  
  
You know, Rhode Island is playing guys that played in the NCAA Tournament last
year, and you know, a team that was the best team in the Atlantic 10 last
year.  
  
So I think a lot of it had to do with experience, but you know, I think a big
part of it was that, you know, Rhode Island just came to play and they set the
tone from the start.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to next year like I was doing with the players, what
did you feel like you guys did to grow this year and set up for next year?  
COACH ASHLEY HOWARD: Well, I think the expectation was established, and even
today, it is going to be a learning experience. I hope that our younger guys,
when we get back to this point next year, they remember the Rhode Island game.  
  
We said we're going to take two charges; we didn't, so then whoever we play in
the first round next year, whatever that game plan is, those guys are on it,
and it's a part of the growth of this program.  
  
It doesn't happen overnight. I understand that it's a process that may take
some time, and experiences like today, I believe are going to make us a better
program moving forward. Whether it's next year or the year after that, we have
some young guys coming in that will mix up with the older guys that are
returning, and I'm looking forward to getting back to work with those guys and
building for the future.  
  
Q. You kind of answered it. I was wondering whether you were going to
burn the tape or talk to them immediately about it, or you know, what your
thought process is about this game, and you kind of answered it.  
COACH ASHLEY HOWARD: To be honest, the players know. They know. They know.
They know that we said the goal was to take two charges by the first media
time-out. They didn't do it.  
  
They know the goal was to be the first team to dive on the floor for a lost
ball, and we didn't set the tone that way. Because if we set the tone that way
whether we make shots or not, we give ourselves a better chance.  
  
There's really nothing to be said. Like at the end of the day, you can tell
lies to everybody but yourself. Our guys knew what the deal was going into
today. We didn't quite get it done. We'll learn from it. If we don't learn
from it, then shame on us.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Keith Drambot](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34890)

### [Marcus Weathers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36782)

### [Lamar Norman, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36783)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Saint Joseph's 92, Duquesne 86  
  
COACH KEITH DRAMBOT: Have a lot of respect for Coach Martelli and his team, a
lot of respect for Coach, been through some difficult times, both personally
with the tragic losses of his parents, and a lot of injuries with his team.  
  
But we knew it was going to be a tough game. They have been playing better.
They are healthier. They are difficult to guard because they can spread out,
and you know, we just had a hard time, every time we got close, we made a
defensive mistake which hurt us.  
  
Q. Marcus, the two big runs when there was the foul, the third foul that
was picked up on Mike and then when they had the 9-0 run, what commonalities
from those two runs really stood out when they were able to make those big
jumps?  
MARCUS WEATHERS: They got out in transition on us a couple times, but the main
thing that we wanted to do is just stay together and stay positive throughout
the run. That's the one thing that Coach was telling us. He was telling us the
whole game that we had to win it on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Lamar, I know it's tough after a loss like this but this has been a
really good two-year stretch for you, for the program, very young. Talk about
the future of the program.  
LAMAR NORMAN, JR.: The future of the program, I thought it will be really
good. All we need to do is stick together, every stay positive and have a
level head, and we'll have a very good year next year.  
  
Q. Obviously a season of ups and downs. Just for you, what do you get
out of this season? Obviously the reserve role, starting today, just trying to
pick up the pieces and make the most out of it for yourself.  
LAMAR NORMAN, JR.: Just sitting back and analyzing things I need to work on on
the team, like make sure what to do better and things like that. Just learning
a lot. I learned a lot, but yeah.  
  
Q. Given that you like to pride yourself on defense, to see a 92 on the
opposing side means what with this game?  
COACH KEITH DRAMBOT: Well, I thought we played a little bit better in the
second half when we backed them -- when we backed off a little bit and quit
getting penetrated on so much.  
  
But every time we made a run we messed up a switch, and they made shots. They
are a dangerous offensive team because they can spread out and drive you, and
they have got good individual players, and you know, now that they are all
healthy, you know, they become difficult.  
  
But we didn't do enough to win, and you know, the interesting question was
just because you're young doesn't mean you're going to be good in the future;
you have to make some changes in order to be good.  
  
So until we're one of the top two or three defensive teams in this league,
we're not going to win the Championship, and certainly, we were one of the two
or three worst defensive teams tonight.  
  
So we got to get better. We got to be more mature. We got to be more even-
keeled. I know exactly what we have to do. We have to continue to hold them to
high standards and hold them accountable, but we made progress, but not fast
enough for me.  
  
Q. Even though Brown had 28, did you feel like you made him work for it?
And secondly, just thoughts on any possibilities of postseason tournaments.  
COACH KEITH DRAMBOT: For us, I mean, we could play in the CBI or CIT or one of
those, but I kind of -- I don't want to sound arrogant, but I kind of am I
high-expectation guy.  
  
So until Duquesne plays in the NIT or NCAA, I'm not really all-in on that. We
have to hold our guys -- we have to make them understand, and that's no
disrespect to those tournaments by any means. I've played in them before.  
  
But our guys have to understand what the goals are at Duquesne and to me,
those goals are pretty evident.  
  
Q. Given that it seems like that statement sounds like it's more of a
finality to the season, what do you get out of the season that you're able to
move forward, not just from today but the season as a whole through all the
peaks and valleys?  
COACH KEITH DRAMBOT: Well, I got another year of experience in the league. I
think I know the league pretty well now. I think I know what we have to do in
order to have better success.  
  
I think our deal's going to be pretty simple in the off-season. Like we'll
make no excuses. We'll go to work every single day. We'll quit talking.  
  
And you know, we'll be like Lamar Norman, who bided his time, worked hard
every time and it paid dividends at the end of the year.  
  
I think that was the difference in the game, is their maturity level versus
our maturity level. They handled the ebbs and flows better than we did.  
  
So ultimately, that's me and Coach Martelli, right. He did a better job
keeping his team more mentally mature than I did keeping my team more mentally
mature.  
  
Because really, that's what it came down to. It came down to runs, spurts;
runs, spurts; and they made them and we got a little flustered and put two bad
plays together in a row and they didn't when it mattered, and that's typically
what happens in games.  
  
Appreciate it.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 14, 2019

  

### [David Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36756)

### [Fatts Russell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34941)

### [Cyril Langevine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35055)

### [Jeff Dowtin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33200)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Rhode Island 76, La Salle 57  
  
COACH DAVID COX: Well, I thought that was a tremendous all-around effort by
our team today. I want to give a lot of credit to La Salle program and Ashley
Howard, who I think is a tremendous young coach. He had those guys fighting
all the way till the end.  
  
I through our guys stuck to the game plan today. On offense we played with
tremendous pace. We shared the basketball with 17 assists, and then
defensively, we limited their paint touches and forced them into shooting
quite a few three pointers which were contested. It was 35 three-point
attempts, which we didn't necessarily think was their game or what they needed
to do to win.  
  
Great job following the game plan and, you know, now we live to see another
day.  
  
Q. Cyril, what does this game mean to you coming off a game like this
playing against a tough team like La Salle?  
CYRIL LANGEVINE: It means a lot because it means we get to move on to the next
round. We shoutout their team. Obviously it's a good team but obviously today
we came out with a win. I just want to say it was a good game.  
  
Q. Fatts, any key you can point to to really get Cyril going right off
the bat?  
FATTS RUSSELL: There was no real key. Me and him in the pick-and-roll is I
think lethal. He reads me well and I read him well. It's just what we do on
pick-and-roll.  
  
Q. You have a chance to play VCU again. How fresh in your mind is that
loss down there a couple weeks ago?  
JEFF DOWTIN: It is definitely very fresh in my mind. We've been circling this
game since we knew our seed in the A-10 Tournament. It's going to be a
dogfight, but I feel like my guys are going to be ready for it.  
  
Q. Fatts, can you talk about how hot this team is playing right now over
the last five games, and what you guys have done to put things together the
way you guys have?  
FATTS RUSSELL: It's all confidence. We had a team meeting I think after the
Davidson loss and we told each other that we are not going to lack confidence
anymore.  
  
It started with us three right here, gathering the young guys together, and we
just told them we are rocking with them till the end. That's just how we're
playing lately.  
  
Q. Jeff, this can be a tough stage for a lot of teams coming in. Can you
speak to how comfortable you guys are playing in games like these?  
JEFF DOWTIN: Has to do with a lot of experience. We've been in the A-10
Championship these last two years, so we've been here before. We know the
position we're in. We know what it takes to win and we've got these three guys
right here that we're just going to go out here and lead our young guys and
hopefully just put them under our wing.  
  
Q. Over the weekend, you said Rhode Island is all about championships
coming into this weekend. What makes this group different than maybe the other
teams in the A-10?  
FATTS RUSSELL: We have three -- no, we have four guys on our team that
actually won a championship before. We're experienced and we know what it
takes to win championships.  
  
Q. Cyril, what does it mean to you to come close to home and have the
performance that you did today?  
CYRIL LANGEVINE: It's been awhile since I've been back home. Obviously my
family came out here so I know I had to go out there and play hard and stay
focused and try to get the win.  
  
But it's always a pleasure to come back home and play in front of the home
crowd.  
  
Q. The players have done this before, but this is your first postseason
game as a head coach. Any different feel today in any different thoughts
coming into a game like this?  
COACH DAVID COX: No, not at all. No, no. I've been a part of this program for
the last five years. We played in some big games, NCAA games. We've played in
championship games.  
  
So no, I prepared myself for this. I felt very comfortable today. The way
we've been playing basketball, I've felt comfortable with this group,
particularly these three guys, as well as Christion Thompson. I just felt they
had been locked in and they were going to play well today.  
  
So with that, using that as kind of a comfort zone, I came out here and felt
pretty positive.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about the confidence that this team has over the
last four or five games now in heading into this tournament?  
COACH DAVID COX: We have a tremendous amount of confidence, and again, I think
it started back with that Davidson loss, you know, where our guys started to
see the ball go in a little bit and they kept competing and kept fighting, and
ever, ever since then, the ball has started to go into the basket. As Fatts
mentioned, you know, they decided on their own that they were going to not
give in; that they were going to continue to fight; that they were going to be
as confident of basketball players as they have been in the past, and once
they made that decision, they have taken a big leap forward, and, you know,
this is the product of it.  
  
Q. Coach, we know how good Fatts is as a scorer. He's a microwave; he
can get hot, but as a facilitator he ties his career-high in assist. Did you
like him taking what the defense gave him?  
COACH DAVID COX: He did. I thought he did an outstanding job of just getting
downhill. He's so aggressive with the basketball and such a great scorer that
when he gets into the paint he causes people to come to him.  
  
When that happened today, he was making the right decisions, and I was really
proud of that effort. He had five assists and zero turnovers at the half and
we made a point of mentioning that to him. I just thought he had a good -- a
good overall game. I thought his defensive game on Traci Carter was really
solid, as well.  
  
Q. You seem to have great numbers whenever I'm in the building. Talk
about playing in a game like this in front of this type of crowd.  
COACH DAVID COX: Yeah, well, The Voice, you know what, I've always -- I'm
going to make sure that you're with me for the rest of this way. Does that
sound good?  
  
No, this building's been good. This building's been good to us. Again, what an
arena, the Barclays. It's an NBA arena, and I think our guys get up to play in
this particular arena.  
  
Q. It seems like T.J. has been more vocal on the sidelines, in
particular, since Coach Carroll has been sidelined. How important has he been
to kind of just keeping that consistency with your coaching staff and him
stepping up from director of basketball operations to interim assistant coach,
if you will?  
COACH DAVID COX: Sure. It's like the old one-man-down thing. You know, one man
down and everybody else has to step up. Not only T.J. but everybody on the
staff has stepped up.  
  
But specifically talking about T.J., you remember him as a player. He was a
grinder as a player and he's a grinder here as a coach. He's been tremendous.
Great communication ability with the players. He can relate. He's dove almost
into the scouts. He seems like a natural, so I'm really proud of him. He's
done a phenomenal job, just a phenomenal job.

COACH JEFF NEUBAUER: Our team's effort this afternoon was really, really good.
Just like it's been all year. This group has really competed. Unfortunately we
ended up, you know, we've been in a lot of close games. We won several of them
but this one's going to hurt.  
  
Really proud of our group. These guys sitting next to me really battled their
tails off. Our defense was really effective. We got the game to play out the
way we wanted it to at the defensive end, and we had a chance.  
  
Q. Antwon, for you, three of four from three, those last shots, big
shots and then you go to the line in a situation. What's going on in your head
knowing how important those free throws are?  
ANTWON PORTLEY: You know the game is on the line and just try to stay focus.
Focus more on your form than just the scoreboard and stuff like that.  
  
So I went to the line and when I was taking my shots, I was just focusing on
my form. Just glad that my last couple threes fell in from good looks, wide-
open shots from my teammates.  
  
Q. Nick, All-Rookie selection yesterday. Do you have thoughts on what
that means for you personally?  
NICK HONOR: I just give all my credit to God. Yeah, He's just blessing me
every day. Just thankful for that.  
  
To be honest with you, the Ws are way more than All-Rookie team, so much
rather have got the W.  
  
Q. Both of you guys struggled as a team this season. Jeff, you can
answer this, as well. How do you look at a season like this when individually
you guys both made big strides as players but in the end, to fall short.  
NICK HONOR: I would just say the season was -- for two words, is like growing
pains. We basically have a new team and just trying to get more wins.
Definitely a learning curve and I definitely believe we can be a tournament
team next year, so we'll just have to keep working, keep doing what we do.  
  
Q. Shooting 25 percent in the first half and 44 percent in the second
half. What was the adjustment that saw that kind of offensive success?  
COACH JEFF NEUBAUER: We were much more aggressive on the ball screens, so we
had more of a blast mentality.  
  
In the second half, we were probing too much, and it didn't create any
ignition for us. So just the fact that we were much more aggressive driving
the ball off of ball screens created better opportunities.  
  
Jackson, to answer your question, you know, the way I look at the season is
that our guys really competed, and I mean exactly what I said earlier. We were
in a ton of close games, and so I think the growing pains answer from Nick is
a really good one and this team will benefit from all the experience that we
had this year.  
  
Q. Onyi got in foul trouble early and picked up his fifth foul with 57
seconds remaining. What do you make of him today?  
COACH JEFF NEUBAUER: Yeah, Onyi had a really good afternoon. I know he didn't
score the ball very much but he was a presence around the basket and you look
at the fact that Richmond only scored 52 points; a lot of it had to do with
the fact that Onyi and Chuba were athletic presence -- presences, around the
hoop.  
  
Really proud of Onyi. He had some great moments earlier in the year and then
he kind of plateaued. Today was a good afternoon for him.  
  
Q. When you make your teams effort on Golden and Gilyard, the two guys
you highlight when you come into this game and both had tough nights from the
field and then how tough is it to stop, in addition to Golden, Cayo, who
really had a good game and they are playing off each other, how difficult is
it to stop them both?  
COACH JEFF NEUBAUER: So this is the best that we've guard ready Richmond in
four years. We beat them last year, and our defense last year in Rose Hill Gym
was really good, but this is the best.  
  
We did make a decision that we were going to put Cayo in scoring situation,
and he scored 15 points, and he is a terrific player. He's going to be even
better.  
  
But as a coaching staff, this is how we wanted the game to play out at that
end of the court. We just didn't score enough buckets at the offensive end.  
  
Q. And how much did it hurt you, once Onyi fouled out of the game, you
had the two shot blockers, one to help on the weak side, when you crowded
Golden, and you didn't have that once Eyisi fouled out.  
COACH JEFF NEUBAUER: Yeah, so I don't remember -- obviously I remember the
final possession. You know, maybe having Onyi in there helps. Having Onyi and
Chuba.  
  
But, you know, for us to get as many minutes as we did out of Onyi today, for
Chris Downing to step in and give us four really good minutes, I'm really
proud of our center position.  
  
Q. Just tell us about what it's like to be here as the local team to
represent New York and to be able to play at a conference like the Atlantic
10?  
COACH JEFF NEUBAUER: This is a great venue, and that's regardless of where
your team is from. To play in Barclays is really cool.  
  
I think for our freshmen who came in here today for the first time and they
were wide-eyed. They were in awe.  
  
It's a great venue to have our tournament. We're very lucky to be here in New
York, and I'm very lucky to coach in New York, so thank you.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Chris Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16304)

### [Jacob Gilyard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34887)

### [Nathan Cayo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36716)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
Richmond 52, Fordham 50  
  
COACH CHRIS MOONEY: Obviously I'm pleased with the win. Those games can be
difficult sometimes and challenging. But I thought that we hung in there. We
missed a ton of shots. You know, we finished with 18 assists, five turnovers,
14 offensive rebounds. Those are great numbers, but we missed so many shots
and when they played zone, it's tough to -- it's tough to just continue to
score two-point baskets as the zone shrinks.  
  
But I thought we were resilient, and continued to fight and probably played
one of our best defensive games of the year. Proud of our group and look
forward to playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Nathan, take me through what was going through your head toward the
end of that game, two free throws, to tie the game up, ball is in your hands,
two seconds to go. What's going through your head at that point?  
NATHAN CAYO: The ball was in Gily's hand. He just beat everyone on the court
and he usually gets that pass to me down near the basket, so I was trying to
get ready trying to shoot as quickly as I can.  
  
Q. What's it like being back here in the East Coast, or at least in the
northeast? You come back here; you grew up in the Philadelphia area. To be
able to be around your family and of course, to get a win today, and to play
tomorrow, what's that feeling like?  
COACH CHRIS MOONEY: Well, it feels great to win. We're so concerned with our
preparation and how we're trying to play the game that we focus on those
things, but it's great to be here.  
  
I think that the A-10 has us here and Brooklyn has been a great host and most
importantly we're excited about playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. You didn't have any time-outs obviously. What was your thought as you
were coming down the court?  
JACOB GILYARD: Just to get a shot off, obviously. We couldn't turn it over --
we couldn't afford a turnover right there. We just had to get something going
towards the cup because hour threes weren't falling, so just trying to make
sure we could get a shot off.  
  
Q. Did you think that guy was going to be there?  
JACOB GILYARD: I assumed he was going to be there naturally. He's usually
floating around down there somewhere. So just found him, luckily.  
  
Q. This was a physical basketball game from start to finish. Did you
ever picture yourself to be, I guess, in this type of moment? Were you
thinking to yourself, you know, this is what I signed up for, watching these
games as a kid, and then now you're the guy that takes that last shot and wins
it pretty much with no time left?  
NATHAN CAYO: I mean, I'm always ready to play any game.  
  
COACH CHRIS MOONEY: Short and sweet, man. (Laughter).  
  
Q. What do you do to keep things moving when the shots aren't falling
like they are. How do you keep the faith going?  
JACOB GILYARD: You want to answer this one?  
  
NATHAN CAYO: You go for it.  
  
JACOB GILYARD: You just have to grind it out. Usually this whole year, when
we've scored -- when we haven't scored a lot or shots haven't been falling,
we've been coming up short in those games. That's probably just because we
don't get stops. So today, we just had to grind it out and try to get stops on
the defensive end, and it worked out for us today.  
  
Q. Quick turnaround between the game tonight and tomorrow. Obviously a
lot of preparation for getting ready for Saint Louis, so what will your night
be like and what will your morning be like?  
COACH CHRIS MOONEY: One thing that's pretty good is we're in the late game
tomorrow so we're pleased with that. At least we'll have some time, not quite
a day off, but we'll have some time. And then we'll probably meet maybe three
times during the course of the day tomorrow.  
  
So we'll be together tonight, start to introduce scouting report and Saint
Louis and things like that and then probably breakfast midday and pregame meal
tomorrow, we'll meet.  
  
We considered maybe going to a gym to do a walk-through but it takes a long
time to get to the gym from the hotel. So I think we'll stay in the hotel, use
the ballroom and probably have three meetings during the course of the day
tomorrow.  
  
Q. You mentioned that Grant has been your leading scorer. I think you
said this to me at Media Day that you were really counting on Grant. Today was
an up-and-down type day. What are the things you're expecting out of him
against Saint Louis tomorrow?  
COACH CHRIS MOONEY: Well, you know, Grant's a great player. He's already
passed a thousand points in his sophomore season. I think in-conference game,
he's finished fifth in assists which is incredible for a 6-10 guy, and today
he had seven assists and no turnovers. Played a good defensive game.  
  
No, he didn't make shots like the rest of us, but he played a great game
tonight, and we'll expect him to be great tomorrow because we certainly need
him to be.  
  
Q. Obviously playing in a first-round game is not ideal foremost coaches
but to be able to kind of have that upper hand when you win a game to sort of
be a little bit more comfortable on that court tomorrow where Saint Louis is
getting their first run at it, do you feel like there's a big difference when
it comes to that kind of situation?  
COACH CHRIS MOONEY: Well, I think there is a little bit of an advantage. We've
played and we've been in there. Tomorrow will be much more normal for us,
recovery, meeting, talking about the game, maybe a little bit more familiar
when we take the court but I don't think that lasts very long.  
  
It's a good thing for our mindset and a good thing to look forward to but I
don't think it will last very long. We're going to have to execute and play
well against a very good, tough Saint Louis team.  
  
Q. I know this isn't the first time you've addressed free throws after a
game this year, but what's it do for your team and what do you try to
communicate here on a short turnaround to get that going for tomorrow?  
COACH CHRIS MOONEY: Well, it's been something that has really plagued us. We
have not shot great from the free throw line, and it has cost us in some games
and almost cost us today.  
  
So you know, you go back and forth between stressing it, emphasizing it,
practicing it and then sometimes, you know, kind of ignoring it or, you know,
knowing that it will get better or hoping that it will get better and giving
the guys confidence.  
  
But it's -- you know, that's not a good -- there weren't many free throws
tonight and to only convert 4-of-11, that's a recipe for not doing too well.  
  
Q. During the last time-out, did you set up something? Did you just give
the ball to Jacob and just let him go?  
COACH CHRIS MOONEY: That's what I should have done. But we had called a play
in the previous time-out that we didn't get to run because they missed the
foul shot and Grant got fouled.  
  
So we decided to run the same play which was to try to give Jacob a little bit
of an opening in the zone and have the guy who sets a screen flare out.  
  
But he was able to just get through there. He's incredibly quick and a great
passer and made a great pass to Nate.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Matt McCall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30687)

### [Keon Clergeot](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36710)

### [Sy Chatman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36711)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
George Washington 68, UMASS 64  
  
COACH MATT McCALL: Obviously very, very disappointed with the ending, that
it's over, and, you know, really looking back and seeing, you know, all the
things that have transpired up to this point that have gotten us at this point
in the season, and there's been a lot of losses over the last two years.  
  
And you know, to end it that way, I thought we had great effort. I thought our
guys really went out there and tried. Obviously undermanned, foul troubled, a
number of different things. But really, you know, it's disappointing.  
  
But I think that as a leader, as a coach, you've got to go through these
experiences to see exactly what your program needs, and it's never fun. But
you know, I think that our guys will become better, and we need a lot more
positivity in our program, in order to win, and win at a high, high level, you
have to get 12, 13, 14 guys that are completely connected and about all the
right things and are completely bought in with everything that we're doing.  
  
As far as the game, again, I thought we had good effort. I thought the
offensive glass really, really hurt us, and the free throw line, we did a poor
job at the end of regulation executing, twice. You know, drew up two different
actions there. One we were trying to get Carl Pierre coming off a wide screen
set by Rashaan and allow him to create a little bit there.  
  
And then was trying to get Keon off a double pick-and-roll end of regulation,
trying to get him in the lane and screen away from Carl for the shot. So did a
really poor job of executing twice there at the end of regulation.  
  
But again I thought our effort was really, really good. But the energy level,
the positivity in our program, you know, being 100 percent completely bought
in with everything we're doing, that needs to happen now.  
  
Q. Obviously their zone gave you some trouble a couple week ago. What
did you do well to shoot them out of that zone?  
KEON CLERGEOT: Really just we come out there to play hard at the beginning.
But then we just really just came flat at the second half. We just didn't keep
playing hard, but, you know, very disappointed that -- how it ended.  
  
Q. Keon, I'm sure the loss really over shadows the career-high 25. With
Pip out and Carl struggling and guys in foul trouble, did it seem like the
scoring load came on you today? Did it seem like you needed to pick up that
slack so to speak?  
KEON CLERGEOT: Really just play hard. That's just all my mindset, always been
my mindset. Just go out there and play hard.  
  
Q. How do you feel like your role has kind of evolved over these past
couple weeks, because obviously before Djery got here, you were playing a lot
of the five, and Djery comes here -- I know Coach is trying to find you some
playing time at the 4 and the 5. How do you think your role has evolved after
you've settled into this groove here?  
SY CHATMAN: I think at the beginning of the season I started off mainly
playing the five just because that was a spot they needed a person to play.
Once Djery came, they were trying to move me to the floor and working off
stuff like that. My role right now I think is to go in the game rebound, play
hard, go rebound, defend; so if I just do that well..  
  
Q. What happened on that final play in overtime where you grabbed the
rebound?  
SY CHATMAN: I came down on my ankle and ended up rolling it.  
  
Q. Did you get hit or anything going up?  
SY CHATMAN: I guess the refs didn't think I got hit.  
  
Q. Did you have some idea that you and Tre were going to get so much run
today and do you think it was kind of a big opportunity for you two freshmen
to grow on a stage like this?  
SY CHATMAN: Yeah, like we always talked about it, just like playing together
and all that.  
  
So like knowing that we're undermanned, like we knew we were going to play a
lot, and we just came into it the game focused.  
  
Q. Coach McCall was just kind of talking about sort of the importance of
this off-season coming up for this program. How do you kind of grade how
important this off-season is for you guys kind of building into next year?  
KEON CLERGEOT: Positivity. Bringing a lot of positivity.  
  
SY CHATMAN: I think this summer could be huge for us, the team. If everybody
gets better and we come to work over the summer, make sure we are going to
have a lot better result at the end of the season.  
  
Q. Judging from what you said in your opening statements, it seems like
you were alluding to possibly times during the year that everybody didn't buy
into what you were trying to teach and there wasn't always a positive
attitude. Could you expand on that?  
COACH MATT McCALL: I mean, you know, I look at a guy like Rashaan Holloway,
you know, and Pipkins and McLean, especially those three guys, those three
guys have been through a lot, and with the coaching change. Me getting hired
at the timing I did with everything that transpired and is really tried to do
as well as I possibly could to build trust with those three guys, and
especially because of them coming back.  
  
And then you add in an influx of other players, transfers, a couple freshmen,
and there was kind of a roller coaster year last year, and well, fast forward
into this year, and you have all these guys sitting out, and human nature is,
well, it's going to be easy because we have more guys.  
  
It's not easier. It's harder, and you have to have more buy-in and you have to
work harder unless you can snap your fingers and get to the Atlantic 10
tournament and think you're going to rope off five games in a row.  
  
And I think at times, maybe when it didn't go well or in my own individual
expectations as a player aren't met, it's easy to say, you're not bought in or
have a negative attitude. That's what you're dealing with 18-, 19-, 20-year-
old guys at times. Especially when you're dealing with rebuilding a program,
and that's what we're doing.  
  
I think for me as a leader, I've said this to these guys before that are at
every single one of our press conferences, I've been spoiled. I've been
spoiled. I was on a bench for two national championships. I've been an
assistant coach in the Final Four, SEC Championships. I was the head coach in
the NCAA Tournament. Won a regular season title and a conference title. I've
been spoiled.  
  
Sometimes you've got to go through this stuff to see exactly what needs to be
done, and that's where I'm at. Hasn't been fun. It's been the most challenging
two years of my life, but I've become a better coach and a better leader
because of it.  
  
And you know, we've got to have an influx of positivity in our program from
the staff to the players to everyone, completely bought in and in a foxhole
together that we're doing, and now we are a connected unit and now you can
take off and take off and talk about doing something special.  
  
Q. Better day today for the effort after up-and-down this season. Seemed
like Keon, especially, was really laying it on the line today. Do you think
that helped the rest of the team to see that from him?  
COACH MATT McCALL: Really, I thought -- I thought, you know, there was a lot
of guys that brought that effort. Keon brings that majority of the time.  
  
You know, I've known him since he was in the ninth grade. He's always played
the game with such a chip on his shoulder and so much passion. I was always
adamant when he wanted to come here after he decided to leave Memphis -- not
necessarily, because he's a talented player, but it was more about that, and
we need more of that.  
  
The other young man that was sitting right next to me, last year he's 17 years
old and playing in the championship game in the State of Minnesota and we've
thrown a lot at him over these last 12 months, and also adjusting to college
as a freshman; and his development through the year, I've been really, really
proud of, and going to be a big, big piece of this program going forward.  
  
He has that positivity that I'm talking about, and I thought he gave us a lift
early in the game. He got in foul trouble, but I thought everybody was into
it. I thought a couple mistakes we made there, the ball was going through the
net, which helped our energy level. But I thought these two guys, especially,
and our starting five, brought tremendous energy today.  
  
Q. You talked Monday about sort of wanting to kind of learn from the
Richmond game how to execute the zone. Obviously you shot them out of the zone
fairly quickly. What was the biggest difference in terms of how well you were
able to execute?  
COACH MATT McCALL: Yeah, we did a tremendous job executing versus that zone
and when they switched and went man-to-man we got stagnant. We were trying to
fire the ball in there to Rashaan. Their post doubles on him caused him to
have turnovers which allowed them to get out on the break some.  
  
But we've been executing man-to-man. We talk to these guys about when we're
running pick-and-rolls, you have to slow down and take a breath if you are at
guard. I mean, how many illegal screens did we have in the first half? Three
or four? You know, like, those guards have to stop, wait a second, have a good
setup and then come off the pick-and-roll.  
  
We were just in such a rush, but I thought we did a better job executing in
the second half versus their man. I just thought the last two possessions in
regulation we did a really poor job executing. We draw up on action, we are
trying to get a misdirection and hit JL at the elbow and have Rashaan wide
screen on Carl. It was either going to be Carl coming off for a shot or get
Rashaan a post-up; and we were trying to run a double pick-and-roll there with
the whole floor space to get Keon going to his right hand and then stagger
away for Carl, and we didn't execute either one of those.  
  
Then the end of the overtime we did a better job, and Carl got fouled there.
You know, we go 10-for-22 from the free throw line, and you know, they shot 36
free throws to our 22. That's a huge discrepancy but we can't go 10-for-22. If
we make six more and we go 16-for-22, we win the game.  
  
Q. Having kind of some of the young guys be -- get a lot of run out
there and throughout the course of the season kind of giving them the growing
pains, how much does that mean to those guys going into a summer where, you
know, a lot of development is possible?  
COACH MATT McCALL: This is the most important summer since I've been here in a
lot of different ways.  
  
There's just been so much going on and so much roster turnover over the last
two years. Who we bring into our program right now, with the guys that will be
coming back, this is a huge, huge summer. It's a huge summer work-wise. It's a
huge summer for us to become a real team, a connected team, where everybody is
pulling and everybody is rooting for each other.  
  
You know, it was tough losing Samba. Samba, like Keon, like Sy, brings this
energy level to us. Plays the game with such tenacity and ferociousness. You
know, him not being able to play these last six, seven games, whatever it was,
I think the last game he played in was Davidson which was a huge win for us.
Not having him down the stretch, I would have liked to have had him, one,
because he's a really good player. Two, for what you're talking about.  
  
But this is the most important summer since I've been here, as a head coach,
for our program going forward and it's time that this program take a huge,
huge step forward because we've been getting knocked back and getting our
teeth set in, and it's time that we march forward.  
  
Q. I feel like after each win this year you've brought up the assist
total in ball movement. To only get seven tonight, is that just a product of
the stagnant offense?  
COACH MATT McCALL: I'd love to see how many of those were in the first five
minutes of the game.  
  
You know, we missed some guys at times. We turned it over some there, on post
doubles when the ball was going into Rashaan. Had some bad, bad, bad
turnovers. Had some chances to make some game-winning plays down the stretch.  
  
You know, we miss a charge there on a baseline drive. It was a loose ball that
we didn't come up with. But I thought our ball movement was really, really
good in the first half and I thought their adjustment to go man-to-man, our
guys got taken off guard a little bit.  
  
But you know, again, that's an inconsistent team and to me that goes back to
culture. That goes back to buy-in. That goes back to being a connected team
100 percent, and I've said this a thousand times: I take ownership for where
we are, and we're going to get it right. We're going to get it fixed. We're
going to get it corrected, and you know, the 12, 13 guys that will be out
there for UMASS are going to be 12, 13 guys that have an unbelievable amount
of appreciation for the opportunity to play at this school each and every day.

# [ATLANTIC 10 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+10+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Maurice Joseph](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20779)

### [Maceo Jack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36705)

### [Terry Nolan, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36706)

  
_Washington, D.C._  
  
George Washington 68, UMASS 64  
  
COACH MAURICE JOSEPH: I want to give credit to UMASS first. I thought they did
a great job. They came out extremely prepared. We came out in our 2-3 zone
which was very successful for us in the first game, and they made some
tremendous adjustments, so credit to them for that.  
  
They shot us out of our zone really quickly. Clergeot came out, played really,
really well for them but our guys were gritty, when went down double-digits we
didn't waver, and continued to guard and we did a great job just weathering
the storm.  
  
We talked about every four minutes, just chop away at it, chop away at it,
chop away at it, and our guys did that, and so I am really, really proud of
them. It's a monster win for us.  
  
I told our guys, we've got to go 1-0, whatever's next. So UMASS was our Super
Bowl. Now we get a chance to compete against Mason again, and we're excited
about that opportunity,.  
  
So we're going to get back. We're going to prepare, try to get healthy, get
some food in us and get right back to the grind. Really proud of our guys.  
  
Q. Terry, you haven't played in the last couple games. How does it feel
for you to come out tonight after having the last games off and you put up 20
points and scored some key points for you guys, so you were able to move
forward?  
TERRY NOLAN, JR.: It felt great. I was battling a foot injury which I still am
today. I couldn't miss this game and let me team down. I'm just happy that we
got the win today.  
  
Q. It was mentioned they did come out 22-11 lead at one point. What was
kind of going right for them just in terms of having the shots fall and what
adjustments did you make, especially on the defensive end to hold them to
eight points in those last ten minutes of play or so?  
MACEO JACK: We switched to a man defense, and I was able to push them off
three-point line and we did a really good job locking in on that and pushing
them off that line; and therefore their shots weren't falling as well as they
were in the beginning of the game.  
  
So once we switched out of that zone, it was really successful for us and we
were able to go on a run.  
  
Q. It wasn't the crispest shooting for you guys. How much of today's win
can be, I guess, credited to your guys' defense and your ability to make stops
and get them off-balance?  
TERRY NOLAN, JR.: The entire game. We predicate winning on defense. Offense
wins games. Defense wins championships.  
  
Q. Even though you didn't make the shot attempt at the half, how
instrumental was it to gain the momentum going into the locker room and coming
out second half of the game?  
MACEO JACK: It definitely gave us some energy going into the halftime. We've
struggled coming out in the start of the second half, so that definitely gave
us a push in order to come out aggressive and come out strong and come out
with some force, and that was able to propel us to go on the runs that we did
and to play as hard on defense as well as we did. So it was definitely
instrumental.  
  
Q. You mentioned that UMASS shot you out of the zone differently. What
did they do differently to start the game for them to take advantage of some
of the holes in your zone?  
COACH MAURICE JOSEPH: They did a great job screening our top guys and then on
the overloads we didn't do a great job of Corralling ball screens and getting
out to shooters.  
  
You know, they ran some of the same plays. They tweaked some, but it was
mainly the ball screens on the inside top guy of our two-three zone and our
inability to navigate those ball screens.  
  
So we tried to get under them a couple times, but when you have Holloway
setting those screens, it's a tall task to get over them, get under him. He's
a big guy down there.  
  
So we transitioned out of it and went to the man and that's when we got on our
run. I think they scored eight points in the last 14 minutes or something like
that. So we did a great job kind of weathering the Storm after they came out
really hot.  
  
Q. You know, it was a little bit of a slow shooting night for you guys.
How much of that was Massachusetts having a really strong defense, and how
much of that was just unlucky shots not going or shot selection or things like
that?  
COACH MAURICE JOSEPH: I always think it's a little bit of both. I thought we
got some really good looks. I know Just got a wide-open one. He's not one of
our knock-down guys, but he got a wide-open look. We ran that play for Maceo
to get a wide-open look and he got that look. That's a shot that we've seen
him hit a bunch and just rimmed out.  
  
You know, Mel got a couple. D.J. got a couple. It was a little bit of both. We
got some good looks. We didn't force too many, I didn't think. A couple we did
but for the most part, I thought we executed and got good looks. We just
didn't shoot the ball terribly well; first time in this arena, getting on the
floor an hour before the game, you don't get shootaround time.  
  
So getting used to the background and balls and rims and all that kind of
stuff; you can make all the excuses in the world. Maybe that had a little bit
to do with it, but I'm just happy our guys defended.  
  
We can't control when the ball goes in the hole or not, but we can control our
attention to detail to the scouting report, our effort defensively, our grit,
our toughness, our enthusiasm with getting stops, all those things are in our
control and I thought we controlled those things after we got out of the zone.  
  
Q. Obviously going off of what you just said, everybody obviously wants
byes in these kind of tournaments, but can you stress the importance of
getting out there, becoming a little bit more comfortable and most importantly
getting a win on this court?  
COACH MAURICE JOSEPH: This time of year as you guys know, you have to go 1-0
and whatever's next. You can't worry about byes or seeds. You play the regular
season for that and at the end of the regular season, you evaluate everything
and attack with everything you have, and that's what we've been able to do in
these last three days of preparation leading up to this game.  
  
So we're just excited that we had an opportunity to come out here and I think
playing gives us an upper hand a little bit. You think about fatigue and all
that, but now that we have one under us, we're going to go and prepare for the
next one and try to go 1-0 again but the byes and the seeds and all that kind
of stuff, obviously you don't want to be playing on Wednesday.  
  
Nobody wants to be playing on Wednesday, let's be honest but that's where we
were. We had to attack where we were and attack that obstacle and we did that.
Really proud of our guys for winning on the defensive end and winning with
grit and winning with toughness because those are things we've been preaching
from day one.  
  
Obviously didn't shoot the ball well. We shot 31 percent but we limited them
to 35 percent shooting and we outrebounded them by five. You know, they had
more turnovers than we did, so we did a lot of really good things out of --
obviously we didn't shoot the ball well. But just proud of our guys, their
effort.  
  
Q. You talked about rebounding. What did you guys do so well to be able
to out-rebound them and to be able to get those offensive rebounds?  
COACH MAURICE JOSEPH: You know, going into this game, we watched the Richmond
game where Holloway had 28 points and 12 offensive rebounds and he was just --
we -- we played that for our guys and said, hey, we need five guys to rebound.
It can't be Marcus didn't there. It can't be just Javi down there. We need
multiple guys. We got to gang rebound. We got to have that mentality, every
time the shot goes up we can't let Holloway just play volleyball around the
rim because he's a load down there.  
  
It was a collective effort. When you look down the line, Mazzulla didn't shoot
the ball great but nine rebounds.  
  
Javi, tough task to guard Holloway, 11 rebounds.  
  
You've got D.J. six. Mac, five. Jus, eight. So we had multiple guys come in
and impact the glass, and that's what we needed. We needed a collective effort
on the glass, and we did that, because Lord knows you can't try to keep
Holloway off the glass by yourself. He's still a load and he's got 12
rebounds. We were scratching and clawing and hanging off his jerseys and doing
everything we could and he still got 12, so I credit that kid.  
  
I seen him transition with his body and become a really good player from when
he was a freshman. So you know, I'm glad our guys really got the message about
gang rebounding because we certainly needed it.  
  
Q. You guys start tomorrow facing George Mason again. Third time this
year you'll see them. How much is that familiarity of being able to see them
in action and having those games under your belt help prepare you for
tomorrow?  
COACH MAURICE JOSEPH: I think it helps a lot. Obviously they are going to be a
little fresher in terms of rest time from our last game, but the great thing
about tournaments and one-day preps and having played guys, teams in the A-10
season is you have familiarity. You understand their personnel, and we've
played these guys so recently that for preparation purposes, it's not going to
be a major adjustment. Like we just played them. So that's a silver lining for
us in this scenario.  
  
Obviously they beat us twice. I thought in their gym we played well in the
first half and we came out in the second half and had nine turnovers in nine
minutes in their gym, so we obviously didn't handle the ball well, but it was
still a close game. I thought we guarded really, really well and missed some
close shots.  
  
In our gym the other day, it came down to the glass and guarding the
basketball. We didn't do a good job there of keeping Livingston and Kier out
of the paint, so we're going to have to make some adjustments there.  
  
But now, the familiarity because of how recently we played them is a good
thing for us because now we can go back, get some food; hey, we just played
these guys last week, jump right into the prep and adjustments we need to
make, let's get some rest, recover and let's go attack tomorrow with
everything we have.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2019

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Zion Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36804)

### [Tre Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36243)

### [RJ Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36803)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 73, Florida State - 63  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Apologize, that's the longest net cutting in the history of
the ACC tournament, so I apologize. But it was a happy one.  
  
Very first thing, we would like to thank the city of Charlotte. They put on a
great tournament. I mean it was -- and we won, so no matter where it would be,
it would be pretty good, but Charlotte did a great job and this arena did a
great job. It's an honor for to us win. This is the best conference,
especially this year, and I'm proud of my guys. They beat three outstanding
opponents, and tonight was a physical, really hard-fought defensive game and
our guys played good defense again. So proud of them and you can ask them
questions.  
  
Q. Zion, this feeling that you're feeling right now to win an ACC
tournament, is this one of the reasons that you felt it was important to come
back and win this with your teammates?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yes, sir. Those six games I sat out, when you see your
brothers going to war battling and there's nothing you can do but sit on the
sideline and cheer, there's nothing wrong with that, but I'm not that type of
person. I want to be out there with them, and I made a commitment to them, and
I would be a bad person if I went back on my commitment.  
  
Q. Tre, your brother had a knack for playing his best in big games, and
tonight you kind of followed in the family tradition. Was there just a little
bit more juice tonight especially when you were attacking the basket?  
TRE JONES: I feel like it's just the will to win. All of us came here with one
goal in mind and that's to win, so especially in a game like today,
championship game, my brother's had my back. Even at the start of the game I
was struggling a little bit. They kept believing in me, coaches kept believing
in me and kept telling me just keep going, keep taking my shot. So with them
believing in me and trusting in me, those plays were able to be there and I
was able to make them.  
  
Q. Tre, again, your game, it looked like a different person in the
tournament where you were more aggressive looking for your shot and all. What
did you see in that? What's your thoughts on that?  
TRE JONES: With Zion being back, I mean, even when he was out, teams were
really doubling down on RJ when he was attacking things, so with Zion being
back, they leave me even more now, and so I'll have to be able to step up and
be able to make plays, even more scoring plays now so it can open up for them
to play their games as well.  
  
Q. RJ, Coach Hamilton said earlier that at a point in the second half
where Duke got the separation that his team couldn't match Duke's energy and
determination. You hardly substituted at all the second half. They're bringing
in wave after wave of fresh players. How can your team be the team with more
energy and more aggressiveness at that point in the game?  
RJ BARRETT: We really emphasized at halftime to come out in the second half
and really punch them first, so once we got that, we were able to kind of
sustain it through out the rest of the half.  
  
Q. When you look at that Florida State team, obviously they played you
guys tough in January, but how good is that team and what do you expect them
to do in March?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I expect them to be a very high seed. I would be
shocked if they weren't a three or four seed. And Leonard and I are really
good friends, you know, like he has a program there, he doesn't have a team.
It's built on great kids, a lot of kids, and playing good defense. And a lot
of tall kids.  
  
But they accept their roles and they play so hard. And because they can really
play defense, they will have a shot at anybody, and we had a very difficult
time winning tonight. I think they're really good.  
  
I think they're better -- we're better than when we played them and they're
better, but there's so many guys, not -- there are a number of guys who are
deserving of Coach of the Year, and I'm not knocking Tony, because his team's
so good, but you know what Leonard did was being 1-4, and what are they, 27-7?
You got to be kidding me. I mean to keep his team together and go through the
ACC, finish fourth, outstanding. Outstanding job.  
  
Q. Tre, early in the second half you guys went on that big run, mostly
fast break. I think it was 10 points in the fast break in that big run that
kind of tilted the game. What was happening there that you were so successful
to get out and run?  
TRE JONES: Right, we were able to get stops. Like we said before, we
emphasized at halftime to come out and deliver the first blow in the second
half. So I mean, both teams were a little fatigued from the past few games,
but we knew that if we were able to get stops and get out in transition we
would be able to wear them out.  
  
Q. Zion, you broke two very old scoring records tonight, the record held
by Art Heyman of 80 points in the tournament; you scored 81, had stood for 58
years. The freshman scoring record of 78 points set by Phil Ford had stood for
44 years. That's 102 years of records. Considering that you're on the bench
mending for a couple weeks, what's this tournament been like for you?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I mean, this tournament's been great. I mean we're ACC
champions. I mean, I think that if we didn't win it then the tournament
wouldn't have been great, so us winning this makes it great.  
  
Q. There have been games certainly this year where you guys have made
3-pointers, but the season numbers, they are what they are. How do you think
that has shaped who you guys are as a tournament team going into next week
where you play a game like tonight?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well we believe in our, we believe that we're a good
offensive team. Actually tonight I'm not sure how many games we have had where
all four of the freshmen were in double figures. And not many turnovers, and
it was very balanced. Usually like when Zion was out, RJ had to put up a lot,
and he's put up a lot the whole year. And then the two of them put up a lot
together, and then tonight, though, Cam hit a big three.  
  
Earlier in the year Tre was just happy running the team and did a great job.
He's still happy running the team, but he can score and we need that and he
knows that better now. So we're just more balanced and we have a lot of
confidence. They have a lot of confidence in one another.  
  
Q. Could you just elaborate on how does it feel to have Jay Bilas
present this award to you guys tonight and see this is basically the future of
Duke right here?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, it's not the future, it's the now. Unless you guys, did
you tell them something? (Laughter.)  
  
Well that's a nice surprise. You guys got together beforehand, right? I'm
going to start crying. Tears of joy. Tears of joy.  
  
Having Jay present it, they were the first team for me that won in '86, and we
have tried to continue to recruit that level of young man. And these guys are
not just terrific players, but they're really good guys and good students most
of the time. And they're balanced, and you know what, they have great
families. So they have been so easy to coach. Just like Jay and Johnny, Tommy
Amaker, Mark Alarie, those kids, so that's why I've been here so long. 39
years. Because it's -- you get good kids, it's a great school, and good things
have happened.  
  
Q. Even over the past few years as the teams have gotten younger,
there's usually been a Quinn, an Amile, Grayson. There are obviously veterans
on your team, but I'm pretty sure there isn't a senior who's been playing lots
of minutes, correct me if I'm wrong, and I'm just wondering if that first
presents an extra challenge for you. And second, talking about that team from
'86 then to now, I mean, how did you get from point A to point B?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I've written a couple books on that, so this is going to be
long -- but, no, all kidding aside, you have to adapt to how long you have the
kids. We get to -- we have, we recruit them early, we get to know them very
well. I really think the level of relationships that we have with this group
exceeds most of the teams that have been young for us. Not that they were bad,
but these guys give you an opportunity to do that. They're very secure in who
they are and they only care about winning. They have fairly decent senses of
humor, you know, most of the time, and so they're fun to be around and they're
really smart and they get it.  
  
I would say they're beyond their years as far as being savvy and they get it.
And wherever they play in the future the people will be lucky to have them.  
  
Q. Zion, you've said it several times that it's a dream of yours to play
at a place like Duke. When you're cutting down nets and holding up a trophy at
the end of a tournament, how does expectation meet reality for you?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: It's even better in reality because when you're a little kid
watching Duke on TV cut down nets, championship nets, and you say you want to
be a part of it, you say it as a little kid, but when you actually grow up and
get to be a part of it, I mean that's why we come to Duke, win championships
and try to get banners.  
  
Q. My question is for Coach.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Why don't we take one for the players.  
  
Q. For either RJ or Zion, whoever wants to answer it. What does it mean
when Tre scores the way he did tonight? What does it mean to the team? And
given his performance, are either of you surprised he didn't make First Team
all-tournament?  
RJ BARRETT: When Tre's doing that, they're really playing off him, so when
he's able to score like that, it definitely opens up the floor for everyone
else, and he has that ability. So for him to showcase it on a big stage was
huge.  
  
Q. You guys gave a great account of yourselves here during the
tournament. Do you feel like with the return of Zion to the lineup that you're
playing at or near your full potential going into post-season play?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You know, it's tough to determine what our potential is, and
like I don't have -- I try not to do that. I just want to have us play as good
as we possibly can play right now. Half the conference season we played
without our full complement of players. So to play these three games was so
important because we learned -- we remembered many of the things that we did
when we played together before, but we learned some new things.  
  
And if we can get Marques back, I hope sometime during this tournament, I hope
we're in this tournament for a long time, that will make us even better. But
they played and competed better and harder than I thought they would be
capable of doing right now based on not having -- and we only practiced a
couple times this week with Zion, and they pick it up. They pick it up.  
  
Q. You played a national schedule this year and pretty much the league
did too, the top teams. Have you ever seen a league or the ACC have a year
like it did? And how do you think it's going to do nationally?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, I would be surprised if we don't have three No. 1
seeds. You know, first of all, we played each other -- I know we played those
two guys five times and they played four times, so like Carolina and us, we
played seven games against No. 1 potential seeds and they played six, and you
know, over the long run both our programs have played tough.  
  
But this year to do that and for all these teams, these three teams especially
to do so well, it's remarkable. And I hope that we're all rewarded -- I
shouldn't say rewarded. I hope we get the due that we should get for that
level of achievement and because the league has achieved a lot.  
  
This team that we played should be a very, very high seed. Yeah, tough team to
play against, man. And then Virginia Tech with the job Buzz did with his team,
when Jimmy gets Tyus back, you know we're going to have some really, really
good teams. I hope they don't put us all in one or two regions, you know, so
we spread it out a little bit.  
  
Q. To follow-up, Kentucky's losing today certainly opens the door for
three No. 1 seeds in the ACC. You've watched this game many years, I think
it's only been done once; what would it mean to the prestige of the ACC to
have three No. 1s? And let me sneak in an NC State question; should NC State
be in?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, I would rather not say who would do that. That's what
you get for being sneaky. You're not usually sneaky, Bob. And so, I think for
the year, the race that was run, our three programs have been right there. We
weren't in the background moving up or whatever, we were right there, all
three programs. And we're finishing that way. I think these three programs
deserve that.  
  
That's not a knock on anybody, and they should talk about the Big Ten and SEC
and all that, because obviously they're really good. But this has been
unusual. It's unusual for this level, and I mentioned this, I don't know in
the last week -- we have, I think, four 25-game winning programs, and Virginia
Tech was just below. And in the conference 16-2, 16-2, 14-4, 13-5, and it made
it look like the league may not have been as good, but that's wrong. It just
made it harder for these teams to -- you bring up NC State; you're playing
against those teams, it's different. It's different, and you know if you have
to play -- like for us, if we're playing at Virginia, at Louisville, play
State and Carolina, not many teams do that, and you can talk about other
conferences, but it's grueling. It's grueling in our conference, and I think
it makes us all better, but we should get rewarded for that.  
  
Q. You mentioned the four freshmen starters all scored in double
figures. I want to ask you about the one starter who isn't a freshmen and
didn't score in double figures? It looked like Javin gave you a huge lift
inside.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I thought Javin had his best game tonight, especially against
their big guys. He rebounded well. He was talking on defense. He came up with
some -- he finished. He's played well, but tonight I thought was one of his
best games, if not his best game.  
  
Q. On the topic of 1 seeds, given what happened last year with UMBC, do
you expect 16 seeds to come into the tournament maybe with a little more
confidence that they can beat the 1?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I think teams come into the tournament, first of all, very
happy that they're in the tournament. And then once you decide, are you only
going to be happy? Or are you going to try to do something in the tournament?
That will determine how far you go in it. And that's at each juncture. Are you
happy to make it? Are you happy to go to the Sweet 16? Are you happy -- really
you should, if you want to be a championship program, you should only be happy
if you win it all. And that's so damned hard to do, but I don't think you're
going to get there if you're happy along the way. You got to be -- you got to
be proud of each win, but you got to maintain a level of hunger for the
ultimate prize, and our conference has done a good job of that.  
  
We have had, especially us and Carolina, National Championship programs, and
that's what I've learned along the way is not to be satisfied, not to
rationalize, that it's okay, because in these tough moments, rationalization
can be the biggest opponent that you have at times.

_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 73, Florida State - 63  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Tonight we lost to a team that had a spurt there in the
second half where they imposed their will, their physicality on us, and we did
not match it. That's to their credit. I thought they had a great game plan
during that period. They came out in the second half more determined, and I
didn't feel that we had that same level of focus and energy that they had.  
  
Obviously it was one of those that they have what you call superior athletes,
world-class athletes, and I thought in order to compete for us to be able to
compete with that level of athlete and skill, we had to be really on point,
and I thought there was a period where we were not quite on point.  
  
We had the score cut to five and we had four possessions, we missed a one-and-
one and got the ball right in the paint, and because of their athleticism and
their ability to contest shots inside, we didn't finish them, and that was the
last opportunity we had.  
  
We've got to give them credit; they're a legitimate National Championship
contender. My hat goes off to them. Mike always -- he always has those guys
playing at a high level, and tonight the best team came away with the victory.  
  
Q. It seemed like in the second half most of your jump shots were short,
like it just seemed like you ran out of some energy. You shot 25 percent; was
there anything that Duke did defensively specifically?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I thought they did a very good job with the ball pressure,
probably the best that we faced all year, and that kind of took us out of
rhythm because I thought Jones did a tremendous job of keeping heat on our
point guard, and then I thought that gave them a little bit more of an
opportunity to pressure our wings, and it kind of took us out of rhythm where
we played -- I think three of the last four teams played more contain, almost
pack line type defense, and that was tremendously different, a different type
of style than we played, and I didn't think we adjusted.  
  
I didn't think our cuts were quick enough with the ball pressure, and they did
a great job of getting us a little further out on the floor, and then it
wasn't the jump shots that I was concerned about, it was those opportunities
that we had going to the basket where we had it right there at the rim where
we just couldn't finish because of their ability to contest and change our
shots.  
  
That's what great teams will do, and you got to put them in the category of
being a great team.  
  
Q. Congratulations on a great effort by your team during this
tournament. I thought you guys acquitted yourselves well. I know you wanted to
take home a W to Seminole Nation and of course the local folks here in
Gastonia, but didn't quite happen. How big a deficit was it for you not to get
more production out of Koumadje? Was that a big factor?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, we have had plenty of games that we've won the way we
played tonight in terms of our rotation. They went small, and he just didn't
match up with them having a smaller perimeter-type player for him to defend.
And we have made those adjustments all year long and we've been just fine, but
it wasn't the lack of Koumadje, it was more of the pluses of the Blue Devils.  
  
Q. No one knows what the selection committee will do, but with Kentucky
losing today, that would seem to create the possibility that the ACC would get
three No. 1 seeds. How would you feel about that, and what kind of a
confidence boost would that give your team to know that you played -- you beat
a No. 1 seed and played with another one seed tonight?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, I think we are fairly confident because we have had a
pretty good year. We can boast that we beat the ACC regular season champs, the
Big Ten regular season champs and the SEC season champs. However, that won't
do any good once we get in the NCAA tournament. I wish we could use some of
those points, but to be serious, that's a strong possibility.  
  
But we have the new evaluation formula that none of us really know exactly how
that works. We're having conversation because this is March Madness and
everyone's making their predictions like they know exactly what's going on,
but none of us will be in the room, and I'm still a little confused about the
quad system and how they're going to evaluate it.  
  
I think we have done enough to make it to the NCAA tournament, and quite
frankly to be honest with you, I think the teams in our league that will go,
make it to the tournament will represent us very well. I wouldn't be surprised
at the end of it to see more than one team from the ACC in the Final Four. I
think we are just that good and that well-coached and loaded with talent.  
  
But from a -- I have, I wish I could speak to that. I've tried not to allow
myself to get too involved because it would confuse me, I'm just kind of more
concerned about what I can control and that's trying to get a team back up
again who I thought they had a great year but just came up a little short.  
  
Q. Talking about getting the team back up, you've had a real good run.
Moving forward, I mean obviously you had good success in the tournament last
year and have had some recent success. How much do you draw from that? And
obviously you've had a good end of the season minus maybe tonight.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Every team takes on a different personality, and I'm
concerned that this is another opportunity for us to grow and mature and learn
that we have to adjust. But when have you a team that works all -- they come
together, they care about one another, and you don't go out and play quite as
well as you had hoped, but you are playing against a team that's really put it
together for 20 minutes and puts you back on your heels, you got to be
concerned about how you manage that, and that's what my most concerns are.  
  
Yes, I think we had a good year. I think that we have potential to be a
challenging match-up for most people once we get in the NCAA tournament.  
  
But that's one thing about the NCAA; that's why they call it March Madness,
because anything can happen. But we have experienced that all year long in the
ACC where just about every game is decided by four points or less almost and
we played a lot of overtime games, and so I'm just looking forward to finding
out where we are, where we're going, who we're going to play and let the chips
fall where they may.  
  
Q. You traditionally play about as deep a bench as anybody. Duke barely
substituted in the second half. Was it part of your game plan to try to wear
Duke down in the second half, and are you surprised it didn't happen?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: We play -- we try to come as close as we can to being who we
are. We played as many players as we felt that we could play tonight and give
ourselves the best chance to win.  
  
Duke's a very, very good basketball team. They have -- I read somewhere they
might have three guys that might be selected in the top 5 of the draft. I
don't know if I've ever seen or heard anything like that. All on one college
team. They have had some challenges with Zion being hurt and so on. They
probably had to make some readjustment.  
  
They're a good basketball team, even without their center. You know, they're a
good basketball team, superior athletes. The game was not as fast a pace of
maybe as some of the games they played, some of the games that we played, and
they did what they had to do to win the game.  
  
I think you can philosophically try to pick and choose what made the
difference in the game. We just got beat by a team that had a little better
talent, and they played a little better than we did tonight. I mean, that's I
think the end of that story.  
  
Q. This event is almost as old as you are, and Zion Williamson just
became the fourth freshman, only the fourth freshman ever to be the MVP.
You've been around a long time; how do you put his talent and excellence in
perspective through the eyes of a guy who has seen a lot over the years?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I tell you, he has to be one of the top five best athletes
that I've ever seen on the basketball court. He reminds me of, you remember a
name I'm going to bring a name from the past named Henry Logan. Do you
remember him?  
  
Q. Barely.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Barely. You were was a child when he played. Well, you heard
of Michael Jordan? This guy, he's a world-class athlete. His quickness, his
speed, his strength, his power, his ability to stop and start and change
direction, how fast he gets up, he changes things. I mean, and it's hard to
match that level of special athlete.  
  
And he deserves the recognition that he's getting. He's a great guy,
competitive, plays with -- loves to play. He makes everybody around him
better, and our hat goes off to him. So you can put him down as one of the
greatest athletes that ever has ever come through the ACC, and there have been
quite a few of them.  
  
Q. You got Duke's lead down to five late in the game and Zion got his
fourth foul. It was a big call, wiped away a basket, and he's got four. And
then for whatever reason you couldn't get the ball in the basket. What was it
like out there? I mean from your standpoint was it fatigue? Obviously they
stepped it up defensively, but can you describe what it was like trying to go
against that defense and get the ball to go down?  
TERANCE MANN: I just think we got good looks and didn't execute them. We got
what we wanted from the drops and the time-outs and we just didn't finish
them. I don't think it had anything to do with fatigue. There was bodies on us
and we just didn't finish. And we missed, I think, the front end of a one-and-
one, so that was key, too.  
  
MFIONDU KABENGELE: I agree. We had some good looks, just didn't finish
properly. Coach just did a great job drawing up great plays to minimize the
lead, and we just didn't finish.  
  
Q. Terance, obviously a disappointing result in the end, but when you
look back on this tournament and all the success you guys have, what are you
going to take away?  
TERANCE MANN: Definitely experience and use that leading on to this next
tournament next week. We had a good run, gave a good fight, didn't come out on
top but we're just looking forward now to this next week and the tournament.  
  
Q. Duke has not shot the ball well all season from three. They did not
tonight. Why do you think they were able to overcome that just in terms of
being a team that has not lost a lot of games even as they're susceptible to
bad three-point shooting?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I think they're very well-coached, and Coach K has done a
great job of adjusting his schemes to match his talents. And they scored 42
points in the paint. Superior athleticism, quickness and speed that challenges
your ability to keep them in front of you.  
  
I think Jones is such a smart -- I thought he had an exceptionally good game
tonight. He hit a couple of, he hit one shot but he hit a couple jumpers, and
he took the ball to the basket. I thought he did a great job of running the
team.  
  
I just think that that's who they are. They have the ability to get put-backs
and tip-ins, and Zion can miss a lay-up, but he's almost back up tipping it in
quicker than anyone can realize the shot's been missed. He's just a superior
athlete with an unusual uncanny way of following it up. And I thought we did a
-- he has the ability to make tough shots.  
  
You have players who can make open looks like most players can, but he has the
ability to jump so high and move the ball around and has good hands and good
touch, he finishes at a high rate. I think that makes it easy for him to be
able to do things. And then when he does that, he draws so much attention that
now he is going to draw two or three -- at least two guys going to the basket,
which now that means someone's going to the basket naked to tip the ball in.
They're really, really a hard match-up.  
  
We thought that we could have done a pretty good job, a much better job, but
tonight you just got to give them credit. They have a chance to win it. I
think we will learn from it and I think we're going to be better as a result
of playing against this level of caliber of team.  
  
Q. Obviously three games in three days, but how important is it going to
be to go back to Tallahassee and get some rest and get healthy before the
tournament?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, we have a plan that we'll talk to our guys about, no
doubt about that. But I think that physically we'll be fine, I just want to
make sure that mentally and emotionally that we're getting that type of rest,
as well, and maybe some growth and maturity with an understanding of how to
appreciate the success we have had so we can draw from the experience of the
season but also that we can grow and improve from the lack of our ability to
match a superior team as we did tonight. Hopefully we can grow from that,
mentally, emotionally as well as rest our bodies up physically.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Cam Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36842)

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 74, North Carolina - 73  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well if you didn't care who won the game it was an exciting
game, but I don't know that either team played exceptionally well. They were
really hard to cover. The guy that's been hurt came back and put on his
superman jersey again and was incredible. It's such a blend of strength and
power and quickness that we couldn't stop him getting the basketball inside
and going to the basket. At the end when they were going to the free-throw
line we called a timeout with 12 seconds. They didn't have any timeouts left
at that time so we said if he makes both of them we'll run a play for three.
If he doesn't make both of them we need to attack the basket and they just did
a great job defensively and we didn't have a chance to attack the basket. But
4-27 will usually get you beat if you shoot that from three-point line. We
rushed them a little bit and I think you got to give their defense credit
there.  
  
It's hard right now because our kids really fought like crazy, but they won
and that's the bottom line today.  
  
Q. Can you go through the sequences both on the one where you missed the
three and then on that last play what you saw and how that all unfolded.  
CAM JOHNSON: On the play that I missed the three it was a call, I trying to
get Coby back door, they covered it pretty well. I ended up got the space I
wanted and when the shot left my hand I could have swore it went down. It felt
great coming off the hand. I could have bet a thousand dollars right there
that that shot was falling but it just didn't. Sometimes that happens,
sometimes that's the difference between winning and losing. Coby's next play
looked like it had a chance when it left his hand. Nass had a chance on the
tip and just it's crazy, just a couple little plays that don't go your way.
And we tip a ball a couple plays before and it winds up in the other teams
hands for a layup. I thought our guys fought hard today, obviously we could
have played a lot better and we'll kind of use this as fuel for what's next.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: The play he's talking about when two guys fought for it and it
bounced on the floor and their guy picks it up and lays it up. And I would
think that was going to be the only time down the stretch that we had the ball
and the lead at the same time, but it bounced their way.  
  
Q. Are you a little relieved that this is finally cover that you can
finally focus on the next thing and the hype around Carolina-Duke is just
done.  
CAM JOHNSON: No, never. There's no relief when you lose a game. And this was
one that we wanted to win, this is one that we thought we should win, this is
one we could have won. So there's no relief there, there's no relief this is
over. This game is important to us and it will hurt for a little bit, but we
just got to refocus and then move on and get ready for what's next.  
  
Q. You guys got to hear a lot about Zion not playing in the first two
games. What did you make of the impact that he had and how much did that alter
the matchup between what you had seen in those first two matchups versus
today?  
CAM JOHNSON: He definitely adds a different dimension to their team. He's a
really good athlete and he does a lot of things that they don't have without
him, so it kind of changes the way they play offensively, definitely. And it
changes the way they attack. But besides that they ran the same kind of sets
and we kind of got the same kind of shots we wanted the first two games. So
he's a great player and he definitely adds something to their team, but that
wasn't really the focus for us this game. The focus for us was coming in and
doing what we wanted to do and doing what we know how to do.  
  
Q. Cam, you guys had a great start were up 13 then Zion hit a couple of
shots. They put Goldwire in the game, and seemed to get energized defensively.
Did you, could you tell a difference in the amount of pressure they were
applying defensively at that point in the game after he hit those shots and
Goldwire came in?  
CAM JOHNSON: They did ramp up the pressure a little bit as the first half
wound on, but we practice that stuff. We practice that. We could have handled
it a little bit better and obviously hindsight being 20/20 there's since
things that we would have changed, there's things that we would have done
differently. We would have played late clock offense a little bit better. But
we went out there and we were fighting the whole time. I don't really think
there was many points in the game where we let up and stopped fighting and we
knew that's what it was going to be, a fight and unfortunately we came out on
the wrong end.  
  
Q. You've seen every other team ranked in the AP top-5. Is it your
belief that the ACC should get three No. 1 seeds?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I really never get into that kind of thing, I really don't. I
can't tell you right now more than one location for the first rounds next
week. I really just try to coach my team today to play the best that we
possibly could today. Zion did have a big influence on the game, but the
injuries are part of the game as well. I can go back and many times tell you
that we have had injuries that really hurt us and Zion being hurt really hurt
Duke, but it was still Duke-North Carolina. He made some big time plays down
the stretch that they didn't have the last couple games. One year we didn't
have Ty Lawson in our game against Duke. It's gotten a lot of attention
because he's, he's very gregarious. I mean he is an animal out there and in a
good way. But still, the bottom line is that you play and try to do the best
you can today. I have no idea, I don't even know what the hell NET means.
Okay. So let's be honest, I'm trying to coach my team. And what I will tell
you is that, I don't know how many, but we have been to several Final Fours,
several. We have never won a tournament championship but one time. So our
season's not over. We just got to regroup and play better and understand that
we didn't play well enough to win today. That's the bottom line, we didn't
play well enough to win and congratulate them and move on.  
  
Q. They attacked almost exclusively through Zion in that last several
minutes, without Garrison in there you know what they're going to do, what
could you, what were you trying to get on defense for him?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well the next best defense for us is if you don't have Garrison,
who is a really good good defender, is your best athlete and that was bringing
Nassir in the game. He's too quick for Huff, too quick for Sterling, but
that's part of the game. You've got to adjust to other people and their
strengths and our weakness and our weakness, I mean our strengths and their
weaknesses. But he's a big time player. I mean, I think I saw him play more
than anybody else in the country the last two and a half years. And so I was
glad to see that he wasn't playing those two other times, I had seen him play
enough. I knew what he was. But again it was Duke that beat North Carolina
today. I mean I don't even remember who it was that picked that ball up off
the floor and laid it up. Who was that?  
  
Q. Goldwire.  
ROY WILLIAMS: Goldwire? That's a pretty big play. All right. That's a pretty
big play right there. But I think other than that, every point down the
stretch, I think Zion scored everyone of them down the stretch.  
  
Q. You often talk about the little things that Garrison Brook does, you
had gotten I think six points in a row and taken the lead and then he real
quickly got his third and fourth fouls. After that I noticed it could have
been coincidence, but I noticed a lot of threes go up, even though you were
4-27. Does your offense function differently when he's not out there setting
screens?  
ROY WILLIAMS: A little bit, probably, but not too much. We shot bad shots in
the first half, my God, we thought it was a three second shot clock. I mean,
if you go 4-27 guys you deserve to be beat. I mean, come on, let's be honest
about the whole thing. Our great teams or this team when they have played
their best games has either been one of two things, we really shot the ball
well or we had good balance. At Duke we played them and yes it was without
Zion, Luke Maye spins around to lay the ball up, and I think that was when it
was we either one down or one up and Zion blocked the shot. But you still got
to play. We had 62 points against them in their building in the paint. Today
they outscored us in the paint 50-38. You live by the jump shot, you die by
the jump shot. But their defense forced us to be impatient with the ball. You
should never just rely on jump shots. I never seen a team that relies on jump
shots to win everything. Never. Maybe Villanova last year but they scored
inside as well.  
  
Q. With six minutes left in the first half after you had the lead and
you lost it, was it your bad shot selection or their defense or combination?  
ROY WILLIAMS: A little bit of both. They got up into B-Rob one time, they
dropped the ball out of bounds, they got up into Cam and they got two
turnovers, Goldwire was important too. I told them that as we went through the
line shaking hands, he was important to their team. I don't want to talk for
Mike's team, but I would think he would probably think the same thing. But
when they're pressuring you, you got, you have to attack and we didn't attack.
We took the easy way out and took quick jump shots and we didn't shoot the
ball worth a darn and if you don't -- our team, if we don't shoot it well, it
makes it really difficult for us.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [David Nichols](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36834)

### [Phil Cofer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35069)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Florida State - 69, Virginia - 59  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: It was obvious that our kids were really locked in for this
game and a lot of it is because we have such a tremendous amount of respect
for the job that Tony does and the legacy that he's built there at Virginia.
They have an offensive system that obviously is extremely difficult to defend
because they have so many options and they have great shooters that any time
you make a mistake, they make you pay. And that's, that goes all the way back
to Tony's father with that system. I'm very familiar with it and it's very
difficult, but I thought our guys were locked in and trying not to give them
at least the easiest opportunities, at least make them work for the shots that
they had and our guys, it was difficult, we played a lot of guys, they
expended a lot of energy, and that's as a result of the quality of the team,
the system and the job that they have done over the years. On the offensive
end, we basically felt that because they are one of the best defensive teams
in the country, that we had to do things a little different than what we have
done in the past and we put in a couple different sets, just so that we could
get some movement and get the ball inside. Now I think that the combination of
the respect we had for them and our guys being locked in executing offensively
and defensively gave us an opportunity to win a very important game for us.  
  
Q. First of all congratulations on a great win. You had a good game
plan. What did you learn from the game January the 5th that were you able to
carry over to tonight?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: We had a lot of issues in that particular game. Phil hadn't
practiced, he had come back from an injury, he was trying to get his health
back and he didn't practice. Phil, Terance didn't, we didn't know Terance was
even going to play until he warmed up to the point where we had put PJ Savoy
in the lineup because we didn't think Terance was going to be available
because he didn't practice. MJ Walker had gotten a bumped knee, had missed two
games and came down with the flu. Trent had come down, no Terance had come
down and bruised his heel and Trent was suffering from turf toe. And we all go
through those things. Now they totally outplayed us, they out-executed us they
were much more prepared, we were not a very good basketball team that
particular day. So I'm not real sure that represented the progress that I
thought that we have made since then. But to their credit, it was a two-
possession game with four minutes to go in the first half and we just fell
apart. It went from a two-possession game to a 17-point deficit and we never
could get over the hump. They actually beat us worse than the score indicated.
They put their subs in the game and so we just didn't totally didn't get
embarrassed, we scored about eight points and I think Tony just felt sorry for
us and allowed us to get a couple buckets so we just wouldn't look like we
were destroyed. But really they outplayed us every way, we weren't prepared,
we hadn't really practiced and it was just one of those games that, in college
basketball it happens and the day gave us, we were pretty healthy today and I
thought it represented the progress that we have made during the season.  
  
Q. You guys got off to that 1-4 start, but you've only dropped one game
in the last 53 days. Other than being healthier, what's different, what
changes have you made that are allowing you guys to be more successful in the
second half of the season?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well we started the season off and didn't have Phil at all
for seven, eight weeks. He was our leading scorer returning from last year.
Then when he came back it was a little cumbersome because he wasn't, he was
healthy, well enough to play, but he wasn't in good enough shape and so it was
a lot of indecision. Who is going to start, how many minutes you going to get.
And we were, we had five new guys who had not played with us before that we
had to integrate into our system. And we play a lot of guys, so it was a
little more challenging for us to get in sync early because we're not playing
seven or eight guys, we're playing 11 and sometimes 12 guys because we wanted
to have a full compliment of guys with experience once we got into February
and March. So we were not a very good team. I thought that the Duke game
really, I didn't think we handled that emotionally. I thought that that took
a, five guys who had never played, other guys who now were taking on different
roles, this is the first year Trent was starting, first year that Koumadje was
starting, first year that MJ was starting. And so we were going through a
development, we were growing and we were just growing and developing and I
think that our play showed that. We were inconsistent, we were not shooting
the ball very well, we were not defending very well because we were playing a
lot of guys and when you are playing that many people it takes a little longer
to get in sync. But now towards the end of the season I think that we started
getting a little better and I think that, I also think that the 1-4 start
brought us closer together. I thought it created a mindset that, hey look, we
got to get busy. This is important to us. And our guys kind of grew and
developed and I think that's one reason why we have the culture that we have
now. Our guys really cheer and pull for each other.  
  
Q. Last week you told us to put in the paper that there's, that you
don't have any tickets to the folks in Gastonia. Tomorrow do you think you
might have a couple extra tickets available for this one?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: No, because if they were not supporting me prior to this
game, I'm not going to take any phone calls.  
  
(Laughter.) This is a business trip. I wish I could stay around to go over to
Tony's Ice Cream and get some butter pecan ice cream and one of those good hot
dogs with that good chili.  
  
Q. Most people would categorize this as an upset, what would you
categorize this win as?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I don't think there are any upsets in the ACC anymore. I
think you guys categorize them as upsets. We're kind of an unknown team, not
very many people felt that we could even have a chance to win this game. I
mean that's part of the journey that we're on. When you're in a conference
with the quality teams that are in the ACC, and you're a team that's trying to
find a way to get into that hierarchy, it's challenging. And so sometimes you
get overlooked and you don't get sometimes the proper respect, but that's, one
thing about respect, you have to go earn it and hopefully this gives us an
opportunity to earn a little bit more respect and maybe people will look, have
a little better feeling about us in the future.  
  
Q. David, in that, there's a 13-1 stretch there in the middle of the
second half where you sort of in part took over that game. You backed somebody
down, you had a drive. Can you talk about that stretch and was that something
that coach told you to go do or is that something you did on your own, was
that part of the strategy at that point in the game?  
DAVID NICHOLS: We're just playing connected basketball, we're doing a good job
of driving the ball downhill. Phil, Terance, MJ, Trent, just getting the
defense to really spread out and open up lanes to attack. Raiquan did a
tremendous job doing that and then just getting off the ball early and lanes
were just opening up and I was the fortunate one to get the ball when the
lanes opened up and I just drove to the basket.  
  
Q. For all three of you. What does it mean for you guys being in the
title game tomorrow for Florida State, first time since 2012?  
DAVID NICHOLS: It's just one of our goals this year was our goal when we
started the first day of this tournament when we started ACC play to put
ourselves in this position to be in the championship game, so we're excited
and we're ready to just prepare for whoever we have to play.  
  
PHIL COFER: I think with us I think we kind of knew, I guess coming up this
year we got high expectations. And the main thing was just keeping our head on
no matter what and win or losses and just playing through anything and just
trusting these coaches.  
  
LEONARD HAMILTON: This is the third time we have had an opportunity to play
for the championship. We won it once and we lost to Duke, I think the year it
was -- I can't remember what year it was -- a long time ago -- and we were
fortunate to win it in 2012. And like the guys say, every team in America
starts off wanting to win a championship. Every team that's in the conference.
And we were one of those teams. We felt all along that we were capable, but we
had to go and earn it. And I think it was an ideal situation for us because we
had a chance to play one of the premier powers in the country that probably
would have been ranked number one in the country Monday, had they won the
game, but they're definitely top three or four team in the country and we're
trying to carve out a little niche for ourselves so it gives us an opportunity
to play against a good team and we were successful and playing for the
championship was our goal at the beginning of the year and I feel fortunate
that we are here but now we got to go get some rest and enjoy this for a
minute and get ourselves mentally and emotionally prepared to go play a great
team, because either one of the teams that win it's going to be a tremendous
opponent.  
  
Q. You mentioned you're going to enjoy this for a few hours but this is
for Phil and David. Tomorrow you're going to go up against either Duke,
Carolina, two teams you are very familiar with, just your thoughts on and not
just playing for a championship but playing against one of those two programs
who are at the top of their game right now.  
PHIL COFER: I think the main thing is just March Madness and stuff like that
we pretty much just kind of our game plan is just going out and giving it all
we got and I think just all the quick turnarounds you can't really do much of
scouting or going back to scouting reports, main thing is just trusting these
coaches and be able to just watch a quick film and the main thing is just
coming out and playing hard.  
  
DAVID NICHOLS: It's a great opportunity and I know our coaches are going to
have us ready, our green team guys, they're going to have us ready with the
scout and preparation, and just got to go back, rest, watch film, and get
ready for Duke or North Carolina, just two great programs and it's going to be
a great opportunity.  
  
Q. Florida State, you guys are an unusually long team, you're big at
every position, obviously I'm sure your opponents noticed that. I was
wondering if that's something you guys notice while you're playing that you
tend to be like longer than the other team and if that affects the way you
play?  
PHIL COFER: I think with us I think the main thing is our defense, I think it
kind of does that for us. And I think just ball pressure, being able to just
get down and dirty on defense and the main thing with us is our junkyard
defense and we kind of take it in each and every practice, being able to just
have high hands, long arms, a lot of times try to get steals and deflections
and those are the main things that win games for us.  
  
DAVID NICHOLS: Oh, yeah, we definitely try to use our length to our advantage
get in the passing lanes, getting deflections, Coach CY preaches having high
hands at all times and he'll just say it over and over and over again, so he's
out there reminding us how tall and how long we are.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Kyle Guy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32835)

### [Ty Jerome](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34923)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Florida State - 69, Virginia - 59  
  
Q. For either of the players. Florida State, their length and their
height how much do you think that disrupted what you wanted to do
offensively?  
KYLE GUY: I think they're a very athletic team very long like you said. It did
disrupt us a little bit and we'll watch the tape and I think it was very
evident what we needed to fix and we'll be ready come next week.  
  
TY JEROME: They were just the tougher team tonight. More physical tonight. All
of it.  
  
Q. How do you get your team ready for post-season now?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, well I think grow from this experience. We had some
chances to win the game. I think we went up one. But Florida State played
well, they defended well, they were sound and tonight they were the tougher
team, or more physical -- they're physical that way. So we look at the things
we can clean up and you always have a growth mindset, that's the way it is.
Get our rest and get ready to go. And again the play on the glass, was just a
lot of areas that you look at that will be good on tape to grow and then
prepare for wherever we're at in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. What lessons did you learn both yesterday and tonight that you can
carry on and use as good knowledge for moving into the NCAA tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: Well, I think when you get into this kind of setting, the
possessions matter. So you can't have empty possessions or some of the things
that, I don't know if you want to say self-inflicted wounds, but if we miss a
block or we miss a coverage we're not going to be perfect. But I think that we
have just been, these guys have been amazing all year and we have always found
ways to pull it out. And sometimes that's a good reminder when you can't pull
it out, we got to tighten the screws in other areas and be ready. But hat's
off to Florida State. That's a well-coached, good team. Nichols was so good
tonight, even at times when we did guard him he just made some shots in our
face and their length is noticeable.  
  
Q. What did Florida State do differently tonight than you guys did back
in January?  
TONY BENNETT: It was quite awhile ago, I think they shot it better. They were
so balanced in their scoring. We probably didn't, obviously did not shoot it
as well and I think they defended, they were a little tighter on us and played
a more physical game and sometimes at this stage of the year the game is more
physical.  
  
Q. Ty, you struggled shooting both nights here. Was there anything about
this setting this venue or why did you feel little off?  
TY JEROME: I don't know sometimes the ball doesn't go in. Just go back, get
back to Charlottesville get back in the gym and get ready for our next game.  
  
Q. Kyle, how would you assess the team's play defensively overall given
that Florida State shot 56 percent, you held it them to 34 percent the first
time you guys played them.  
KYLE GUY: I think coach and Ty really hit the nail on the head, they were the
tougher team, they were trying to penetrate and kick out or finish at the rim
and they got to the paint a lot and that bothers us and it's very repetitive
but we'll watch the tape and we'll be better from it.  
  
Q. What kind of scouting report did you have on Nichols? I don't
remember him doing a whole lot the first time?  
TONY BENNETT: No, you watch them, Florida State's good because they have one
guy I think in double figures and then maybe they have a second guy, but
they're balanced and they play a lot of guys and he's capable. He's really
capable as we have seen, but you could see where he would back us down and
just kind of go over the top. He hit one a couple on Kihei, did it on
De'Andre, he was rolling tonight and we couldn't quite bother him enough and
we tried to get a double to him. And when we needed to get a stop we couldn't
come up with a key defensive rebound so those things kind of hurt us to give
him second chance opportunities.  
  
Q. For all three, what are your thoughts on now after three months of
fighting the wars of ACC getting a chance to play somebody different next
week?  
TONY BENNETT: Well incredible regular season, incredible year for these guys.
They have played well. And this tournament last year we were fortunate to win
the regular season title and the conference tournament. This year we weren't.
Now we go into another tournament. We always talk about it, it's 40-minute
territory, that's kind of what we have been talking about and if you're not
sharp for the majority of those minutes or possessions, you get beat. And then
you're out of that tournament.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, I don't think this is anything to hang our hat on. We got
three losses on the entire year, six in the last two years, so I'm nothing but
excited for next week.  
  
TY JEROME: Yeah, it's going to be painful not to play tomorrow, but I remember
we cut down the nets in the ACC tournament last year and we didn't like the
way our season ended. So this isn't the end all, be all by any means, so just
about trying to figure out how much better we can get from now to Thursday or
Friday.  
  
Q. You didn't get much scoring off your bench either two nights, is that
any concern going ahead?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think that when we played them in way back, we did get
some scoring. I think Braxton had a big game and you could see how they were
really contesting. Kyle and Ty making shots hard, De'Andre got some stuff. But
balanced scoring, which is what they had against us, is always very tough. And
we weren't, I didn't think we were as productive or as efficient, of course,
offensively. But we can talk offense all you want, sometimes that's going to
come and go, you got to be able to stand in there and get the stops and if you
can't do that, it's hard to be successful.  
  
Q. First time really that Kihei's lack of size proved to be a liability.
Teams have tried to post him before and you've always been able to adjust and
cover. What did Florida State do tonight that made that more difficult?  
TONY BENNETT: It wasn't like they posted him. That guy, again, he hit a couple
shots over a lot of guys, he did it over De'Andre, he was just, he was
cooking. But he used his physicality and he sort of whatever you want to say,
backed a guy down and then just jumped up and shot over the top or made some
plays off the bounce, as he did against a couple guys. So you just try to
contest those and bother him and even when we had some length he did it too.  
  
Q. Curious, both halves, first half here in Charlotte the offense seemed
to be struggling to get going. Is there anything that was happening there,
because you made adjustments last night but today it didn't seem to happen?  
TONY BENNETT: I guess I didn't make good adjustments at halftime, so that's
it. No, you get into this part of the year and this post-season and the
defense cranks up, the physicality increases, and probably the game even slows
down some. And so again the ability to, you got to knock down shots when you
get them, but it was hard fought. We played a team that was very good
defensively and to beat a team like that, you have to stop them and then be
very efficient when you have your chances.  
  
Q. Kyle just laid it out, you've only loss six times in two years. In
this league. What do you believe your team's potential to be in this NCAA
tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I mean I think we know what we have to do to be
successful. You know it's a one-game tournament, you just go 1-0, that's
always the way. But these guys have showed when we're right and we're
efficient offensively and hard to score against, we play at a very high level
and these guys have been so sound and so smart all year. But we also realize
that we're susceptible as every team is in this tournament and sometimes
that's as valuable to know instead of thinking you're invincible. So if we
play well, hopefully we can go 1-0 and then we'll address the next one.  
  
Q. Do you subscribe at all to the idea that taking a loss at this time
of year, this stage of the game might help bring everything into focus for
your guys going into next week?  
TONY BENNETT: I do now.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
No, you just, all right, we lost, we'll get some extra rest for these guys,
we'll grow as we said, learn from the tape, and you take the hand that's dealt
and you make the most of it. We would have loved, I wanted these guys so bad
to get a chance at a title fight is what we said again, but that didn't
happen. It wasn't that their effort was poor or anything, but now we'll use it
to the best of our, or to our advantage.  
  
Q. Really for all of y'all, it's probably hard to think in the bigger
picture right now, but you are a lot more elite offensively this year in your
body of work than last year and you seem to be healthier too. So how does that
impact you guys feeling like you have more weapons this year than you did last
year and assumedly better health also?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think versatility is very important and again their
offensive efficiency numbers have been very good this year and tonight they
weren't, but we probably didn't -- again we didn't defend well enough, but
that's healthy, I hope everybody came out of this game unscathed and we'll get
the rest and then attack the next one.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, really excited to play and very happy that nobody's hurt, like
coach said. And every loss we have ever taken we learn from it and just
excited to play.  
  
TY JEROME: Yeah, I think they improved the improved offense has been very good
for us throughout the year but more times than not it's going to come down to
how well we defend and how tough we were throughout the game and today we
weren't the tougher team and when we're not that's what happens.  
  
Q. Sorry you've been asked this but if not are you beginning to think
Charlotte is a jinx, this place that you've had some rough outings here?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, well, I got to live out my dream of playing in the NBA, I
met my wife, got to play a good game yesterday, I think I'm pretty blessed, so
I'm okay.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [RJ Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36803)

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Zion Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36804)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 74, North Carolina - 73  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: This was obviously a great game. I mean vintage ACC, Duke-
North Carolina, you know, both teams played so hard and well. I thought in the
second half it was tough for either team to score. The defense of both teams
was outstanding and I'm really proud of our guys. We had to put some lineups
in, guys coming off the bench, J-Gold played 28 minutes and was a significant
factor defensively. Not just on Johnson, but getting back. His athletic
ability, he was the first guy back all the time to help stop their break. And
he came up with that one bucket, I don't know how he got it, but it was a huge
-- well every bucket was huge. And these two guys are terrific and really
amazed at how many minutes they play. RJ the whole season and still plays at
the level that he does. And Zion coming off of the injury to put two games
like this together is, their will to win, these two guys have an amazing will
to win and it makes us coaches look a lot better. So any questions, I think
you want the players first, right?  
  
Q. Zion, I know it was tough, you had to sit and watch the first two
North Carolina games, but can you talk about finally getting a chance to play
against them and ending up being the one to make the winning basket for
Duke.  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I mean it was tough watching the first two games. I watched
my brothers out there battling and I wished I could go to war with them but it
was very exciting to get out there and play. I mean the rivalry lived up to
what I expected it to be. And I mean to make the game winning shot, honestly I
got to give credit to RJ because the read was for him to fake the ball and
take it to the basket, but he read the defense and he gave me the ball and my
teammates trust me to make the shot.  
  
Q. RJ, Zion, you guys have been rating the dunks all season long. The
reverse, the windmill. Starting with you, RJ, how would you rate it 1 to 10?  
RJ BARRETT: Which one?  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It's two points.  
  
RJ BARRETT: The one he had today where he took off outside the key on the fast
break, I give that one a 10. I didn't know he was going to dunk that one. It
was tough.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Let's not talk about rating dunks. Let's talk about the game.  
  
Q. Zion, you were down 13, you hit a three, a couple other buckets,
Jordan came in and really, along with Tre really stepped up the defensive
pressure --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: And Antonio also.  
  
Q. Correct. The defensive pressure seemed to change noticeably. Could
you feel a difference in the energy level among your teammates after all that
happened?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Definitely. I think we were just going too fast and we were
playing at their tempo, but I think we just needed to calm down and play at
our speed and we started to execute more.  
  
Q. You called it vantage Duke-North Carolina. From our seat it was like
watching a prize fight. This is for all three of you guys. What was it like
playing in it for you two and coaching it for you?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well I've been in a lot of them, so I would rather have their
impressions. It's, Roy and I both know how lucky we are to have the teams and
the programs that get players and produce this level of performance. And he
and I are good friends and we both know that this lived up to it. Obviously it
didn't live up to how he would want it, but it certainly lived up to the
expectations of a high intensity. But these guys can answer it.  
  
RJ BARRETT: Yeah, you know, both historic programs going at it, and they kept
coming at us and we kept going at them all game long. So it was definitely
just a great environment and such a fun game to be in. Very thankful that I
was able to be a part of it and that we got the win.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: To keep it simple, it's a rivalry, and that's how rivalries
go. So just got to play hard and execute.  
  
Q. The question here is, when you were down 13 at the first half
juncture there, what did you say to your guys to keep their heads up and to
inspire them to go on and close the gap at halftime?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, I don't know it's anything we said. It's a long game,
and they're going to play fast and we'll play fairly fast, not as fast as
them, and we just needed some stops. Cameron Johnson came out so hot and he's
such a terrific player. And I thought J-Gold did a great job on him. But our
bench really helped us. Our bench really helped us. They gave us J-Gold
especially, and Antonio, who, he didn't, I'm sure he didn't think he was going
to play tonight, but he did and he played very well. And both those kids gave
energy and maybe that's one of the reasons RJ and Zion weren't as tired,
because they were instead of giving energy to a teammate, they were getting
energy from a teammate.  
  
Q. My question is actually about the bench and all the adversity that
this team has had to face throughout the season being without Zion, being
without Tre. How do you feel about their development especially with the NCAA
tournament coming up?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well, the fact that we would love to have Marques back.
I mean tonight especially with the big guys, and we're hoping again maybe,
maybe by next weekend but I can't, we're, we're hoping for that. The thing
that we found against good man-to-man offense, Jordan Goldwire has just been
sensational on defense. His athletic ability, and he and Tre out there they
put such good pressure on the ball and that takes RJ and Cameron not having to
do that. And then Antonio, that's a little bit of a surprise, but he's had a
great attitude and if you find some guys like that, now they have confidence,
that's good. And Javin played well, he gets tired, that's why the combination
of Javin and Marques is the best one for us, but that's not what we have right
now.  
  
Q. Do you think maybe in a way the injuries could have been a blessing
in disguise because some of these guys have had to play and get that
experience where you can use them in the tournament the rest of the tournament
here?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well I think you have to make every situation as positive as
it can be for you. But I would rather have no one injured. All the teams we
play have not had any injury adversity. The four teams here, three of them,
they know who they are already, and I would rather have, I would rather have
that. You know, our kids have played a hell of a schedule. Tonight's game was
like the seventh game against a potential one seed that we have played. I mean
that's a lot. That's a lot. Three against Carolina, two against Virginia,
Gonzaga and Kentucky. And two of them were with guys, not our full team. And
that's a heck of a schedule for these kids. They have done a terrific job and
hopefully we have enough in the tank tomorrow to play well against Leonard's
team.  
  
Q. Going back to when you were down early, putting that lineup in there,
I'm not sure you've ever had that particular lineup on the floor --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, we haven't, no.  
  
Q. What went through your mind? Was it a desperation, were you trying to
save the game? But then you started them in the second half also.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well they deserved to start. They put us in a position to do
that. I don't think it was desperation as much as who do we have in uniform?
J-Gold has earned that. And Antonio, yeah, we didn't have -- Jack was too
small to play against their bigs, I thought. And Antonio, for, what did he
play? Eight, 10 minutes? I don't know. Yeah, he just gave us a physical
presence inside there. So we did learn about that. I'm proud of our guys
because they, we had a big meeting this morning about giving energy and anyone
who is in the game, give the guys who have been in the game a long time,
energy. Don't expect them to give energy to you. And I thought our bench did
that tonight really well.  
  
Q. Ordinarily this is the kind of a win that you the guys would
celebrate for a day or two but you got a game tomorrow and you are starting
four freshmen. How difficult is it anticipating any problems getting these
guys to come down and focus on tomorrow?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, I think it's more of getting them physically ready.
Because it's two exhausting days in a row and if we want to win in the
tournament, you have to win two big time games in three days. You have to do
something after you've already done something. And so we had hoped that we
could play three games here and we had hoped that we could win, but the main
thing was to get the experience of playing with one another again with this
level of competition. Because our league is as good as any, it's just, I think
it's better, you know, and so this has been a heck of a thing for us. I
watched a little bit of Florida State and their defense is outstanding today.
Virginia's as good a team as there is in the country. We have some really good
teams. We have some really good teams and players. So -- and Florida State is
one of them. They're one of them.  
  
Q. Roy and you both circled Jordan as a big factor in this game. It's
unusual that a guy at the end of his sophomore year would have a career high
in ACC semifinal. Do you go into a game like this thinking Antonio might play
10 and Jordan might play 28 or are you improvising the whole way?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, but you, I do have confidence in the guys and just ask
them that, when their number's called to, you know, just be yourself and play
your butt off. Jordan has done that. Jordan, though has given a level of
enthusiasm that really helps our team, besides playing out standing defense.
And he's a really good athlete. Really, if you watch, they get down so fast
and I thought a big key for us in defending them once he got in was how fast
he got down the court. He took away, he fanned out and they weren't able to
pass ahead. Then they had to run more half court offense and he was really a
big part of, it was the turning point of the game, really, his defense. Thank
you.

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

### [Ahmed Hill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28466)

### [Nickeil Alexander-
Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36774)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Florida State - 65, Virginia Tech - 63  
  
Q. Obviously not the result you wanted, but the effort level from your
guys coming back after playing yesterday, playing against such a deep team,
how would you kind of address that?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I don't want it to come across arrogant at all, but if there
was some category for effort across the country regardless of sport in
college, I think we would win. I know it comes across selfish and I just said
this to our guys, and I don't mean this in the wrong way either, I don't want
to win so we can win. I want to win because that means we get to play again
and I've never seen in my career as a coach the connectedness and the effort
that these guys play with. I'm just struggling to articulate over and over to
these guys the level of respect that I have for them, considering all that
they have been through and how they just keep responding. So much of what goes
on in the locker room and timeouts, it's them, it's what they're saying. And
it's not just our players and it's not just me, it's the organization all
pulling and I think you can see that, we probably get more bench warnings than
anybody, and it's not for mal-intent, it's just that's kind of how we do
things when it's just us. But the utmost respect for Florida State, for sure,
but also for the effort and care and love that our guys play with. Thanks for
asking.  
  
Q. Guys, what, you were down for so long in this game, what enabled you
to climb back in this game in the second half and second over time game with
Florida State in as many weeks, what is it about this matchup or these two
teams that makes for such compelling basketball?  
AHMED HILL: I think they're a great team they got coaches, they're a very deep
team, a very talented team. They got pretty much everything you need as a
team. I just think they outplayed us and they earned it they earned the W
today, and I think that these two of the hardest fighting teams in the ACC and
I think every time we play them it will be a battle.  
  
NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: I believe it's the matchup, I think we matchup well
with them they matchup well with us. When you have two teams that are tough by
label it's going to be a good game and it's competition. Guys wanted to
compete, everyone was going back and forth and we were aggressive, they were
aggressive, it was a physical game, but again, like Med said, credit to them,
they made shots down the stretch and they did what they had to do. They're a
great team, which is why they earned that double bye and I just feel like it's
always a great matchup because you have two high level teams going as hard as
they can.  
  
Q. For both the players, you heard your coach talking about being proud
of the effort level and I know you're not satisfied with the result but what's
it like to play on a team that coined of does have that extra gear and that
extra effort level?  
NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: I mean I love my teammates and it's like it just
brings us closer. When you have someone that's giving just as much if not more
effort than you are you feel like I got to give more. It's never like, well,
I'm doing this for what purpose? It's always, I'm doing this for Med because I
know Med's trying his hardest, so I can't hold Med down, everyone's trying to
push each other up. I wouldn't say we have a leader telling us to go up the
ladder, we have everyone making sure that the guy at the bottom is pushing
people up, the guy at the top's pulling people up. I think it's a chain and
everyone's going in one direction and everyone's flowing together.  
  
AHMED HILL: Yeah, that was perfect what he said. I just think that it's always
been like that, that's kind of the culture we have here, we never are going to
do anything soft, that's our culture, so it kind of bled into us and we just
want to come out here and play for each other and that's about it.  
  
Q. Obviously you had a pretty good look there on Mann on defending him
on that game winning basket how did that look from your point of view?  
AHMED HILL: He made a great drive I just tried not to foul. He made a
beautiful floater and it happened to go in. And from then on it was the next
play. We drew up, a good shot at the end and we just came up short.  
  
Q. You played in the ACC and beat up on each other basically for the
last three months, you move on now, do you look forward for the opportunity of
playing somebody different for a change when you start the NCAA tournament?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Your outfit is beautiful. That Gingham shirt, that velvet -- is
that velvet or suede?  
  
Q. It's velvet.  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Man, you look like a million bucks.  
  
Q. I wish I had a million bucks.  
NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: I mean, I thank God for the opportunity, it's a
chance to go dancing, I mean when you think about how many NCAA teams there
are and then you break it down and it's like, okay, we are one of those people
that get a chance to play in an event like that, that's stories I can take on
for life and when you have people in your corner that you would love to go to
war with, I mean it's, we're creating life stories, it's more than just
basketball at this point, it's not about who we play, I mean as long as I got
this team, I don't care who we play.  
  
AHMED HILL: I think that was a great test for what's coming up next for us.
That was a great team, tremendous team, and I think that if we go out there
and play like that next week, man, I for sure think we'll get a W.  
  
Q. X's and O's question on their game trying three at the end of the
game. Had they taken a little more time were you guys intending to foul before
they got that shot, did they get it off too quick or did you not want to foul
in that situation?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, all that's -- we discussed all of that, we discussed, did
you see how Nickeil played the ball? On the out of bounds play? We didn't want
it to go to the strong side, right? That was one thing. We talked about
fouling on the inbounds pass and then we talked about our colors signify some
defensive things for us, we wanted to black on the weak side. Coaches call
that a hammer screen that they set and we wanted to black that, which is
switch it. So we prevented it from going to the strong side, it went to the
weak side, but we didn't black it, we didn't switch it. In hopes that if you
switch it, maybe that's denied and now the ball's got to go towards half court
and now as the ball goes towards half court now we can load to the ball and
maybe buy, eat up two and a half, three seconds and maybe it's more of a
contested shot. Really good player, it's 24 that hit the shot, right? I think
he's shooting 44 percent from three through 18 conference games. Obviously
that's why they ran the hammer for him. And similar to what Med said, on the
baseline drive, very good contest, kind of a strange bounce that went in, but
both of those shots, to tie it and to win it, they earned them.  
  
Q. Curious, as you prepare over the next week for whoever's in store
next, how do you evaluate Justin? I know he's talked about he would like to
play. Is that a realistic and how do you evaluate is there things you want to
see him do on the court before you make that call?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yes, sir. He's making progress. Similar to any athlete, you
have to continue to make progress and that progress is based on the doctor's
timeline, the trainer's time line, he has met each passing phase, we took
pictures of it last Friday before we played our last home game, those pictures
determined that he couldn't play. So we're going to end up being able to take
pictures again on Sunday and I think that's a nine day stretch between
pictures, which is the longest that we have had. Well not we, not me, the
medical team will make that decision after those pictures are reviewed. But we
were off on Saturday -- oh, we didn't work on Sunday, we ended up having a
history lesson. 5 did his work on Sunday. Monday we had practice, Tuesday
morning early we had practice, we came here, 5 was able to participate more on
Monday and Tuesday than ever before. When did we practice at Queens?  
  
NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: Tuesday.  
  
AHMED HILL: Tuesday.  
  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Oh, so we came here on Monday. So on Tuesday we had practice
here in Charlotte. He was able to do a little bit more than Monday. So God's
the ultimate healer and we're praying that it works.  
  
Q. For the players I think you missed your first 12 threes as a team,
what about their defense kind of made that tough and how did you kind of
finally work your way back into this game?  
AHMED HILL: I think they had beautiful contests they knew that we as a team
that we could shoot three, they kind of played it, they wanted to make us
drive and go into their bigs and the bigs are so tremendous at blocking shots
so we tried to get them in the air, kick out for a three, but they did such a
good job of contesting it so they just made it miss.  
  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Perfect answer, Med.  
  
Q. For both players, if you could just speak to what you've learned last
year and Med before that in the NCAA tournament and what you think needs to
happen differently to have more success.  
NICKEIL ALEXANDER-WALKER: It's a moment of a lifetime and as you go farther
and farther and you start, teams start shedding off and it gets realer and
realer and realer and you got the best out of every conference out of that
tournament. So it's like no matter who you play, 8-9, 1-16, 2-15, it's a real
game, you're going to have to play all 40 minutes, it's going to be a dog
fight. And I learned through even ACC, which I feel like is great preparation
for the Tournament it's like you're going to have to fight all 40 minutes,
sometimes 45. But it's whatever it takes to win and you got to be locked in
and engaged the whole 45 to win.  
  
AHMED HILL: I just learned to not be so uptight, I just learned just go out
there and have fun. It's a game and you know you need to win but you can't
stress it too much, you can't want it too bad, you just got to go out there
and continue to play how you played all year.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Coby White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36786)

### [Luke Maye](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33294)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
North Carolina - 83, Louisville - 70  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: All right. We're very pleased to be able to spend another night
in Charlotte and get up and talk about a game tomorrow morning. I thought
there was a couple things that was good for us. They came back and got it to
seven or eight or nine and then I thought our defense got two or three
turnovers in a row and we laid it up on the other end. And we kept running. We
practice running a lot and so I think that was helpful to us today. And I
think the rebounding margin 44-35 and second chance points 9-2, I thought they
were big. We got to the free-throw line and when you're playing Louisville, we
talk all the time about trying to play them without fouling. They're one of
the best free throw shooting teams in the league. And so for us that was a big
key. But 19-9 for Luke, 19-7 and 6-1 for Coby. Cam didn't score a basket in
the second half but he kept us in the game a lot early and he gave us a little
bit of a margin, but I thought is was good. And then Garrison made a couple of
big baskets and after he missed the two free throws they had a chance to
choose the guy and they chose him. And I thought it was big for him to step up
and make the two free throws. So we're happy to still be here.  
  
Q. Kenny's defensive pressure early forced some turnovers and helped you
get the tempo that you wanted. Then he took a hit, rebounding, left the court
holding his collar bone, came back, then got hit in the eye later. Is he going
to be okay? Is the eye injury serious or is it just a temporary thing?  
ROY WILLIAMS: He's just a little soft. Be sure and tell him I said that. No,
his shoulder, he's got a bad shoulder but luckily it was more inside and it
wasn't one of the things that hurts him a great deal. But he did get poked in
the eye and I assume he's okay because we put him back in the game.  
  
Q. You're 22-7 all-time here in Charlotte. How much did the crowd give
you a boost tonight with the tournament being here in North Carolina?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well I love being in North Carolina. I love being in Charlotte.
I think the whole town loves having the tournament here. But we were in
Charlotte last year in the second round and got our butts kick. I appreciate
the crowd but it's the guys in the short pants that make it for us, not those
guys in the crowd. Did we put Kenny back in the game after that? Did Kenny
come back? He's all right. He's a little soft.  
  
Q. Luke, you've been through tournaments like this for awhile now, and
you realize it's a process, you want to get better every game. How is this as
kind of a starting point for the tournament? Did you feel like you guys did
what you needed to do tonight?  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah, I think we came out early and punched them in the mouth. And
basketball's a game of runs and they came back and battled back and I thought
coach got on us a little bit, especially at halftime and it kind of got us
going and came out the second half and made some big plays. I thought Coby
made some big shots and Cam battled on the boards which was big for us. And I
thought overall it was just a big team win for us. And I mean in a format like
this it's definitely tough, but you got to continue to play and continue to
fight because the other team's doing the same thing. And I think we're going
to try to do that tomorrow.  
  
Q. Luke, how special of a night was it for you not only to win the Skip
Prosser Scholar Athlete Award, but also playing in front of your hometown to
put up the numbers you did.  
LUKE MAYE: It was great. I love coming back to Charlotte. I was talking
earlier, we lost last year and it was tough playing in Charlotte and losing
like that. And I wanted to come out and make sure that this time it didn't go
that way. And we came out and battled and fought and I thought it was a big
win for us and we got a big game tomorrow.  
  
Q. 11-36 from the three, five from eight from the free-throw line.
Keeping Louisville off the free-throw line was the main key for tonight's
game?  
ROY WILLIAMS: It was one of the three things we put up, like when you're
playing golf, you don't want to three-putt. We didn't want to -- you
understand that one, right? But we wanted to play really good defense without
reaching. We still -- one of them I didn't understand, we reached when 30 was
77 feet from the basket and he made a heck of a play and laid it up and it was
and one. But still for the most part we did do a better job of talking and
listening, and that is communication, not just talking. But made some switches
and got out and helped each other one the screen.  
  
Q. What does it mean to have a player like Luke Maye who excels on the
court and off the court as well? What does that mean for your program?  
ROY WILLIAMS: It means a great deal. And Luke's been a great student and a
great student-athlete many, many years all the way back to his high school
days as well. His parents emphasized education. And the guy sitting up here
with him has done a nice job in the classroom as well. I've got one of the
easiest jobs that anyone could have because we have such great kids that care
about what they do in the classroom. And we're proud of the fact that six of
the nine years since we had the Skip Prosser winner we have had the winner, so
we're proud of that and proud of Luke.  
  
Q. Coby, you had a lot of success taking the ball to the basket. Talk
about your ability to penetrate and either get it and finish the play or kick
it back out to one of your teammates.  
COBY WHITE: I just started to look and see where the defense is at and just
take what they give me. Early on I kind of forced it a lot, when I first
started here, but I think I'm starting to make better decisions on it.  
  
Q. Coby, you had 12 in two games against Louisville and then 19 tonight.
What specifically changed against the same starting lineup for them?  
COBY WHITE: I kind of got to the basket. I still didn't hit a jump shot. Coach
got on me about hitting -- I think I'm like 1 for 18 against them from the
three-point line. But I got to the basket, I made some tough plays at the
basket. But I could have played better, but all I care about is the win.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: I'll say something for Coby. He said earlier in the year he was
trying to get there. He's got better at reading it. But I always want him to
be aggressive. I like point guards that are aggressive, take the ball to the
basket and make plays and I think his attacking the rim in the first half was
huge for us. Cam made a couple threes too, but the other thing in the first
half was Coby taking the ball to the basket.  
  
Q. For Coby and Roy, Coby you touched on it, but you had one turnover
tonight I think you had two turnovers your last three games, what's working
better for you now?  
COBY WHITE: I think I'm just trying to make the easy play instead of the home
run play. Not trying to force it, not trying to do too much with the ball and
just make the correct play and I think early on I was trying to force it and
make the home run play, but that didn't benefit me so coach got on me a lot
about turning the ball over and I think I'm getting better each game.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: As you can tell Coby thinks I get on him all the time I get on
him about his shots I get on him about his turnovers and he's right, but he is
making much better decisions. It's just attack, attack, attack.  
  
COBY WHITE: Under control.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: That's what we talk about all the time we want to attack like
crazy and be under control and I think he's doing a lot better job of that
tonight and late in the season he's done a much better job.  
  
Q. I know often times you've preached we play for April. But is there a
part of you that wants to play for March like you know you want this
tournament?  
ROY WILLIAMS: No, there's a huge part of me. I think you remember what you do
in April, but we're in the moment too. I tell the guys all the time, if you
look down the road I tell our fans, if you just think about what may happen at
the end of the year in Minneapolis, is it Minneapolis? Okay, what happens, if
that's the only judgment, it's bad, so I talk to them all the time about
enjoying the moment, enjoy the journey and we're playing tonight. So we want
to win. That's, winning this thing is one of our goals. It's not the only one
and it's not the biggest one, but I've never been to an ACC tournament where I
didn't really want to win. Sometimes we have and sometimes we haven't, but the
rest of the journey's still out there too.  
  
Q. Coby, they scored 10 straight points to cut it to one late in the
first half and then you guys finished the half I want to say it was 12-2 or
11-2 to get that 10 point lead back. What changed and how did you guys handle
that to be able to get back up and make that run?  
COBY WHITE: I think our transition defense got better, we went through a
little spurt where it was bad and we wasn't getting picked up and they were
knocking down open shots, so we started to get picked up better, we locked in
and we just got stops down the stretch.  
  
Q. For any one of you guys, it's hard not to look ahead when the game's
tomorrow. Is there any part of you that wants to see Duke tomorrow night? With
how the game goes tonight?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Frankly my dear --  
  
LUKE MAYE: I knew he would say that.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Luke says I'm -- he knew I was going to say that. I hate it when
people know that kind of thing. I really don't. Come on, we are here and if
they bring Golden State Warriors out we'll play, if it's Duke we'll play, if
it's Syracuse we'll play. I'm being honest. I care about how our team does.
Are all of you old enough to know what I'm talking about when I say, frankly
my dear? Okay, you're old enough Chip, that's for darn sure.  
  
Q. Yes, sir. You might be the oldest person in the room though.  
ROY WILLIAMS: Could be.  
  
Q. For Luke, that run that coach referenced before late in the game, I
think started with two blocked shots by you. What were you anticipating on
defense that was going to happen at that juncture?  
LUKE MAYE: Well when I play the five I try to do my best to protect the rim
and coach continues to get on me about trying to take charges and I need to do
a better job of taking charges but I still think I'm a shot blocker and
sometimes I do get blocks, but I think just the biggest thing for me is just
trying to be in the right spots and coach continues to preach being in help
side and being in the middle of the paint, especially when the ball's opposite
and I just tried to be in the right spots for my teammates and make sure that
they could rely on me on defense.  
  
Q. Coby and Luke, Louisville did a really good job of keeping you guys
out of transition in Chapel Hill and in Louisville as well. Tonight you got 27
fast break points. Talk about the mindset of push the ball, push the ball and
what did you do specifically to get those many fast break points?  
COBY WHITE: Coach preaches push the ball every day in practice and in the
games and we try to do it every game and today we really pushed it and I got
on the break and it benefited us well.  
  
LUKE MAYE: Mind if I say something?  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Let him speak he won the Skip Prosser award. Let him talk.  
  
LUKE MAYE: I think the biggest thing and coach has changed the defense to help
us guard the gaps a little bit better and guard the basket, but I don't think
Kenny gets enough credit for the job he does and for him to get the steal and
for him to hold Nwora to seven points who is one of the best scorers in our
league is really strong and I think he started the break a lot and he was able
to get the board and he runs out and leaks out sometimes, but he makes great
plays. I think he doesn't get enough credit for the job he does every night.  
  
Q. Now that weather on rolled, Roy, this team really remind me of an old
fashioned Carolina team and I know you don't like to compare teams but can you
compare the progress and the improvement that this team has made, talk about
that, because they're really?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I think we got better and if you look and I really believe this,
I believe almost all of our teams have gotten better down the stretch, second
half of the conference season I would think our record's probably about as
good as anybody's. Maybe better than most everybody. But I think we have the
kids who pay attention and try to make what we're teaching every day become
habits and then when it become habits for them it's easier to do that. I think
as the season's gone along they have shared the basketball better, I think
they have appreciated a better shot than maybe the one they have, I think we
have done a better job of keeping the other team trying to run them off the
three-point line and I think they understand the knowledge of that. But we
practice really pretty thoroughly and pretty hard every day and I think it's
the kind of kids we have, they have just done a good job of getting better.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Dwayne Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30709)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
North Carolina - 83, Louisville - 70  
  
CHRIS MACK: Carolina is a great team. They were better than us tonight, that's
for sure. And it's nothing that we didn't know coming in. But I thought where
the game got out of reach for us early on was because of their transition. I
mean it's phenomenal, as fast as any team I've coached against. And you talk
about it, you talk about it, but talking doesn't prepare you sometimes. And
you give those guys credit, they were shot out of a cannon, that ball was up
the floor and in such a hurry and got to the rim, they hit the rim runner a
couple times, they get advance pass threes to Cam Johnson and really, really
put us back. And we were never able to recover enough. I give our guys great
credit for continuing to fight against one of the elite teams in all of
college basketball, but I thought those were the two things that we could have
controlled. It takes effort and communication to get back in transition and
then it takes effort to keep them off the glass. I thought we passed for the
most part that second part of keeping them off the glass, but we didn't do the
job that we needed to do in transition. Second half turnovers when we started
to cut the margin just killed us.  
  
Q. You have to be happy with V.J. and Darius Perry's progress going into
the tournament. You really got bench punch now, how does that make you feel?  
CHRIS MACK: Great. I thought for the better part of both games a lot of guys
stepped up. And hasn't always been easy for Darius and V.J. through out the
year but they really gave our team a shot in the arm. I thought they did great
things on both ends of the floor and hopefully they gained a lot of personal
confidence. We're going to need to be a deep team and if we expect to make any
type of run in tournament play.  
  
Q. You did a great job of keeping them out of transition in Chapel Hill
and if I remember the Louisville game you made them play a lot of half court
offense in that game as well. What was different tonight and then I would ask
specifically what part did Kenny Williams defensive pressure early play in
getting them some turnovers and get the break going?  
CHRIS MACK: It's hard to say what they did better, other than Roy did
something that to get those guys shot out of a cannon. I remember years ago
when he coached Kansas against Marquette I believe in the Final Four in New
Orleans and I don't know if I have ever seen a team play as fast that day as
they did until today. The floor was tilted, even on made shots we could not
get back and we ended up adjusting. Instead of sending three guys to the
offensive glass we ended up sending two and we haven't done that one time all
year in both games that we played Carolina. So I think it was more them trying
to swing a knockout punch early and play downhill. And Coby White made the
right decision each and every time whether it was an advance pass to Cam
Johnson, whether it was to Brooks underneath, I mean even when Malik got his
first foul of the game it was in transition right under the restricted arc. So
they're a load when they play that quickly. Not just Kenny Williams, but all
those guys I thought were very, very handsy, they pressured our guards, they
did a really good job on ball screen coverage for the most part and they have
terrific length and great anticipation. And while we took care of the ball
well in the first half we certainly didn't do it well enough in the second
half to give ourselves a chance to cut the margin even further.  
  
Q. When you guys will see some new faces in the NCAA tournament do you
think this team will thrive against the grind of the ACC that you've been
through, will that help you when you get to the NCAAs?  
CHRIS MACK: I told these guys in the locker room that we have played the best
teams in the country. I mean there's a reason that y'all are talking about a
possibility, not saying it's going to happen, a possibility of three No. 1
seeds. That's incredible. And even if they don't get three, if even if our
league doesn't get three No. 1 seeds it just shows you the quality of
basketball that we have. So, yeah, it beats you up, and they're extremely
talented and well-coached. It's the best conference in the country, in my
opinion. But every game in the tournament is going to be difficult. Every
single one. Hopefully our guys understand that when we do the things that we
can control, we'll give ourselves a chance to win against anybody.  
  
Q. Duane, after their early surge I think they were up 16 something like
maybe 18 you guys came roaring back, you got a lot of transition, got the lead
down to one, hit a lot of, you hit several threes in there, what was going
well during that phase of the game and why weren't you able to sustain it?  
DWAYNE SUTTON: I think our energy picked up throughout that stretch, we did a
good job of rebounding the ball in that stretch and pushing the tempo
ourselves, but I think we made some mental mistakes and they got the lead back
to around 10 at that point, but I think we did a good job of cutting the lead
at that point.  
  
Q. Chris, you talk about things you can control, what one or two things
in this game would you really have like to have maybe had a little bit better
handle than you did?  
CHRIS MACK: I think those two. Transition defense early on, I thought we did a
much better job when we weren't giving live ball turnovers in the second half.
I thought we did a much better job of getting matched up and making it more
five on five and they're still terrific in the half court. Luke Maye is a
tough matchup for anybody, Cam Johnson is so efficient he doesn't waste any
time on the floor. When he's open he shoots, when he's not he doesn't. But if
we could have boxed them in and made them play a little bit of half court more
in the first half. In the second half we just, we had too many turnovers. And
that's what went from about a 10 point, 11 point margin where, hey, we got a
fighter's chance to get this to a couple possession game if we handle
ourselves and we turned the ball over and that wasn't a trait of ours the
first 30 minutes, but it was the last 10.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Kevin Keatts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30653)

### [Markell Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36703)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Virginia - 76, NC State - 56  
  
KEVIN KEATTS: Guys, obviously we played a very good team today in Virginia. I
can see obviously why they're going to be a No. 1 seed. I thought Kyle Guy was
tremendous. You know, the shots that he made were back-breakers. He played
extremely well. I thought everybody kind of fed off of him, and he just made
shots. When you look at his numbers, that's incredible the way he played. He's
10 for 13 from the field and 7 for 9 from three. A lot of those we were right
there. He just raised up and made some shots.  
  
Proud of my team that we have fought. Good win for us yesterday to get into
this game, and I thought we played very well up until halftime, and then
obviously they made some plays, and it kind of got away from us.  
  
Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, ideally you guys will be going to the NCAA Tournament. How do
you get your guys in April mode? We're going for April now. How do you switch
to that mindset?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, I think what we talked about in the locker room is at this
time of year, players make plays. As coaches, we give you a game plan, we put
you in the right situation, the right spots. Example, Tony is a hell of a
coach and he does a tremendous job, but Kyle Guy was special today, and he
made everybody look good.  
  
You know, we talked about that. Markell was the same way yesterday, where we
needed a play, he did a tremendous job of making plays for us, and so when you
get to this time of year, it's more of a mentality. You don't care who does
it, just as long as one of your teammates do it, and you start more
concentrating on playing for the name on the front of the jersey.  
  
Q. I know you would have preferred the game ended at halftime today, but
you guys did put in a lot of scrap and effort. What was your strategy in
deploying the back court pressure for most of the game?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, obviously I think it's no secret that Virginia does a
tremendous job of controlling tempo. You know, probably the best in the
country. Any time we had a chance to be able to get into some pressure we
wanted to, we wanted to get those guys to play a little faster. At our place
in the second half, we were able to speed them up. They took some shots that
were a little questionable for Tony's system. Tonight they didn't. They stayed
the course. They ran their stuff, and obviously they came away with a good
win.  
  
Q. Funderburk really carried the fair share of the offense in the first
half, didn't get many touches in the second half. Was that an adjustment
Virginia made in the second half?  
KEVIN KEATTS: I think it was a little bit of both. Not so much of oversight. I
thought they made adjustments because he hurt them. I thought D.J. floated
around a little more in the second half on the perimeter than he did inside.
But it's just -- we tried to get the ball to guys that when it's in their
situation and they have a favorable -- but I thought they made some
adjustments and kind of took him away.  
  
Q. Coach, you were leading in the second half, and then all of a sudden
a three-point play by Salt, another three-point play by Salt, a four-point
play by Guy, you missed a bunch of free throws and D.J. got poked in the eye.
How difficult was all that adversity to deal with?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, I don't know if you stared at me, but it was tough. It's a
lot of things that happened in a short amount of time that kind of blew the
game open. When you look at the game, we were right there, and then I remember
getting to 10, then I thought it got to 12 and then we cut it again. We made
some unfortunate plays. You know, they got some and-ones that obviously they
converted, and then I didn't think we made our free throws. When you look at
it, it was a pivotal stretch that I thought we missed five free throws in a
row where the score was about 11, should have been a six-point game.  
  
Q. As well as you played defense against them in the first half, did you
think maybe you wasted an opportunity by not being up more at halftime, and
then how much in the second half maybe did legs kind of start to come into
play?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, I don't think we wasted an opportunity because I don't
think we played that much greater than them in the first half. You know, we
talked about trying to win the game at whatever pace we had to. You know, it's
hard. I thought both teams played equal in the first half. They just played
better than us. They made plays. They got and-ones. They made their free
throws, and for us in the second half, we didn't get those breaks.  
  
MARKELL JOHNSON: We conditioned ourselves in practice to go full go every day.  
  
Q. Kevin, obviously Kyle Guy can shoot like that. You guys were able to
force them into some bad shots in the first half and kind of showed up with
Jerome and Hunter's numbers, but how do you prepare for Jack Salt to have a
game like that?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, I mean, Jack was really good, and I thought we did a
really good job on him in the first half. He did a great job. He's so big, and
Jack screens and rolls and rolled to the hole, and our guys did a poor job --
the thing that made Jack special tonight was he made his free throws, and that
was tough on us because obviously any time you foul him, he hasn't been a
great free-throw shooter, but I thought he played great. I thought Kyle Guy's
performance was as good as I've seen this year as far as a guy playing well
against us. When you look at his percentages, I don't care who they play
today, if he would have shot 7 for 9, 10 for 13, it was going to be hard to
beat them today.  
  
Q. Markell, second half they used Hunter on you for long stretches, and
it seemed to get you guys out of sync offensively. How much harder is it
dealing with a guy who's that much bigger and still quick?  
MARKELL JOHNSON: It was just really trying to get my guys the ball. When he
was like defending me and things like that, it was tough. You know, trying to
get the ball inside with the length and things like that.  
  
Q. You guys won the game that a lot of people were saying would have you
guys in the tournament, and you fought hard with Virginia. What do you guys
see that the selection crew should put you guys in for, your credentials?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, I kind of look at it like this: If the selection crew, if
they value what they've said all year long, then there shouldn't be any issues
with us. We've always talked about quad 1 and quad 2 wins, where we just
played the No. 1 NET team in the country, and we're 9 and 9 in quad 1 and quad
2 games after today when you look at it. We went into this game with a NET of
32. More than likely probably will go up because we played Virginia even and
lost. So I like our guys' chances. If they value what they have talked about,
it shouldn't be an issue at all.  
  
Q. Kevin, looking at the way you've played here in the tournament, some
positive plays, a lot of good things happening. What aspects of this can you
take with you into postseason play that will benefit you?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, that's a great question. We talked about mentality. You
know, what's your mentality. I thought in the two games that we played, we
played two good halves. When you look at Clemson game, I didn't think we
played well in the first half, and then you take this game, we didn't play
well in the second half, and so what I'm asking these guys is our mentality
has to be to put back to back halves. That doesn't necessarily mean it has to
be 40 minutes, but we've got to be able to play 30 to 35 minutes of good
basketball.  
  
Yesterday we didn't play great in the first half, but Markell Johnson, he put
us on his back, and we won the game. Today we had a great first half and then
we didn't have a good second.  
  
Q. Kevin, I'm curious how much you'll pay attention to the discussion
over who gets in, who gets left out over the next 72 hours and how much you'll
be paying attention to that and how much you'll be paying attention to your
own team.  
KEVIN KEATTS: I will not pay attention to it at all because this is -- and I
say this, and here's why I mean it. This is the first year that the selection
committee has put value on the NET. I don't think anybody in this room, I
don't think anybody in the country knows what that means. And so I'm not going
to -- if you take half of the people they're going to say certain teams should
be in, and others, certain teams shouldn't be in. But I feel good about us.

country, and so even though I don't think we played exceptionally well, a lot
of that is because I thought they did a tremendous job with what they do. We
didn't get any lobs, we had very few post touches, and then when we did throw
the ball in the post, they trapped us and they forced us into several
turnovers in the first half.  
  
But our guys have been resilient. They keep finding ways to win. We hit big
shots when we have to make them, we get stops that have been necessary, and
that just says a lot about the character of this team. They have a way of
finding ways to win games when we're not playing very well, and this was a
game that could have gone either way, but I have to give the kids a lot of
credit because the shots that we had to make, we made, the stops we had to
get, we got and we made the big plays down the stretch. The game could have
gone either way. My hat goes off to Virginia Tech. They're a really good
basketball team. We were very fortunate to win the game. Any questions?  
  
Q. Leonard, on your final play at the end of regulation they called
time-out; did you stick with your play or did you change plays?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: You talking about the shot that Terance made?  
  
Q. Talking about the three-pointer that tied the game to force overtime.
Did you stay with the original play or did you change plays?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: You're talking about the out-of-bounds play. We had four
options and Trent did a very good job of locating. We had options on the left
and options on the right, and I think with the lack of experience with
Vassell, I'm sure that they thought he was the -- would be the last option,
but he was open and he's a very confident freshman and he knocked the shot
down. And when it left his hand, Coach Gates said, it's going in, Coach, and
he was right.  
  
Q. For both the players, if you could each each walk us through the big
shots you each hit, Devin obviously to force overtime and then Terance in
overtime.  
DEVIN VASSELL: Coach just drew up a great play. Trent, he just found me open,
T-Man set a great screen and I caught it, and my teammates told me to let it
go if I got it, and so I just let it go and it went in.  
  
TERANCE MANN: For me when I caught it they were kind of jogging back on
defense, and I kind of caught it in a stride so I thought I was going to get
all the way to the basket and he kind of cut me off and I took the hit and
shot it, confident shot. Just let it go.  
  
Q. Did you think you were going to call timeout after that rebound
before Terance's shot because it looked like there was some debate?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: No, we didn't want to call timeout because it was in
transition and we couldn't have gotten a better shot than an open floor with
him with the ball in transition. I was going to live and die with whatever
happened as a result of that. He's very good in transition, he takes bumps, he
makes those plays after contact all the time. I thought like you said, I
thought he was going to get all the way to the basket and if I would have
called timeout I would have had to go against five guys, so but fortunately
for us the basket went in.  
  
Q. Terance, it was not easy shot you made there. What was your
confidence level as you were putting it up and what does it mean to you to be
the one to hit the show the that puts you into the semifinals?  
TERANCE MANN: It means a lot to me just to be able to be a senior, coming into
this tournament and winning another game, just survive and advance, doing it
with this team.  
  
Q. What was your mindset, your confidence?  
TERANCE MANN: Yeah, I was confident, I knew, it's not a shot I haven't took
before and Devin knows that, but yeah I was confident when I let it go. Yeah.
Definitely.  
  
Q. I know there's different schools of thought but before Devin's three-
pointer to force overtime did you expect Tech to play it straight or did you
think they might foul because it was a three-point margin?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well I'm sure that had the ball came, had the ball been
inbounded and we put the ball on the floor, I'm sure they would have fouled us
but that was a quick catch-and-shoot play and I'm sure that had we put it on
the floor, been driving to the basket there's no doubt that they would have
fouled us and we knew we had to get the shot off quick.  
  
Q. Terance, talk about the challenge of playing Virginia Tech for the
second time in 10 days, second straight overtime game.  
TERANCE MANN: I mean they're a tough team, they're a good team, they were well
prepared for us, they kind of keep us out of the paint, kind of keep us away
from doing what we do getting in the paint and stuff like that, but we knew it
was going to be a dogfight and we knew we had to bring our all and I think
everybody was kind of ready for that, mentally ready and we came out and did a
good job.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your bench today, you outscored them 33-7 and had
10 different players score today.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: Well, that's who we are, we're a team that has to win by
committee. We're not necessarily going into a game feeling that one particular
guy has to carry us. When someone's not playing as well as they're capable of
playing -- and they did a very good job tonight, forced us into 17 turnovers,
a lot of those because they trapped us and in double teams in the post and
they do such a good job of flooding the lane and we turned the ball over
several times because of their defensive system. We took more threes than we
normally take, but I feel very fortunate we made 12 when we normally have not
shot that well from the perimeter and if you are playing against a team who is
containing as much as they contained to hit 12 threes was good for us.  
  
Q. You led most of the game, I know y'all called a timeout after they
took their first lead. What was kind of the message at that point because
obviously the momentum seemed to be clearly on their side and yet you managed
to get into the over time and win the game.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: This team maintains their poise, they have a sense about
them that between ever seem to panic. They listen and they went out and
executed the instructions. This team has shown a tremendous amount of maturity
over the years. I think this is our, what, fourth over time game that we won?
Seemed as though they get more locked in the more intense the game becomes.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Frank Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34259)

### [Elijah Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32876)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 84, Syracuse - 72  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: I thought we really got off to a slow start. Their defense just
suffocated us, they were really aggressive. And then at the end, the last part
of the first half we stabilized a little bit and got back in it. Foul trouble
obviously was a problem with our big guys, but I thought we fought as hard as
we could. Williamson is a difficult guy, you really can't handle him in the
paint area, he's, I thought the second half we did a better job with him. But
overall we played pretty well, we got to the shooters, Jones hurt us with one
open three in the second half. But overall I thought we battled about as hard
as we could and very proud of the way we played. Duke is a tremendous team,
but I thought we did some things that were really good. And we think Tyus will
be back at practice probably Saturday, he's close, but he just couldn't go
today. It's swelling in his back and it's just not something he could go with.
But as far as what people were commentating on at halftime, I talked to Frank,
I looked at the video, there was no trip involved out there. I don't know who
was talking about that, but it was a bump and both guys fell and that's it. It
was nothing there. Trying to manufacture something out of nothing.  
  
Q. What are some things that you want to see improve going forward after
this season?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Pardon?  
  
Q. What are some of the things you want to see improve with your team
going forward after this season?  
JIM BOEHEIM: It's been a long year. I think we have done a lot of good things.
I think that it's, obviously it hurts not having Tyus here. He's a major part
of what we do. But I think that we're capable of playing with anybody, we
proved that tonight without Tyus. And I think that this league, you're playing
the 1 and 2 and 4, 5 teams in the country, and I think that helps you get
ready. I think we're ready for post-season. We have experience from last year,
we have gotten some of our young guys some really good experience, it's really
important -- this is the first game Paschal's got in this kind of foul trouble
early and some were just so silly fouls and one he wasn't involved in, but
that's just the way it goes sometimes. But he's important for us, to be in the
game. But I like the way we played this year and I think we're certainly
capable of being a very good tournament team. We're better than we were last
year.  
  
Q. With Tyus being out, are you pleased with the way that Buddy has
stepped in and played? And is your wife going to be demanding more playing
time now?  
JIM BOEHEIM: We don't talk about that anymore in our house. That's off limits.
We talk about my other son and my daughter. We talk about their games, we yell
at their coaches. But, no, Buddy's played well, I mean all he did was
extrapolate what he's been doing. He's been playing 14 minutes in the league
and averaging eight points a game. And in these two games he played 34 minutes
and he got, he averaged 16 or 17, which is exactly what he should do, given
you're doubling, a little bit more than doubling his minutes and he's
averaging seven, almost eight points a game in the league. So I don't think
there's any surprise there. I think he's getting better, I think he's getting
better with the ball. I told him he better, he needs to stop banking shots
unless he calls them, but he stepped up big here. He was really big yesterday
and he was, he was again exceeding expectations for what I thought coming in
to the year, his game has been really solid. Again, I think this will help him
and this will help our team, this tournament, tough games we played. We're
just not quite good enough against the 1, 2 and 4 teams. We played with them
for 20 minutes, 30 minutes, but we're not quite good enough against those four
teams and we aren't going to have to play those four teams for awhile, I hope.  
  
Q. Frank, you had 28 points tonight. You talked about after last night's
win being more aggressive. With Tyus's absence and with all the pressure that
Duke puts on how does that change hadn't how do you approach that defense?  
FRANK HOWARD: Tyus being out I knew I had to be a little bit more aggressive.
Around this time of the year I finally got my body right to feel comfortable
to attack and that's just what I've been trying to do, get in the lane and
make some plays and my teammates have helped me with that.  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think Frank's really picked up his shooting over the last two,
three weeks and tonight obviously we needed him to take a lot more shots and I
think he's very capable or that. Last night he did that. I think he's more of
a scorer now than he has been in a long time and this is what I thought he
would do early in the year until he got hurt. This is the way he was shooting
the ball. Again, going into the tournament, getting Tyus back, that gives us a
little bit more offense back there.  
  
Q. For the players, I know you played against a lot of great players but
when you watch Zion out on the court do you ever get like amazed at what some
of the stuff he does?  
ELIJAH HUGHES: He's a good player, I mean physical and yeah, he's just a good
player.  
  
FRANK HOWARD: As a competitor you don't want to say amazed because we still
have to compete but he's definitely a terrific talent, terrific athlete and
he's showing that.  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well he's a different player. There's not many, there hasn't been
anybody I've been coaching a long -- I've been in this game over 50 years and
I haven't seen -- I've seen a lot of great players, I'm not saying he's better
than those guys, but he's a different play. He can do things that nobody has
done in this game. I mean Charles, like I said, is, was close, but this guy's
bigger, stronger. And I mean he's crazy different type of player, there's not
guys like him. You have to have size with him and we don't have that physical,
physicality type of team for a guy like him. We played Duke as good as we
could play them without him. If he hadn't -- we played much better than we
played in Syracuse or different. We were really, we really played very good
basketball, but's different kind of guy. And I give my team credit, I don't
know how many we were down in the first half, but it was significant and to
come back the way we came back in that first half was a tribute to the
toughness of these guys. And our defense got better. As the half went on we
shut them down a little bit too. But again, this was good for our team.
Obviously we would like to have had Tyus for these games, but we know that
he'll be back full scale at practice, probably, I think Saturday, Sunday at
the latest. So he'll have plenty of time to get back. And he's played so many
minutes this year the rest is probably good for him.  
  
Q. For Frank or Elijah, what are some of the good things that you guys
want to take into post-season?  
FRANK HOWARD: Just this fight. Like coach said, this fight, that's what it
comes down to. We had some bad turnovers down the stretch, the one with me
down four. But just aggression and assertiveness, that's what we really want
to take.  
  
ELIJAH HUGHES: Yeah, pretty much piggyback off Frank. Complete every play, and
to be aware of some shooters, stuff like that. Just little things on defense
and then just mostly just fighting and competing every play.  
  
Q. Frank, not to belabor the point but I'm curious what your version or
how you saw that play unfold that obviously became a talking point at
halftime. And did you hear any of those comments and what you might have
thought of them?  
FRANK HOWARD: No, I mean I was just shown the video on the way out here. But I
mean if you said I'm trying to trip him, I don't get it. I saw the play, I
realized I tripped him, and I tried to give him a little hand at the same
time. I mean it's the heat of the game with a very tough defender on me, I was
trying to get open, get the ball and get the ball out fast and that's all I
really remember of the play. I just saw the video really quick, but he's a
hell of an athlete, hell of a player, I have a lot of respect for him, I'm not
going to wait four years to get to this stage to start tripping people.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Kyle Guy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32835)

### [Jack Salt](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33162)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Virginia 76, NC State - 56  
  
Q. Jack, what do you attribute your offensive contributions and three
three-point plays?  
JACK SALT: My teammates finding me wide open, they were extending on help and
they were being guarded by my man so they were just finding me and I was
getting easy looks at the rim.  
  
Q. Tony, when you told us you were holding Jack out trying to get his
back healthy, did you know he would be full go for this tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: We believed that, it's just a matter of can we get it to where
he feels as good as he can, and I thought these two guys were terrific today.
I even joked with the guys, I think I'm going to do a haka in the locker room
the way Jack played. But it looked like he was moving well and defending well
and we needed his physicality, and like he said, he caught, he finished that
one play in the second half where he hustled and made the up and under was
good. I've probably been holding him back from scoring, and he's showing it
now as we're getting into the postseason.  
  
Q. On the same track, has Jack shown that ability to score, and
obviously your offense, you've got established scorers, but he certainly had a
big day today when you needed him to.  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, he's a relentless worker, and Jack understands who he is.
He finishes when stuff is there. He gets offensive rebounds, and how he scored
was he just took what the game gave him unless there was a shot clock
situation. He's one of the best givers I've ever coached. He's just a giver,
and he gave today, and obviously he gave us production on the offensive end,
which was good scoring-wise.  
  
Q. Kyle, first game of the postseason under your belt; if you could just
describe your mindset and the team's mindset as you embark on the postseason
now.  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, just trying to have a laser focus and prepare for each game
like it could be our last, and I think that's an important step that we've
taken as a team. We're always happy when Jack can put up 18 points. So just
really happy with the team and even though we were down at half, how we fought
back and won.  
  
Q. Tony, what was the tone at halftime?  
TONY BENNETT: Well, we thought we were getting some good shots offensively in
the first half. We had a couple careless turnovers and a shot-clock violation.
We said, continue to tighten up the defense but take the shots when they're
there, and just run your offense hard, and we're in -- this is tournament
basketball. These are possession by possession games, and there's a
physicality that's there, so we just kept plugging.  
  
JACK SALT: Yeah, I mean, we were getting good looks and we weren't hustling on
the offensive boards. Coach Tony said we only had one offensive rebound, so we
had to pick that up. I tried to do a little bit of that, and the other guys
rallied and did a really good job.  
  
Q. Kyle, what do you think made it such a rough shooting night for the
rest of your teammates, and did you feel any pressure because that kind of
continued through the game to keep taking and hitting your shots?  
KYLE GUY: Well, you know, shots are going to come and go, defense is always
there, so I definitely felt, not pleasure, but that I needed to be a little
more aggressive when Ty's shot is not falling, but again, he runs the show and
had 10 assists, so even though he didn't shoot well, he did fine. Again, 18
points for Jack, we'll take that any day.  
  
Q. Two-part question: Tony, what was the impact of the two three-point
plays by Jack and four-point play by Kyle, and Jack, when was the last time
you had an offensive game like this?  
TONY BENNETT: The impact was big. You know, there's momentum. We needed those.
And it was, again, a possession by possession game the way it was going, so I
don't remember what those plays either got us in the lead or put us up by, but
those are just those X factor plays, again, an offensive rebound or an and-one
or a four-point play, so I think they were important.  
  
JACK SALT: I guess last year in the ACC Tournament against Clemson was
probably close to this, but I've not had a game like this at Virginia, so it
was pretty awesome to get that and for the guys to find me down low.  
  
Q. Kyle, considering the extended scoring drought that you guys had in
the first half, did you feel pretty good about going into the locker room only
down two? And what changed defensively in the second half to really kind of
get them off of their game?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, we're a team, I think I've been saying this phrase a lot, calm
is contagious, and it starts with Coach Bennett and ripples all the way down
to our first years. When we have experience, we can stay calm in these
situations. We never really worry. We know what we need to take care of, and
in the second half it was just buckling down on defense and making open shots.  
  
Q. Coach, NC State is this team that you guys went to overtime with
earlier in the season. Today they put up a fight in that first half, and a lot
of people were saying the game two days ago was a play-in game for them. Could
you talk a little bit about the fight with them and their credentials for the
tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think they're very quick and they really pressure the
ball, and what Markell did yesterday to come back and make the plays he did
was -- it was noticeable.  
  
They hurt us on the glass there, and they pressured us into some turnovers,
and we didn't play our best in certain stretches. Again, I thought we were
steadier in this game.  
  
This league is good. They're talented. They're athletic. They pretty much play
four guards all the time, whether it's Dorn at the 4 or whoever else they put
in. Again, I think they're a heck of a team. Coach Keatts does a great job,
and I'm not on the selection committee, but I believe the way this league is
and how they played, I would hope that they're in, but I'm the wrong guy to
ask.  
  
Q. Kyle, we saw you in the first half take the ball in the middle of the
court, pass on what looked like an open shot, read the defense and drive
inside. Do you think that ability to dissect defense is where your game has
grown the most this season?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, absolutely. We had a meeting, a coaches' player meeting after
every year and talk about what we need to work on and stuff, and creating my
own shot and creating for others was on that list. I always knew I could do
it, it was just getting the confidence and putting it to work like I did
today.  
  
Q. Jack, in the second half you had a dunk and then they called a
technical foul for hanging on the rim. You looked like you had a look of
disbelief on that call. Give us your impressions of that play?  
JACK SALT: Yeah, I haven't jumped from that far and dunked in a while, and so
I had to hold onto the rim or else I would have fell on my head, so I was
pretty surprised on that one.  
  
Q. Tony, I apologize for asking a big picture question, but at the Final
Four last year when you got your Coach of the Year Award, you said, you
mentioned the text from Ty Jerome about how UMBC was part of y'all's story
now, and that what was going to be the determining factor on how you went
forward was how you got better day by day. You're 29-2, so I'm guessing you've
managed to achieve that. Would you agree with that?  
TONY BENNETT: Yes. (Laughter).  
  
No, I think -- yeah, I think we've grown from that experience. We've owned it.
We've talked about it. We had a great year last year and a hard loss. But it's
time to press on, and there's not any more to say about that, and I'll get
asked and we'll answer the question, but it's time to press on and be as
focused as we can and just get good, but certainly grow from all your
experiences.  
  
Q. Jack, on the technical, even if you hadn't needed to hang on the rim,
at that point would you have possibly considered getting a technical anyway
for the career high? And also, I know New Zealand is bigger than they make it
look on Flight of the Conchords, but you're in North Carolina, do you know
Michael Campbell at all?  
JACK SALT: I don't know who Michael Campbell is.  
  
Q. The golfer?  
JACK SALT: Now that you say that, I recognize the name. I don't really want to
get texts to give an advantage to the other team, so I won't do that.  
  
Q. Tony, the double bye obviously is a good thing and getting the rest,
but do you think any of the issues in the first half were rust-related from
time off?  
TONY BENNETT: I think NC State played well. We talked about before the game
when you play a team that has a game under their belt, you've got to be really
ready. I'm not sure. I know we challenged our guys to be as ready as we can
with that in your first game, but NC State did a good job, and again, we did
some good things, it's just didn't make some shots with these guys kind of
kept us in there until we got our footing, so to speak.  
  
Q. Kyle, forgive me one last question about UMBC. You're playing on the
same floor. Did anybody say anything about that before the game amongst the
players?  
KYLE GUY: No, I think me and Jack had an advantage coming back here for media
day -- and you guys don't have to apologize for asking those questions, I'm
happy to answer them. Feels good to be back right here in this press
conference room where we were last time, and just like Coach said, ready to
press on and move on from it, learn from it.  
  
Q. Tony, everybody knows Kyle can shoot, but how does it change how
teams have to defend you when he's also slashing to the rim and fighting for
rebounds?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, Kyle is a complete, he's so efficient. You look at that
stat line, but he's deceptive with that as far as getting in there, and I
thought he made some terrific passes to guys, and he's unselfish, so yes,
that's a triple threat. Those kinds of things make a guy, if you just say, run
him off the line, run him off the line, you can't do that. So I think that
makes him and us more efficient and effective offensively.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [RJ Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36803)

### [Tre Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36243)

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Zion Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36804)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Duke - 84, Syracuse - 72  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We're obviously really pleased to advance. Getting, we still
don't have our full team back, but getting Zion back after missing almost a
month is huge. I thought we played great defense for about 12, 14 minutes in
the first half and then when we had some transition, we had about three in a
row where we didn't get, we made mistakes, we had a 15, 17 point lead and that
gave them some momentum and then they can shoot. They put a lot of game
pressure on us, our guys responded in the second half. Goldwire was a big
spark for us and because we had foul trouble. And Boeheim -- Buddy was really
shooting well and Goldwire, once he went in it was hard for him to get the
ball in a shooting position. So that helped. And these guys did a good job of
responding under pressure. So any questions that y'all might have, of them,
right.  
  
Q. Zion, elephant in the room, how are the shoes this game? How are the
shoes this game?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: The shoes were incredible this game.  
  
Q. Zion, give me a sense for just how badly you wanted to be out there
the last couple of weeks?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Forget about him. How badly I wanted him out there. Why is it
always about you?  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I don't know, ask them.  
  
Q. Just how much lobbying has there been between you and Coach K trying
to get back out there?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I've been holding him back. Go ahead. I promise I won't
interrupt you any more.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yeah, you're doing it right now. I mean I wanted to be out
there every game. You see me, I see my brothers out there battling and I just
wanted to go to war with them.  
  
Q. Zion, looking ahead to tomorrow night, what are your thoughts on
hopefully significantly being a part of the UNC-Duke rivalry finally?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I'm very excited just to be a part of the game and looking at
going to compete.  
  
Q. Zion, how much obviously we have, after you got hurt, there was all
this talk among other people about what you should do. Did you give any
thought to anything or was this sort of the moment in time that you always
envisioned you were going to be back, there was no question about it.  
ZION WILLIAMSON: There was no question about it, I knew I was going to be
back. Everybody has their right to their own opinion, but I knew I was coming
back the whole time.  
  
Q. I'm going to continue the theme and ask Zion a question. Zion, it
took all of two minutes and seven seconds for you to dunk the hell out of the
ball. What statement did you want to make early in this game?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I just wanted to play defense, get out in passing lanes and
just apply pressure.  
  
Q. Zion, about the shoes, I understand they were modified a little bit
for you. What was the modification to, for you to wear tonight?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I couldn't really specifically tell you if I wanted to. I
just know they're a little stronger than the regular Kyrie 4's, so I want to
thank Nike for making these, but, yeah, they felt very comfortable.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Also he alternates the shoes quicker, so you're not wearing
them too many games because the wear and tear, I think contributed to that
blow out.  
  
Q. You're going to face Carolina for the third time this season. What
can you take from the past two games that you played them, other than having
Zion back, what are the areas that you need to clean up against this team
tomorrow night?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well let's gets our head around it -- we'll get our
head around it tonight. We just finished a very intense game, so we'll come up
with a game plan tomorrow, tonight and tomorrow, and try to do a good job
against them.  
  
Q. RJ, how excited were you to get out there and just get back on the
court after the showing against Carolina and just kind of prove that you have
that game that you people talk about?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You guys are really something. He doesn't have to prove
anything. These guys are really good players, it's not, it's about being in
the moment. I'm sorry, I just, come on. Come on. You can answer. Whatever you
want.  
  
RJ BARRETT: No. I was excited to get back out there with my team. We have Zion
back so it was just a lot of fun.  
  
Q. For all three players. This is your first time getting in the March
Madness with the ACC tournament, the big tournament. Talk a little bit about
your feelings and your thoughts of the opportunity of playing here in post-
season play.  
TRE JONES: There's some nerves that come into ACC tournament tonight.
Obviously it's our first time. It's a win-or-go-home situation. But we were
able to come out with a lot of energy, play the way we like to play at the
start of the game and it just fell off our main game, but it's a lot of fun
playing games like these.  
  
RJ BARRETT: For sure, we grew up watching March Madness and these games as
kids, so to be a part of it is a great experience.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: What they said. Been watching it since we were kids and we're
very excited to be a part of it, because it's real now, like just living in
the moment because from now on it's win or go home.  
  
Q. Tre, as the point guard, the quarterback back of the team, how did it
change and how was it that you had this extra weapon to use in your offense?  
TRE JONES: Right it was back to, almost back to normal with Marques still
being out, but we were able to get Zion back and he was able to affect the
game so many different ways. Not only when he has the ball but when he's away
from the ball or on defense, he's able to affect the game as well, so it's
great having him back and we're able to feed off him a lot.  
  
Q. Tre, you had a quiet first half. Syracuse defense kind of shut you
down but you stepped up in the second half, so what changed. You came out with
15 points, so what changed?  
TRE JONES: My teammates kept believing in me, coaches kept believing in me as
well, kept telling me to take my shot when it comes, keep being aggressive. I
knew that I was going to have to step up in the second half for us to get back
to playing how we want to play. So I just want to thank my teammates and
coaches for still believing in me and I was able to step up for us.  
  
Q. Any of the players here, you guys have played against the two-three
zone of Syracuse a couple times now, gotten a feel of it after the first time
at Cameron. What is has changed after that first game and that loss?  
TRE JONES: I mean with their zone, not a lot has changed, they ran it for many
years now. We've played against it three times. I mean we were able to do
almost the same thing against it every single time.  
  
Q. I know because Zion can't necessarily speak specifically to the shoe
and obviously because of your and the university's close ties with Nike, what
can you tell us specifically about the conversations that the team and that
the program has had with Nike over the past month?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well we have a very close relationship with them. We
think it's the best shoe or else we wouldn't be with them. And right after the
event they sent their top people out here to figure out what went wrong, the
next day. And then those people went to China to actually look at the making
of a shoe that would be very supportive and then they came back within a week
with different alternatives to make sure that it was done right. So their
immediate, great response was appreciated and it was something that we have
grown to expect from our relationship with them.  
  
Q. Zion, when did you start feeling like you were ready to play again
and could this return have gone any better? You were 13-13 from the field and
pretty much a perfect night.  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I wouldn't say perfect night. Like couldn't really throw a
tennis ball into the ocean with my free throws, so I don't consider that
perfect. But I know I was ready to come back a few days ago. I got some reps
in with the team. But I would like to say this, there was never any pressure
for me to rush back when I wasn't ready. So I thank coach, the assistant
coaches and my teammates for that, they always told me come back when I'm
ready and I felt ready a few days ago and I mean it was good to get back.  
  
Q. Tre, your family, your brother is no stranger to the ACC tournament.
What are some advice that he gave to you concerning the tournament and how to
win it all?  
TRE JONES: Right. I mean he just told me to keep playing my game. I know when
he came to the ACC tournament I don't think, they didn't go very far, but
obviously with the NCAA tournament they were able to win it all, so I mean he
just told me be myself in these moments and then keep playing my game, try to
lead these guys.  
  
Q. Coach Boeheim was in here earlier and said he's never seen anybody
quite like Zion and somebody mentioned 13-13. That is the greatest shooting
performance in the 66-year history of this event. Are you running out of
comparisons and superlatives, because Boeheim called him a bigger, stronger
Charles Barkley.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I wouldn't, I wouldn't, first of all, I know Charles
and he's one of the greatest players ever. But all these kids, they need to be
themselves and they're forming their own identity. And I know the game and
sports is played that way, like who is he like, and for all three of these
guys, they're becoming. So I don't want them to be like anybody, I want them
to be them and become who they're supposed to be. They're still, they're
teenagers and they got a lot of, they've got a lot ahead of them. The
beautiful thing about them is they're the easiest group that I've had to
coach. And they love one another, they listen, and that's why I don't like to
say they're like somebody. Nothing against Jim. He, you know, in that regard.  
  
Q. I know you always live in the moment, but I couldn't help but think
of Ryan Kelly's return game watching Zion out there. I don't know if that
crossed your mind at all?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: The difference in athletic ability maybe caused me not to
think of that, but nothing against Ryan. But his were threes and but it's, I
get it, you know, it was neat to have him back for that Miami game and, but
it's even a little bit better having him back for post-season.  
  
Q. To David's point, Zion had a historic evening tonight. So quite
simply how would you describe what you saw from him this evening?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well he was himself, so let him be himself not like anyone
else, and just like all these kids. And then take advantage of the moment you
get a chance to see them as they're developing into the players that they're
supposed, that they're going to be. For me, I love the fact of being part of
that process for a short period of time and that's why I never try to make
them like somebody else. They didn't come to Duke to be a four or a three or
like Jason Tatum or Brandon Ingram, they came to see who they were going to
become and let's see what happens.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Buzz Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19411)

### [Kerry Blackshear Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36712)

### [Ty Outlaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36131)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Virginia Tech - 71, Miami - 56  
  
Q. Ty, what was it that got you so open especially early on in that 11-0
spurt when you were able to knock down those threes?  
TY OUTLAW: It was really just my teammates getting to the paint and being
aware that I'm ready to shoot whenever they kick it out. So we were just
getting into the paint with the plays we were calling, and I was just ready
for it.  
  
Q. How much of what you guys got you clicking on offense in the first
half was carryover from what you did well against Miami last Friday?  
TY OUTLAW: I think we did all right against Miami, but we didn't feel like we
played our best. We could have played way better, and that's what we focused
on today, playing our absolute best, not really depending on the opponent,
just worried about ourselves. I think we was clicking very well for a good bit
of the game.  
  
Q. Ty, you get that award right before you take the floor; your thoughts
on getting that award and what it means to you?  
TY OUTLAW: I've been through a lot. I'm glad they gave me an award for it, but
I wasn't doing it for an award, obviously, but it meant a lot. I always have
my team, my family, my friends supporting me, and just to be recognized for
it, all the stuff I've been there, was a compliment.  
  
Q. Ty was talking about the way you're playing inside and Nickeil
driving was opening things up for them. When they started hitting those threes
did things become easier for you to operate in the paint?  
KERRY BLACKSHEAR JR.: I think that we tried to attack early in transition that
helped each us. I think when you have teammates like ours, it makes the game a
lot easier from the start, whether we're hitting or not, because everybody is
a threat. We know that if somebody is hot, that's the person we're going to
find. We know that each person is going to make the right basketball play for
our team, whether that be taking their own shot, finding somebody else,
setting a screen, anything like that. It's just great to have teammates like
that.  
  
Q. Coach, you're about to have your fourth game in one week and you're
playing two opponents that you've -- two rematches. How do you feel about the
match-up against Florida State tomorrow afternoon?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: It's strange, right? We're living last week in reverse this
week. It's never happened. I agree with what Ty said. I think we were better
today than we were on Friday. Obviously a neutral site, new place. But it's
never happened, so it's hard for me to have the evidence on what to say. But
obviously we didn't do very well in the second half at Florida State. So
thankful that we have another chance.  
  
Q. KJ, they cut it to seven in the second half, then you score seven in
a row, you get a dunk, you get a three. What were you able to do in that
stretch to kind of gain the separation again?  
KERRY BLACKSHEAR JR.: I really didn't even know that I scored that much in a
row. Just in the flow of the game, we just found good looks. I thought that
the intensity on defense led to that run that they made, so I think we picked
it up there, then we were able to score in transition at the rim, and finding
each other on open shots. I think it started with defense on that run.  
  
Q. For both the players, if you guys could just speak to what did you
learn from the first Florida State experience, and then what are your thoughts
going into that match-up?  
TY OUTLAW: They're a very hard-playing team and they won't back down. It's
never over when you're playing against them until the last second goes off the
clock. But they have talent. They won't quit on you, so that's what we have to
take from the last game. I think we kind of relaxed, even though we tried not
to, relaxed a little bit too much and let them get back in it. We've just got
to respect them the whole game and not let up.  
  
KERRY BLACKSHEAR JR.: It's going to be a 40-minute dogfight. They're a very
talented, capable team. I think that we are, as well. I think it was a good
match-up. It was a tale of two halves, and if we keep the intensity that we
had similar to the first half for a whole 40 minutes, I think that it puts us
in a really good position to win at a neutral site.  
  
Q. Guys, what did you like about your defense today in terms of maybe
making it a tough shooting day for them, and you've beaten Miami three times
now; why is this a pretty good match-up for you guys?  
TY OUTLAW: You know, our whole defense is predicated on making guys shoot
threes and just having our hand up. They're very capable shooters. Of course
we did well of contesting, but we just game planned better. Like you said,
this is our third time playing them. We know exactly what to say. We've a
disciplined team. We have great coaches that tell us exactly what to look for,
so we just executed.  
  
KERRY BLACKSHEAR JR.: I think this year more than any other year I've been
here, we've carried out a specific defensive identity, and I think we've
gotten better at that each and every game. What we do defensively is pretty
much the same every game. We put different players on the floor for the other
team, obviously, but how we want teams to score and how we want to guard teams
is the same, so I think that helps each person grow each and every game.  
  
Q. Buzz, Coach Larranaga was in here earlier and he said, did Outlaw
even dribble the ball once today, and of course he did out on that fast break
drunk, but is an ideal situation where he rarely has to dribble because the
passing is so crisp and he's so open?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: I would say he would answer that yes. If he has space and he
has ten toes to the rim, I think he's an elite level shooter. The key is for
him to get space, but that space doesn't normally come from him, it comes by
penetration by someone else and forcing help. And so I think that was the
first dunk of his career off a steal at Virginia Tech.  
  
TY OUTLAW: Florida State, my first year playing at Tech, same thing, a steal.
But it's my second one.  
  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Two. Sorry I didn't remember.  
  
Q. When Ty had to go to the locker room, Isaiah came in and scored
seven. I think he's back to back games now with double figures. This is a guy
who came very late in the summer, like you've said earlier in the season. What
have you seen from his growth to just have this great performance today in the
ACC Tournament?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: It's the only player in my career that never attended summer
school that played the next year. And obviously, upon arrival, we weren't
worried about summer school because we did not anticipate that he was going to
play this year, and I think the trajectory of the importance to what he gives
us is unlike any player that I've seen at his age. I think he's the second
youngest player in Division I. So his maturity and handling those
responsibilities, and sometimes because he's old and K is old and Five is old
and Med is old, sometimes I think our language is so much that I do a poor job
of maybe educating Chico on, I'm sorry, I assumed you knew what that was. And
so that requires a very high IQ for him to even pick up and translate what it
is that we're saying.  
  
But he's meant a great deal to us, and I think maybe most importantly, his
energy off the bench has really changed us on both ends.  
  
Q. KJ, Florida State poses such a physical -- they're one of the biggest
teams in the league. What kind of a situation does that pose for you guys
where all your front court players will be playing against taller players?  
KERRY BLACKSHEAR JR.: I think they're probably like one of the biggest teams
in the country, but I think that's an advantage that every team is going to
have on us essentially. I think all the front court players are going to be
bigger. It's a fight that we've been preparing for each and every game. So no
different than any other game. We're going to watch film on them, figure out
how we're going to attack the glass, figure out how we're going to stop the
penetration, and simple as that, I think.  
  
Q. What do you need to battle from the first time in Tallahassee in the
rematch, and what do you need to do better from the second half in
Tallahassee?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: Yeah, similar to what K just said, some of that played itself
out in today's game, other than the third ATO. When we don't get in rotation,
that means we're able to keep the ball high on the floor, that means that
we're in the appropriate gaps. That means we at least have inside position to
rebound, and potentially it means that the shot that the opponent takes is
contested.  
  
Where we struggled is when the front line gaps are not doing their job, which
forces us into rotation. It's typically these two guys. And so now if they're
considered big, now our biggest guys are way out on the floor. And so the shot
is probably not contested to the degree we want it, and we're at a
disadvantage on the offensive glass.  
  
In the first half at Florida State, we were able to keep the ball high on the
floor and not get in the rotation. In the second half we did a poor job of
that, and their pressure really bothered us offensively the first eight or
nine minutes of the second half.  
  
Q. Buzz, I'm sure you'll understand with the success you've had these
things will come more and more, but there was a report linking you to Texas A
&M, that they would be interested in you. I'm curious, do you address that at
all with the guys and do you have any reaction to that report?  
BUZZ WILLIAMS: No, sir, I've never commented on jobs. I don't think that's
appropriate by our kids. Where I'm employed, that's just -- I can't control
what people say. I've got to make sure I'm doing my best with these guys.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Jordan Nwora](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36733)

### [Ryan McMahon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36734)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Louisville - 75, Notre Dame - 53  
  
CHRIS MACK: Well, coming into the game, we knew that the way that Notre Dame
could beat us were two things: Number one, Mooney. They're going to play
through him. They're going to use him as a 4, use him as a 5. We wanted to
make the game hard on him. I thought our guys did a terrific job. And the
second thing is we had to limit their three-point shooting as best we could,
and so we went for a lot of shot fakes in the first half knowing we wanted to
really run them off the line, and I thought our discipline was a little bit
better in the second half, and offensively really took care of the ball except
for maybe a two or three-minute stretch in the first half. But you know, we're
excited to play another day, and we know that we have a huge challenge in the
Tar Heels tomorrow. But it beats going home.  
  
Q. Coach, as you mentioned, tomorrow you play against UNC, you guys
split the season this year. What are your thoughts going into the game, and
how do you prepare for them tomorrow?  
CHRIS MACK: Well, when you play a team for a third time, both teams are going
to have great familiarity with one another. Coach Williams doesn't try to
trick you. They're going to try to race the ball up the floor. They're going
to try to pound it inside, and they're going to try to decimate you on the
glass. They did that in Game 2. They didn't do it as well in Game 1. But
that's going to be the answer for us if we're going to be able to be here as
winners tomorrow night, to be able to keep them out of transition, make it a 5
on 5 game, keep them off the glass. Again, easier said than done. They're one
of the best teams in the country, and we recognize that. But they don't try to
fool you.  
  
Q. Question for you, Coach, and you, Jordan. Coach, you mentioned that
Mooney was the focus of attention. What did you do? And Jordan, it looked like
you guys' length kind of bothered their inside shooters.  
JORDAN NWORA: Yeah, when we were preparing for them, Mooney was obviously one
of our main focuses, so just playing tough, not letting them back down.
Everybody did a great job of guarding them, 1 through 5 a lot of guys got
switched on to them. I don't think length played a big part in it. I think it
was just us being tough, just being tough this game, and not letting them get
to the rim at will, bully us in the paint, and that's what really helped us.  
  
CHRIS MACK: He does a really good job when he catches it in the long post,
turning and facing and sort of jab and creating space, and I thought our guys
didn't let that jab create the space. We really tried press up into him, force
him to dribble the ball, and hopefully we could have a second or third
defender at least close to the situation when he got close, and did a really
good job. Like Jordan said, it wasn't just one or two guys because when they
play him at the 4 we're going to switch a lot of his ball screens, so we had
point guards, and Darius did a great job, CC, all the guards were on him at
some point in the post.  
  
Q. Question for Coach: Keeping Carolina out of transition is one, and
the second question is you defeated them at home. How do you think the
hometown crowd will be tomorrow night?  
CHRIS MACK: Well, it's going to be obviously pro-Carolina. I'm hoping the Duke
fans get excited, too, for the Louisville Cardinals. But keeping them out of
transition, we've got to score. We can't turn the ball over. If we have live
ball turnovers like we did at the end of the first half, that's going to put
one of the fastest teams in the country in the open court. So we have to do a
great job with our ball security, and then getting numbers ahead of the ball.
White is a blur in transition, his bigs are going to run, and they're going to
spread you with shooters.  
  
As I told these guys before, we've done it. It doesn't make it any easier
tomorrow night, but that's the first thing that we have to take care of if we
put ourselves in position to win.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the importance of being able to rest some of your
players tonight and to play a lot of people knowing you had to come back and
play a big tough game tomorrow night.  
CHRIS MACK: Well, I thought our bench played great. It's always easy to play
more guys when they're playing as well as they did. I thought Ryan obviously,
despite the turnover there in the first half, shot the eyes out of it. We ran
a few plays for him. You know, it's nothing that we don't expect. If he gets
some daylight, we feel like it's going in. Thought V.J. King and Darius Perry
gave us great minutes, so when they're effective they're going to play more.
It really didn't have anything to do with trying to rest them for tomorrow
night. We extended the lead when our substitutes were in there so we're going
to go with the hot hand and the guys that were getting the job done, and those
guys certainly were tonight.  
  
Q. Jordan rebounding against Notre Dame tonight and the last time you
guys played them was really good for you guys and was kind of the down fall in
the second game against UNC. Do you feel like there's something you've been
doing the past couple games that's led you guys being better on the boards or
is it just kind of match-ups with this Notre Dame team?  
JORDAN NWORA: I think just his last couple of games we've been locking in and
focusing on boxing out. I'll call myself out. There are times I didn't do a
great job boxing out and they get on me for it. There are a lot of times I
don't do a great job boxing out and they get on me for it. It's just us boxing
out and just being tough and being physical with guys. We can't get bullied,
like I said earlier, and that's really the key to battling these guys on the
glass.  
  
Q. I just want to get the players' thoughts on Carolina tomorrow and the
kind of challenges they present.  
RYAN MCMAHON: Well, they just play fast, and their men on the glass, those are
the two keys to the game, honestly. Like Coach said, they're one of the
fastest teams in the country. We've got to cake care of the ball and not give
them any easy points.  
  
JORDAN NWORA: Yeah, I'm just going to go with what he said, just got to keep
them out of transition and fight them on the glass. Those are going to be the
two keys to the game. If we want to have a chance, we're going to have to do
that.  
  
Q. Ryan, you said the other day that you hoped this tournament would
kind of be a fresh start for you guys. Did you feel like how you played
tonight lended itself to that?  
RYAN MCMAHON: Yeah, I mean, the postseason is kind of a season of its own. You
see some teams that really were in a funk and they can get out of it, or they
weren't in a funk and then get in one. We've been pretty conscious of that and
have been really dialed in and locked in and having had a couple great weeks
of practice, and we're excited for our upcoming games.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Jim Larrañaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30874)

### [Dejan Vasiljevic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36693)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Virginia Tech - 71, Miami - 56  
  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: I thought Virginia Tech got off to a great start right out of
the blocks. They jumped on us, had an 11-0 lead. It took us to while to get
started, and at halftime we had dug ourselves a huge hole. I thought to start
the second half we were much more poised and focused on executing our game
plan and did a really good job, cut the lead to seven, and actually had a
wide-open three that would have cut their lead to four, and had that happened,
I think that could have made the difference. But right after that, it went
from seven up to 14 again and kind of took the air out of our balloon.  
  
Q. Jim, did what made them trouble to guard in the first two meetings
this year, similar situation to today?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Yeah, they do the same things. They don't change from game to
game, they move the ball extremely fast to basically four guards on the
perimeter and a big guy who can really handle. All five guys shoot the three.
They spread you out. Their touches, where it's in your hand and out of your
hand without dribbling, gives them a chance to get open shots. The defense
can't move as fast as the ball can.  
  
When they're making their shots, they're going to score a lot of points.  
  
Q. You talked about their three-point shooting going into this one. In
that 11-0 spurt that started the game, did you guys lose track of Outlaw, or
what did you see on those three early makes that he had?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: He's really good, and they're really good at finding him. So
the problem occurs in basketball when somebody has to help you. If you can
just guard your own man, then Outlaw is not open, but when someone is getting
beat because Alexander Walker is so good at putting pressure on you or
Blackshear is so good at putting pressure on you that you have to help on
them, then they just find the open man. Outlaw doesn't dribble. Did he take a
dribble today? I don't think so. But that's -- whether it's Hill or Outlaw,
their game is catch and shoot, and they're really, really good at it, and
Walker and Blackshear and Bede are really good at creating situations where
you have to help or the guy is just going to go by you and shoot a lay-up.
When you do help, you're too late recovering to them.  
  
Q. Jim, I know we see it all the time, Chris Lykes' contribution, but
could you speak to that today, and how is he doing after that spill he took?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Yeah, he ends up -- he's getting his ankle X-rayed, hoping it's
not bad, but I'm not optimistic. He went down really, really hard.  
  
Q. What takeaways do you take from this season? Obviously not the way
you wanted to finish, but obviously some building blocks and young players for
the future. How do you look at your program moving forward?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Well, first of all, it was very, very challenging to really
have only seven scholarship players available to us, and was very hard to
prepare and practice properly because even amongst those seven players, they
were dealing with injuries. Ebuka Izundu's back, D.J.'s back, Zach Johnson
didn't play in the second half because of a knee injury that happened
yesterday. But he's been dealing with that knee situation since he arrived at
Miami in the summertime.  
  
He actually sat out an entire month trying to rehab that knee so he could
actually play during the season, and he's been in the training room for hours
every day so that he can show up and play. And then just before the Carolina
game, he sprained the ankle.  
  
When you have so many physical issues that you're dealing with, there's very
little preparation. Most of it's mental. A lot of it's just like a walk-
through. And then those guys have to play 35 minutes or more. You look at
Chris Lykes played 31 minutes, D.J. played all 40, Anthony Lawrence 38. I
mean, that's game after game after game, and it's just very, very challenging.  
  
But as far as the future is concerned, we've got a good group coming back. We
have two good recruits coming in, and we're still very actively involved in
recruiting several players.  
  
Coming into this year, we were picked 10th, finished tied for 11th, but I
thought we could have finished in the top five before the season started. I
really was very optimistic.  
  
But when we lost all those guys, when we lost those four kids, it was near
impossible.  
  
Q. Jim, that's fewer points than you've scored in either of the regular
season meetings against Tech. Were they doing things better or differently
today?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: That was the fewest number of points they scored, too. They
only scored 71, the last time they had 82 and 84. So we went zone. Now, if you
watched us during the season, in the last probably eight games, we didn't play
a single possession of zone. But the way they started the game, we ended up
with guys in foul trouble. We went to the zone trying to slow them down. It
actually slowed the whole game down so there was probably fewer possessions
today.  
  
Q. D.J., can you just speak to the challenge their perimeter shooters
presented and what you guys learned in past games that you tried to apply
today?  
DEJAN VASILJEVIC: I mean, they played with four guards pretty much, and even
Blackshear can shoot the three, so they spread it out pretty well and they
share the ball and makes it tough for us, but as Coach said, once we went to
the zone we slowed the game down and they're a great team, full credit to them
and we've just got to finish the season now and look forward to next season.  
  
Q. D.J., I think you guys shot 33 percent today. Did their defense do
certain things to make it a tough shooting day for you?  
DEJAN VASILJEVIC: I mean, yeah, if we shoot 33 percent, that affects -- their
defense it had an effect on us, but we've gone through so much adversity this
season, guys are tired, some of my open shots weren't going in, just not
getting my legs under it. But full credit to Virginia Tech; they came out and
played hard.

### [Torin Dorn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34987)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
NC State - 59, Clemson - 58  
  
KEVIN KEATTS: So guys, what a great ACC game, especially to open up on
Wednesday when you talk about a 12:00 noon game. I told these guys I don't
think they woke up until about 1:00 and we started to plan. We didn't do a
great job in the first half. I thought we played on the back of our heels, and
consequently you look at it, Clemson jumped out to a 16-point lead at half,
and we gave up eight three-pointers which traditionally we're a good three-
point defensive team. We talked about halftime, it wasn't about X's and O's,
it was about how much heart and desire and effort you would put into it, and I
told them, I said, if you played extremely hard, we'll come out with a win,
and these guys were special. Markell, I thought he was tremendous down the
stretch. He made big threes, and then obviously sealed the game by making two
big free throws. But great win for us, and we survive and advance. Questions?  
  
Q. Phil just announced that you guys had the second largest comeback in
ACC history. What did you say during halftime to get your guys rallied to come
back?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, we were all disappointed. The team that you saw in the
first half was not NC State basketball, and for us to get to this point and
play that way we did in the first half, we wasn't happy. So honestly, it was
-- I'm not a guy to yell all the time, but there was a little yelling going
on, and give these guys credit. I thought they responded.  
  
Q. Coach, I think my question similar to that, I was going to say, what
was the message that you were able to deliver to keep these guys in a positive
frame of mind to where they could mount such a gigantic comeback?  
KEVIN KEATTS: We talked about play as hard as you can for 20 minutes and we'll
live with the results. That being said, I knew if we came out and defended the
way we were capable of, then obviously we would have a chance to win the game.
Like I told you, Markell made big shots down the stretch. I thought Jericole
Hellens made a three for us down the stretch and Devin Daniels and I can point
to every guy in that locker room that played for NC State and not for each
other.  
  
I thought in the first half we pounded the ball too much. We didn't share the
ball. We didn't outplay in ball movement, and we cleaned that up in the second
half.  
  
Q. Markell, take us through the last 20 seconds or so when they had
three fouls to give and were fouling you, and did you feel like the last foul
was in the act of shooting, and talk about the pressure free throws that you
had to shoot one at a time with like two minutes apart?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Are you really going to ask do you think that foul was in the
act of shooting? 100 percent it was.  
  
MARKELL JOHNSON: Yeah, going back on that, I definitely think it was, and just
going back on the free throws, I've been in a situation like that versus
Virginia, and I just wanted to just give it back to my team for what I did in
Virginia the first game, and that's make the free throws.  
  
Q. Torin, a lot of talk about bubble status and NCAA Tournament hopes.
Did you guys think much about that going into today, about not losing a game
that could really hurt you in Selection Sunday, or were you focused on that at
all?  
TORIN DORN: We don't really try to focus on things like that, we try to let
the powers that be handle that and we just play and focus on the next game
next game next opponent.  
  
Q. Markell, could you go through that final play? They had fouled you a
couple of times and still had one more foul to give. What were you looking for
there, and how did you execute that getting in there when they did foul you?  
MARKELL JOHNSON: I was just trying to take the best shot as possible getting
into the lane, and he just fouled me.  
  
Q. Did you think they might try to foul you again with a foul to give?  
MARKELL JOHNSON: Yeah, definitely. I was already thinking that in my head,
that they might foul me again.  
  
Q. Markell, at the 5:38 mark when you hit the three that gave you the
lead, you smiled. What was going through your mind at that time? Did you know
you guys were in it?  
MARKELL JOHNSON: Yeah, I knew my teammates had my back from whatever, like
from when I shot that three. They had my back the whole game, but they really
boosted me. They really helped me. They encouraged me to keep going there down
the stretch.  
  
Q. Torin, for you to be from here and to be a part of a win like this in
this building, in your city, what's that like for you?  
TORIN DORN: You know, it's special being from here and being able to get a
first win in the ACC Tournament and us being in a similar situation, being
down and coming back and falling a little short in the tournament and being
able to come back this year, falling down and being able to pull it off was
good for our team, and it shows a mature team and a team that's growing.  
  
Q. For the players, you guys had to expend a lot of energy to come from
16 down to win this game. Now you have to turn around and face a top seed in
less than 24 hours. Conservation of energy? What's it going to be like for you
guys tonight? And Coach, if you want to weigh in on this, as well, how do you
keep your guys fresh for tomorrow?  
TORIN DORN: We just turn the page and get ready for the next game, take all
the necessary steps to get our bodies right. But this is something that we
prepare for. We just practice extremely hard, and it's kind of an identity for
us, so we just get back and get some rest and get prepared for tomorrow.  
  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, I would say everybody is going to do through the same
situation. Obviously Virginia has a bye that they've earned, a double bye, but
when it comes to tournament time, I think we have a team that's built for
that. I've got nine guys that right now I feel like I can put in the game and
be ready to contribute right away. What'll happen is we've got to use some
more guys and try to shorten some guys' minutes.  
  
Q. Earlier this week you talked about how you liked the tournament being
in Charlotte and how you'd potentially like it to be in Raleigh. Just by the
crowd and the ovation you guys were getting as you were making that comeback,
what is your impression of the crowd and how they came out to support you
guys?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, let's start off with this: This is the best tournament in
college basketball. Everybody knows it. When I was growing up, I used to love
to come to this tournament, when I was a prep school coach I would love to
come to this tournament. Now that I'm coaching in the ACC, I don't think
there's anything better than this.  
  
I said those things because obviously I think this Carolina, the state of
Carolina is where this tournament deserves to be.  
  
Now, if it moves somewhere else, then certainly we're going to go. But our
fans were great. We travel well. We've got a passionate fan base, and that's
what I love about our fans.  
  
Q. Markell, that time-out between the two free throws gave you some time
to think. What was kind of running through your mind in the huddle and then by
yourself while you were waiting to shoot that second free throw?  
MARKELL JOHNSON: Really just making it. That was the only thing going through
any mind, stepping up to the line, being confident and knocking it in. That
was really it.  
  
Q. Knowing the last game that you played against UVA, that game going
into overtime, how much confidence do you have going into this one knowing the
game plan that you had last time nearly worked?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, you know, we say this all the time. I think styles make
fights. But I think my team is very confident. Our last two games we were able
to go on the road and play great defensively against Boston College, and we
held them to 26.7 percent, and then we put together a great second half,
obviously, today, and so we're going in as a confident team. We know that
they're a very good basketball team. We respect -- Tony has done a tremendous
job with their program, but our guys are excited to play.  
  
Q. Defensive rebounding had improved against Wake Forest and against
Boston College today and in the second half especially, Clemson got a lot of
second shots. They didn't always make them, but they kind of prolonged your
taking over the game. How do you shore that up for tomorrow?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, we've got to do a good job. You know this because you've
followed us all year. We're not the biggest team, and so we have to do a great
job of gang rebounding, all five guys gotta do a great job of rebounding, and
that's something that we've to clean up.  
  
Q. What's Eric Lockett's availability for this ACC Tournament?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, I don't know yet. It wouldn't be fair to say because he
hasn't practiced with our team yet, and so I couldn't even tell you what type
of shape he's in.  
  
Q. Torin, there were a couple more seconds today, but against Georgia
Tech, the inbound pass, the receiver caught it with a good head of steam
heading in toward his front court. Today Reed did not. Did you guys
specifically try to keep that from happening, and could you go through your
defensive mindset on that play?  
TORIN DORN: Our defensive mindset was just to keep the guys in front and not
fouling and force a tough shot like we did. I think that you never want to
lose a game like that, but us losing that game against Georgia Tech helped us
today, being able to clean those things up towards the end of games.  
  
Q. Kevin, you made a point, it might have been even the Clemson game the
first time, about the way you guys play, that you can be in any game, that
this team could hang around with the style of play. I'm curious how much that
helps you think in that situation today when you're down big in the first
half, that if they do what they do, you know that they can get back in the
game?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, I think this team is built for that. We don't want to -- I
think somebody said that was the second largest comeback in ACC history. I
don't want to be in that position all the time.  
  
Our guys' mind and mental, they think that they can win every game. That's
great going in. We've only got four guys who have really participated in any
postseason play, would be these two guys and then C.J. Bryce and Braxton
Beverly. So I've challenged these guys to take ownership in their team and to
will the other guys a win. But I like our guys. I like how hard we compete.
There's no quit in us.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

### [Jared Wilson-Frame](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34812)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Syracuse - 73, Pittsburgh - 59  
  
JEFF CAPEL: You know, our record isn't indicative of how hard we fought this
year, and the thing that I feel that these guys on this team and in that
locker room did was that they gave our program hope. And that's something
that's really, really important, and so I thought we took some major steps
forward as a program, and we'll use these lessons that we've been through, and
there have been some very tough lessons at times, but they've helped us become
better and grow. This guy next to me believed from day one, from the time it
was announced I was hired, I called him that night we had a conversation and
he was all in, and he and I had some very tough conversations, I was very
honest of my assessment of him from afar as a player. I didn't know him as a
person so I couldn't comment on that. And when I got there, we met, we talked,
and right away, he committed to changing.  
  
And I think he's had a great -- I thought he had a great senior season. I wish
we could have helped him get more wins, but his leadership, his buy-in,
everything that you'd want from a good player and from a senior. And so I'm
really proud of him.  
  
I hate that it ended like this. Our season is abrupt. It ends abruptly. Our
season ended today, but I will remember this group for the group that gave
this program hope again.  
  
Q. In the second half where did you see things kind of break down, and
how much of an impact do you think there was from this being y'all's second
game in a 26-hour span?  
JEFF CAPEL: (No audio.) And then I thought that affected our defense, our
inability to score and our hesitancy I thought made us not as in tune to what
we were trying to do defensively in the second half.  
  
And they got momentum right away. I think they scored on their first four or
five possessions, and they got a lot of confidence, where in the first half I
thought our defense was terrific.  
  
We had some breakdowns in the second half right away early, and they got the
momentum, and I thought we got deflated a little bit. But we continued to
fight.  
  
But they're a good team, and they have veteran guys, although they were
missing their best player. They still have guys that were part of a Sweet 16
team and have been really good players in this league. And then Boeheim
stepped up and hit some big shots for them.  
  
I just thought that they played better than us in the second half.  
  
Q. Jeff, do you think their size or the big lineup they used in the
second half gave you some problem altering a lot of shots you took?  
JEFF CAPEL: Yeah, I think so. This is the third time we've played them, and
they've been bigger than us every time, so it's bothered us every time,
especially at the basket. They're tough to score at the rim, especially if you
don't have guys that can play above the rim and have confrontations at the rim
with them.  
  
You know, in the first half, look, this guy made six threes. That was the
difference in the first half, and it opened some things up and we were able to
couple things right there in the mid range, we were able to get the ball to
the high post area and make some plays. In the second half they kind of
adjusted their zone and kind of sloughed off everyone except for him, so it
made it a little more difficult to get into the high post. When they did, they
kind of forced us to the basket and the big fella was there to clean up a lot
of stuff. So their size did bother us.  
  
Q. Jared, I noticed looking at the stats sheet you're the only Pitt
player that played 40 minutes tonight. You led the team in scoring. Do you
feel like you left it all out there?  
JARED WILSON-FRAME: You know, that's just something I try to do every day.
Like he said, from day one, the conversation that we had, that was something
he mentioned to me and that was something I told him I wanted to do. It was
something I felt like I had a problem with before, and I was on myself just as
hard as he was, and I just tried to leave it all out there on the floor for my
guys, everybody on the team. I love this group, so...  
  
Q. Jeff, you touched on Tyus Battle a little bit and they did have Buddy
Boeheim today and he's known as a shooter but he did a couple of other things
against you guys too. How effective was he today?  
JEFF CAPEL: He was terrific. I think he likes playing against us. He's had his
best games, I think, against us. He was terrific. We wanted to make him put
the ball on the floor. He did that a couple times. He kept a couple
basketballs alive getting to the offensive glass, and obviously with him being
able to shoot the ball like that, he can stretch you out, now all of a sudden
you're playing in close-outs. He's improved from the first time we played him.
I thought the first time he was more of just a shooter. I think he's made an
adjustment, and you can tell the staff has worked with him on doing other
things besides just being a three-point shooter, and he's got a mid-range game
now, he can play off of a shot fake, one or two bounces, get into a spot. He's
big, and he's got good size.  
  
When you can shoot the ball like that, that's a big-time weapon, and it opens
up so many other things in your game.  
  
Q. I was curious, are you all planning on pursuing any potential
postseason opportunities, whether it's the CBI or anything like that?  
JEFF CAPEL: I don't know how that works. I've never been in a position like
that, so I don't know how that works. With our record, I don't know how that
works.  
  
Q. I was just wondering, I kind of asked the same question to your
women's basketball coach last week, you guys are kind of in similar situations
where you inherited new teams this year. What sort of foundation did Jared and
Sidy and some of those veteran players kind of set for you going forward in
your tenure here?  
JEFF CAPEL: Well, the thing we tried to do was establish how hard we have to
play. You know, you have to fight to be good. It doesn't just happen. And you
have to show up every day, and there's an investment that you have to make, A,
in order to become a really good player, and then B, to become a really good
team. And that's something, to be quite frank, none of these guys knew about.
They didn't understand the investment that it takes to make that happen.  
  
And so I don't compare our program to anyone else. I compare it to us and to
what we're dealing with. And so it was teaching everything, and so I thought
we took some steps there in how hard you have to work individually and
collectively.  
  
It's hard to win. It does not just happen. You know, you have to show up every
day. You have to fight every day. There has to be an investment of time, of
commitment, of taking care of your body and things like that. All those things
that we have to learn, and again, I thought we took some steps. We're
certainly not anywhere close to where we want to be, but I think we're better
than we were -- it was almost a year ago when I walked into this job. I think
we've made big-time steps.  
  
Q. You've touched on this some, but for Jeff as a coach and for Jared as
a player, what is it with -- in all likelihood over now -- what is it you take
away from this season?  
JARED WILSON-FRAME: Like I said to you a couple weeks ago, I just see the
growth that we've all made, first as men, especially as young men, and then as
basketball players. You know, under Coach Capel, under the rest of the staff,
they've done a great job of building this program back to where it needs to
be, and I have the utmost confidence that in these coming years it's going to
be way better than everyone even expects, and we expect it to be in good hands
for the rest of these years, but I think it's actually even going to be better
than people expect.

### [Brad Brownell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21640)

### [Marcquise Reed](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28664)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
NC State - 59, Clemson - 58  
  
BRAD BROWNELL: We obviously didn't execute things in the second half very
well. I thought kids on both teams really competed at a very high level. Proud
of the way our guys fought and really disappointed with the way the game
ended. Really disappointed with the way the game ended. Too much at stake for
things to end like that.  
  
Q. Obviously you don't want to see two free throws to determine it. What
was your viewpoint on that foul, and --  
BRAD BROWNELL: Just thought it was a tough, tough play for us. Very
disappointed with the way the game was ended.  
  
Q. You had another foul to give, and you had been giving them. What made
you decide not to and let them play it out there?  
BRAD BROWNELL: We were trying to. It's not as easy to get to a guy like that.
We obviously got to him four times, one with Eli, I'm not sure, with maybe we
did. But he just -- he got away and made a play down the lane and got a very
good call.  
  
Q. There was a situation where they reviewed who touched the ball last
and NC State was awarded possession. There was another dead ball situation
that was not reviewed. They just called it NC State's ball. Did you feel that
should have been reviewed?  
BRAD BROWNELL: I don't know. I didn't think enough about it at the time to
think it needed to be. I think I thought it was NC State's ball. You know, no.  
  
Q. Marquise, in the second half, was it more them raising their
defensive level of intensity, or was it a matter of you guys kind of maybe
losing a little bit of intensity?  
MARCQUISE REED: We just didn't execute like we should have second half. That
was it. It wasn't nothing their defense did special.  
  
Q. For either of you, did you get the shots that you wanted in the
second half? Was it a matter of them not falling or were there some shots that
maybe you would have rather not taken?  
BRAD BROWNELL: No, I thought there were some threes. We talked in a couple of
huddles about that we were settling for some jump shots. Obviously it was hard
for us, Eli didn't have a good game today and was in some foul trouble and
couldn't really get a rhythm. Credit their kids for that. I thought their guys
did a really good job of playing Eli. But there were some times, yes, within
the second half that we settled for jump shots, whether it was a long two or a
three. Some of them were open, but there were a couple huddles where we were
constantly talking about getting the ball to the paint, making more plays at
the paint. We did some and occasionally we got a call, but we didn't do it
enough.

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Louisville - 75, Notre Dame - 53  
  
MIKE BREY: You know, give -- I thought Louisville was really good, and just
kind of wore us down physically. We didn't have much left in the tank. But I
thought, again, Louisville, especially on the offensive board, really hurt us,
like they did in Louisville 10 days ago.  
  
Q. Mike, what can you take -- I know you had a lot of adversity and a
lot of injuries, but what positives can you take from this year?  
MIKE BREY: Well, I do feel good about how our young guys played yesterday, for
us to come down here and to win a game in the tournament after a really tough
regular season. You know, and our young guys got to play a lot. We played
them. We didn't get the best of results wins-wise, but they got experience.
They got minutes. But we certainly need to get healthy, and we need to get a
lot stronger. You know, it's a great strength training summer for us.  
  
Q. It just seemed like their length bothered you --  
MIKE BREY: A lot.  
  
Q. Did it bother your shooting, as well?  
MIKE BREY: It did. You can talk about you're not shooting well, you didn't
make shots. That's Louisville. They really do guard you. It was different than
-- Georgia Tech played us zone so you could move a little freer and you got
looks. The looks we got, there was somebody athletically closing out all the
time. And that's how they play. Chris has done a fabulous job, and they really
have physicality. I mean, they have got bodies that can get out to you.  
  
You know, what you think is a good shot, I'm not sure we had as many good
shots as we thought.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Franklin Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36743)

### [Elijah Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32876)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Syracuse - 73, Pittsburgh - 59  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: We thought yesterday in the walk-through that Tyus had a
reasonable chance to play today, then when he came in, he was worse. He fell
on his back. It's just a bad bruise. We thought he had a chance today, but
he's probably realistically two or three days away from being able to play, I
think.  
  
I think that the story of tonight's game, these two guys stepped up, and when
you lose your best players, somebody has to step up. These two guys did a
great job. We started the game and let Frame get too many looks, and I thought
that was the difference in the second half. We got him and then Paschal did a
good job when they got the ball in the middle. He did a good job of making it
hard for them to score in there.  
  
But Pittsburgh plays -- Jeff has done a great job with that team. They play
the whole game, come at you. Frame has always hurt us, and he certainly did
tonight, as well.  
  
But this was a really good win. I thought everybody had a part in it,
especially these two guys. When we got down, they made some big shots to get
us back in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about the lift that Buddy gave you
and the tall line-up in the second half seemed to give you a spark.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, Paschal is a key for us, no question. Marek has done a good
job all year for us in the middle of the zone, making plays out of there. We
handled their pressure very well and got the ball in the middle.  
  
But Buddy is a very good shooter. He's shot it well all year. He's only really
played about 14 minutes a game, and he's averaged almost eight points a game
in that 14 minutes. His mother tells me he should be playing more all the
time, every day, but he's been well-prepared to be able to step up in this
kind of game.  
  
He really turned the game in the second half when he hit those two right off
there. But he's a very good -- he's becoming better. He's moving the ball,
passing the ball better. You know, he's getting better all the time.  
  
Q. Elijah and Frank, with Tyus out, when you guys found that out, sort
of as scoring and veteran leaders, how did you feel you had to step into a
little bit bigger role?  
FRANKLIN HOWARD: To be honest, it wasn't too much to change. We all knew what
our roles are. Just had to step up a little bit more on the defensive end and
offensively, attack a little bit more, make some more plays. But we were
prepared. Coach did a great job of giving us a scout and went out and
executed.  
  
ELIJAH HUGHES: Yeah, pretty much what Frank covered. Coach said some guys got
to make a few more plays, and I feel like me and Frank did a good job and
Buddy, as well, and everybody stepped up and made big plays, whether it was on
defense or offense.  
  
Q. Jim, did you change anything on defense in the second half, or was it
just getting out on Frame?  
JIM BOEHEIM: No, like the last four games that we had the lead at halftime, I
tried to start coaching at halftime. Tonight I decided not to coach at all,
and so they went out and made the adjustments.  
  
We knew all along we had to guard Frame and we didn't, and then we did. That
was the difference. The difference in the game was that, and then Paschal in
the middle. Those were the two things defensively. Instead of scoring 36, they
scored 23. But offensively we moved the ball better than we have in the second
half, and we made some shots.  
  
Again, both -- all three times we've played Pittsburgh, they've been right
there all three games. They come at you really hard, and for a young team,
they're smart, they get the ball where they need to, and Frame has always hurt
us. I said -- I congratulated him and said, I'm glad you're a senior; I've
seen enough of you here.  
  
Okay, thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2019

  

### [Josh Pastner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22043)

### [Moses Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36694)

### [James Banks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36695)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 78, Georgia Tech - 71  
  
JOSH PASTNER: First off, want to give obviously Notre Dame credit, Coach Brey
and his staff and players. He's one of the best coaches in the country, and
they've got a really good team, and Mooney is very, very good. There's no
question about that.  
  
Secondly, they shot the daylights out of it the first half. We were just on
our heels, in a sense, and they were just making those threes. We dug
ourselves a hole, but as the year has been, we have fought, scrapped and
clawed our way back every game, and it was no different this game. We found a
way to get back in. We just dug ourselves such a deep hole that it was hard to
dig out of.  
  
But we gave ourselves a chance, and that's all you can ask for. Our guys have
played their tails off for this program all year long. You know, I was really
proud of Moses Wright, the way he has gotten better towards the end of the
season. He's continued to improve. James Banks the second half was obviously
at a high level for us and led the ACC in shot blocking and was all-defensive
team.  
  
It was a tough loss. We've got to have a great off-season this off-season and
spring, summer, fall. We've got to get better, got to keep improving. We'll
obviously be older as we go into next season. But to wrap up for this year, I
was proud of our young men in terms of the effort, energy, fight that they've
given this program every game, but obviously losing stinks, so we'll get back
to the drawing board and get back at it.  
  
Q. Josh, it seemed like they had a really great plan for attacking your
zone and kind of used Mooney, kind of a dose of your medicine with the high
post and kicking it out.  
JOSH PASTNER: It's a disadvantage of playing them -- this is the seventh time
we've played them against our defense, you know, so that was just one of the
things -- in fact, when they were playing Pittsburgh in Notre Dame, I had told
our staff we would have been better off playing Pittsburgh because they have
only seen us once and Notre Dame, this is would have been the seventh time
that Coach Brey has seen us and so they did a good job, but they also made
shots. The first two times we played them, if you look at the numbers, we held
them in the 20 percent range from three and 31 percent from the field. We just
-- today they made a lot of threes.  
  
They were just on fire that first half, and you've got to give them full
credit. And we were actually playing okay offensively, and we scored 32
points. We only had two turnovers. We had seven assists on 13 made field
goals. They had probably their best half all year long was against us this
first half, and that's just one of those things, unfortunately.  
  
Q. Do you feel snake bit at this point? It seems like every time you
start to get a little momentum going, things kind of go backwards on you. You
had a game where your offense played pretty well.  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah, you know, I was just saying that for us we have -- a big
step for us we've got to make, I said before the year that we needed to win
road games. We've won some tough road games at North Carolina State, at
Arkansas, at Syracuse, but then our next step is we've got to be consistent.
If we want to get to not playing on Tuesday, so we're playing in the NCAA
Tournament, our consistency level -- and I still believe the best way to do
that is getting old, staying old, and getting old, our team, our core group
will all be back next year, obviously, so they'll just get older by just the
natural maturation of college basketball.  
  
But that's a big thing is consistency. We were really good against Boston
College, really good against North Carolina State, and we were really good the
second half, and we were good offensively the first half. We just had a bad
defensive game the first half.  
  
You know, I was sitting next to a coach next to me before the game, another
ACC coach, and he told me, he said, in all his years, he's never seen his
defenses -- I swear to you I said this in my mind -- he said, in all my years,
I've never seen a defense that's not man-to-man that's as good as yours,
because we came into this game fifth in the country in three-point defense,
and we play all zone. Most teams against zone you gave up -- fifth in the
country in three-point defense. That's how good we are. And he said that to
me, and I was like, I hope he doesn't jinx us. And I really felt that when he
said that -- I said that in my mind, when he told me that before the game, I
hope he doesn't jinx us. They were just incredible from the three-point line.
They were on fire. It was probably Notre Dame's best half all year, and it
just came at the right time. Unfortunately for us, it came at the wrong time.  
  
Q. What did you think about the way you guys were playing defensively,
particularly in the first half?  
JOSH PASTNER: Well, we just -- they made a lot of great shots, and we weren't
as good the first half. I mean, there's just no other way to deny it. Our
defense, which has been our staple all year long, just we failed the first
half.  
  
But second half we were obviously much better. They scored 26 points the
second half. First half they had 52. We haven't done that all year long. It
was just a bad first half.  
  
And again, there's no excuse. It's just, I don't know if it's -- if it was the
conference tournament or we didn't play Saturday, I don't know why we played
the way we played, but again, that falls on my shoulder, and we've got to go
back to the drawing board and figure that out, and the best thing we can do is
not put ourselves to be playing on Tuesday. That's the goal is we've got to
get to the next days. And if you're not playing on Tuesday, you're probably
going to be in the tournament, so that's what we've got to accomplish.  
  
Q. Moses, when you came out of the second half, you scored I think the
first eight points for them. I'm just wondering, was that part of the
adjustments at halftime, adjustment strategy, try to get you the ball down
underneath, or was that more a question of just how things worked out?  
MOSES WRIGHT: It was how things worked out. When we went in the locker room,
Sylvester got on us about how we were so lax in the first half and how we had
to be more aggressive. So when I caught it in the high post, I just attacked
then on defense, and I just scored.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: Moses has gotten better and better, which I'm really proud of
him, as has James, and for us, look, the bottom line is for us, José had a
tough game. And in this league your guard play has to be good every time you
step on the floor. Boston College, NC State, our guard play was good and we
won both games. Today Michael Devoe was solid but José he had five assists to
one turnover but it's hard in this league if your guards aren't really good
every time you step on the floor, and tonight, this afternoon, José didn't
play his best, and obviously that was a struggle for us.  
  
Q. That's actually what I was going to ask is even if you have Moses
going for 25, how difficult is it to win if your point guard goes 0-for for
the first 38 minutes?  
JOSH PASTNER: We're probably not winning. When you were at the Florida State
game, and in that stretch of -- José had been, the last six or seven games,
he'd been averaging at a high level, and you look at how good we'd been
playing. Prior to that he was just in a bad slump, in a funk, and we weren't
real good offensively. Thank God our defense saved us.  
  
But without José playing well, he's our engine in a sense, and it's not that
he has to make 30 points, it's that he's got to have the energy level, and I
just didn't think he had his same fight energy level that he usually has. He's
our motor guy for that.  
  
And in this league, you've got to have great guard play to perform every time
you step on the floor in this league.  
  
James did his job. He did a double-double. Moses did his job. It's just, when
we're relying on José for that, we need him to produce. But he's been in a
stretch where he's really played well. This is his first off game in about the
last six, seven games.  
  
Q. James, how difficult has it been to defend? They have two good posts
that can score and Mooney is really difficult because he can stretch the
court. How was that match-up for you today?  
JAMES BANKS: Oh, Mooney is a great player. Juwan, he did a great job in the
post, as well. But once we were able to get out -- it's a lot more difficult
than 20 because of the responsibilities that I have playing that X 5. But when
we were able to go into man, the biggest thing is just not letting them get
the catch because we're playing against good players in the ACC, and you let
them get that catch, they have a package that they're able to score.  
  
Q. Moses, can you describe a little bit just the confidence you felt
every time -- it seemed like the offense was kind of running through you. You
seemed like you were looking to score in the second half. I'm curious if
you've ever felt like that in a game, particularly at this level.  
MOSES WRIGHT: My teammates really helped me get that confidence because first
half I wasn't really looking to be aggressive. But with the four other players
that was on the court and the bench players, they really helped motivate me to
be aggressive.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: For Moses, he's come a long way. He's really starting to be
consistent. He's got to have a great off-season. But you've got to remember,
Moses was literally a zero start recruit. I think we were his only scholarship
offer. And he's only been playing for a few years of organized basketball.
Prior to that he was a tennis player. So I'm proud of Moses. He has gotten a
lot better.  
  
In these last two games, even this last stretch, three or four or five games
he's been playing, but especially his last two, he's played as well as anybody
in the league. He's been very high level, so very proud of him for that.  
  
Q. Josh, what are you missing to kind of kick your team to the next
level? What do you need to add in the off-season, or what do you need to
develop in the off-season?  
JOSH PASTNER: Let me tell you this: As I said in my radio show last night, I
didn't come to Georgia Tech to finish 10th place and not be in the NCAA
Tournament. The whole objective is to get the program back to the NCAA
Tournament and then the next step is to try to move up the ladder from there
and try to compete with the upper tier for league titles, but the first step
is to get to the NCAA Tournament, that is the objective. You know, initially
it was a five-year plan because I truly believed we had to get old and stay
old. I really believe if we had Josh Okogie back this year, we would have been
in the tournament, but we didn't. He starts for the Timberwolves.  
  
Missing him was a crushing blow for this season, but going for next season,
we've got to move the needle because we'll have our core group back. Of course
we're going to continue to recruit and recruit guys in the spring, but we've
got to most importantly continue to get the current guys better. So we've got
a great core group, got to maybe sign another guy or two in the spring, and
we've got to move the needle next year. That's important, and we're positioned
to do that. I really believe we're in position to do that, to take the next
step and put ourselves in position to the NCAA Tournament. Now, is it going to
be easy? No. There's a lot of good teams. The league is 20 games. We're
playing Arkansas, 21, Georgia, 22, the ACC-Big Ten Challenge, 23, three games
in Diamond Head in Hawaii. That's 26 high-major teams you're playing. So
there's not a lot of room for -- or 27, I guess, whatever it is, 26 or 27
high-major teams that we're going to be playing. So we're going to have to --
our work is going to be cut out for us, and we're going to have to have wins,
and like I said, be in the top nine, I guess, to get you to Wednesday, and you
probably put yourself in a position in the NCAA Tournament as you see with
Clemson and North Carolina State, 8 and 9, they've got themselves in a
position.  
  
So we have had a good growth year. Guys have had an opportunity to get a lot
of playing time, and they'll grow. We'll get better, and the goal is next year
to really move the needle and let's get our butts back into the NCAA
Tournament.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2019

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

### [Jaylen Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36691)

### [Brandon Childress](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32821)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Miami - 79, Wake Forest - 71  
  
DANNY MANNING: Good afternoon. Obviously for us, not the outcome that we
wanted going into the ballgame. Having split with Miami in the regular season,
today we just didn't make enough plays. I thought they did a really good job
of putting their head down and driving the basketball and getting into the
paint. You know, they ended up shooting 25 free throws for the game, and some
of those are a little bit skewed because we were in catch-up mode and we were
playing the foul game. But you look at the stats sheet, and both teams scored
27 field goals, both teams had seven three-pointers. They were plus eight on
the free-throw line. We out-rebounded them by one.  
  
So you know, I look at the free-throw line, and then we turned the ball over
far too many times in certain situations. But they came out and made more
plays than us this afternoon, and we didn't get the win that we desired or
wanted.  
  
Q. Danny, it seems like you got some things going offensively when you
were trying to make a comeback, but what was the problem on defense where you
guys couldn't seem to get any stops?  
DANNY MANNING: You know, a lot of it is just couldn't stay in front of Lykes
or Johnson. Those two guys are really talented. And Lawrence played really
well, also. You know, he got to the free-throw line. I thought in the first
half, we lost D.J. a little bit too much. Going into it, we knew he was a
knock-down shooter, and he gets off seven threes throughout the course of the
ballgame.  
  
So it's just needing to do a better job of sitting down and staying in front
of the basketball.  
  
Q. To either of the players, how disappointing or frustrating is it to
play so well in stretches like you did in the first half when you took the
lead, and then the second half late in the game but not be able to sustain it
at this point in the season?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: I mean, it's obviously a tough part of it because of me as
a leader, as a veteran of the team, I feel like I can do more, not just on the
court but in terms of leadership level, just making sure guys keep our
composure, things like that. But obviously we came up short. We had some good
plays, had some good stretches throughout the course of the game, but I just
feel like we didn't do a good job of putting up a collective 40 minutes of
basketball like we've been doing, especially the second half of the season.  
  
JAYLEN HOWARD: It was tough. You know, obviously we fought hard. We were just
really trying to win the basketball game. But we weren't like consistently
throughout the game, and it's happened like multiple times this year, and it's
frustrating because we fight hard out there on the court but can't seem to put
like 40 minutes together. So it was frustrating today.  
  
Q. Brandon, this year you've had the weight of the team on your
shoulders, playing a significant amount more minutes than last year. Talk
about your growth as a player this year.  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: It was a huge step for me. It started with Coach Manning
from the beginning of the season telling me things are going to change for
you, especially off the court. You've got to do a much better job of taking
care of your body, understanding when to do more and do less, and most of it
was just off the court, continue to have a good workout, continue to work but
also maintain taking care of my body, eating right, getting enough rest, and
just letting everything take care of itself. In the first half of the season,
the numbers were good, just continuously to be solid throughout the course of
the season. I had a little slump at one point, but he kept my head high, just
told me to stay aggressive throughout the course of the season, and everything
just took care of itself. That was basically it, just maintain the rest and
just keeping my body strong and stuff like that.  
  
Q. Danny, you had one of the youngest teams in the league, even the
country this year, a team that's probably a year away. Do you think you're
going to be back next year to coach them?  
DANNY MANNING: That's my hope. That's always the hope. You know, I feel I'll
be back. You know, I'll look at the score card, the score sheet and everyone
that scored is an underclassman. You talked about it. We had some guys that
grew a significant amount this year in terms of their growth from the start to
the finish, and that's how we want to build it. We build it with our young
guys, and we had a really good freshman class come in and got a lot of key
contributions from a lot of guys throughout the course of the season, and even
tonight on the score card, we had a lot of freshmen make big contributions for
us in terms of scoring the basketball and rebounding the basketball.  
  
Q. Danny, what were your thoughts on the change in athletic director at
Wake Forest, obviously John Currie taking over May 1st?  
DANNY MANNING: I'm excited to work with John. Ron hired me, and I've gotten to
know him very well during my time at Wake Forest. He's become a good friend
and been extremely supportive, and I look forward to building the same type of
relationship as we move forward.  
  
Q. Jaylen said that you guys have had a hard time putting 40 good
minutes together all season. Is that just a product of the youth, or was there
something else that prevented that from happening as the season went along?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, I think it's a combination of a few things. You don't
have experience until you have it, and I've said this before, we threw a lot
of our -- we threw all of our young guys out there to the wolves, so to speak,
to kind of figure out on the fly, and they had some really good moments, and
they had some freshman moments. But I think they've grown, and they've
developed, and across the board. Brandon, this was a new role for him this
year. This was a new role for Chaundee this year, even Olivier, the returning
guys that we had. Everyone had a new role going into the season. I think we've
shown some growth. I think there's some times when we've done some really good
things, and there's some times when there's some areas that we have to
continue to improve in. But I do believe that this group continued to work
hard and put forth the effort necessary to give ourselves a chance to improve
and develop throughout the course of the year.

## March 12, 2019

  

### [Jim Larrañaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30874)

### [Anthony Lawrence II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36692)

### [Dejan Vasiljevic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36693)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Miami - 79, Wake Forest - 71  
  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: March Madness. It's, you know, win and advance, lose and go
home. We're just happy we won. I thought it was a very hard-fought game by
both teams. Rebounds were pretty even, assists pretty even, and their pressure
at times was very good and bothered us, but at other times we handled it very
well. And when we handled it well, we normally scored. But if you look at our
three games against them, we had 75 in one game, 76 and 79. So pretty
consistent offensively. It's the defense, and when our defense was good, that
really put us in a good position to win the game.  
  
And Anthony Lawrence had a sensational game. Final stats someplace here? No,
that ain't final. Oh, it is final. I was looking at rebounds. Anthony Lawrence
had 20, they only have him for two assists, that's probably wrong. He probably
had four or five assists but might not have been given credit because the guy
might have taken a dribble or something.  
  
But we had 12 assists. We like to get 16. But these two guys, anybody else?
Were really terrific, both scoring 20 points or more. Talk to them.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about survive and kind of that stretch in
the second half where you had to sit your point guard because of foul trouble
and that seemed like a pretty big turning point of the game where it could
have kind of easily got out of control for you and you guys did a good job of
handling their press?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Yeah we only have seven guys, and when we get in foul trouble,
anybody, in the first half, Izundu had two he, Chris had two, Sam Waardenburg
had two, and two doesn't seem like too many, but what ends up happening is
guys with two fouls tend to like worry about that and don't want to foul and
they don't plate great defense. And so we had to sit hem out for a good while
we put Chris back in with two, but fortunately he didn't pick up his third.
But when he was out, that leaves it up to these two guys and Zach Johnson to
do all its ball handling and I thought what we were doing offensively really
worked because Anthony Lawrence when he was in high school played point guard
and he's very comfortable out there handling the rock. So real proud of him.  
  
Q. You got Virginia Tech next, they put up over 80 points, I think in
both meetings you had with them this year, what do you need to do better
defensively tomorrow?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: We got to keep them from scoring 80. 80's too much. The whole
game with them is they're an incredible three-point shooting team, puts a lot
of pressure on you to defend the three and then Kerry Blackshear is having a
tremendous season, and he's a real force, both inside and outside. Outside as
a facilitator and inside as a scorer and offensive rebounder. I think we can
guard them much better than we have in the first two games, but that's easy
for me to say, I don't have to put on a jersey and guard one of those crazy
shooters.  
  
Q. For the players, when you think back to the two meetings with
Virginia Tech and including last week, what do you guys need to do better to
have a different outcome tomorrow?  
DEJAN VASILJEVIC: We got to stop them from scoring 80 points but also talk in
transition. That's where they got a lot of their points and be able to guard
our man one-on-one. They spread the court out really well and rebound. So
that's what we got to do.  
  
ANTHONY LAWRENCE: I think we got to play better one-on-one defense and
guarding the perimeter and taking away the three, they're a very good three-
point shooting team, so we got to come out and defend the three very well.  
  
Q. How much confidence do you guys get from getting a win and playing as
well as you did kind of to carry some momentum into this game, because it
seemed like a lot of maybe people were looking past the lower-seeded ACC teams
but because the league is so difficult, maybe teams are better than their
records.  
DEJAN VASILJEVIC: Yeah, definitely. Loyola did the same thing to us last year
and went on a run. We're going to try and do that. People underestimate the
lower-seeded teams. Once they get go on a run, it's hard to stop, so we're
going to try and do that this tournament.  
  
DEJAN VASILJEVIC: Yeah, definitely toil went on a run try and do that people
lower-seeded teams. Once they got going on a run, it's hard to stop, so we're
going to try and do that this tournament.  
  
Q. D.J., when you came into the league you were primarily known as a
spot-up three-point shooter, yet today we saw you put the ball on the floor
numerous times and in fact sort of a alley-oop there in the second half. What
have you done to expand your offensive game?  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: Excuse me, wait a minute, we threw him an alley-oop? We threw
him an alley-oop? That's what that was called?  
  
DEJAN VASILJEVIC: So after my foot injury over the summertime, most of it
because of my weight, my girlfriend actually made a diet for me, and I was
able to change my body completely, lost 25 pounds, lost about 10 percent body
fat, and I worked a lot with my GA's and the coaching staff to get me better,
being able to be more versatile and put it on the deck, finish at the rim and
create for others. So I'm just trying to be more versatile, and I think I'm
doing that.  
  
JIM LARRAÑAGA: I'd like to add, D.J. has always been able to do that. We never
considered him just a spot-up three-point shooter. I think in his mind, he's
so good at that one thing, he looks for it all the time. But he'll tell you,
I've encouraged him to utilize his all-around game because he's always been
able to do that.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2019

  

### [Jim Christian](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18217)

### [Jared Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36699)

### [Steffon Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34824)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Pittsburgh - 80, Boston College - 70  
  
JIM CHRISTIAN: We can just take questions.  
  
Q. Coach, I wonder if you could talk about the two freshmen guards. They
seemed to hurt you on the penetrations. How dangerous are they moving forward
here in the next few years?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Well, obviously, I mean, they took over the game, just by
attacking the rim. The first time we played them, we did a great job of
keeping them in front and then protecting the basket, walling up the basket,
making them finish over us, and today we did an awful job of both. So they
were going by people, and then our secondary defender was just not in the way,
and because of it, they took over the game. So obviously moving forward,
they're two really good players, and they're going to be -- obviously continue
to get better.  
  
Q. To both of the players, I think you guys only had one field goal in
the last nine minutes of the first half. What went wrong? What was the cause
of the drought? And how much did that kind of knock you guys back?  
STEFFON MITCHELL: We stopped moving the ball. We weren't making extra passes
like we did in the first couple minutes of the game, and then we started
letting our offense affect our defense.  
  
JARED HAMILTON: Yeah, Steffon said, we stopped doing what was working for us
starting out the gate when we got the early lead.  
  
Q. For both players, you guys got off to a great start. I mean, it
looked like you were going to just run away with it. Did you have a feeling at
that point that this was going to be your night?  
STEFFON MITCHELL: Early on we were moving the ball. We turned them over quite
a bit, very often in the beginning, but then we stopped getting away from it,
stopped ball pressuring, gave up open lines to the rim, and that's going to
happen.  
  
JARED HAMILTON: Yeah, I don't think it was so much whose night it was. I think
it was just we were playing basketball the right way, and we got away from it.  
  
Q. Jim, if you could start and then maybe the players address it, as
well. Ky did not have his best game tonight and really struggled in the first
half, both shooting and he also had four turnovers. How disconcerting is it
since as much of a leader he is when that happens, and how much does it kind
of carry over to other guys?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: You know, nobody is going to be great every night. There's a
lot of things that you can do in basketball. I think sometimes we dwell on
offense. If a guy is not making shots, you can still play fantastic. It's the
other areas of the game. You can't let one area, one particular area of your
game affect how you can impact a game, and I think we did that from a bunch of
guys the last couple games where you can't judge how effective you're playing
by if the ball is going in the basket. That's a great aspect, and that's what
everybody wants, but there's a lot of ways to impact the game, and I think
that's the one great strength that Ky has, has had all year. He didn't do it
tonight, but he's able to impact the game on the backboard, he's able to
impact the game getting a steal, able to impact the game in a lot of different
ways, orchestrating our offense, and I think tonight when shots weren't
falling, it's just he wasn't impacting the game the way a great player -- and
he is a great player -- usually does.  
  
STEFFON MITCHELL: What Ky did was he had a tough game, but that's our job to
pick him up when it's not working by contributing more scoring, getting more
stops and just giving him more opportunities.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2019

  

### [Jeff Capel II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36697)

### [Trey McGowens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36698)

### [Xavier Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24958)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Pittsburgh - 80, Boston College - 70  
  
JEFF CAPEL II: First of all, a big time win for us. I'm really proud of our
guys and for how hard we played, and I thought it was the most complete game
that we've played as far as executing the game plan defensively, understanding
personnel, I thought, for the first five minutes we struggled, especially
valuing the ball. I think nerves a little bit. But as we settled into the
game, I thought the last 15 minutes of the half and then the first 12 minutes
-- probably the first 14 minutes of the second half, I thought we were really
good. And then I thought we got a little tired at the end, and we made some
tired plays.  
  
But I'm really proud of our guys. Obviously these two guys beside me were
terrific. But I thought Kene's rebounding, I thought Malik Ellison coming into
the game, his talk, his energy, his understanding of the game plan really,
really helped us out. He made some big time plays. I thought Sidy Ndir came in
and I thought he kind of calmed us when he came in the game and got a couple
of big baskets early that kind of calmed us down a little bit. And again,
everyone that played did a really, really good job, so I'm proud of my team.  
  
Q. What did you say to them in the time-out?  
JEFF CAPEL II: I said, stop turning the ball over, let's settle into the game,
and we have to be strong. We have to be sharp, and we have to defend. That was
really it, just settle into the game and let's play.  
  
Q. How much do you feel like the win over Notre Dame, and having really
something go your way for the first time in a couple months, how much did you
see that impact and maybe buoy your team's confidence over the last couple
days?  
JEFF CAPEL II: I thought it helped us a lot. Obviously if you win, that gives
you confidence. We had been close, but we hadn't been able to finish the deal,
and so I thought that win was big for us. I thought we had a little bit of
momentum coming in here off of that win. We had a couple of really good
practices in preparation for the game, and obviously after the start that we
had, I thought for the rest of the game we played really well.  
  
Q. These two guys seemed like they were attacking the hole, and that's
where you're getting a lot of buckets. Was that part of the strategy going in,
and can you talk about their effectiveness doing that?  
JEFF CAPEL II: You know, that's our strategy every game was to try to attack.
We've been a very streaky shooting team, but when we've been at our best is
when we've been able to get downhill and attack, when we're able to defend
well and defensive rebound and get out in transition, these two guys, they're
athletic, they're fearless, and they can attack and they can put pressure on a
defense. It was the first time in a while that we've gotten to the line like
this. We got 32 free throws, and these two guys stepped up and made 19, so
that's big for us. When we've been at our best this year, these two guys have
been able to put pressure on the defense and get to the foul line.  
  
I thought they were terrific. I thought they dictated the pace, the tempo. I
thought they gave us confidence, and I thought that led to other guys stepping
up and making big plays.  
  
Q. Both of the players, what was the key to getting to the rim so easily
it seemed, and did you notice them kind of getting knocked back a little bit
as you were scoring so close to the basket?  
XAVIER JOHNSON: That's the key every game is attack. I mean, last time we
played them, they littered the paint, and I shot 3 for 19 from the field.
Today I shot 7 for 14, and that was the difference.  
  
TREY MCGOWENS: I think the biggest thing was spacing and moving them off the
ball, didn't give them a chance to just sit in the paint, so when they moved
around, when we were moving without the ball, just opened up lanes.  
  
Q. For both guys, I mean, being out there on the court, in that four or
five-minute stretch to end the first half, how much could you feel the game
and the momentum change?  
XAVIER JOHNSON: We felt the momentum change a lot. I would say for the first
like four minutes, I'm going to be honest, I was kind of nervous and I knew
they were kind of nervous because our first time playing an ACC Tournament
game. But I mean, that fell off after I guess the first four minutes.  
  
TREY MCGOWENS: Yeah, it just seemed like everything was moving fast. It was
our first time on a stage like this. But once he called a time-out, told us to
settle down, after that I felt like everything was pretty smooth.  
  
Q. With Syracuse coming up to tomorrow, how do you take getting to the
rim against BC's man-to-man and sort of keep that success against the 2-3?  
TREY MCGOWENS: I think being able to attack, and then we were -- I think we
shot it pretty well from the three today, at least it felt like that. But just
attacking and then making them close the gaps and kick-outs.  
  
XAVIER JOHNSON: I would say the same thing, keep attacking at the right
moments. We've got to get our footwork right because last time I think we got
a lot of travel calls.  
  
Q. For Trey, I think this is the first time you've had 25 points or more
in a game since you guys pulled off that big upset against Florida State. Did
you kind of feel pretty good coming into this game? How can you explain your
performance?  
TREY MCGOWENS: I just felt like probably last game, I played pretty well, and
then this game was kind of -- at the beginning I was kind of hesitant, not
shooting a lot of shots, and then Coach and Xavier they just told me to shoot
the ball because I'm open, stop being hesitant and just play.  
  
Q. What did you guys do to keep Bowman from being so effective? I think
he was only 3 of 13 maybe?  
JEFF CAPEL II: 3 of 10.  
  
Q. What was the strategy on him, and how did you execute it?  
JEFF CAPEL II: I thought that we wanted to have -- we didn't want him to see
space. He's really, really good. I think he's as good a guard as we have in
our league. We wanted to be in the gaps, and that's where I said us
understanding the game plan and understanding personnel.  
  
I thought our bigs, I thought Kene and Terrell did a terrific job on their
ball screen defense, on their coverages and early in the game we got a couple
of deflections on Bowman trying to make some passes, and I thought we
frustrated them a little bit. We wanted to try to wear them out, too. I
thought picking them up full court, we didn't start the game that way, but
after we called the first time-out, we started picking up full court, and I
thought he wore down a little bit as the game went on. One of the things
coming in is that we wanted to make him guard, and we wanted to put him in
ball screens, we wanted to have space when he was on one of these two guys,
and let them drive him, and I thought all of those things kind of made him a
little bit fatigued.  
  
He missed some shots that he normally makes, but I think our defense and our
attention to detail with how we wanted to guard him was really good.

## March 12, 2019

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [John Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36337)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Notre Dame - 78, Georgia Tech - 71  
  
MIKE BREY: Well, I am really thrilled for my group. We have had a tough
regular season ACC to say the least, and for us to mentally prepare and come
down here and understood we had a clean slate, I just thought we got out of
the gate with such a free mind. We were flowing offensively. A little bit of
the old days offensively. We've been in search of that.  
  
And Laszewski goes down, hopefully we can get him back tomorrow. And now
you've got to hold them off in the second half. And we actually made some
plays that we haven't made all year to kind of hold people off, especially his
big bucket to put us up five.  
  
Q. Coach, can you just talk about -- was there something you saw on film
against their zone or something in particular with the execution in the first
half on offense, or was it just baskets falling, because it seemed like you
probably had the most success in the first half.  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, you know, we're a good passing team. What's crazy is, again,
we shot a crazy percentage today, but our percentage hasn't been very good.
But our assist to turnover, even with a poor shooting percentage through 18
league games, is good. We're good with the ball. We don't throw the ball away.
We usually get a shot. We just haven't made the first shot much.  
  
And I thought tonight, we did. I thought Laszewski on the floor to start the
game, you know, having another shooter against the zone stretched it and
helped us. He was fabulous in the high post, making decisions, and our guards
are really good with the ball. TJ and Prentiss just know where the ball --
we've got transition stuff which helped us. We got some easy buckets in
transition.  
  
Q. John, you got to play basically some point forward almost. What was
that like doing that in terms of the offense and kind of being the guy that's
the distributor and maybe the finisher instead of being more of a focal
point?  
JOHN MOONEY: Yeah, somebody talked, before the game, watching film a little
bit last night, was that high post guy is definitely very important to kind of
be able to get it there and read. We were moving guys in and out throughout
the whole entire game. But yeah, once you get it up there, you kind of just
turn it up, face the basket, and I have shooters around me ready to shoot the
ball, so it's easy to pass it to a Dane Goodwin or a Nate or TJ or Prentiss
Hubb, and they're ready to catch it and fire it. Just an all-around great win.  
  
Q. Mike, to go fought first half, you seemed like you're really moving
the ball well, you mentioned getting it into the free-throw line and spreading
it out. How close to just what you really wanted out of the game plan did you
play in the first half?  
MIKE BREY: We haven't played a half like that all year. It was just really
neat to watch us move and cut and handle the ball and score it. We've not had
a half like that. Of course I told the halftime interviewer, I said, we wait
until Charlotte to find ourselves offensively? Come on now, fellas. But we are
a good passing team. Like we are good with the ball. We just haven't made
enough of those first ones, and we got confident -- you know, we had a good
practice yesterday. We played 4 on 4 because I can't play 5 on 5. I don't have
enough guys. We actually played 4 on 4. And we made a lot of shots in our
little scrimmage, and that always helps you. Kids felt good. We're starting
three freshmen. Durham is a new guy, too. For them to come out of the gate in
an ACC Tournament game the way they did, I'm really proud of them because
we've been searching for confidence at times the last three months.  
  
Q. Mike, could you just tell us the extent of Laszewski's injury, and if
he's not available, what are your options tomorrow?  
MIKE BREY: Well, it's a bad bruise. The X-rays were negative, thank God. They
took him up and X-rayed him X-rayed him. We'll try and get him loose for
tomorrow, but the group that played pretty much the whole second half may be
the group that whole game. Chris Doherty gave us some good minutes, I think he
made a shot off his forehead at the end of the shot clock, it's a thing we
work on with our big guys (laughter), but Liam Nelligan, our walk-on is
probably going to have to play a little bit, too.  
  
I hope we can get Nate loose because the Pittsburgh game and today, we've been
kind of waiting on that from Nate and I was so frustrated when he went down
because I think he's kind of found his game, as has Dane Goodwin, te two of
them have kind of found themselves late in the year.  
  
Q. You replaced a lot of guys as you kind of alluded to --  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, a lot of men.  
  
Q. And in terms of playing an ACC schedule, do you feel like this is
sort of coming to fruition of the experience you guys got in the last part of
the season?  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, I was so hoping that we could find a little bit of a rhythm
down here, after a really tough 18 games in the regular season. We knew we
were going to be in a youth movement. We knew that. But for our young guys to
play confident down here, this guy has been fabulous. I don't know how he has
any energy left. We have rode him so hard, and he just goes double-double
against unbelievable athletic front lines every single night.  
  
I'm happy for the kids because they have invested. They've been coachable, and
they've hung in there even though it hadn't been as fun a January or February.  
  
Q. Mike, when you're trying to basically finesse a lead for a whole half
and it's down -- you see it shrinking -- how much confidence do you have that
you can find a play at the end like John's shot that will carry you through?  
MIKE BREY: Well, today was a big day for us in the second half because we've
been in search of that play. We have played people close in this league, but
we have not been able to get over the hump with a big offensive possession.
Even making key free throws, a key defensive stop. And for Johnny, first of
all, we got it to the right spot, and for Johnny to rise up and do it, that's
kind of new for us. I was proud because we've been in search of that.  
  
But the guy that should be shooting it at that time should be this guy.  
  
Q. You've had a lot of battles with Louisville. Just can you speak on
tomorrow night, you just played them a couple weeks ago and kind of the match-
up.  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, you know, they're really good. Chris has done an unbelievable
job in year one there. The frustrating thing about our game in Louisville two
weeks ago or a week ago was I felt it would have been game situations, but we
missed all kinds of free throws in the second half, and we've been a good
free-throw shooting team for the year.  
  
But we're going to have to rebound, and we're going to have to score, and you
know, tonight we -- I told our guys a couple of the time-outs in the first
half, we're going to score 85, we're going to score 95, and you've got to
score against these guys. They're very good.  
  
Q. John, all-ACC awards came out yesterday. Happy to be mentioned? Do
you feel like you were snubbed or a little combination of both?  
JOHN MOONEY: No, I mean, I think it's definitely always an honor to be
recognized on one of the best conferences in America's all team. There's
obviously some great players in this league, probably some first-round and
second-round draft picks coming up in the NBA Draft, so it's awesome to be
able to compete against those guys. It's a testament to the coaching staff and
my teammates for helping me all year, making me a better player.  
  
And yeah, no, I don't think I got snubbed at all, man. It's always an honor to
be recognized.  
  
Q. Mike, I think you had one turnover, and that seemed like a really big
part of what you did. Speak to the success you had there.  
MIKE BREY: Well, Hubb and Gibbs are fabulous with the ball. They're in the top
ten of the ACC. They've been there all year, even though we only won three
league games. They've been in the top ten assist-to-turnover. They're great
with the ball. Goodwin has really improved with the ball. And what's helped is
our big guys are good with the ball. Johnny is good with the ball, Juwan is
good with the ball, Nate better with the ball but our guards were fabulous
dealing with that press the whole second half and just being poised.

## October 8, 2019

  

### [Mike Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20740)

### [PJ Horne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38102)

### [Wabissa Bede](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37074)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach, just what you could say about your first impressions coming
into Virginia Tech, just what your overall thoughts were of the guys that were
coming back and just what you can say about the sense of the Hokies moving
forward.  
MIKE YOUNG: Excited about it. I'm thankful that I have these two. I think of
character and the kind of young people I want to build this thing with, that's
a pretty good start, just in terms of their -- how much they've helped me,
their leadership, their appreciation for Virginia Tech -- two pretty good
pieces to begin your time in Blacksburg at Virginia Tech, and I'm thankful for
their contributions.  
  
Proven that it can be done -- three straight NCAA Tournaments, Sweet 16. I
think the first three consecutive years that they've been to the NCAA
Tournament, I think. We'll build it the right way. We'll build it to last, and
we'll build it with the right pieces, and, again, these two guys are certainly
a positive step for me.  
  
Q. Coach, you 're not new to basketball, of course, but you are new to
the ACC. Wanted to see if you would share with us your thoughts about offense
that you like to play in and what's your defensive philosophy?  
MIKE YOUNG: Without getting into stuff you don't want to hear, just sharing
and being a great teammate and not turning the ball over. Our teams
traditionally rank nationally top 25 in assist turnover, top 50 in assist-
turnover. Just don't think you can expect to win at a high level if you're
kicking the ball around 15, 16 times a game.  
  
Good on the glass. Stingy in the half-court defensively. Will we play some
zone? Yeah, we will, but you're not going to see a steady diet of it, at least
I don't think so. We're trying to lay a foundation with this program that will
carry us through this year and into the coming years and a style and a way
that we want to fight night in, night out.  
  
Q. First of all, for the players, you heard what Coach young had to say
about you and the importance of having you as you move forward here with this
team. What were your first impressions of Coach and just what you can say
about him as a leader?  
MIKE YOUNG: This is a really big question for you guys.  
  
WABISSA BEDE: I was just very excited for him being our head coach. The big
thing I thought was like him being at Wofford for 30 years, Coach is a very
young dude. So I just know being at a spot for 30 years is like you can kind
of say you're from there. He probably took the same route to practice, to his
house, probably like for 30 years. So he kind of knows the roads. So coming to
Blacksburg is probably very different to him.  
  
Just learning from him is going to be great, and we're very excited.  
  
P.J. HORNE: I believe he's a very great coach on and off the floor. He keeps
us in line. He keeps us motivated to want to work on the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, tell us about building your staff, the decisions you made, the
core group that you have with you.  
MIKE YOUNG: When I walked into that office for the first time after being
named a head coach, April 8 -- I think it was April 9 -- with all these things
swirling around and no staff, a lot of things in the air, I knew, and I had
the presence of mind I had to get the staff component right. I had to make
that right.  
  
After a great deal of work and a lot of thought and a lot of effort, I was
able to put together a staff that I could not be more excited about in Chester
Frazier, who was a very good player at Illinois. Coached with Bruce Weber at
Kansas State the last seven years, I think. Antwon Jackson, been around a long
time, started his career at William and Mary, and later, most recently, seven
years with Mick Cronin at Cincinnati, and Christian Webster, who's on Virginia
Tech staff, a year ago. I think this is his fourth year at Tech.  
  
Great people. It's been a great deal of fun to walk in and work with them each
day and see things come together within. They're good coaches. They're very
good on the floor, and have an excellent rapport with our team, which is very
important to me.  
  
Q. Coach, you have a couple of scrimmages coming up within the next
couple of weeks. Are there some things that you want nailed down by those
scrimmages that you want to see from your team?  
MIKE YOUNG: Yeah, but a level of patience. You can say that with any team.
Sometimes I can get ahead of myself, and I want to see it this way, this way,
this way, and it's kind of spotty. It's all right. We're starting the season
now in September. I mean, give me a break. We're going through march, over
both academic semesters, both major holidays. We begin in late summer, early
fall, finish in spring.  
  
There's going to be a number of growth opportunities throughout the course of
the year. Let's cool our Jets. I had a team last year, I had a great team. I
don't know what Wabissa and P.J.'s experience was. I think they scrimmaged
Liberty. But we went to Knoxville and scrimmaged Belmont, scrimmage Belmont
every year, always traditionally a terrific program, and we were terrible. We
were awful. I'm saying ugly things and just making an idiot of myself. I think
I caught myself on the way home, come on, man, relax. We're going to figure it
out here, and we did.  
  
We'll be the same thing here. Do I want us to play well? Sure. Do I expect us
to be great? No. We will progress at the rate that this team is capable of. I
feel very confident of that.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome North Carolina, our final school, to the stage here
this afternoon.  
  
Q. Coach, you led the ACC in scoring last year, averaging more than 85
points a game, and I suspect you would have liked to have scored more. What
does it take offensively and defensively to play at your tempo, especially
many of your opponents want games in the 60s and 70s, and can this year 's
team push the tempo that old Roy would like?  
ROY WILLIAMS: It's hard. It is hard. The young guys come in, boy, Coach, I
really want to run, and they get there and find out it's a lot harder to do it
than it is say they want to do it. For us, we do like to play at a fast pace.
I've never had a team play at as fast of a pace as they want them to.  
  
This year's team, what I've emphasized to them so far is last year could have
been our best three-point shooting team ever with Cam and Luke and Kenny,
Coby. Those guys are gone, so we've got to be a lit better on the defensive
end of the floor, a little better on the backboards, a little better at
defending around the rim, scoring around the rim. But the biggest thing is
we've got to run and make sure we can score some in the open court. For us,
it's get the ball in the point guard's hands and him to push it as fast as he
can and get our big guys.  
  
So far in practice, Armando and Walker and definitely Harrison, those big guys
have really run the floor nicely for us. We've got to keep doing that. So
you've got to emphasize that every day so we can see if we can get the game at
our pace as opposed to somebody else's pace.  
  
Q. Coach, just what you can say about the makeup of this year 's team,
four freshmen coming in, two grad transfers, just what they bring to the mix
of what you already have and what you've seen so far.  
ROY WILLIAMS: It's been a hard preseason. We've had eight practices, and we've
only had -- the most we've had is 11 guys that have been able to do the whole
practice. We've got all of the aches and pains and some very serious injuries
that we're trying to get over. So it's been difficult to see so far.  
  
So far, Garrison and B. Rob have been two of our best players. They're two of
our most experienced players. They're trying to drag the other guys along with
them. Cole has been a guy that wins almost every sprint, won the 12-minute
run. One day we had maybe the toughest conditioning test, and he finished and
made all his times, and guys had to make up five times, and he ran that with
them and won those too. So he's gotten the respect by doing the little things,
the tough things.  
  
But those three guys have so far been the leaders of our team, and now we've
got to get Andrew Platek healthy. We've got to get Christian and Justin out
there on a full-time basis and knowing what we're doing. For us, it's got to
be getting healthy is one of the biggest things, but these two guys up here
with me have done the best job so far for sure.  
  
Q. Question is for Garrison and Brandon. Can you talk about what your
preparation was over the summer knowing that you have to have a different
mentality being more go-to guys than role players from last year?  
GARRISON BROOKS: Me personally, I would say the biggest thing for me would be
just leading by example and trying to be on time and work as hard as I
possibly can just to show other guys that you have to work the same way I'm
going to work to kind of step up to my level.  
  
BRANDON ROBINSON: For me, it was definitely the little things. Coach always
preaches about the little things. Definitely, like Garrison said, leading by
example, and me always trying to get in extra work in the weight room, trying
to get guys to come with me in the weight room and get extra work in, and get
in before practice, after practice, getting extra work in with the coaches.  
  
So just always preparing and just leading by example is my biggest thing.  
  
Q. I got a chance to ask Garrison. I wanted to ask Robinson and Coach as
well. How much of you guys ' competitions in practice get into you guys'
philosophy as far as competing and as far as trying to win everything? Whether
it's every little drill, every one-on-one. How has that been helping you guys'
chemistry so far?  
BRANDON ROBINSON: I think everything we do in practice is about competing.
It's nothing that we do that it's like you lose and you just move on. If we
have a drill in practice, at the end of practice, you're going to run for it
if you lose. And I think from the weight room to the classroom, everybody in
our program knows that we compete. So we compete trying to get better grades
with each other, compete trying to lift heavier weights than each other.  
  
Coach is a big competitor, and he always jokes around how he and Coach Rob
compete about little things. He pulls his keys out before Coach Rob to open up
the door. So I think everyone in our program has a competitive nature.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: You got anything?  
  
GARRISON BROOKS: I already answered it.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Did you need anything from me? I think B. Rob's right.
Everything we do is competitive. At the end of the day you win, you don't run.
If you lose, you do run. The game is competitive, but I also think life is
competitive. So we compete in everything we do, and everything there is a
consequence. If you lose, you don't get the rewards, and if you do, you do get
the rewards.  
  
Q. For Coach Williams, at the start of the season, taking out the guys
you said that wouldn 't be ready -- so Anthony, Jeremiah, and Sterling -- how
do you see the rotation shaping up so far?  
ROY WILLIAMS: I really haven't. There's been six or seven guys that stand out
because their experience or their play, and that's been Cole, B. Rob,
Christian, Justin, Garrison, Armando. So those guys have been on the white
team just about every day. Walker really does some good things, and Andrew has
been hurt a little bit. Those two guys really put in a lot of work too. So
they're going to get some reps as soon as they get healthy, or in Andrew's
case, as soon as he gets healthy enough.  
  
We still -- Sunday we had -- from Sunday, it was October 6th, we play on
November 6th. So we still have a month to worry about that part.  
  
Q. Question for the players. In watching some of Cole 's games in high
school, he has a unique ability to attack the basket. Sometimes he shoots. A
lot of times he dishes. Brandon, as a jump shooter, how does that help you
when he dishes to you beyond the line? Especially Garrison outside, how does
that change your life as a post player to possibly get a Cole Anthony pass?  
GARRISON BROOKS: I would just say, just seeing him dish all the time in high
school, it just helps me to get prepared, to get the ball, even if he passes
it, to kind of make him look good for those flashy passes he has.  
  
BRANDON ROBINSON: I think the one thing we preach about in pre-practice with
Coach Rob is always being shot ready. That's something I've been working on a
lot, always being shot ready when Cole has the ball. The pass could come to
you at any time, so always be shot ready and always expect the pass to come to
you when he has it.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: And these would be the two that have most benefited from Cole's
ability to pass. I think Garrison has gotten more lob dunks in the first eight
practices than you did maybe all year last year. So they're aware of his
passing ability, and B. Rob is always shot ready.  
  
(Laughter)  
  
Brian, don't you laugh. I remember when you played, boy. I remember that too.  
  
Q. This is for Garrison and Brandon. Just what you can say about your
leadership roles elevating through the process. We see that in North Carolina
every single year somebody moves on, and within a couple years it 's who's
going to step up next, but there's always those guys who have gotten time.
Just what you can say about the experience you've had and what it does for you
leadership-wise now.  
GARRISON BROOKS: It's been a learning experience since we had Luke, Cam, and
Kenny.  
  
GARRISON BROOKS: For me personally, it's been like a learning experience since
we had Luke, Kenny, and Cam leave campus. So I think that they kind of
instilled the things that are important -- being on time, would being very
hard, and learning how to talk to everyone. Like me and B. Rob, just kind of
like keep on with what they've already taught us and kind of mention what we
want to do and what we've learned as leaders from like hearing them.  
  
BRANDON ROBINSON: Each and every year since I've been here, it's been
different type of leadership styles. As the years go on, you see these
different leadership styles change based on the team that we have. I think me
and Garrison's leadership styles are different from Kenny, Luke, and Cam, just
because based on the team that we have, having new guys come around.  
  
So like he said, we're taking in things that we saw them preach to us, and
we're preaching to the new guys that we have here but still trying to do it in
our own way and be ourselves.  
  
Q. Coach, you were needling your players just a few minutes ago. Have
you always had that type of rapport with your kids over the years? If not, did
you find a point in your career in which it was comfortable for you to give as
much as you get?  
ROY WILLIAMS: It feels very comfortable, yes. It's something I enjoy kidding
guys. I enjoy pushing guys. I've got to be able to take it a little bit along
with that, but I've always said I was fortunate enough to help recruit and
help coach Michael Jordan, and the only thing he ever did better than play was
talk, and he used that to his advantage.  
  
So you have to be careful because there is a fine line that you can go over
when you're needling someone -- I'll use your word there. I do try to push
guys, and sometimes I'll make it humorous, but they also know there's a point
to it. But I don't mind taking it a little bit as well. It's okay.  
  
Q. Coach, the last three years you 've led the ACC in rebounding. Two of
those years, Luke Maye had a lot to do with it. I think you'd agree he's
arguably one of the better defensive rebounders in school history. Where are
those ten rebounds a game that he got going to come from, especially on the
defensive end?  
ROY WILLIAMS: These two guys up here. They're up here for a reason. But
Garrison is rebounding the ball even better. B. Rob's understanding we want
him to go to the boards. Again, I'll say Armando and Huff and Walker and
Sterling, when he gets back, are going to understand that too.  
  
But I think rebounding is the most important factor of the game. I really do.
You get the ball, and I get the ball. You get the ball, and I get the ball.
The only way to break that is if I get an offensive rebound and don't allow
you to get an offensive rebound. Then that means I've got one more possession.
So I think that's something we preach a lot and emphasize a lot. So I hope we
do it well.  
  
Q. Coach, speaking from media day, one of your players -- I can 't
remember who it was -- but he said that you always mention Coach Smith. How
important is it to keep Coach Smith's legacy even through you and keep his
name for the players?  
ROY WILLIAMS: The guys that I have on my team now never saw Coach Smith coach
a game live. I made that statement, and my wife said some of the guys said who
you're coaching right now weren't even born when you started coaching, at
North Carolina even, much less Kansas.  
  
I do think he's the greatest coach that ever was. People say that your numbers
are as good or whatever, but when I talk about he's the greatest coach that
ever was, I thought he did it on the court. As much as I try to keep
relationships and keep aware of former players, current players, and what
they're doing personally and everything, I'm not as good as Coach Smith. So I
want to set them a high standard.  
  
I enjoyed calling Garrison a couple weeks ago, the fact that I'd been -- I'm a
fan. So I go to the drug store, CVS in Concord, and there's a basketball
magazine, and his mug's on the front. So I called him just to tell him to tell
his mom don't buy that down in Alabama. Wait and get up here and buy it up
here. It's got his picture on the cover.  
  
But that's not the effect that Coach Smith had on guys, but I do like to know
that there's a tremendous relationship off the court, and Coach Smith was the
best there ever was at that.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 8, 2019

  

### [John Swofford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15017)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Your 23rd year as the commissioner showing up to media days like
this, and obviously several more as an athletic director, acting athletic
director. Does this ever get old for you?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: No, no it doesn't. I think as long as you have the passion and
the energy and you're a part of a great league, as I'm fortunate enough to be,
you've got great schools and a lot of fan interest, and there's always
something else to do, there's always a what's next. And so, no, this doesn't
get old. Privileged to be here.  
  
Q. Let 's talk about what's next. It's arrived already here. Couple
months ago we launched the ACCN, and it's been so far a very fun experience,
and I think -- I hope we've delivered a worthwhile product. For somebody like
you, this has been 20 years in the making. This has been a vision of yours and
to see it come to fruition. And the first few months in, how do you feel about
the product and what we've been able to do?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I feel great about it. It's nice to be in front of this group,
and there's some people out there that have heard me talk about this subject
and say nothing, numerous years when we were leading in and the questions
were: Are you going to get there; are you going to have a network; et cetera?  
  
So it's good to be able to have it as a reality, and I couldn't be more
pleased, our league couldn't be more pleased with where we are. Tremendous
startup in every respect, whether it's the talent, whether it's the
production, the storytelling. The distribution is beyond expectations at the
beginning. So in terms of startups, it's been an extraordinarily successful
one.  
  
Q. As we talk about extraordinary, how about the product on the playing
field, with these teams within the conference? The overall state of the
conference, let 's talk about that. You've got Clemson, who won a national
championship. Virginia men's basketball won a national championship. Men and
women's soccer at, Virginia currently stand at number one. How pleased are you
with the performance of the student-athletes and just where we are as a
conference?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Extremely. We're on a run as a league that our league has
seldom seen when you look at the entire picture and the competitiveness of the
league. And obviously that's an important aspect of it. And I'm going to pull
out some notes here because --  
  
Q. A lot of numbers?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I don't want to get these wrong. Since 2015, seven national
championships in football, men's basketball, women's basketball and baseball
-- by six different institutions.  
  
And I think that says an awful lot about the Atlantic Coast Conference and
what our schools, our programs are able to do competitively in recent years.  
  
And obviously that's been tremendously helpful leading into the network and
its launch. That's the most of any conference in those four sports.  
  
Two of the last three years our teams have been able to win both the football
and men's basketball national championships in the same year. That doesn't
happen very often in our league, nor does it happen very often in anybody's
league.  
  
So tremendous from that standpoint. Our teams have won three of the last five
men's basketball national championships, three of the last six football
national championships.  
  
In the last 43 years, Jordan, our teams have been to 31 -- we've had at least
one team in 31 of the last 43 Final Fours. From the basketball standpoint, you
talk about success and consistency, that's hard to top.  
  
So we're spoiled from that standpoint, from a basketball standpoint. But
that's okay. It's nice to have those expectations.  
  
Currently -- and you go back in Olympic sports and considering them combined
with the two revenue sports I was talking about, 24 national titles in the
last five years, six national championships last year.  
  
And currently, bringing us up to date, this fall we've had 10 of our teams
ranked No. 1 in the nation in their respective sports. Currently there are
five because eventually we start playing each other. So they don't all stay
there.  
  
So it's been just a tremendous run, competitively that I think has us in a
great place.  
  
You mentioned the lead-up to being in a position to do the network. And that
did start a long time ago. It really goes back to the initial efforts and
decisions within our league to expand and to bring in the schools that we've
brought in, going from nine to 12 then to 14 and then to 15.  
  
And all of that was with a purpose in mind. That was to put us in the best
position that we could possibly be in to have the opportunities that we felt
like our league needed to have and must have to competitively continue to be
one of the premier conferences in the country.  
  
And fortunately that put us in a position of maximizing media opportunities
and other opportunities. We're now a league that is the largest in the country
in terms of the geographic footprint of our peer conferences, with the most
television sets of our peer conferences, and with the greatest population of
our peer conferences. And the population base is growing.  
  
So when you combine the competitiveness with those decisions that have put us
in a really good marketplace with the quality of our schools, academically --
because if you look at the academic performance of our athletes, we lead our
peer conferences every year on just about any analysis that you could put
together -- and the quality collectively of the 15 institutions is the highest
rated of any of our peer conferences, too.  
  
So, when you put those three things together, I think the league is just in a
tremendous place for the long term, long-term future. The grant of rights is
there. The 15 schools are committed to each other through 2036 at least.  
  
And so we know who we are now. We know who we will be for the longer term
future. So I think we're in a great place.  
  
Q. Great place, indeed. Commissioner, talk about the future. I think it
's a perfect segue. And before this last question I ask, I'll open up the
floor to anybody who has questions. So you have a few moments to think about
it as I ask what may open the floodgates here this question -- and I wouldn't
be doing my job if I didn't ask -- it's NIL. Everybody is talking about the
Fair Pay to Play Act, a bill that's been signed in California. And we hear
states within the ACC blueprint discussing their plans to get involved in how
they want to help enhance the athlete and fairly compensate the athlete. In
front of everybody here, what is your initial take on what you're seeing as it
evolves now? And being the progressive conference the ACC is, how do you
envision getting involved in this movement?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, it's a tough issue. I think the California law, in and of
itself, is extreme, personally. But I'm not a doomsday guy in terms of college
athletics. I think the intercollegiate athletics has been tremendously
resilient over the years and will be going forward.  
  
I don't think the way to address and solve this is by individual state laws. I
don't think that really gets us to a good place ultimately. It probably pushes
the envelope in terms of stressing the system to really focus on this and see
if there's an answer that can work in a way that maintains -- doesn't go down
what I think is a slippery slope of professionalism, but can modernize who we
are and what the collegiate model is.  
  
So I'm hopeful that as the NCAA working group comes together, there can be
more focus on specific concepts and how this might work in a collegiate and
educational environment to the benefit of our athletes.  
  
I think we have to be really careful about unintended consequences that can
come with it. I don't think we can look at it in a pure silo of a couple of
sports. I think we have to look at the whole picture and the impact on Olympic
sports, women sports.  
  
What would some adjustment in that area mean? Are there adjustments that can
be timed to higher education, which is in my opinion very, very preferable?
But I don't think we should have our heads in the sand and not give it a
chance to find something that fits into that modernization of the collegiate
model. And I'm not smart enough to know the answer. We've got a lot of work to
do on that.  
  
We've got some really good people working on it. And hopefully, as spring
approaches -- well, through the winter and into spring, when the committee
intends to send something forward in a more focused way to the NCAA board,
that within our collegiate athletic processes we can find something works. Or
we may find that nothing that truly works in an amateur collegiate model.  
  
I don't know yet. But I think we need to be open minded. I don't think this is
going to be the end of college athletics by any means. I think we've been
resilient, as I said, in the past, and we will be now and we will be in the
future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Regarding NIL, if I have my timing right, you guys were in your fall
meetings when Governor Newsom actually signed the bill. How active was that
discussion in your fall meetings? Carla Williams is on the NCAA working group.
I 'm just curious how that interaction was among you and the ADs when that
bill was signed.  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, we were at Virginia Tech in our fall meetings when the
bill was signed. We anticipated that it would be signed at some point. So I'm
not sure if that necessarily changed the discussion, because the discussion
would have taken place regardless of the signing of the bill at that
particular time.  
  
And, David, as you mentioned, Carla Williams is the ACC representative on the
working group. And Val Ackerman and Gene Smith co-chair that.  
  
So, it was an opportunity for Carla to bring her colleagues and our faculty
representatives and SWAs up to date on their work and particularly in terms of
the timeline going forward, and to have some discussion about pretty specific
aspects of this that might or might not be a part of something going forward.  
  
But right now, I mean, quite frankly, I think there are a whole lot more
questions than there are answers. And hopefully there will be some answers as
this progresses. And obviously there are other states that are now coming
forward with potentially putting forward similar kinds of state laws.  
  
And, again, I think that what we need is something national that is workable
and manageable, particularly in the recruiting process.  
  
Q. NIL is something that 's been discussed for several years and the
NCAA never really got any traction on getting anywhere with that. It's been
kind of forced into acting more quickly now by the legislation and the
O'Bannon lawsuit and sort of external factors. Are there areas, as you said,
to modernize the collegiate model that now that it seems like we're going to
see more lawsuits, antitrust lawsuits? We're going to see legislation where
these states feel like they can have an impact. What areas would you like to
see the NCAA now go forward and actually act on and move ahead of that could
have to, as you said, modernize the collegiate model?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: In terms of this particular --  
  
Q. Beyond NIL.  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I think that's the issue at hand. And I'm going to -- I don't
want to get into a lot of particulars at this point in terms of that issue
because there's so many of a specific nature, and I don't really think it's
particularly helpful for any of us to publicly get out there with the
specifics of it until the committee does its work. I think they deserve and
need the opportunity to do so and they put a lot of time into it.  
  
But in a general sense -- times change. And full cost of attendance, as an
example, that took a long time to come into effect. I went to college and
played football, signed a football grant and later received an academic
scholarship. So I went on a scholarship program that was basically a full cost
of attendance. It was a better scholarship than the football grant in aid of
my teammates. And ever since then, personally, I've been a proponent of
elevating the scholarship because of that personal experience.  
  
That took a long, a long time to get there. And if you recall, an awfully lot
of people felt that that was going to be a problem to do that, that it would
negatively impact Olympic sports, et cetera, from a financial standpoint,
because it was going to cost more money. And maybe you're hurt more from a
recruiting standpoint -- because it's not equal, the dollars aren't equal in
every institution and you get more if you're coming from California to the
East Coast, for instance, or vice versa because of travel -- that that would
have a huge impact on recruiting.  
  
Neither of those scenarios happened, neither one of them. You don't hear a
word about either one of those at this point in time. So that's what I mean by
sometimes I think we have a tendency to stake a position and not be open
minded about what the possibilities are to provide it even, and I think our
athletes have a tremendous experience and opportunity in today's world, and
it's been improved in recent years.  
  
But our world keeps changing technologically and so forth. And if we're not
willing to step back and be open minded about, are there more adjustments that
can be made without really getting to pay for play, because I think that -- I
don't believe in that for intercollegiate athletics. But I do believe in
maximizing and modernizing the athlete experience for the students that come
in and play in our programs.  
  
I just can't define exactly what I think that means right now. But I think we
need to find out. We may find out there's nothing in this that truly works for
an amateur collegiate model. I don't know. But I think we really do need to
take a look at it.  
  
Q. With Georgia Tech being handed down the sanctions, this is now three
schools in the last six years that have had a one-year postseason ban at
least. NC State has got a notice of allegations on the table as well. How
concerned are you about this trend? And are steps being taken to correct the
problem?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, it's an institutional issue in each instance, obviously,
first and foremost. But, yes, I'm concerned about it, always have been
concerned about it anytime we have one of those situations within our league.  
  
Our history in the ACC has been one that I and many others have been very
proud of. And the fact that we've really been on the low end of that; we've
had it. We've had them. But we've been on the low end of it. And we're not at
the top end of it now but we're not at the lowest.  
  
And we talked about this last week, collectively in our meetings in
Blacksburg, and it's not unusual for us to talk about that.  
  
But I think you want to eliminate those. Zero is the right number of those.
We're a larger league now and the larger you are, the more of everything that
happens. But it's something that I think you have to keep at the forefront of
the discussion collectively and be in a position that if our institutions have
something that they feel collectively we can do as a league that minimizes the
potential for NCAA violations at any of our schools, we need to do it.  
  
But the first thing is awareness and keeping it constantly in front of the
entire conference membership, because it's a part of our culture.  
  
Q. You said for years you 'd like to see a splashy open to the
basketball season. This year it begins early, November 5th and 6th, with a
full round of conference games. Is this a one-time thing coinciding with the
launch of the ACC Network, or do you see it as a template for the future in
basketball?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: We don't know yet. We're going to go through it this year and
talk about it and then make some decisions going forward. But I'm excited
about it. I think that it will grab basketball fans of the ACC and of the
nation right out of the chute so to speak.  
  
I've said that I think that basketball needed some kind of -- something
nationally to tip off the year. Football pretty much has that. I think with
the huge success of the College Football Playoff, I think that's had an impact
on the basketball regular season. So I think it's more and more important to
start the basketball season in a way that it deserves and that really grabs
fans' attention.  
  
So we're really excited about tipping off the year in that way with conference
games. And obviously it's outstanding in terms of the ACC Network. And that
was the stimulant but that may also become the norm. We just don't know.  
  
Paul Brasso is sitting down here and works diligently with our schedule each
and every year with our schools. And so we'll experience it and then talk
about it and then move forward from there.  
  
But I think it's terrific, particularly in the first year of the network. And
it was something we could do as a conference that where we didn't have to have
national buy-in on anything. So it was much easier to address it as a
conference.  
  
Q. The tournament 's returning back to Greensboro this year. With the
way the tournament has expanded its footprint into D.C. and Brooklyn, how
important is it to you to include Greensboro in part of a regular rotation?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: Well, I'm glad it is there this year because we've had so much
history in Greensboro. It's been in Greensboro more than any other venue. We
were here in Charlotte last year and had just a fabulous experience in every
respect.  
  
We've been in a rotation. We went to Brooklyn for two years. Felt like we
really needed to do that and the experience there was outstanding. And that
was coming off going to Washington.  
  
We're fortunate because of what this league has been over the years and its
tradition and history and the great coaches and great players that our
tournament is successful wherever it goes. It's just a question of how
successful. Is it different in one location than another? Yes. But I think
that's probably good. But it is good to be coming back to Greensboro. And
that's a different experience in Greensboro, obviously, than Brooklyn or DC or
even Charlotte. But it's a very good experience.  
  
The interesting thing -- and Jordan, you mentioned 23 years -- we were looking
at changeover and turnover in the league over that period of time and there
have been -- I think it's 53 presidents and 51 athletic directors during that
point in time.  
  
The reason I bring that up relates to the tournament. I can't give you the
exact number right offhand, but there are a number of athletic directors
sitting around that table and the ADs generally ultimately make the decision
as to the rotation of the tournament.  
  
A lot of those ADs have never been to an ACC Tournament in Greensboro. So it
will be the first experience for a number of those folks. So it will be
interesting.  
  
The same thing in Charlotte. A number of them had never been here in Charlotte
for an ACC tournament either. So those managing the transitions around the
table is important and sometimes challenging because you're constantly losing
some institutional memory every time somebody retires or leaves a position and
someone else comes in.  
  
But we'll see what the future holds. But I think the rotation or something
similar to what we're doing now is probably what you will see in the future.  
  
Q. From the outside, most people think first when it comes to the ACC of
men 's basketball and yet one of your ADs years ago was quoted as saying your
TV partners viewed football as 80-plus percent of the value of the
relationship. Do you believe that's true? And since we're here at basketball
day, how do you describe more generally the value of men's basketball to your
brand because a lot of folks were shocked to hear that this greatest
basketball league could be worth only 19 percent or something like that of the
total value?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: You know, I think there are different kinds of values.  
  
I would agree with what the athletic director was saying in today's world
based on dollar value and media rights, yes. I would agree with that. And
that's speaking from a commissioner's chair, I think it is fair to say that
for years we were a basketball-centric league in a sense because of the long-
term success and the consistent success nationally of our programs and the
depth of our programs. And the fact that this league going all the way back to
the late '50s was always ahead of everybody else in terms of basketball
television. Late '90s, early 2000s, the media values really started changing,
and quite frankly that was one of the reasons some of us in the league at that
time sat down and said for us to be who we want to be, and generally who we
are today, if not better, we're going to have to change and we're going to
have to get bigger.  
  
We're going to have to have more television sets. We're going to have to have
a geographic footprint that exceeds where we were with nine institutions and
we had to get better with football collectively and we had to have more impact
at the national level from a football standpoint, because the business model
in intercollegiate athletics at our level was changing, and it wasn't changing
in a way that was particularly favorable to us and our strength competitively
with basketball.  
  
I would say, along with all that, that -- and fortunately we were able to do
that, we expanded, I referenced all those things before, and we've really had
some good success football-wise, particularly at the top but also depth-wise,
when you look at bowls, when you look at our competitiveness within the league
as well as outside the league, we've made a lot of progress and we needed to,
if for no other reason was that it was shifting the business model.  
  
But I will say basketball is more valuable in this league and to this league,
in my opinion, than any other conference.  
  
So the ratios may be a little different and there's no question that that in
our relationship with ESPN, which is all in, basketball is tremendously valued
because of who we have been for so long and continue to be.  
  
Q. Going back to NIL, you mentioned you were afraid of a slippery slope
to professionalism. What is the bright line for you for what is
professionalism, I 'll editorialize all this looks very professional you just
got done talking about business and competitiveness and making money for the
leagues and the schools, so what is that bright line for student-athletes and
professionalism?  
JOHN SWOFFORD: I'm not sure exactly what that bright line is. I think we
almost have to get to particulars and define the particulars and see what it
means or as best we can and see how it feels.  
  
Certainly when you get to a point where it's an employer/employee
relationship, that's a bright line, but that's the ultimate bright line. I
think there are probably some others that maybe aren't quite as bright but
would be there. But that's why I look forward to a more focused discussion
from the working group on this to see where it takes us, because the
collegiate model, amateurism, you have some people ask why not just do the
Olympic model. To me the answer to that probably is recruiting. We recruit.
The Olympics don't recruit; we do.  
  
And I think we need to continue to have a national set of regulations that are
consistent across the board and that are as best we can manageable because
ultimately the whole compliance, back to the earlier question about
compliance, I mean ultimately obviously a culture in a league, and
particularly a culture at an institution matters in terms of that, in terms of
compliance and managing the enterprise, so to speak, that is there to manage
from a compliance standpoint. But it really gets down to individuals and
individual integrity.  
  
People know the rules. And it's usually not an institution that is breaking
rules; it's individuals that are a part of that institution and representing
institutions that have gone off the wagon there in terms of the compliance
wagon and not an institution -- I don't know of an institution in our league
that would knowingly be a part of breaking NCAA rules. I really don't. But
what we can do is constantly try to provide the kind of guidance and the
culture within institutions and athletic programs that minimize the risk that
an individual or two or three are going to push beyond the limits in terms of
compliance regulations.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach, this is for you. Just what you can say about the additions of
the transfers that you have coming in, just what they do for this team, what
they build for the depth and the importance of the transfers that you brought
in?  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah, no, I have felt for us when I got the job that we needed
to -- in order for us to have success, we wanted to get old and then
eventually stay old. That's been important to us. And so we've been able to do
that through recruiting and getting high school kids. A young man like Michael
Devoe, and then to grow with him, and then on the other hand also to get
transfers from other four-year institutions.  
  
And so a guy like James Banks or Jordan Usher, who will really help us, he'll
be eligible at mid-year, he's a transfer from USC, and then Bubba Parham, a
transfer, he's eligible right now. We have Shembari Phillips, who's a fifth-
year senior, a transfer.  
  
So I really believe in order for us to have the success that we need to have,
we need to get older, and this year's team, we're older. We have great
experience, and that's both from guys growing within the program and then
getting guys transfers who have already been in college. So it's part of our
formula for what we're trying to do to have success.  
  
Q. This is a question for James and for Coach. James, you led the league
in blocked shots last year, and you 're one of the top returning rebounders.
What makes you such a tough customer inside? Coach, Georgia Tech was very near
the top in three-point defense. What does James's toughness inside and your
ability to defend the three, what do those factors do to make Tech so
difficult to play really?  
JAMES BANKS III: To answer the question about being one of the best rebounders
coming back, one of the best shot blockers returning, I'd just like to say
that that was last year, so I have to build on that. Teams from the ACC have
film on that. They know what I did well last year, and they probably have a
way to stop it.  
  
So this summer I've just been working hard, getting stronger, getting more
athletic, working on my game, just so this year I can be just as effective if
not more effective on defense and rebounding.  
  
JOSH PASTNER: And in our three years here, we've been very, very good
defensively. If you look at our numbers, our first and third year we've been
nearing an elite defensive team.  
  
Second year I felt we were a good defensive team, but we've hung our hat on
the defensive end. Three straight years we've had a First-Team All-Defensive
guy, and two of the three years, not all three years, we've led the ACC in
shot blocking. We've had Ben Lammers both years, and now James Banks.  
  
Part of it's our philosophy defensively and what we do and what we recruit to
and how we play, but that's a big part of who we are and our identity is what
we do on the defensive end.  
  
Q. For James and Michael, what you can both say about how you would
describe this year 's team? And then secondly, knowing that there is no
postseason no matter what, just how you've kind of navigated through that?  
MICHAEL DEVOE: I would say that our team is really getting old, like Coach was
saying. We have a lot of depth. We have a lot of guys that are experienced and
ready to go, and our main objective this year is just winning games. We'll
leave all that other stuff to the media and the administration, and our main
objective is just to win games, so that's our main thing.  
  
JAMES BANKS III: Honestly, I'm excited about this year's team. If you look at
it on paper, a lot of our production is returning from last year, and just
being in the gym with these guys, these guys have been working hard all
summer, all spring, all fall, and everybody has really improved their games
offensively and defensively. Everybody is getting stronger, everybody is
getting faster, and I think that comes along with getting older.  
  
I think we'll be able to surprise a lot of people this year. Our transfers are
really exciting. We have him, we have Bubba, who's dangerous anywhere from
three-quarter court. We've got Jordan Usher, who puts his head on the him.
He's really a violent attacker. I think we'll surprise a lot of people this
year. People don't expect much from GT, but I think we'll win a lot of games.  
  
And speaking on the sanctions and things of that nature, we'll just let the
administration handle that. Our job as a player, my job is not to coach, my
job is not to worry about the postseason, my job is to go out there every day
and produce at a high level so we can win games, and my philosophy is winning
cures all.  
  
Q. Coach, stay on the whole getting older scenario. A lot of people
think about getting older in terms of play on the floor. What 's the value of
being older off the floor on campus, on road trips? Where is that maturity
value?  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah, again, just being older and more experienced, they've gone
through -- one, they know the system; two, they know kind of the standards of
what we do and what we want and how do we want to achieve the bottom line of
success.  
  
So again, that's just part of our vision and our plan, was to -- when we took
over, is we've got to get to a point where we're older and then we stay old,
and we've got to do that through recruiting high school kids and developing
them and getting them better and then getting four-year transfers and being
able to continue to develop them so we keep in that flow of just trying to be
as old as we can year in, year out.  
  
Q. Coach, we have kind of a clash of tempos in this league. We have
teams like Duke and Carolina, NC State, which like games in the 80s, teams
like Notre Dame and Virginia, more in the 60s. I 'm thinking you guys are
somewhere in the middle. Defensively how do you slow down a Duke as you did
very successfully for part of the game last year?  
JOSH PASTNER: Yeah, well, one is transition defense is really important to us,
being able to get back and build a wall. We talk about shrinking the floor,
and for the offensive player that has the ball, they have to see bodies.
They've got to see a crowded picture in front of them so they don't have the
gaps to be able to penetrate.  
  
But first order of business is getting back in transition defense, building a
wall, keeping it compact.  
  
You know, defensive fortitude is all about just having multiple efforts, being
a team that you are going to be a team that's going to make multiple effort
plays in each possession, and that's the best defensive teams do that.  
  
For the most part we were pretty good on that last year when we would make two
or three efforts in the possession to allow us to be able to have a good
defensive standard, a good defensive possession during that time period.  
  
Q. Michael, you shot nearly 40 percent from the three-point arc last
year while the rest of the team shot 30 percent. As a leader and coming back
as a sophomore, how do you encourage your teammates to get that percentage a
little bit higher?  
MICHAEL DEVOE: I would just say our work. Our work ethic, from throughout the
summertime, springtime, and going into fall is -- that's what Coach emphasizes
in practice a lot is our shooting. I think this year we've been working on it
really hard, and we've been locked in on that, and I think it's going to be a
huge thing for us this year, and a lot of guys are shooting the ball really
well in practice right now. I feel as if we're going to be really good at
shooting the ball this year.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 8, 2019

  

### [Danny Manning](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23674)

### [Andrien White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38106)

### [Brandon Childress](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32821)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach, this is for you. Just what you can say about your time at Wake
Forest up to this point, just what you 've learned over the years? And then
secondly, your relationship with the university and just what you can say
about the university and you moving forward?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, I'm excited. You know, obviously for me, I grew up in
Greensboro, North Carolina, most of my formative childhood years, and so Wake
Forest was always the closest ACC program that I could see or touch. And so to
be able to come back and to work at wake is something I feel very fortunate
and blessed about.  
  
I think wake provides a great opportunity for our young people obviously on
the basketball court, to play at a very high level, but also be at a great
academic institution. I feel like it's one of the better private schools in
the country, and it helps prepare you for life. And that's something that we
don't take seriously in helping prepare our young people for life.  
  
You know, right now I'm teaching life through the game of basketball, and at
the end of the day, though, the ball is going to stop bouncing and our young
people have to be prepared to be the best person that they can be, and that's
something that we enjoy stressing and sharing as a staff with our young men
every day.  
  
Q. Brandon, going into your senior year, assists seems to be your thing.
As the leader of this team, how do you plan to contribute your senior year?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: As a leader, just trying to find ways to take different
steps to approach the young guys and just understanding that we need everybody
this year. We have a lot of guys returning, actually the first time out of the
previous three years that I've been here, the majority of the team is
returning. I think only one or two players left from last year.  
  
So just understanding, sharing my knowledge of the game of basketball that
I've learned from Coaching Manning and the rest of the coaches and the staff,
and my brother here, Andrien, he's coming back from sitting out last year. So
just understanding what it takes to be successful and understanding that we've
got to get over the hump.  
  
Now that everyone is returning I'm actually excited. I'm ready for this year,
and I'm looking forward to -- ready for anything that comes our way.  
  
Q. Brandon, obviously you 've been there for a little bit. Winston-Salem
last year, ups and downs, but didn't finish the way you wanted to. How do you
try to refocus coming into a new season with a new crop of players and new
expectations?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: I mean, just embracing everything, just understanding what
we have and what that takes. We open up with Boston College this year, so our
level of preparation over the summer has really been different, opening up
with a game that's going to count towards conference and understanding that if
we go out there and be successful, how that can help us from down the line.  
  
So I mentioned before about passing on knowledge and things like that, and
just understanding what's at stake, playing the two early conference games and
just moving on forward from that. Just finding different ways to be successful
because a lot of guys are returning.  
  
Q. For the players, Brandon, just what you can say about your evolution
as a player at wake, and then Andrien, what you can say about being back in
Charlotte but now finally getting to represent Wake Forest on the floor?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: I'm just constantly putting in the work, early mornings and
late nights. I couldn't do any of this without the coaches, so just having
Coach Manning trusting in me, believing in me, giving me the opportunity to
play the amount of minutes I played last year, taking advice from him. He
helped me out.  
  
The success I had last year, that doesn't happen without the coaching staff
that we've got. So my evolution is from the coaches. I have a role in that,
but my coaches have a huge role in that.  
  
ANDRIEN WHITE: Being here in Charlotte is definitely a great experience for
me. Coming from UNC Charlotte and being back and now representing Wake Forest,
it's a dream to play for Wake Forest in a great conference like the ACC.  
  
I think just my evolution as a player from sitting out last year to stepping
in to play this year is just -- overall, strengthening all my skills as a
player and as a leader.  
  
Q. Andrien, I wanted to ask you now that we 're less than a month away
from you stepping back into a competitive game, really for the first time in
about two years, are you getting nervous, excited? Can't wait to get out
there? What's the emotion getting this close to you finally being on the court
again.  
ANDRIEN WHITE: I'm very excited after sitting out a year. I think the coaching
staff here has done a great job of keeping me engaged and busy this last year,
with helping with things like scout team and giving leadership assignments to
help guys that need help getting through slumps and things of that nature.  
  
I mean, I'm prepared. I feel as prepared as I've ever been in my career, and
I'm ready to come out and make an impact for this school and this university.  
  
Q. Coach, the Demon Deacons return six of the top seven scorers from
last season, return 77.3 percent of the minutes played, 77.2 percent of the
scoring, 68.2 of the rebounds and 82.7 of the assists. Fair to say these are
pretty stout numbers, pretty healthy as you get into the season?  
DANNY MANNING: Well, we're excited. Brandon alluded to it a little bit. We do
have some young men that have been battle tested in the ACC, and we have three
senior guards that have played minutes in college and understand what it takes
to be somewhat successful, understanding scouting report, understanding going
into each game that you're going to have to make adjustments.  
  
We have some upperclassmen front court players that we feel are going to make
great contributions for our team, as well, and then we have some freshmen that
are also going to have those contributions night in and night out.  
  
This is probably the first year in some time where we haven't had to throw our
freshmen to the fire and depend on them night in and night out, but there
certainly will be times throughout the course of the year that they're going
to have their moments, but for us we can always fall back on the veterans that
we have on our team and their experiences.  
  
Q. Brandon, a similar question as it was for Andrien, but for you it
might hold a little different meaning heading into your last season. What 's
it been like to represent the Demon Deacons given the family history and for
you wearing that black and gold?  
BRANDON CHILDRESS: This goes all the way back to high school, just being
recruited. I remember Coach Manning, before he took the job at wake, he was at
Tulsa and the letter of recommendation that I got from Coach Manning, he
didn't know but I knew he was before he recruited me. So when I first got that
letter I was extremely excited. It's amazing how God works.  
  
Three months later after the letter, he takes the job at Wake, and a month
later my dad is back at Wake Forest, as well. I didn't have any offers during
the time, was not heavily recruited at all, had a good summer that year, then
going into my junior year, thank God for Coach Manning and Coach Woodberry and
my father. They gave me the opportunity to play at Wake. I took full advantage
of that, didn't hesitate at all.  
  
And Coach Manning just said, Hey, I'll tell you, I was calling his phone once
or twice a week just getting knowledge of how can I be prepared for what's at
stake, for years coming at a time, and I feel like I took full advantage of
that, and I did, going to the weight room a lot, watching film, just being
ready for the ACC because there's no other conference like it.  
  
And I finally get to Wake, just embracing all the advice that he gave me
playing with great players like John Collins and Bryant Crawford, and the list
just goes on and on, and just embracing it.  
  
So just understanding that this is my last year, I've been to the tournament
my freshman year, had a good season last year, just knowing what's at stake,
just understanding and taking my time and just embracing all the little things
that's going on now because I won't get this next year.  
  
Q. Coach, what 's it been like coaching the son of an assistant coach,
the assistant coach who obviously carries so much history with Wake Forest?
Did you have to learn that coaching dynamic? You had never been in that
scenario before. Take us behind the curtain just a little bit.  
DANNY MANNING: I can relate to that scenario because that was what I was in in
college. My father was an assistant coach at Kansas under Coach Brown when I
was there, and so it's a great memory for me.  
  
You know, Brandon is going through very similar situation. He gets very
aggressive counseling, so to speak, day in and day out from our coaching staff
and from his father, as well. But for Brandon, his situation, his growth as a
player is kind of what you want your players to go through.  
  
He comes in as a freshman and he has a role, he gets a chance to contribute,
but he also gets a chance to take things in. His sophomore year, he gets a
little bigger role. His junior year, his numbers speak for itself and the
things that he was able to do. His work ethic, his preparation gave him a
chance to be successful like that.  
  
And now not only him but Andrien and Torry, those three senior guards, it's
their role to give us a chance to go out and be successful night in and night
out but also prepare the younger guys as we move forward.  
  
I'm excited about this group. These guys work extremely hard, and we're
looking forward to the season.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 8, 2019

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Steven Enoch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38103)

### [Jordan Nwora](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36733)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach, just what can you say about what you took away from last
season at Louisville, coming in, just what you saw from the program walking
into it and now what you see moving forward as you progress?  
CHRIS MACK: Sure. I couldn't be any more grateful and thankful for the guys
that we have and had in our locker room a year ago. I think to be able to add
Akoy Agau, Cristen Cunningham, and Khwan Fore, three guys that had been
through the wars, so to speak, of college basketball and wanted to be at a
second home, and then the guys that, you know, didn't get recruited by me. I
said in the very beginning, hey, this was never going to be "Wait until Coach
Mack gets his guys in," and they were all in.  
  
I thought we exceeded a lot of expectations. It also left a bitter taste in
our mouth losing eight of the last ten, whatever it was. So despite all the
fanfare, all the preseason prognosticators and the cover of magazines and all
that stuff, I try to tell our guys: Don't drink that poison. We haven't done
anything yet, and we're the same team that felt as low as we did in the NCAA
Tournament at the end of the year.  
  
We're excited about the year, I think our guys are working their tails off to
try to have a memorable season.  
  
Q. The league has gone through a great deal of turnover, most of the
veteran players have moved on. You 're blessed to have a number of players
back from last year as well as new players. What are your expectations for
this year's team?  
CHRIS MACK: Well, my expectations, I'm not going to sort of throw the whole
season out there, but I'll talk about just be at your best each and every day.
I think these guys will tell you that I want our practices to be ultra
competitive. I think having 13 scholarship players as opposed to 8 or 9
healthy scholarship players a year ago has made a world of difference.  
  
We have had a couple of guys go down, unfortunately, in the preseason. I would
like to think that our team, you know, certain individuals will have
opportunities, maybe they wouldn't have if David or Malik had been healthy. So
when we get those guys back, we become a whole team, a deeper team, I would
like to think that makes us a better team. You know, my expectations are to
come to practice ready to go, to be as competitive as we possibly can, and to
win every game that we play. It is not always going to work out that way. We
have to figure out how to deal with adversity. I wouldn't want to be around
any other group than these guys.  
  
Q. This is for Jordan and Steven, what can you say about what Coach Mack
navigated you through, on and off the court? There was adversity, how he
navigated you through that, and the positive he 's brought to you as a leader.
Both of you to answer that question, if you can.  
STEVEN ENOCH: You know, Coach Mack came in a year ago and he's kept the same
expectations with him that he has now for us. That's never changed. That's
just -- that falls in line with loyalty, being a leader as well.  
  
You know, it is up to us to follow that and emulate that and translate that to
the court. You know, translate his competitiveness as a coach on to the court
as we head into the season.  
  
JORDAN NWORA: Yeah. I would say the same thing. Coach Mack came in, has had
the same energy, same attitude every day, ultra competitive. He's kind of
instilling that into us. And if we're not competitive, we're going to hear it.
That's making us even better every day.  
  
Like I said, I have said it earlier today and I wouldn't want to play for
anybody else. You know, I'm really happy he came here. You know, he's doing a
great job with us, I know he'll keep doing a great job with us. Like I said,
we'll be all right if we just keep following his lead.  
  
Q. Jordan, you 're one of the top three-point shooters returning to the
league in terms of percentage. Line's a farther back this year. Is that -- how
do you think that will affect the league, and how will it affect you? Is it
going to affect you? Do you have that NBA range?  
JORDAN NWORA: I don't know if you watched any games last year, I already shoot
-- I already shoot a lot of my shots from out there. I played FEMA this
summer, I was playing from that line all summer.  
  
In terms of the league, in my eyes I feel like if you can shoot, you can shoot
if the line is pushed back a little bit. I don't think it matters, you know.
We have guys on the team, you know, Ryan shooting the same, people are
shooting the same.  
  
If you can shoot, you're going to be able to shoot. The line isn't crazy far
back. It is not an NBA three. So, yeah, if you can shoot, you can shoot.  
  
Q. In one word, can you describe the personality of the team? So many
new faces, so many different bodies. One word, how do you describe the
personality?  
JORDAN NWORA: Competitive.  
  
Q. You want to back up the reason for that word?  
JORDAN NWORA: It is just what's preached to us every day. So you know, that's
what we want to be. That's going to help us win games. Yeah. That's what I
would use for our team.  
  
Q. Steven, you can 't say ditto?  
CHRIS MACK: That means I'm getting my message across. That's awesome.  
  
Q. Steven?  
STEVEN ENOCH: If there was one word -- Jordan kind of took my competitive
word. I was going to use that, honestly. I would say consistent. You know, so
far every practice that we had, we've been the same people and the same
competitive players every day. So, you know, as long as we keep bringing that
to the table every day, you know, we've got the capability to take this season
as far as we want.  
  
Q. This question is for Coach. Not every team in the league has one big
man, let alone two, you 're blessed to have a couple of big bigs and Jordan is
a top rebounder returning to the league. These guys, when they're able to
play, what do they mean to the program? What are the skills? They bring a
little bit different things, I think you would agree?  
CHRIS MACK: They're definitely unique in terms of what each brings to the
stable. Steve is a very, very gifted scorer, a guy that's just as comfortable
facing the basket at 21, 22 feet as he is with his back to the basket. Equally
on the block, he's very comfortable going over his left shoulder, his right
shoulder. You don't often find that in a big guy.  
  
I give is Steven a lot of credit. The strides he's made from last year to this
year have been more in the conditioning and stamina. I don't say this about
any player usually, Steven doesn't have to get any stronger. He's as strong as
he'll ever need to be in his life. He does have to be able to sustain his
play.  
  
It is great to hear him use the word consistent. I think that's what his team
needs him to do, is be a consistent guy each and every night with his
production, with his defensive intensity, with his effort, but you can't do
that if you're getting too winded three and four times up and down the floor.
That's where I feel he's made the biggest change from last year to this year.  
  
You know, Malik, to me, Malik is one of the best defensive big guys in the
country. He affects the game at the rim. He has great anticipation. Although
not a tremendous athlete, he has great timing, he can block shots, he's got
the versatility to move his feet on the perimeter against a guard.  
  
At the same time, he's tough enough and stronger now to battle an inside, you
know, presence. If the ball is on the floor, I think anybody on our team would
tell you that Malik is the first guy with his nose on the ground diving for a
loose ball. It is part of the reason why his teammates voted him unanimously
as a captain this year, I think that says a lot about how people feel about
Malik on the team.  
  
Q. Chris, I know that there is a lot of little things that you probably
want to fix, looking especially at that last stretch of games from last
season. If you had to pick the one big issue that you think is facing your
team this year, what is it?  
CHRIS MACK: I talked to our team a lot about the word "finishing," being able
to finish a practice, finish a drill, finish a game, finish a season, which I
know may seem like a far-reaching or a broader way to look at things, but I
think that's important that our team really focus on that.  
  
So you know, being able to finish a possession might mean, you know, making a
better decision with the ball, being stronger with the ball, being able to
finish through contact and get the and-one, being able to inbound the ball
against pressure. Those type of things I think they have to be really, really
important to our team during practice because you are in the game who you are
in practice every single day, and the fortunate thing that I have is guys that
have been with me now for over a year along with an infusion of energy with
our six freshman. That, to me, I don't want to say is the biggest issue, but
something that we talk about every single day.  
  
Q. You talked about Malik, him and David Johnson have both been injured.
Can you give a health date on them?  
CHRIS MACK: Sure, David Johnson, a freshman from Louisville, Trinity High
School, Mike Szabo did a great job coaching him. He got injured, I don't know
the date, sometime in June -- or, sorry, sometime in July, tore his labrum in
his left, which fortunately for us was his non-shooting shoulder.  
  
He's far ahead of schedule. They gave us the timeline of four to eight months,
and I think it is going to be closer to four. He saw a doctor the other day,
and the doctor said six weeks from today we think he can be back on the court
playing for us. You can get the calendars out, check when that is. I'm not
really quite sure.  
  
That's really good news for our team. David has great size at his position. I
think his IQ for the game is really terrific and will help us on both ends of
the floor.  
  
Then Malik broke his 5th metatarsal and had a surgery to get a pin in it. Was
given the timeline of six to eight weeks. I think he's just finished with week
two from the surgery. You know, when we get him back, we'll probably be -- if
he was on the six-week timeframe, would be a couple of days before we play
Miami. I highly doubt he'll be able to go by then. We want to be very
cognizant of making sure we bring him back at the right time.  
  
Both guys are doing well. Malik is in a boot. So it is hard to really judge
his progress so far.  
  
Q. With the announcement of you being captain, how did that
responsibility feel for you? Do you feel like you have to adjust to something,
or is it something that you 're used to and it is just a title that came along
with it?  
JORDAN NWORA: I'm not a captain.  
  
Q. I meant Steven. I was looking at you --  
CHRIS MACK: He's not a captain either.  
  
JORDAN NWORA: Neither of us are captains.  
  
STEVEN ENOCH: It is okay, though. I appreciate you!

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 8, 2019

  

### [Jim Larranaga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13680)

### [DJ Vasiljevic](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38105)

### [Chris Lykes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34998)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach, this is for you. Just what you can say about how Chris and DJ
kind of represent what you are at Miami and just what you can say about having
the team on their shoulders as you step forward into the season?  
JIM LARRA�AGA: Well, I love these guys. They've been great. Chris is now a
junior. It's hard to believe so much time has gone by so quickly. But he's
been tremendous in his first two years. We expect him to be a very, very
important leader for us, along with DJ Vasiljevic. DJ is shooting to become
the leading three-point shooter in school history this year, and we hope he
achieves that goal because that means he's making a lot of threes.  
  
Between Chris and DJ, they're both closing in on 1,000 points in their career,
and they've done a great job so far with a group of young guys that they
compete against every day in practice.  
  
Q. Chris, you seem to play with no fear. DJ, you seem to play with a
laser focus. Where does that personality come from?  
CHRIS LYKES: My nickname when I was younger my mom gave me was "No Fear." I
just used to do things without necessarily thinking, and the consequences
sometimes were a little bad. I think that's just how I play basketball because
I feel like in basketball you can make up for plays. There's a lot of
possessions in a game. So you've got to play with no fear.  
  
DEJAN VASILIEVIC: Growing up, I think I just had a concentration of just
wanting to win and do whatever I have to do to get that win. That's why I'm so
laser focused in the game. I also have a little bit of pitbull in me because I
want to compete and win.  
  
Q. Chris and DJ, this is for both of you. Just what you can say about
playing off of each other, how you make each other better on and off the court
as people, and then obviously as teammates in the backcourt?  
CHRIS LYKES: This is my third year with DJ, and I'm starting to kind of feel
for where he likes to get his shots, which really is anywhere, especially from
three, but playing well off each other. If DJ doesn't have it, he's making a
quick move and he has easy layups, but if he doesn't have it, he's kicking
out. That's what we've been working on in practice is getting in the paint and
kicking out for catch and shoot threes, which has been a real emphasis for us
this year. But DJ is probably one of the best shooters I've ever seen.  
  
DEJAN VASILIEVIC: Just to bounce back off Chris, I think we're playing really
well together in practice and reading one another really well. I'm creating
space on the floor for him really well. By me spacing the floor, it gives him
an opportunity to go one-on-one. When my man does help, he does find me for
the open shots. I think we're really connecting that way.  
  
Q. You have two transfers coming into the system this year. What have
you learned in your time about meshing a transfer personality into a group of
kids that you 've had with you for two or three years?  
JIM LARRA�AGA: Well, I think team is all about teamwork, and working together
is the whole key, and guys knowing what they need to do, what their job is,
identify their role so they can make a great contribution. Whether you are a
veteran player like DJ and Chris, who really know their role because they've
been doing it for a long time, or a freshman who comes in and has to learn
what his role is going to be. It's all about teamwork. It's all about guys
working together, identifying your role, and making a great contribution to
the team effort.  
  
Q. DJ and Chris, last year the team shot 33 percent from beyond the arc.
That was sixth in the league. The arc has been moved back a little bit. What
is it that you guys are working on? How is it that you 're communicating about
the next open man, a better percentage shot, and making sure that you guys
jostle that number up a little bit?  
DEJAN VASILIEVIC: I think we're emphasizing in practice to catch and shoot a
lot because -- the analytics coach talks about it a lot. The catch and shoot
is the best three-point shot there is. So emphasizing that a lot in practice.
And I think the guys are putting in work before and after practice of
adjusting to the line.  
  
Obviously, me being from a foreign country, being able to play at that three-
point line before, so it doesn't really make a difference for me. I think the
team's doing really well to adjust.  
  
CHRIS LYKES: Basically, what DJ is saying. We've got guys that can really
shoot the ball. So I don't think the line is affecting guys too much. Like DJ
was saying, Coach L has been preaching to us about catch and shoot, and that's
kind of the way basketball is translating to right now. Getting in the paint
and kicking it out for threes has been the highest percentage, and it's also
you get the most points per possession.  
  
So just working on that, and if we can get good at that, I feel like we've got
guys who can break down their man and be able to do that with ease.  
  
Q. Coach, I understand that during practice you 've got a new three-
point practice drill. They're color coded as well, under 40 red, over 50
yellow. Can you explain that a bit?  
JIM LARRA�AGA: We believe the best way to evaluate a player is to make sure
he's proficient at any level. We have a very specific level. It's called five
minutes of threes. If a player can average making 50 or more in five minutes,
he gets the green light, meaning that that's a great shot for him and he
should shoot it.  
  
If he is open, he should not hesitate. If he can average between 40 and 50,
that's the yellow light. You need to shoot it with a little bit more caution.
It may not be your best shot, but it's still something you can make. If you're
under 40, it's not a good shot for you or our team, and that means you
shouldn't shoot it. That's the red light. Under 40 on the average is a red
light, not a good shot for you.  
  
Q. Coach, we always seem to end our Miami session with you with a little
bit of wisdom, little bit of thought. You 're entering your 36th season as a
head coach. What have you learned that has really stuck with you in all this
time?  
JIM LARRA�AGA: Honestly, you learn an awful lot throughout your life, whether
you're a basketball coach or in any walk of life. What I've learned is every
job, whether it's as a coach, a player, a sports writer, a TV personality,
what have you, that every job is challenging and that life is about handling
those challenges, overcoming adversity, and working together with others to
achieve goals.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 8, 2019

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Jack White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36124)

### [Javin DeLaurier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36125)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Question for Coach, but the players can chime in. Duke averaged more
than 82 points a game last year, led the league in scoring for a lot of the
year. What does it take offensively and defensively to score that many points
in a league where so many teams are comfortable playing in the 60s, and can
this year 's team push the tempo in the same way with Tre back?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: That's a long question. Well, I think it starts with defense,
and we think we have a chance to be a good defensive team, and defense
hopefully can force a tempo and force some turnovers, which give you a
numerical advantage. So that adds to offense. Offense, we'll play a fast style
of play.  
  
Our team this year is very balanced, so we're going to need not just balance
in whatever the starting five would be, but really from 1 through 10. We can
play that many guys. I think you can get greater consistency then because you
have more guys playing.  
  
Q. Coach, just what you can say to expand a little bit more on the
return of Tre Jones, what he does for the team, and then the leadership from
your senior group that you have.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, Tre is a key guy for us because he's going to have the
ball most of the time. Last year he got the ball especially designed and RJ.
Now he's going to have to distribute it to a number of guys. His ball pressure
gets things going.  
  
But as important as he is, the two guys on the podium with me are extremely
important. Our three captains, these two guys with the experience they have,
and they both become better players, I think those three guys have to be solid
for us, and I think will be.  
  
Q. Jack, you 're a senior now. How did that happen?  
JACK WHITE: I guess I've been at Duke for a few years. But I mean, the time
has gone by as quick as anything. I can't believe it myself sitting here about
to start my senior year. But yeah, I'm just excited to get started with this
team we have this year and get to competing, and yeah, I just can't wait.  
  
Q. You guys lost four of your best players. The whole league, though,
has lost a lot of players, no first or second team players are back from the
whole league. Have you had a chance to look at the entire league and how do
you think it shapes up this year?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You know, really I have not, but I know those things. I
thought we really had five teams last year that by the end of the year could
have been National Championship teams. This year I think it's wide open. It'll
be -- to go to 20 games, and I think the league will be more balanced, and as
a result there will be some great basketball throughout. There aren't the
veteran teams that we had last year, so I think staying healthy and how --
like for us how our young guys develop will be two keys for us.  
  
Q. Coach and players, to play off what you just said, what is it like to
lead a program and play in a program where Final Fours and championships are
the expectation?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Is that our expectation? Are you putting expectations on us?
No, we want -- our program has been one of the best ones, and it's not the
only one, but it's one of them, and I think if you're going to have an
outstanding program you have to have high expectations. When you don't do it,
then there will be big disappointments. But you're dealing at that level. Each
year we have a different team.  
  
But I like my group. Not that I didn't like my group last year, but this group
is -- they really like one another, and they -- there's not the separation
that we've had from our starting five to our bench like we've had in the last
few years. The balance and togetherness hopefully will produce something
really good for us.  
  
JAVIN DELAURIER: Just speaking on expectations, I don't think we really look
at it in that way. For us, it's more of us setting goals and knowing whether
or not we can achieve them, and for the guys who have come back, we've been on
some teams where we've been a play or two away from that Final Four.  
  
And so whether or not we lived up to expectations, I don't think we look at
our season as having been that. We look at it for the body of work that we've
done. But at the same time we carry that disappointment and we think about it
every day.  
  
JACK WHITE: Yeah, pretty much echoing what Javin said. I feel like anything
from the outside, outside of our team, outside of our group, coaching staff
and players, in terms of the expectations that are put on us, we don't really
pay too much attention to it. It is what it is, but at the end of the day, I
think as a group we have a collective goal to win a National Championship
every year, and that's what we're focused on, in our preparations for the
season and throughout, that's our focus.  
  
Q. Javin and Jack, what you can say about being a part of this senior
class and just the leadership that you both bring back to this team this year
and, secondly, what you think about the freshmen coming in?  
JACK WHITE: Well, I think first of all, coming off a leadership role from last
year, I think it's helped us feeling comfortable coming into our senior year
with that same role, and obviously with a fresh group of guys coming in, just
really excited to learn from them, learn with them, and compete with them. I
think our experience last year is going to help us with that.  
  
In terms of -- what was the other part of the question?  
  
Q. Just leadership-wise for you and Javin --  
JAVIN DELAURIER: Jack sort of touched on it earlier. It's crazy how fast time
flies. Being a senior now, really just trying to emulate what the guys who
were in my position when I came in as a freshman, what they did for me in
terms of reaching out and being a good leader and trying to help me on my
path.  
  
We try to do that with the freshmen because we know how difficult that
transition can be. ACC basketball is no joke, and so just trying to prepare
them in every way that we possibly can before we get into the thick of things.  
  
Q. Similar question for Javin and Jack; you 've been through this a few
times now, a new team forming. Can you talk about the process with the new
guys, summer, preseason, during the season, when you feel good about it, how
it's starting to come together, this new team?  
JAVIN DELAURIER: Well, this team, it's been fairly seamless in our transition
between last year and this year in that the freshmen have come in, they've
worked really hard and they're eager to learn. We also just have more vets
than we have in years past, and so having that continuity has really helped us
transition into becoming a team.  
  
JACK WHITE: Yeah, I think obviously we've touched on the balance of our team
already with a few questions, and I think that's definitely helped us create
-- I don't know how to say it, but it seems like we're all on the same page in
terms of what we're all trying to do in coming in every day, trying to
compete, and we're just making each other better.  
  
I think because we're so balanced, guys look to one another to challenge them
or whatever it may be, guys are keeping each other accountable. So I think it
puts a bit more ownership on us as players to really control our destiny in a
sense, and obviously you put Coach into that equation, we're on the right
track.  
  
Again, you know, just excited to get started.  
  
Q. Coach, you touched on it a little bit, but I wanted to also get some
more of your thoughts on the 20-game schedule this year and how some teams
have the opening night game and then while you guys aren 't as early, you do
have an early December conference game, as well, so how that changes the
league?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, you know, college athletics should always evolve. Our
conference, with the network, 20 games comes at a good time, more content. I
think you're coming closer to having a true champion, still like when we had a
round-robin where you played everyone twice.  
  
But in order to fit it in you have to do the whole year, and I think that
that's going to be good overall. And we're going to make it good. What's
happened -- this is my 40th year, so I've seen the league change quite a bit,
and it's exciting for the league to take this step forward with the network
and with the 20 games.  
  
We'll see how it all works. I wasn't a big -- and still am not a big fan of --
we're in the Champions Classic, so we have a tough game, but it's not a
conference game. I'd like to see us have a little bit of time before you get
into conference.  
  
But you adapt to what's being done, so I think it'll be great.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 8, 2019

  

### [Kevin Keatts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30653)

### [Markell Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36703)

### [C.J. Bryce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33041)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach Keatts, good to see you again, glad you and the guys are
here.  
What I wanted to do is ask you this: Your teams have always been noted for
being strong physically in the fourth stage of the game, fourth quarter of the
game. Other than that, what are you stressing this year to the guys that you
want to stand out with? What are those goals that you have for the team?  
  
KEVIN KEATTS: Well, I appreciate you talking about my team being -- we take
pride in obviously being in great shape towards the end of the game. I think
that one thing that we want to emphasize and what we have been talking about
in the practice, is we want to be a really low turn over team.  
  
What I mean by that, from us, obviously on defensive end, we try to turn guys
over as much as we can and create tempo, but we don't want -- we want to play
fast, but don't want to turn the ball over ourselves. So that would be one of
the things that we're working on.  
  
I do think that we have to become a better defensive rebounding team so that
we can get out and run and transition and getting a few more easy baskets?  
  
Q. Coach, just what can you say about the first couple of seasons at NC
State building up the brand, creating that environment that you want? Just
where things are at from when you stepped in, what you can say about that?  
KEVIN KEATTS: That's a great question. I'm excited about where we are entering
year three. You know, if you told me that we were going to year three winning
45 games and beating six top 25 teams, I would tell you that we're right on
pace.  
  
Obviously, we were all a little disappointed about the outcome of not making
the NCAA Tournament last year, but that being said, we put that behind us and
we're really focused on moving on. I like our team. I like our pieces. For the
first time since I have been at NC State, we have the most returners that we
have ever had, which is seven.  
  
Q. Coach, only three teams in the ACC average 80 points or better,
Europe one of them. You preach about pushing the ball. Other teams in the
league are not comfortable playing at your pace, 60s and 70s. Can you tell us,
offensively and defensively, what 's required to play at the pace that you
want to play at?  
KEVIN KEATTS: You have to be in great shape in order to play in our system.
That doesn't mean that you can't play in our system if you're not in great
shape, but your minutes won't be there. We're trying to get the ball out in
transition as fast as we can.  
  
I tell Markell and Braxton and C.J. all the time we want to run a three-second
offense and fast break and try to get the ball up and try to score without
setting the offense up.  
  
Defensively, we want to create off the defense trying to get as many easy
baskets as we can. I like where we're at with our pace. Obviously, you know,
scoring 80-plus points a game has been great for us. I would love to run even
a little bit more if we could.  
  
Q. C.J. and Markell, C.J., Coach talked about returning seven guys and
the importance of that and what the team feels like going in the season?
Markell, being one of those returners, just what you can say about the
decision to come back after testing the waters of the NBA?  
C.J. BRYCE: We definitely bring back some experience from last year's team.
You know, like Coach mentioned. You know, not being able to -- a little bit
disappointed not going to the tournament, playing NIT, definitely experienced
some hungry guys on the roster. Guys are ready to play this year.  
  
MARKELL JOHNSON: Just picking off of what C.J. said, having the experience of
coming back, you know, with the pieces we have coming in. I thought it was
just a great decision for me to come back.  
  
Q. For the students, from the podium, what 's the key to consistency?
How do you build consistency?  
C.J. BRYCE: I believe that you build consistency by going hard every day in
practice. You know, when you get to those games in late February, March, you
know, you can rely on what you did in practice at the beginning of the season
and offseason, you know.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Markell will take the dive and say exactly what C.J. said.
That's fine.  
  
Q. As a result, Markell, you get the next question. You 're the leading
returning three-point shooter in terms of percentage in the league, you also
have been a leader in assists for a couple of years. Last year your steals
were down somewhat from the previous year. You took a nasty fall and hurt your
back last year. In hindsight, did that play a part in your defensive game? And
secondly, what are your expectations this year?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Before you answer that, why were your steals down, Markell? I
want to know that!  
  
MARKELL JOHNSON: I really don't know why my steals were down. I would say I
wasn't really that locked in defensively last year as I am this year.  
  
This year, you know, make it to the tournament, not only to make it to the
tournament but make a run in the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, from the podium, you show so much fire and enthusiasm on the
sideline. Where do you get that energy from, and do you ever get tired come
February and March?  
KEVIN KEATTS: Yeah, I don't -- when it is basketball season, its basketball
season. I don't sleep. You know, I'm up all the time. You know, this is the
most exciting sport that you can play in and be a part of. So I get excited
about the opportunity.  
  
I get a chance to work with great young men all the time, and to play the game
the way we like to be played, that's exciting to me.  
  
Q. C.J., you have been with Coach Keatts for a lot of years at UNCW and
NC State. What jumps out is the fact that like last year, NC State was one of
the very top offensive rebounding teams despite playing just one big man. How
do you do that? How do you become such a force rebounding with just one big?  
C.J. BRYCE: You know, I have been with Coach Keatts for a while, you know, he
hasn't changed. He demands the most out of his players to go hard every single
day. You know, that happens to be in the offensive rebounding range last year,
but we want to go hard in every category and be the best at whatever we do.  
  
Q. How cool is it for you to be in Charlotte your senior year at an
event like this?  
C.J. BRYCE: It is great. I actually wish that the ACC Tournament was this year
again. You know, it is great being home. You know, seeing a lot of familiar
faces here, and I'm glad I can do it with Coach Keatts and Markell Johnson.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 8, 2019

  

### [Leonard Hamilton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14060)

### [M.J. Walker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38100)

### [Trent Forrest](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35070)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach, 17 seasons, heading into season No. 18. Just what you can say
about the evolution of Florida State and your opinion, just where the program
was and where it 's been taken in almost two decades here.  
LEONARD HAMILTON: It appears that we've developed some consistency over the
years. I think we've developed a culture that our players have bought into.
We've been able to recruit to who we are. We've -- early on, I thought we
adjusted our system to the talent that we have available.  
  
I think now what we're doing, we're recruiting the kind of players that fit
the system that we feel comfortable in implementing into our system.  
  
So we're happy with where we are. We are still driven by the fact that we have
not won a championship, which I'm not real sure, very many people feel like
that should be a goal of our ours, but we've been knocking on the door the
last several years. But the fact that we haven't made it to the Final Four or
had an opportunity to compete for a national title, I think our guys are
extremely motivated. They're consistently, sometimes maybe -- we're in a
conference of some of the most rich tradition and successful programs in the
history of college basketball, so we always have goals that we can achieve and
great teams that we can compete against, and that just motivates us to work a
little harder to continue moving our program forward.  
  
We expect to have a good year now. We think that we have a good basketball
team, and we're looking forward to an opportunity to go in and show who we
are.  
  
Q. Coach, I don 't think any team lost as many great players to
graduation in the NBA as you did, and yet you still have a really good core of
players who got playing time, including the two men next to you. Is this the
ultimate justification of your 10, 11-man rotation? Where would you be if you
had not been playing so many players?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: That's the way we've been over the last number of years. We
try to develop a system that, as we're moving players on, we have guys with
experience that are returning that can set the table and give us good
leadership like we have with these two guys here. They have been tremendous,
Trent and M.J. They're great in the locker room, great before practice, after
practice, setting the tone that these are our standards that everyone has to
live up. We've been consistent with that.  
  
I think we have four sophomores that are -- we have four redshirt sophomores.
We have a couple of juniors in Trent. We have two seniors, and we have several
first year players that are in our system that seem to be buying in. I think
the culture now will allow us to be consistent and successful year in and year
out.  
  
Q. Trent, going into your last year at Florida State, how do you make
this year count?  
TRENT FORREST: I would just say coming in every day, doing just the same thing
I always did, work hard. The main thing, just being on my last year, is just
to cherish every day. I mean, going out of college, I'll miss Florida State.
I'll miss Coach and my teammates. So just cherishing every day. But to make it
count, just come in every day, work hard, demand the most of myself and just
demand the most of my teammates.  
  
Q. This is for M.J. and Trent. Just what you can say about evolving
through this and knowing the fact that some of the guys that came before you
that have since moved on that you spoke about a little bit here today have had
success, but you 've had success behind them now, you're passing the torch,
kind of taking that, and just what you can say about this year's team being
leaders and maybe some of those guys you're passing the torch to.  
M.J. WALKER: I would just say the guys that left, the legacy that they left
and the example that they left impacted us a lot. We've learned so much from
them as far as just how they approach the game and their leadership styles and
how they got us involved on the court.  
  
I think for us as leaders, we learned so much from them, and we're trying to
continue that culture throughout the rest of our program, through our guys so
that, when our time is done, that culture has continued to build. We'll just
continue to keep building.  
  
TRENT FORREST: I would just kind of go along with what M.J. said. I mean, I'm
pretty sure they feel like they left it better than what it was when they got
here, and now just for me and M.J., we want to do the same thing, leave it
better when we're gone than what it was than while we were here. If we can do
that, we'll be able to be the best leaders we can be in the position that we
are in.  
  
We were able to learn so much from those guys because we were with them for at
least two years. So it was -- I mean, we got to see kind of the younger stage
and then the maturity process that they went through from like junior to
senior year, sophomore to junior year. So it's kind of just the same thing
with us. We've been able to see that, and we kind of went through the same
process, just going from that junior to senior year or sophomore to junior
year. So just leaving the culture better than what it was when we got here.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about when you 're recruiting, the type of guys
that you recruit because you get them to buy in to that ten-man rotation year
in and year out?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: I've been asked that question quite a bit, and I'm finding
it interesting because we don't seem to have any problem with our guys buying
in to our system. That's who we are, and we try to be honest with the
prospects when we go into their homes, and they understand that works.  
  
When we look back over the last eight or nine years, I think guys have been
able to go on and realize the opportunities available for them. We've only
had, I think, two youngsters not graduate in the last 17 years. They've been
with us for four years, so they're leaving with their degrees. They're leaving
with opportunities to play basketball at the next level. Many have gone on to
Europe. Some have gone on to the NBA. Those that have not have successful
lives.  
  
So I think we try to be honest with the players that we are recruiting as to
who we are, and the guys who come buy into the culture. So we've had very
little issues, and we think that, in order for us to be successful, we've just
got to play extremely hard on both ends of the court, and in order to be able
to do that, you can't play if you're fatigued.  
  
We have a motto that resting is the enemy of success. So we don't rest very
much. We try to play hard on both ends, and to be honest with you, I think if
you're on the court and you're doing that, you can't sustain that level of
effort but for so many minutes, and our guys look forward to the rest.  
  
Q. Coach, if I 've done my count right, you've got eight newcomers, and
of those eight, they each represent a class -- freshman, sophomore, junior,
senior. Quite a lot of diversity, the meshing, how do you take these
personalities and put them together with the guys you've got coming back?  
LEONARD HAMILTON: We understand each player is individual, and we try to give
them rules that allow them to be successful within their abilities, and we try
to play to their strengths. And those who need areas of improvement in the
game, we work on those. So everyone realizes they have an opportunity to make
a contribution to our system, and even some of the younger guys, it's obvious
in areas where they need to improve.  
  
We've had very little issue. I think everybody wants to play. Everybody wants
to contribute, and we give them the opportunities they deserve. We've had very
little issues. You're always going to have one or two, but those guys probably
aren't great fits. So we have -- I don't know of any issues, really issues
that we've had that we haven't been able to sit down and talk about and work
things out. People seem to be accepting of who we are and how we have to play
in order to be successful.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach, just what you can say about your five seasons at Boston
College, what your takeaways have been, and kind of like that look in the
mirror, what you 're seeing, what you've seen over the last five years as you
step forward.  
JIM CHRISTIAN: You know, I think every year is different. I think you build an
excitement for each year, and without question, this group that we've
assembled this year is just so much fun to be around because they're just so
connected. There's so much energy in our gym.  
  
So to watch the culture of our program grow and grow, even though we've lost
some really key guys along the way, whether it be to the NBA or to injury,
just a culmination of watching that is special. That's what building a program
is all about.  
  
Q. Following up on that question, Coach, you did, as you said, lose some
talented players, but you 've got a number of them back, including these two,
and Steffon Mitchell is a top rebounder. What do you see as potential areas of
improvement this year for Boston College?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: That's a really good question. I think what happens when you
lose a really great scorer, and Ky was a guy that could create a lot of shots
for himself and just hit big shots, I think the team has to now absorb those
points, and I think the best way to do it -- and for us, one of our areas of
growth that we're trying to see is scoring from defense, just creating more
havoc on the court, creating more transition opportunities where everybody can
get involved and everybody can get excited.  
  
And that's really where our main focus has been, is where can we grow
collectively to help our team grow long-term. I think our players have really
been bought in from minute one of it. I think it's a mentality that's going to
carry us through the year.  
  
Q. Derryck, what you can say made BC the right fit for you when you were
in the transfer partal trying to figure out where the best place was to go?
And, Nik, navigating through adversity, what you can say about going through
those injuries and what that taught you?  
DERRYCK THORNTON: I think from the first time I talked to Coach first and just
the staff, I felt extremely comfortable, and that was a huge thing for me is
just being able to be comfortable. It's a great education, great school, great
style of play.  
  
So those things all went into it. But I think just the relationship I built
with Coach from our first conversation was better than I feel like any other
coaches that I was talking to at the time.  
  
I feel like from day one, I kind of in the back of my head knew that I would
be at BC.  
  
NIK POPOVIC: Also just to clarify, do we talk about my injuries or just the
team injuries?  
  
Q. Just what you went through.  
NIK POPOVIC: I mean, I missed a few games because of injuries, but I mean, I
came back, like normally. I didn't have any like breakdowns after it. So it
was okay for me to play and continue.  
  
Q. Coach Christian, talk about the pluses and minuses of the 20-game
conference schedule.  
JIM CHRISTIAN: It's a great question. Nobody has played it, so I don't know
yet, to be honest with you. I think it's going to all play out. I think
there's some interesting challenges, especially starting in the ACC with a
conference game in terms of what you need to do to prepare for such an
interesting battle that usually comes down to a couple minutes here or there.  
  
And long-term is the 20 games going to benefit us getting some more teams into
the tournament? Or is the committee, which none of us are on, going to look at
your non-conference choice of eight games, because these 20 games that we're
about to play, they're taxing physically, they're taxing mentally. It's going
to be interesting to see how it plays out long-term.  
  
But for the kids, they're excited, man. They want to play ACC games. Your fans
want to see more ACC games. People want to view it. So it's going to play out
over time, but I'm interested to see how the season is because I know playing
18 games is demanding. It's tough, and it wears people down physically. So now
adding two more of those hopefully will help our league grow long-term and, in
our situation, get more teams in the tournament.  
  
Q. Nik, you shot better than 52 percent last year. You were the highest
returning shooter in the ACC by far. I think the next highest was like 45
percent. What makes you so accurate?  
NIK POPOVIC: I mean, I don't think I'm as accurate as like the good players
that made plays for me. I had a lot of wide-open lay-ups, especially against
Minnesota last year when I went 100 percent. I think that game helped me a
lot, like, fix my averages. But I also try to make like a lot of good shots,
like take good shots, so that's why I have such a high percentage.  
  
Q. Coach Christian, can you touch on Nik 's development over the years
and how important it is for him to continue for your team's success this
season?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Well, first and foremost, I'm probably more happy and pleased
with his developments off the court as a person and just watching him grow and
mature through good and bad, the way he handles situation now. Even
frustrations.  
  
It's frustrating to be a college basketball player. You're not going to be
great every night. You're not going to be great every day. So watching him
handle those situations and developing relationships with myself, with his
teammates, with the staff has really been beneficial for me to watch. And I
think it goes hand in hand with how he's improved as a player.  
  
It wasn't any particular skill or any particular difference in his work ethic,
it was a maturity, and I think watching that and for him to continue that, now
he's got to find a consistency because I think the first thing he would tell
you and I'm telling you is that there were moments he was fantastic and there
was moments that he needed to be more consistent with a lot of different
things, and I think he's really willing and trying to do that.  
  
So if you do that, then your senior year becomes a special memory for you, and
that's what I want for him and Derryck and Jared, our three seniors. I want
this to be a special memory for them, and it should be, because they've really
worked hard at it. They've really worked hard at creating something I think is
going to be pretty special.  
  
Q. For Nik and Derryck, just what you can say about this year 's team,
how you would define it, kind of describe it heading into the season for BC?  
DERRYCK THORNTON: I'll start. I think our team, a huge thing is we compete,
and that's the most important thing playing in the ACC. It's such a
competitive league, and our team competes every day. We work extremely hard,
and we play as hard as we can every day in practice, and I think just seeing
that shows how -- just how well of a season we're going to have. If guys
compete every day through thick and thin, I think you'll be able to win a lot
of games.  
  
NIK POPOVIC: He said it pretty much all. But yeah, I would say we have a great
energy this year, and we have a size to our team, so we're going to use it to
our advantage to play good and also like to make right plays and help us win.  
  
Q. Can you talk about over the years, the player development for the
guys that have come through your program have been an integral part. Can you
talk about the guys you have returning and the new guys, their development
over this off-season, how it 's going to play for you guys this year?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: Yeah, player development for us is paramount. It's a big part
of how we recruit them, and it's built into every practice, it's built into
every day, through a bunch of different ways -- through on court, through
being part of our practice, skill development throughout practice the whole
year long. We don't just do it in the fall.  
  
And then a ton of video one-on-ones. So I try to watch as much one-on-one film
with guys as I can watch so they have a complete understanding of what they
need to do. They get clips every single day on what it is we think they need
to do to develop. And their ability to buy into that, it's never coaching.
It's all about the players. I can send you a million clips. If you're not
bought in to trying to get better, if you're not bought in to trying to
develop and see how that's going to help us grow, and by us growing you're
going to get better, then you're going to have some issues with it.  
  
But we have a really bought-in group here, and the guys that you're talking
about, the development of Niko, the development of a Steffon Mitchell, who
basically stayed at BC all summer, he's probably shot more balls than anybody
I've ever seen because he wants to develop and get better because I think
that's the key to success, man.  
  
It's got to start with them, and then we've got to like water it like it's
like a plant. That's kind of what we pride ourselves on. That's what our whole
program is about, and our young players have bought into it right away.  
  
Q. Coach, I haven 't heard you talk about the 20-game schedule. How do
you think your team is going to adjust to play 20 ACC games, and how are you
going to adjust?  
JIM CHRISTIAN: It won't really -- from my perspective, every game is
important, so it won't make any difference for me. But in terms of these guys,
I think that's why you have older guys who have been through it. I think that
the older guys, Derryck has played a ton of games, Niko has played, Steffon
Mitchell is a junior but he's played so many minutes, he's practically -- he's
a senior. Those guys have to get the team through the tough times.  
  
Every team goes through a stretch where it's tough, somebody is not playing
well. And to get them through those moments, experience, not just my voice but
their voice. I'm hoping as the year goes on, my voice and voice has to be less
and their voice and voice has to be louder. If we're getting that, then we're
getting the leadership that we need.  
  
Q. Derryck, this journey of yours, what have you learned about
basketball through your time? And most importantly, what have you learned
about life during this journey?  
DERRYCK THORNTON: I mean, I feel like I've learned so much about both. I think
life gives you a lot of up and downs, and so does the game. You know, it's
your attitude and how you approach it, and I feel like I've learned that in my
time as an athlete and as a man. I feel like I've learned that a lot. I love
this game of basketball so much, and I feel like every year I fell in love
with it even more. I'm just excited to be able to compete with my team and
take this as far as I can.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 8, 2019

  

### [Jeff Capel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15825)

### [Trey McGowens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36698)

### [Xavier Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24958)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. I know, Jeff, that you wanted to establish a defensive identity right
out of the gate. A lot of success with a very young team. One of the top team
's in the league as forcing turnovers, almost 15 a game. Think only two other
teams had more. Where do you go in year two? What are your expectations on the
defensive side of the ball this year?  
JEFF CAPEL: I think we have an opportunity to be better defensively than we
were last year. I think, first and foremost, we'll have experience. These two
guys beside me, along with our other sophomore, Au'diese Toney, they got a lot
of experience last year, played a lot of minutes.  
  
We added depth in the backcourt. We have more quality depth that we can play,
and then I think our inside guys have gotten better, Terrell Brown was
improved, he's gotten stronger, mentally he's in a better place where he has
confidence in himself.  
  
And then, you know, we added a grad transfer, and we have a freshman that we
think have chances to give us quality depth there. So I think we have an
opportunity to be an even better defensive team, which my hope is that it
helps us to become a better team in general.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the decision to add Ronald to the coaching staff
and what he brings to this team, being able to be that player/coach type of
person for you?  
JEFF CAPEL: You know, it was an easy decision for me to bring Ronald Ramon
onto our staff. I have gotten to know Ronald since I took the job. Last year,
he was rehabbing an injury over at our place. He was coming over, and so I got
to spend a lot of time with him.  
  
I talked to him a lot about his teams when he played and what made them so
good, what was the culture like. You know, we were at a dinner the other
night, and I was listening to Ronald talk, and I think he said the most games
he lost in a season at Pitt was seven, which is really amazing.  
  
He's a great guy. He was an outstanding player there at Pitt and overseas in
his professional year. He got back from the World Cup with the Dominican
National team.  
  
He has a lot of experience. He wore the jersey. That's something that's very,
very important to me. I think he -- he loves the program. I think he
represents us and what we want to do.  
  
So when the opportunity presented itself, when I had the position open, there
was really no one else that I talked to. He was the only guy. You know, it was
a point in his career where he was ready to make the decision to be done
playing, and we're really, really excited.  
  
Q. Question for both players, it is really kind of rare that freshman
have the kind of impact that both of you guys did last year. I wanted to ask
each of you what your experience was like playing as a freshman in a year that
the league was so old. And then secondly, how did the lessons you learned last
year prepare, shape the season ahead for you?  
TREY McGOWENS: Can you repeat that? I'm sorry.  
  
Q. Want to talk about the impact you made as a freshman. Kind of
unusual. What was the year like for you being a freshman in a year that the
league was so old, you 're playing against so many older guys, what did you
learn? And how did what you learn prepare you for your sophomore season? What
are your expectations for this year?  
TREY McGOWENS: I feel like the biggest thing was mentally just trying to keep
the right mindset the whole time, not getting too high, not getting too low.  
  
Then Coach, he brought us in, talked to us about what he went through at Duke,
and we kind of had similar circumstances. Just trying to learn.  
  
XAVIER JOHNSON: The main thing I learned from my freshman year is that you
have to be composed and you have to stay locked in and maintain the body.
That's one of the main things I'm carrying into this year.  
  
Q. Coach, from the podium, what are the dynamics like coaching with your
brother? Obviously you have a familial relationship, are there fine lines,
places you don 't cross, can't cross? What's behind the curtain?  
JEFF CAPEL: It has been relatively easy. You know, when I was -- when I got
this job, putting together my staff, I understood the challenges that this job
presented certainly being a part of the best conference in the country, and
then having to greatly improve our talent, and then I knew development was
going to be very important.  
  
Also, for me, with the climate that we're in, in college basketball, it was
imperative for me to have people that I trusted and people that I knew.
There's no one that fit that bill better than my brother. He's qualified for
the position, he's been a head coach, and he was a very good player in this
league. He had covered the league as far as TV is concerned, he knew -- you
know, he knows the ACC.  
  
I think he's really good with the guys both in recruiting and then in
development, and not just development on the floor, developing them as young
men. And then there is no one that I trust more than him.  
  
It's been a pretty easy transition.  
  
Q. Coach, just what can you say about -- you spoke a little bit about
it, your takeaways from the first season with Pitt, and obviously Pitt has
been in somewhat of a transition over the last few seasons. What can you say
about getting back to what you believe Pitt is and to describe that a little
bit?  
JEFF CAPEL: You know, I thought we had a lot of growth as a program in year
one. It didn't necessarily equate to as many wins as we would have liked. I
think if you look at the wins off the court, the wins that we did as far as
growth and development of the young people in our program, exciting and giving
hope to our fan base, trying to develop habits, not just change them, but
develop good habits, and then having -- you know, having an opportunity as we
head into year two to have guys with some experience where now they understand
what the standards are and they can help teach it where it is not just me and
my coaching staff.  
  
So I thought year one was very positive as far as taking steps forward as a
program. You know, this has been one of the better programs in college
basketball. If you look at -- I think it was a 15-year period with 13 of those
15 years Pitt was in the NCAA Tournament, they were relevant on a national
scale, multiple Big East championships. This was one of the toughest places to
play in all of college basketball. It was voted that.  
  
Those are all the things that appealed to me when they came after me for this
job. You know, to a certain extent, it was exciting that it was down, that it
was a rebuild because it gives me an opportunity to build it exactly how I
want to build it.  
  
I understand that that takes time. We want to have a solid foundation.
Anything that's sustainable is built on solid foundation, and that's what
we're trying to establish right now.  
  
Our goal right now is to take another big step this year, like I mentioned
earlier. I think these guys that we have back, we have four guys returning for
us that played significant minutes last year, three of them are sophomores,
one is a junior. I think they have all gotten better. Then we have added
talent, I think, around with freshman, with JUCO, with grad transfers, you
know, and regular traditional transfers.  
  
So we're excited about that. We think we have an opportunity to take another
step this year.  
  
Q. Coach, as Trey pointed out, you played as a freshman. What 's your
assessment of the impact these guys made as freshman, and what do you look for
from them in their sophomore season?  
JEFF CAPEL: I thought they had outstanding freshmen seasons, way better than
me, you know, because they were in a very different circumstance. You know,
for me as a freshman, Duke didn't necessarily need me to play well in order
for us to win. You know, the program was established. There were already
standards of excellence in place.  
  
I played with I thought the best player in the country who was a senior, which
is a rarity now, in Grant Hill. So the expectations were very, very different
for me than they were for these two guys.  
  
You know, the reality of it is, that in order for us to have any chance of
winning last year, they had to play well. That's a different type of pressure
than I experienced as a freshman. I thought they handled that very, very well
because it can be overwhelming, especially this league. You know, night in and
night out you're going against elite players at the respective positions that
they play. You can't have a night off.  
  
I thought they handled themselves really well. They went through what most
freshmen go through, which they had some challenging times, but I was really
proud of the way they stuck with it and fought and figured things out on the
fly.  
  
I think those experiences will really help them -- I know it is already helped
them, I have seen the progress they have made as players, I have seen how hard
they have worked, you know, since the season was over with, the time that they
have put in on their games, on their bodies, on getting really good shape so
they are more prepared this year than they were last year.  
  
Q. Xavier, from the podium, you have several freshmen in this year, you
have one year under your belt. Are you finding yourself to be a coach and a
mentor? Are you leading these guys, trying to show them a little bit of what
you learned last year?  
XAVIER JOHNSON: So we have a bunch of new players. We only have four returns,
as Coach said. The main thing that my job is to make everybody else around me
better and to teach the freshmen from my experiences.  
  
Q. Trey, anything from last year that surprised you as being a freshman
that you may convey to the newbies?  
TREY McGOWENS: Just being prepared for success early. Just expect it so when
it comes, it is not overwhelming.  
  
Q. For Trey and Xavier, what can you say about the early experience you
have gotten, not a lot of returning players, but you have got some experience
to bring forward, just what that 's given to you going into the season?
Secondly, what can you say about Coach and what he's done for the program in a
short amount of time?  
TREY McGOWENS: The experience last year, one of the biggest things was Coach
trusted us to make decisions early on and play heavy minutes. I mean, I feel
like that was the biggest thing that helped us play so well.  
  
Then just going in to this summer, we worked hard, he told us what he with
needed to work on and really just -- we kind of kept a close relationship. I
mean, I think we'll be really good going into this year.  
  
XAVIER JOHNSON: Basically the same thing. Coach put a lot of trust in us. Not
really too much pressure, but it was pressure on our backs because we both had
to play well, not just -- everybody had to play well, but mainly us two guys,
with he had to put the ball in the hole.  
  
One of the main things we have to carry over this year is the same confidence
and we have to know how to win.  
  
Q. Coach, last question from the podium, I know it is one game at a
time, I know you 're trying to get to the start of the season, but you're
going back to Cameron this year as a head coach. What's that going to feel
like, do you think?  
JEFF CAPEL: You know, it will be exciting. It is one of the best places in all
of college basketball to play. I'm excited to take my team. I don't think
anyone that we have that's a player will have competed there, and so I know it
will be exciting for them to have a chance to play there, to play Duke. And so
I'm excited for it. I'm excited for the opportunity to go against one of the
best.

_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach, just what you can say about the evolution of Clemson
basketball during your time there and just what you 've seen over the years
and then coming off of back-to-back at least 21 seas ones moving forward.  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah, I'm really proud of what we've been able to accomplish.
Back in the day when I first got there, we didn't have the kind of facility we
have now. I think that has really helped us, not only in recruiting, but just
in terms of maybe enthusiasm for basketball.  
  
Been blessed to coach a lot of really good players through my nine seasons at
Clemson. I feel like our program has made a little bit of a turn, three
straight postseasons and back-to-back 20-win seasons.  
  
Look forward to coaching this group this year. It's a little bit of a
different team, seven new players, but coming off of World University Games
gold medal, something we're really proud of and an experience that was really
good for our players.  
  
Q. Coach, can you expand on the thought of winning gold? What does that
mean? How deep does that meaning go?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Yeah, I think very few people have an opportunity to represent
their country, so amazing honor, and somewhat of a responsibility to make sure
that you're competing at a high level. I thought it was extremely rewarding
for our guys. Started when we went to the opening ceremonies. It really kind
of hit home with 65,000 people cheering you on.  
  
The game started shortly thereafter. We got some success, won some close
games, and really built a lot of positive momentum. Just an incredible
experience, certainly a lifetime memory, and one I'm sure everyone in our
program will never forget.  
  
Q. Going off of that, this is for each of you, the players. Just what
you can say about your trip to Italy and representing the United States,
winning a gold medal. A lot of pieces to that. So just kind of how the trip
was, what you thought of Italy, and then at the same time to represent America
and bring home the gold.  
JOHN NEWMAN III: I think the experience in Italy was a great experience. Just
seeing new scenery. I mean, you see a lot of Italy on TV shows and in movies
and stuff like that, but to go there and experience it firsthand was
definitely a really special experience for me because I like to be -- I'm
heavy into those like crime and mob movies and stuff like that. So they're
always over there. (Laughter).  
  
So to see a little bit of that and kind of see where all that stuff kind of
branches from, it was really special to me.  
  
Back to basketball, it was really special. It was just like Coach said, you
got there, opening ceremonies, 60,000 people, all these people cheering for
you, and even people that's from their native country cheering for us. It just
shows how much of a responsibility we had to protect the three letters on our
chest. So I think that was very special.  
  
Also, we were able to get momentum each game. It was like each game we kept
getting more and more momentum. For play, we had some tough games. I think we
had only one blowout win. We probably had one blowout win the whole time we
were there. Everything else were nail-biters. But I wouldn't have wanted to
have it any other way because those nail-biters are what gave us momentum to
keep going and give giving us hope.  
  
So I think that's some momentum from there. We won, so that's obviously
exciting, and I think that momentum is something that's going to help carry us
this season and stuff like that.  
  
AAMIR SIMMS: To piggy-back off of John, it was kind of difference for me a
little bit because I had the experience of going to Spain my freshman summer,
and I was kind of curious to see how it would be different from that
experience, being just like a playful area and just kind of had a lot of
freedom, so just to learn about the country and whatnot.  
  
But going to Italy, it was more of a business trip, as a lot of people like to
say, and I think we were all, quote, on board, and we all bought into Coach
Brownell's philosophies and what he wanted us to produce for our country and
our school, more importantly.  
  
It was just a great experience, something that I'll never forget. Being there,
we kind of came together more as a team. It kind of forced us to grow and
mature a little bit more than we have to because you're kind of put in an
extreme situation where you're away from home and you're just with your
teammates and coaches and the support staff we obviously had out there.  
  
It was just a great learning experience, like John said, from watching movies
and whatnot to actually seeing live places that you've seen growing up. It was
just like a really fun thing for us. And also, with like the nail-biters, it
was very scary to be in that situation for the first time really because
you're going against grown men really. To be able to pull it out, it just
showed our program, what we like to produce to the world with our Clemson grit
and always like fighting and hammering at the nail and making sure that we're
getting the job done whether it's ugly or pretty win, and that's just
something we'll never forget going forward in our lives.  
  
Q. Coach Brownell, with so many new players and key roles this summer,
how surprised were you that players gelled so quickly?  
BRAD BROWNELL: It was surprising for sure. We had seven new players join our
program and all at different times, whether it was transfers coming in late.
We had a couple guys come in about two weeks before we left, high school guys.
A couple of them got there about a month to five weeks ahead.  
  
I think it speaks to the character of our players that these guys, all in
different points in their career because we have two grad transfers, three
freshmen, and two regular transfers that it points to the character of our
team and that these guys were all able to put aside egos and really
concentrate on one goal.  
  
I was really pleased that our new guys came in with a humble attitude, serving
attitude, but our older guys also were remarkable in the way that they led and
really helped teach the young guys what we're trying to accomplish and how we
do things in our program.  
  
Certainly, the experience was helpful in a lot of ways, but it was probably --
the result was probably something that was a little bit unexpected, to be
honest with you.  
  
Q. John, what did you learn about yourself, and what did you learn about
the league in your first year through?  
JOHN NEWMAN III: Really what I learned about myself is how -- I guess how I
kind of like fit into our program, I guess. Coach Brownell is really big on
the grit and growth thing. I went through -- I had ups and downs throughout my
season, times where I felt like, oh, you know what I'm saying, like I'm at my
peak -- well, not at my peak, but I'm making a rise, but then I had some games
where I didn't feel like I was at my best. But I really just kept at it.  
  
I think my faith really had a big part to play in it. I was just trusting God
and just trusting my process because, to get to where I am right now, it
hasn't been the easiest, but I've always just stuck with it.  
  
I think that's kind of why Coach Brownell gets guys like me in his program,
guys like me that realize, like, the path to go is not always going to be
pretty. It's going to be tough, but if you just keep grinding and being gritty
and really buy into that growth aspect of things, that you can accomplish
great things.  
  
And then what I learned about the league was you've just got to bring it every
single night, and I'm still learning. Even in practice sometimes, I have my
days where I'm not necessarily all the way engaged and I don't have my best
practices, but I think that's just me.  
  
I just have to learn to -- I'm just getting used to having to bring it every
time. My role last year, I didn't have as big of a role, and then even going
back farther, when I was in high school, you don't necessarily have to bring
it every night because everyone's not good. But in this league, everyone's
that good, everyone's the best player on their high school team. So you're
playing against those teams night in and night out, and you can get 30 on your
head. So you've just got to be ready at all times.  
  
Q. Aamir, same type of question. You 've now been through the cycle
twice. As a junior, what have you learned, and what are you teaching some of
the younger guys like John, who is still, as he admitted, still kind of
young?  
AAMIR SIMMS: Since I've been here, I'm going into my third year, I have the
luxury actually to sit behind Donte Grantham, which I'm sure you guys are
familiar with, and learn from him and his leadership and how he approached
certain things and how he kind of handled situations. Even with his injury,
how he was still a very vocal leader on the sidelines and on the court and in
practices. So with me, I've taken a part of that into my process of how to be
towards these guys.  
  
I struggled with it at first early on in the summer, and I see now, as an
older player, how easily you can get frustrated watching a younger guy kind of
mess up continuously and almost effortlessly. So it's like something I've
learned since I've been here is to have composure and be poised in certain
situation, and you have to approach different situations differently with each
kind of guy on the team, especially with young guys, because we have a really
good mix of young to old. We have a nice little freshman class, our sophomore
class, our junior class, and our graduating seniors.  
  
So for me, it's been something of a learning experience to approach the ways
differently and how to lead our guys in a different way without being negative
or getting on guys too hard, but I've learned also that every day is
different, every practice is different, and every day is an opportunity to
grow. So I try to remember that going into each practice, each film session,
and each game that we have. It's just been a trip for me as well, a blessing
for me to have the opportunity and the platform to help my teammates grow as
well as myself in the process.  
  
Q. Coach, we 're on a role. What have you learned now nine seasons
through, heading into your tenth?  
BRAD BROWNELL: Oh, a lot. First of all, it's a privilege to coach in this
league and to have the opportunity to coach at Clemson every day, something
that I cherish and greatly appreciate.  
  
I think, in order to survive, the culture of your program has to be solid. You
have to have a good foundation. As you get a little bit older, you realize
it's even more than just basketball for certain. If you're educating and
supporting the young people in your program the right way and giving them
proper guidance in all areas, that the basketball part will be better.  
  
I think that's something that you develop and grow as you're in the league a
little bit.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 8, 2019

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

### [John Mooney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36337)

  
_Charlotte, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Coach, just I know that he 's not here with you today, but in spirit,
with the team coming back, Rex Pflueger, what you can say about his story, his
mother's story, everything it meant to this team? I know that faith is a big
part of what you do and a big part of what he does as well?  
MIKE BREY: If anyone deserves a great senior year, it is Rex Pflueger with
everything that he's been through. He's handled it like a man. You know, as a
coach, you're always looking for team building exercises. Certainly this has
kind of brought us together on an amazing front. It's a -- I think everyone
was prepared for it.  
  
It was a bad diagnosis a year ago in December. I have been so impressed with
how his teammates have been there for him and Rex has needed his teammates. He
still has continued to be a leader, a captain. I would say he's about a week
to ten days out from going five on five. He's doing everything else. I'm
thrilled to have him back. He's getting his master's degree in business.  
  
But I think our whole team, you know, has, you know, gone through it with him,
our whole program. We certainly have his back and I'm excited to have him
back. He's a leader for us and a heck of a young man.  
  
Q. Coach, you 've had tough luck with injuries not just last year but
the year before that. Over that time, a lot of young players who may be
wouldn't have gotten playing time have gotten playing time. They're veteran
hes now. Is that the silver lining? Is this the year that the agony of 2018
and 2019 have become to be a positive?  
MIKE BREY: I do feel we can rotate back to the mix. We through our young guys
to the wolves last year, and the wolves were old in this league and men and
veterans. What kept me going all offseason was I kept looking at the First and
Second-Team All-ACC, and they're all gone. That was good for us as we have
really everybody back and some continuity and some young guys that got some
minutes and are better.  
  
You know, we're older, we're better, we're healthier. Then I say well, what
does that mean in this league now? You know, I like the fact that there is
some continuity and our young players got minutes last year, even though it
didn't produce many wins.  
  
Q. We heard coach talk about it, just Rex going through it with him,
just what you can say about his leadership and the story, and how it has made
you guys closer? I know you had a trying season last season but you get him
back and you get another crack at it, just what he 's meant to you and maybe
what the energy comes from that, you know, the spirit from that?  
JOHN MOONEY: Yeah. You know, Rex has meant the world to us. Had us mom was a
tremendous lady, had the chance to meet her and it was awesome. My family and
Juwan's family got close with the Pflueger's. You see that, you're certainly
saddened for him. He's been an amazing leader, he's kept his poise, kept
positivity throughout the whole journey.  
  
You know, I think what was really powerful is the whole team went out to
California to be with him during his mom's service. Like Coach said, it kind
of brought us together even more. Yeah, it was just a great experience given
the circumstances.  
  
JUWAN DURHAM: It was nice to go out there and support him and his family. We
made sure we were there for him at all times. Any time he needs somebody,
we're there to talk to him. Things like that. Just be a brother.  
  
Q. John and Juwan, from the podium here, I don 't know if anyone told
you, you're seniors now, how did that happen and what do you expect in the
last year?  
JOHN MOONEY: It definitely went by fast, no kidding. You know, when you kind
of look at it, you have one more go around, it is very exciting. You know, now
it is kind of about leading the rest of the group. You know, I really can't
wait. I think we open up November 6th, very exciting and I can't wait for it.  
  
JUWAN DURHAM: Like John just said, it was in a blink of an eye that we're
seniors, we're the old guys on campus now. It is just nice to be out here and
be able to compete again and I feel like this year we can do some things, and
we're going to do the best that we can like we always do.  
  
Q. John, you led the ACC in rebounding a year ago. You are the leading
returning scorer in the league. What are your expectations for this season,
and how challenging is it to bang around on the boards and yet still go out
and shoot the three?  
JOHN MOONEY: It is challenging. You know, when you're playing against some of
the best players in the country, it's certainly is challenging, but that's
what you work for. That's why you put hours in the gym to go out and play
against guys like that.  
  
It is competitive league. It is always challenging. You know, I think
expectations are just getting back to the NCAA Tournament, that's the number
one goal, and then we can make a run from there.  
  
Q. Coach, you 're coming back with all familiar faces, just what you can
say the team learned from some of that adversity last year and coming back
with those guys, and obviously getting Rex back, what this mix does after
having a year of a learning curve, so to speak?  
MIKE BREY: I think they have a little chip on their shoulder. I mean, we got
punched hard last year. I think they're hungry to kind of bounce back, and
they're older and better for it. As I said, you know, Rex added to the mix
helps us on the court, there is no question about it because he makes winning
plays all the time. Having his voice and him on the court as a leader I think
really helps us.  
  
Yeah. It is -- the schedule is amazing. With 20-league games and then our non-
league stuff, we have never played a schedule like this in the history of our
program. I'm excited to go through it with these guys. You know, they have a
little edge about them after last season. They know each other better. You
know, we're a little more familiar with each other than a year ago.  
  
Q. Coach, you opened with North Carolina, a team that likes to play
really, really fast. You guys don 't like to play really, really fast. You
have had some success slowing them down. Your thoughts on opening against
North Carolina and how do you slow that team down?  
MIKE BREY: You know, we have always played pretty well there. We have won one
there. We have always played pretty well there. Johnny has played great there
matter of fact. That's the one thing, you know, when you prepare for North
Carolina is transition and trying to get back and take away easy buckets.  
  
You know, my biggest concern for us is we got stuck at scoring 62 points last
year, and our program overall has been one to put numbers on the board. We
have always taken care of the ball. Even last year we were good with the ball,
and we just -- we have got to get back to stepping up and making shots. I feel
our young guys are more ready to do that.  
  
I know they're all good shooters, or we wouldn't have recruited them. Now it
is a matter of feeling better about it. If you're going to play well in Chapel
Hill November 6th, you've got to put numbers on the board, you have to come
out trying to let it rip as well.  
  
Q. Coach, from the podium, there is a story that last year you and the
team had a private meal and that you served on paper plates and plastic
utensils. How will you know this year if you move back to china and fine
silver?  
MIKE BREY: We have to get a bid to the tournament and get back. We have missed
that tournament. You're right, we used paper plates and that was our banquet
and we didn't invite anybody. We kind of circled the wagons and tried to set
the tone.  
  
We missed being a part of March Madness the last two seasons, it became a
habit for us, it was something when I was hired which was my charge, to get us
back, we had missed in the '90s altogether.  
  
So seeing Selection Sunday -- matter of fact, I can't watch Selection Sunday
went when we're not getting in. The year before, we were the last year out.
Talking about painful. Getting that bid, seeing our name show up, we may go
back to silverware.  
  
Q. John and Juwan, was the message lost on you? Did you get the message
about paper plates and plastic forks?  
JOHN MOONEY: We definitely did. It gave us an edge a little bit. Like Coach
said before, we're hungry to get back, we're hungry to get back to the NCAA
Tournament. You know, we have put the work in this offseason, now it is just
about going out and doing it. We're excited for it.  
  
JUWAN DURHAM: Yeah. It is important to just remember our roots and come in and
just do the best that we can and go out and give it all because if you don't,
then we have a repeat of last year and we're not trying to do that at all.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 8, 2019

  

### [Jim Boeheim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13725)

### [Marek Dolezaj](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38101)

### [Elijah Hughes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32876)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Folks, we welcome Syracuse to the main stage.  
  
Q. Coach, just what you could say about Elijah. Obviously, this will be
his second season on the floor, but third season with the team. Just what he
's done leadership-wise, and how he's grown in the program to lead it for you
now.  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think the thing with Elijah, last year he really was about our
fourth option offensively, he's our second leading scorer, which tells you a
lot about what his ability is to score. I think he's improved over the summer.
I think he's worked really hard. The trip helped him and helped our whole
team. His role is different this year. He'll have the ball more. He's taken a
real active role in leadership with our younger guys.  
  
I think we're a little bit deceptive in that we have three juniors with Elijah
and Marek and Bourama, who have played a lot, and I think their leadership is
going to be very important for this team. I think we have a lot of good young
guys who are probably a little bit underrated, a little bit under the radar,
and I think they're more ready to help this year than I think most people
would think.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about your defense. Coach, last year you were
very high in the league in all the key defense statistical categories --
blocked shots, turnovers forced, field goal defense. A couple of the guys that
helped build those numbers have moved on. Can this defense be as good?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, I think offensively -- I'll get to your question, but I
think offensively we have a chance to be a much better team, a much quicker up
the court team. I think our defense is going to need improvement. I think the
veteran guys were really good at our defense. I think Tyus and Frank were
really, really good defensive guards. I think that Elijah did a great job in
his first year defensively, and we had Paschal.  
  
So I think we're a little bit different defensively. I think our offense has a
chance to be better than people might expect it to be because we're a much
better shooting team. We've been 13th, 14th in the league in three-point
shooting for about as long as I can remember, and I think we're a much, much
better three-point shooting team.  
  
Our defense is going to have to be something that gets better. We think we can
get better defensively. We think we can do a few more things defensively, but,
obviously, when you're a pretty good, solid defensive team, you're not really
thinking as a coach about changing to other defenses. Certainly, we'll look at
what other things we can do on the defensive end.  
  
Q. This is for Elijah and Marek. Just what you could say about that
Italy team, how it built your bonds, and how it made you stronger going into
this season.  
ELIJAH HUGHES: It was really fun. Number one, it was a lot of fun, my first
time out of the country overseas. So it really brought us together because,
one, when we got out there, we only had each other. So we were all we got. It
really brought us together. We went out and did things as a team, sightseeing-
wise and going to get food and things like that. And we obviously played
together. So it really brought us together. It was a lot of fun.  
  
MAREK DOLEZAJ: I couldn't play, but I think the trip really helped us, like as
a team. We had five new guys. I tried to help the new guys, talked to them on
the bench. But team-wise, I think it helped us a lot.  
  
Q. Jim, just wanted your thought on the three-point line being out a
little bit and if you foresee that impacting the zone at all a little bit
defensively.  
JIM BOEHEIM: Well, it doesn't impact our zone because we play the shooter.
We've always played where the shooters are, and most shooters are out behind
the line. The really good shooters that you have to stop, they don't think --
they don't even get -- some of them don't even get near the line. So you play
where the shooters are, and that doesn't change.  
  
As far as shooting the ball from the three, the guys that can shoot it, it's
no different. The guys that can shoot out there, the difference in the
distance doesn't matter. It's not important, not relevant. I don't think it
will change the number of three-point shooting at all.  
  
Q. Coach, I was fascinated by the personalities last year of Battle and
Howard. Such interesting guys, strong personalities. Who 's going to take that
role in terms of working with the younger players on the team?  
JIM BOEHEIM: Yeah, I think we have guys with very strong personalities.
They're quiet in some ways, but I think they have a strong impact on our team,
and I think that with Tyus and Frank, they were quiet guys too. They said very
little. So I don't think there's any change there, but I do think that these
two guys are junior -- even though they're quiet, I think they talk to the
players, the younger players, and there's a clear differential between their
experience and the younger players on the team. So I think there's an
acceptance from the younger players to listen to what these guys are talking
about.  
  
In the backcourt, where, obviously, the most youth is, Jalen and Buddy both
played last year. They both had pretty important minutes on the court. So I
think that will help them. I think the two freshmen, Joe Girard and Brycen
Goodine, are very good players. It just depends how long it takes them to get
used to the game. They were both good on the trip this summer. They were
confident. They played with a lot of confidence for freshmen, but I think the
leadership that we get from these two guys will be important for this team.  
  
Q. Jim, what kind of impact is the 20-game schedule going to have?
Specifically, how do you feel about a conference season opener against
Virginia?  
JIM BOEHEIM: You have to be ready right away, but you want your team to be
ready right away anyway. Some years you open up in a tournament -- we've done
that in the past where you're playing right away against good teams. It makes
you focus and make sure you're ready. We try to get ready anyway. The trip
this summer certainly helped. We had that extra time.  
  
But the 20 games every -- that's what it is. It's more or less than proven
over time that, when you talk to people that are experts in what you need to
do to get in the NCAA Tournament, that the more conference games you play
doesn't really help your league get in more teams because you have more
losses, but we'll see how it all plays out. It's certainly -- it's a
challenging schedule, and we have to be ready right away. But you want to be
ready right away every year anyway.  
  
Q. This is for each of you, just what you can say -- and, Coach, you
touched on it a little bit -- the new faces coming in and being underrated
somewhat, just getting out there and getting experience in the scrimmages,
what it 's done for the team, and for both of you guys, what that's done as
far as building up your teammates and the quality of the team.  
MAREK DOLEZAJ: I think we have a really good young group, Joe, Brycen, really
good guards. They know how to play. Joe, unlimited range. He can shoot the
three. He's a really good scorer. Brycen is really good, athletic. And Quincy,
really strong guy. He's really similar like Oshae. He'll help us a lot. He's
strong. He can shoot. He can go to the basket. And our two centers, they're
great young guys, and they just need a little bit of time, and they will get
used to it, to the zone, to the offense and the defense, but I think they will
be really good for us.  
  
ELIJAH HUGHES: Coming in anywhere as a freshman is kind of difficult,
especially coming to our zone and stuff like that, but everyone, they're all
special, real special, talented group. They all each bring something different
and unique to the table. I'm just really excited to get going with them and
everyone else that we have and have a good season.  
  
JIM BOEHEIM: I think, if you look at the ratings of guys we've had in the
past, like Oshae Brissett was 120 or something. Some guys just don't get rated
because of where they play or where they're from. This group is a much, much
better class than their ratings would indicate. I think they'll prove that on
the court.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE OPERATION
BASKETBALL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+OPERATION+BASKETBALL)

  

## October 8, 2019

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Mamadi Diakite](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37093)

### [Braxton Key](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32945)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Tony, you came here last year and you were very much at peace with
the way the 2018 season had ended, at peace with life, at peace with what life
held for you. Can you be any more at peace now considering how the 2019 season
ended?  
TONY BENNETT: I'm very thankful for what transpired, and I think it's been a
process, and just like after the 2018 season, it was an amazing year and
obviously a hardening from a basketball stabbed point, but we grew from it. We
didn't hide from it. We addressed it. But we didn't obsess about it, and I
think the same holds true with this last year.  
  
We're very thankful for it. We'll grow from it. We celebrated it and have
enjoyed it, but we won't obsess about it, nor will we just sweep it under the
rug and say that was then. I think you don't overdo either of them, and you
learn from them and you're thankful for what both extremes teach you.  
  
And to get to go through it with these guys, I'm just glad that they have this
memory, as our staff does, of winning a championship from last year, but I
think because of how we lost the year before, it made us value it even more.  
  
Q. Coach, you 've got so much height on this team, experienced and
newcomers. How will that change your philosophy on offense?  
TONY BENNETT: I think, yeah, with obviously our experience this year is more
in the front court with Mamadi and Braxton kind of playing some more of the 4
and the 3 this year. He'll do both. And Jay Huff, who got some limited
experience. There is quality experience. The only other really guy with
experience that's returning is Kihei, and he doesn't have a lot of height.  
  
So there's a lot of newness to this team, so we'll certainly have to rely on
these guys, and that's our job as a staff and even as a team to see what gives
us the best chance both offensively and defensively to be at our best.  
  
I think when you have size, you want to be good on the glass. You want to at
times use their strengths, and defensively be good in all areas.  
  
So yeah, it's -- I think the physicality and the size factor is definitely one
of our strengths, and our front court. And when I say "front court," kind of
the forward spots.  
  
Q. Coach, just what you can say about handling the job with humility,
with appreciation? It never seems to be about you. You turned down the bonus
and wanted to reinvest in the program. What you can say about how you handle
your job, and you always seem to pay the buck forward instead of keeping it
for yourself?  
TONY BENNETT: Well, first, I've been given a ton, and I understand that. And I
think -- I tell these guys all the time: It's a gift to be able to coach. I
think they have gifts to be able to play the game, and our job with whenever
you're given a gift is to be grateful for it and to maximize the gift you've
been given.  
  
And for me right now at this point in my life, it's about coaching these guys
and being part of that. For them it's about being as good as they can as a
team and individually.  
  
You know, when you've been blessed in ways beyond, I think it gives you a
different perspective. Been through great successes and hard failures,
professionally speaking, and just used those to grow.  
  
But like I said, I'm just grateful to be in this spot. And I'm starting my
11th year, and I didn't know how it would go when I took the job. I hoped I
knew how it would go and I had a vision, but to see some of the things come to
fruition, it really is -- and I don't use the word lightly, it is humbling,
and you're excited about it and grateful for it, and you just -- now you start
another cycle again, and that's what we're doing with these guys.  
  
Q. You 've been very successful with slowing the game down and keeping
the score low, but it's worked out well for you. What is your philosophy that
you drill into the guys to keep the score low? Is it a matter of passing the
ball a lot for a certain period of time before you look for the shot, or do
you go first available best shot?  
TONY BENNETT: I think with each team, it's different. This last year I think
we were the No. 2 team in the country for offensive efficiency. And I think
that word "efficiency" is most important. Some teams can score a little
easier, and I think you have to look at that.  
  
But we always try to play as good a defense as we can, and when we're playing
our best defense, it can take the opponents a little longer to break us down,
so that might lower the possessions.  
  
But again, you look at your team and say what gives us the best chance. That's
always what it comes down to, and trying to be as efficient as you can. You
know, that's sort of been how we've played, and guys have been able to develop
their games and go on and play professionally after, so I don't think it's
hurt their professional careers.  
  
But it is -- looking at this is our way. And it varies from team to team. I
guess it's a combination of all those things.  
  
Q. I wanted to get your thoughts, and the players as well, about the
20-game schedule, opening up the season inside the Carrier Dome and how
exciting of a challenge that is to have that now in the league with some extra
conference games.  
TONY BENNETT: Sure, these guys -- do you want them to answer?  
  
BRAXTON KEY: Yeah, it's exciting. 20 games for the conference, I think it's
big. It's great for the fans, great for the players. We love the competition
in the conference. Syracuse is a great team, great coach, has had a lot of
great success.  
  
And opening up at the Carrier Dome, it's one of my favorite places to play.
It's massive. Last year we played there, and we got really hot, so hopefully
we can keep that streak, and it'll be a great match-up November 6.  
  
MAMADI DIAKITE: Yeah, it's definitely going to be a great match-up for us.
It's going to test us in a many ways, and we'll find out what we're -- what
we're doing at practice.  
  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think it's 20 games, I remember when it was 16 and
probably some of the coaches remember when it was 14. I don't know what the
lowest it was.  
  
But I was here when it was 16, and then it went to 18, and boy, that's two
more quality games. Now we're at 20. You play in the ACC-Big Ten Challenge,
you play in these tournaments. So every game is a test. There's such parity in
college basketball.  
  
And then to start, because I said, we have a lot of new guys, there's newness
to this team, the experienced players will have to really rely on that because
that's the different kind of game in terms of that zone, that venue, and being
ready for it.  
  
Again, whatever the outcome, you just grow from it and learn from it, but you
get as ready as you can because you're starting in conference play, and you
want to, to the best of your abilities, get off to a good start.  
  
Q. I have a question. I think a lot last season was made of you altering
your offense, more ball screens, something that Mamadi had a lot of success
in, maybe more isolation for De 'Andre and less motion move for blocker. How
do you expect the offense to flow this year, looking more like from two years
ago or new adjustments? What's the move?  
TONY BENNETT: It's a different team. Obviously with the changeover, we'll see.
But I think guys like Braxton, Mamadi, Jay, they certainly are very good when
they can either roll on the rim or catch it in the high post and on the move.
That's I think offensively some of their strengths. Kihei is good off the ball
screens. So certainly there will be an element of that.  
  
Last year I think ironically we probably ran, if you call it blocker mover or
some of our sides, maybe 60 percent, and then some of our ball screen
continuity was 35, 30 percent, and we did some other stuff. So it'll be a mix
for sure. I think it will be. And you have to space the floor, but you've got
to be good on the glass, and again, trying to find ways to put these guys in
the best positions possible offensively, and then obviously being able to go
to the other end and work like crazy, that's sort of the -- it's both and.  
  
Q. Braxton, about a year ago this time, you didn 't even know if you
were going to be able to play last season. Now you have the whole season under
your belt, national champion, come back as one of the senior leaders for this
team. What has that experience been like and what was the focus for you in the
off-season?  
BRAXTON KEY: Just being a better leader. Like you said, I wasn't sure if I was
going to play last year, and I remember Coach called me right after class and
I got the news that I was eligible, and it was exciting and great news. It was
an up-and-down season, of course, playing some games and not. But you learn a
lot from the bench.  
  
And this year just leading the young guys, leading them to try to catch up to
speed with like returners with me, Mamadi, Jay and Kihei. It's challenging,
but we're looking forward to it.  
  
TONY BENNETT: I'm really glad he got that waiver, too. He was significant in
the championship game, obviously. But yeah, when you said that, that did make
it real. You didn't know at this time if he was going to be able to play, so
he was a huge part of it.  
  
Q. Tony, have you ever had a rebuilding challenge like this? I don 't
know if you've ever had three draft picks in the same year.  
TONY BENNETT: I think we've been successful at Virginia because guys have
grown and they've gotten into their upperclassmen years, and now we rely on
the upperclassmen that are in our program.  
  
But there is a lot being lost. You can't deny how good Dre and Ty and Kyle
were, and Jack Salt. He was significant. So rebuilding, starting a new cycle,
however, the beauty of college basketball is you can be good with
inexperienced guys and enough experience, and that's the challenge before us.  
  
We've just got to keep trying to figure out how we can be at our best with how
we play offensively, defensively. There will be some growing pains. I know
that. We've already experienced that in practice, and I've been on these guys
pretty hard and pushing them. But I'm grateful for them because they got a lot
on their plate. We do.  
  
But I think we've been through a lot. So we'll just -- we'll be as good as we
can, and we know not to worry about it. We talked about it last year, let's
get as ready as we can and run not to the finish line, to the starting line.
Let's be as good as we can at the start and be process oriented. That's the
way for our program and for players and I think team. So that's what we'll do.  
  
And yeah, there is a bit of a newness and rebuild to it, but that brings some
new excitement, and it means that those three guys that left early had
phenomenal careers, and I think we'd all take, hey, you can win a National
Championship and lose those three guys, will you take that and maybe be newer
and have to start over in some ways? I think we'd all agree and take that, and
that's where we're at right now.  
  
Q. For the players, Mamadi and Braxton, returning as upperclassmen, how
has your mentality been different going into this year being the veteran
upperclassmen versus last year?  
MAMADI DIAKITE: For me it's the same thing. I think everything started when we
lost against BC, and I'm carrying that and hopefully all the other guys are
still carrying it. I'm carrying that underneath my skin, and it drives me
every time. I've been having it since two years ago, so I'm just carrying that
through this year.  
  
BRAXTON KEY: And for me you go from being A player to kind of the player, and
not in a selfish way, but you just -- the coaches expect a lot more of the
older guys, and within this program, I don't know how it is in other programs,
but here, leadership is on the older guys.  
  
So me, Mamadi, Jay, Kihei, a lot of leadership is on us, so we have to lead
the younger guys and mold them and get them ready for, like Coach said, the
start line.

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Quentin Grimes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36864)

### [Devon Dotson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36865)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Iowa State 78, Kansas 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach Self, and his
two student-athletes, Quentin Grimes and Devon Dotson. Coach, we will call on
you first for your thoughts, opening statement?  
  
BILL SELF: Well, it was a strange game. Iowa State controlled it basically
from the jump, but I thought our guys played their butts off. That's about as
hard as we played in a long time and competed hard and we just didn't have
much to show for it, couldn't buy a basket. But we got the ball where we
wanted to and didn't finish and they made a lot of baskets at the end of the
clock especially down the stretch in the second half. Give them credit. They
were better than us today, but by no means am I leaving here disappointed at
all. I thought we had a good weekend. We competed hard today, and I saw a lot
of positive things that hopefully we can take into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Quentin and Devon, today the shooting, especially from three was off
after being pretty good in the other games. What was the difference tonight?  
QUENTIN GRIMES: Like Coach said, one of those nights. I felt like every shot
we put up was a good shot. I don't think anybody took questionable shots. It
just didn't fall tonight. Och put up some good shots. Devon got us some good
shots. It was just one of those the nights we just couldn't get a basket.  
  
Q. Quentin and Devon, going back to what Coach said about positives,
what positives do you take from this?  
DEVON DOTSON: I would say just the way we competed. We showed some signs
where, you know, where we really wanted, you know, to win this game. But they
hit some tough shots, and we were missing some of our easy shots that we
usually make. It's a bad feeling, but, you know, we're on to the next game.  
  
QUENTIN GRIMES: Like Devon said, felt like we competed to the last second of
the game. We tried coming in making that last three, nobody quit on the game,
they kept playing on defense even the last 20 seconds of the game. So I felt
like throughout the whole game we competed the whole entire time.  
  
Q. Devon, could you discuss the challenges with so many freshmen playing
such a big role on this team, the challenges you guys face and coming back
from this kind of loss and navigating your way into the NCAA, since none of
you guys have been there yet?  
DEVON DOTSON: I would say there are some challenges, but in the big scheme of
things, I feel like we're ready for it. And, you know, the four freshmen, we
really have been prepared by the coaching staff and, you know, our teammates.
So there is going to be some challenges, but I feel like we're ready are for
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Quentin and Devon, we will let you go back to the locker
room. Thank you for coming. Great week and good luck next week. Questions now
for Coach Self?  
  
Q. Bill, you guys coming into today were tied for second in quadrant 1
wins and you scheduled a difficult noncon. I just want to know how you think
the Committee should factor that in?  
BILL SELF: I don't know. We're going to be happy whatever happens. I think we
could have probably helped ourselves if we won the tournament, but we didn't.
So I don't think we hurt ourselves at all by playing in the final. If we were
a 4 seed before, we probably are a 4 seed. I thought we had a chance to get to
a 3, and hopefully we still do. It's about match-ups rather than seeds once
you get into the tournament anyway.  
  
Q. Bill, you've been coaching in this league a long time. I think this
will be the second time the league hasn't had a one or two seed. Talk about
the challenges. Do you think the league will do as good as it usually has in
the tournament, not as good?  
BILL SELF: I think our league is plenty good enough to have teams in the
tournament that have multiple wins. Our league is not as top heavy as what it
has been in the past. To me, Texas Tech has had the best year, nothing against
K-State. But I think if you include nonconference and ranking, and I think
they probably had the best year, but obviously K-State can make a run and go
deep. Iowa State is the best offensive team in our league. They can go deep
and Texas Tech can. There are others that are capable of doing it, too. I
don't think when you look across America you look and say, there are teams
that had a chance to go the Final Four out of those respective leagues. ACC is
different, obviously, because they're top heavy. But most of the leagues have
two or three, you know. If they get hot at the right time they can make a run,
and I think that's the case with this league. Last year we had the most wins
in the tournament, if I'm not mistaken, and whether that happens or not, who
knows? But this league has prepared by beating up on each other and we should
be ready to go have some success next week.  
  
Q. Going back to what you said last night, Bill, you said you were
expecting about 70% of the fans to be Iowa State supporters. Did it seem like
it was an away game?  
BILL SELF: Not at all, but they had the majority of the fans, but I don't
think it was 70/30. I don't think it was that. I thought our fans hung in
there and fought pretty hard. We just didn't give 'em enough to get excited
about. We get it to the 9 and foul a 3-point shooter, get it to 9 and have a
wide open look to cut it to 6. We just didn't make those plays that you need
to make in order to put some real game pressure on 'em. I thought their crowd
was great and certainly I thought our crowd tried and did their job. We just
didn't give 'em enough to get excited about.  
  
Q. Obviously, you didn't stick with David too long tonight. Was there a
turning point when you realized you had to go a different direction?  
BILL SELF: Well, you know, if you you're going to play big, with that team,
you've got to score inside. Because they put you at such a disadvantage if
you're going to play man-to-man. We knew that going in, and we didn't score
inside. I thought the best way and it was the best way to play was spread it
and drive it. You can say David, and David understands. If David is in the
game Dedric has to drive a guard and when Horton-Tucker went out of the game
that's not good match-ups for us. I made a decision we're going to play small
and try it on drive it. We scored the ball so much better the second half and
had a chance to score it even better if we could have converted some open
looks from three.  
  
But nothing has changed. David is still a starter, all that stuff. But they're
a hard team for us to match-up with if Dedric has to guard a little guard.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about last week being a little down, you know, not
coming out of the league without a championship. How excited are your kids
going to be pumped up. They've seen it all their lives, the tournament, now
they get to play in it.  
BILL SELF: I think we will be excited. I'll be honest. I'm more excited about
my team after watching them play today than I have all year long. We had
nothing go well, nothing, and they battled their asses off for forty minutes.
Even it though it wasn't pretty, I thought we did a lot of good things. When
the ball leaves your hand, if it's a good or bad shot when it leaves your
hand, for both teams we both did pretty well. Their players were better than
our players at making shots. That's just what it is. I don't think we defended
them perfectly by any stretch, but I thought we got some good looks, too. They
were better than us, make no mistake. They were better than us. But I loved
how we competed for forty minutes, but there is a difference in competing and
trying real hard, still, and what the young kids learned today, trying harder
and harder and harder doesn't necessarily mean you're competing better,
because we got tighter, the rim shrunk. You gotta be able to relax and play
through those things and know if we're not making shots, hey, we gotta get
inside touch here, we gotta do this. We haven't quite got that yet, but I
thought there were some things that we could move forward that will help the
young kids later on without question.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much, good luck next week.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Iowa State 78, Kansas 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are not joined now by the champions of the Big 12
Conference, the Cyclones of Iowa State, head coach Steve Prohm and three
members of the All Tournament team, Michael Jacobson, Lindell Wigginton and
the Most Valuable Player, Marial Shayok. Coach, congratulations.  
  
STEVE PROHM: Thanks. This is a special night. Kansas is obviously a tremendous
program and, you know, you can talk about them and Coach Self forever. They
were resilient. They kept coming back and making runs, but our guys answered
the bell and we came down here and we won each game in different ways. We
showed our toughness and we showed our togetherness. For me, personally, it's
cool and I said this in the locker room, it's cool to have Lindell up here
right now, just through all the ups and downs really me and him have gone
through together this year and he's gone through with the injury and two guys
that sat out last year and worked and were resilient. Mike to get 16 rebounds
in the semifinal and Marial to be a rock all season long. But Nick vowed to
never lose a game here in his two years in this conference tournament, and you
can go down the line. George stepping in. The one line I heard when I was
going through the handshake line last week at home when Texas Tech won the
regular season Championship, Davide Moretti told one of the coaches, hey,
we're connected for life now. That's the thing I talked to these guys about.
When you do something special and you win a championship you've got a
connection for the rest of your life.  
  
Hopefully this is just step one. We will enjoy this for a while and then when
we figure out where we're going for the tournament we will get to business on
that. Proud of the guys and proud of what they've shown in their character
this weekend.  
  
Q. Marial, you were voted the Most Outstanding Player. In your words,
how would you sum up your play in helping to contribute to this
championship?  
MARIAL SHAYOK: I thought I played all right. Today I didn't think I played my
best, but I think it was our best team win of the year just because it was
gritty and everyone stepped up. So it was great to have Lindell play well.
Mike, his play has been underrated this tournament, having 16 boards like
Coach said and those big rebounds that we needed yesterday and being solid All
Tournament. Lindell, accepting his role and coming in and bringing that spark
and playing to his capabilities. Everyone played a huge part. MVP could have
went to anyone, but I'm just glad we won the Chip.  
  
Q. Lindell, Marial and Michael, Coach called timeout with 2:53 left when
Kansas got it within 9. What days do you feel like that timeout energize you
all to where you were able to keep the momentum and keep the ball game from
swinging?  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: Yeah, I think the biggest thing we wanted to focus on was on
the defense end. We wanted to keep getting stops. We knew if we could get a
couple more stops and some good offense we could have a chance to win the
game. We definitely didn't want to let them get any closer than that, because
like Coach said, Kansas is a great team and they never gave up tonight and we
wanted to keep them at an arm's distance and try and run another minute or so
off the clock and we knew we would have a good shot if we could keep it there.  
  
MARIAL SHAYOK: Like Mike said, it wasn't the prettiest win. But it was a
collective win. I'm proud of my guys. We gotta ride this wave until the
tournament and every time I tell these guys after we leave the locker room I
will take us over anybody and a lot of guys playing in the tournament for the
first time. Myself getting back to the tournament is going to be a great time.  
  
LINDELL WIGGINTON: We were trying to milk clock and run as much time off the
clock as we could. We tried to have a big lead and not get too rushed. Like
they both said, it was a great team win. I think it was our best team win. We
came in and showed resilience, fight, and everybody gave it their all on the
floor.  
  
Q. This is for Michael and Marial, you both have played in conference
tournaments in different conferences and we talk a lot about the atmosphere
here. Especially when Iowa State plays. I'm just wondering if you can compare,
Michael, what you saw here with what you had in the Big Ten; and Marial, in
the ACC in terms of the atmosphere of a conference tournament?  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: Second to none would be the way I is describe it. The
atmosphere was awesome for all three games, lots of fans for all teams came
and supported. The atmosphere for tonight's championship was unbelievable as
well. The Big Ten they have a good tournament as well, but I think what they
do here in Kansas City is special. They keep it here and near. They have a ton
of success with it, and I just had a lot of fun.  
  
MARIAL SHAYOK: Like Mike said, I think it's the best tournament in the country
because of how each fan base represents their school and having the Cyclone
fans travel with us all year long and they really showed up for us this week
has been special. Definitely something I'll never forget.  
  
Q. For Lindell, the difference between your freshman and sophomore
years, it was a short stay here last year, rough year overall. How would you
describe the differences between the two years you've had here at the Big 12
tournament?  
LINDELL WIGGINTON: My first year it was frustrating because we were losing and
everything, and personally I think I was having a decent season, but it was
frustrating because we were losing. This season it's been up and down because
I came in with an injury, came back, didn't start, come off the bench, had to
embrace my role. But I felt like it was all for the good of this team. It all
showed tonight with the championship we had. I just fought through everything.
Obviously I was frustrated through the season, but I really just fought
through everything. My coaches and my teammates kept confidence in me. They
kept telling me be confident every time I step on the floor. I'm a big part of
this team, and listening to them and them keeping me confident that's what
they gave me, what I'm getting right now. I give credit to all my coaches and
teammates.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we will let you go back to the locker room. Great week
and good luck next week, guys. Questions for Coach Prohm?  
  
Q. Coach, going back to something Michael said about the teams being
with supported. Could you talk about how Iowa State's fans traveled well and
turned what has often been just another home game for KU into what actually
felt like more of a neutral site game?  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, our fan base, you know, I've been coaching for 20 years at
the different levels and went to college in the SEC and this is just
different, man. I've never seen anything like it. I've watched a ton of games
on TV. You look at the fan bases. Our fans support us from November 6th to
whenever we finish and hopefully it's late March, early April.  
  
That's the one thing. You come here, you don't want a short stay because even
my secretary, Julie, she doesn't like coming here for just one day. They're
planning on coming here for three or four. That's the pressure comes from
there a little bit, so you can keep all them on vacation a little bit. The fan
base, the way they travel is incredible.  
  
Tonight it was, I don't know if it was 50/50, 60/40. Two years ago against
West Virginia it was probably 90/10. They make a point of being here, but it's
not just for the Big 12 tournament. It's in Maui. If you saw our AD tweet
about we sold the most packages for the Battle for Atlantis next year. It's
when we're in Orlando for the ESPN Old Spice. It's in all the tournaments.
I've never seen people travel like the way we do, but it's not just for men's
basketball either. You saw it when Coach Campbell took his team to San Antonio
for the Alamo Bowl. You will see it when our women's basketball team hosts
first and second rounds next week. You see it with gymnastics, wrestling,
volleyball. They support everything at our school and it's really cool to be a
part of.  
  
Q. Steve, the Big 12 is probably not going to have a one or two or three
seed in the tournament like most years. How would you describe the
preparation? I know there is typically not a lot of bottom feeding programs in
this league, but how would you describe the preparation that this league has
given you going into the NCAA Tournament?  
STEVE PROHM: I think a ton. You can't read too much into the challenges
because of the match-ups. Then you've got some teams didn't play, but you look
at the SEC challenge, what we did. You look at our league and how it's rated.
It's 1 or 2 rated league. It's been like that for the last five or six years.
Half our league has been to the Final Four. Three or four coaches in the
league are current Hall of Famers or future Hall of Famers. The venue is
great. The support is great. You look at this, the way the people care about
it, I think I heard Coach Weber say, we may not have the top five team in the
country. But when you go through our league home and road, 18 times, that's
tough. You gotta play everybody. You gotta play everybody at home. They're
going to know your tendencies. You play people for a third time down here.
That's why the game can get muddied up a little bit, but I think that helps.
Hopefully we get eight teams, TCU, Texas, they get in and give us eight teams
as well, and we can all go and do well in the tournament. This is as good of a
league as there is in the country. When you are in there as a younger coach
and you listen to the Hall of Famer guys talk about how good this league is
when I first got here, that's when it really resonates.  
  
Q. Steve, you guys come here losing 5 of 6 in the regular season. Is
this the best stretch of ball you've had this week? Are you playing as well as
you guys can play?  
STEVE PROHM: We're playing good. We're getting back to who we are and what we
want to be about. We had a stretch, you know, when we got to 18-5. We had won
6 out of 7, 7 out of 9, where, you know, we got up to, you know, with the
first NCAA poll we were 13th. Then for whatever reason, three weeks, we
struggled, defensively and sharing the ball. We will never know for sure why
we turned. We just didn't play great, especially at West Virginia and Texas.
Baylor came in outtoughed us at our place. We played well at home against
Oklahoma, but it was a tough three-week stretch. We got back. We had better
practices coming in here. Then it's a new season. You have a championship to
play for and there are only so many opportunities you get to play for a
championship. These guys responded, and now we've got to be able to handle
success, tonight, we've got to not handle success once we figure out who we
play in our preparation and be ready to play Thursday or Friday because
whoever you play, a 4 seed or 7 seed, it's going to be somebody really good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we will let you go celebrate. Thank you.
Congratulations.

_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Iowa State 63, Kansas State 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Kansas State, Coach Bruce Weber. Student-athletes are
Barry Brown, Jr. and Cartier Diarra. Coach?  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Obviously, you're always disappointed when you lose. Proud of our
guys, been proud of 'em all year. They battled their butts off. We had a bad
stretch in the first half, ended the half, allowed them to make that run and
we got together at halftime and they came together and I thought played as
well as you can play to start the second half. You've got to use so much
energy though to come back. You still have a 5-point lead. I told them it's an
identical spot to the game at their place. We were down 5 with 2 something
left and we scored the last 7 points and got a win. They made the plays. We
had lots of chances, missed too many layups, had a lot of wide-open threes,
didn't make 'em. Disappointing. I'm proud of our guys, and hats off to Iowa
State. I thought Michael Jacobson played his heart out, 8 points, 16 rebounds,
played so hard for them and obviously Shayok with the big 3. When we were all
struggling making shots he stepped up and made that big three that turned the
game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's go to our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Barry, you guys took the lead with about 10:43 with Xavier's
3-pointer and held on to the lead, but it seemed like offense got difficult
from there on out and I think you missed 8 straight to finish the game. What
changed from that point on? You were so good and then just dried up.  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I think maybe we got a little stagnant, some quick shots,
then just got some missed, wide-open shots. Not being strong in the paint, not
making the extra pass, maybe. I think all that kind of played a factor into
it.  
  
Q. For both of you, in a lot of ways after losing tonight you guys are
in the same position you were in last year going into the tournament, same
group of guys, Dean's out. Do you feel better equipped or as well equipped
certainly as last year for what you're going to do in the tournament?  
CARTIER DIARRA: I'm not going to say we're in the same position. Of course we
have grown from that. You learn from experience. I just think we also learned
from this game. We know that it's win or go home and we gotta play together at
all times, follow the scouting report and play K-State defense and K-State
basketball and give ourselves an opportunity to win. I think that's the
biggest thing moving forward is keeping that mindset and just focusing on who
we are going to be playing against and not looking ahead.  
  
Q. Barry, compare where you are now to where you were last year. You
guys obviously had a pretty fine postseason last year and you've got a lot of
the same elements in place and same circumstances except what you did last
year is under your belt.  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Like he said, I don't think we're in the same position.
We've grown. We went through it, been through it without Dean, which is always
tough. But we survived and advanced last year and we were able to get some
experience under our belt. Obviously, it's not last year. It's going to be
different teams. The ball is going to bounce different. The shots are going to
fall different, but it gives us the self-confidence that it's able to be done.  
  
Q. For Cartier, I know you're not happy with the loss. But how do you
feel playing 30 minutes yesterday and how did the tournament feel overall
after missing over a month?  
CARTIER DIARRA: How do I feel? Man, I feel good. I feel good. But of course
I'm upset we lost and I had two wide-open shots at the end to, you know,
extend the lead or take the lead back again and I didn't make those. So I'm
really upset about that.  
  
Other than that, I felt pretty good running, just getting fatigue back and
stuff like that. But the game is over and done with. Coach stresses about
moving on and now we gotta wait and get ready to see who the competition is
for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. For Cartier and Barry, considering you have one less game to play and
something that can obviously distract you until Selection Sunday, is it going
to be more difficult to not dwell on tonight over the roughly next 48 hours
before you find out who you play next or no?  
CARTIER DIARRA: Nah, we good. The game is over done with. We lost it. Can't
get it back. Everybody is going to get their bodies right, get back focused
mentally and get ready for this next game because we know it could be our last
of the season and for the seniors. So I'm definitely going to be prepared and
ready to play for my guys.  
  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I agree, man. We're not going to dwell on it. It's going to
suck today, maybe even suck tomorrow. But once our names go across the screen
and we find who we are playing it's going to be about that team and not what
happened in the past, not the good that happened in the past and not the bad
that happened in the past, just what we can do to move forward and survive and
advance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you. Good luck next week. Question for coach?  
  
Q. I wonder if you could speak to how much better equipped are you for
this postseason run after last postseason and despite the fact the feeling
that you have right now?  
BRUCE WEBER: I said it two years ago when we were one of the last ones in, to
have that experience to go to Dayton and play that game to get to go across
country to Sacramento and play Cincinnati even though we didn't play well.
One, they got a taste of it. Two, they got a win, and each experience is
important. Last year it helped us because they had been through the NCAA
Tournament. So I think we're much better equipped. Obviously we're older,
we've been through it. We played NCAA games. It was great to get Cartier back
going. I didn't expect or anticipate him to play that many minutes, but Mike
McGuirl kept getting in foul trouble both games and we had to push him.  
  
So I feel good about it. But we really gotta focus on one game win streaks and
that's all. Being prepared. We've been so good. If you think about it, Iowa
State is really good, but we were so consistent and dealt with so many things
and kept fighting even within today. It was like a microcosom of our season
all the things we went through. And hopefully we will have that drive, that
determination to fight through and be ready for the tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, it never felt appropriate to ask about seeding or anything at
any point in this season and maybe it's tough after this loss, but where does
this team deserve to be seeded?  
BRUCE WEBER: I think our league is very, very good. You see West Virginia
beating the league champ last year, so the balance in the league, I've said it
all year, I'm not sure the top teams are quite as good, but the balance is
unbelievable and you have to grind it out to play for a third time, to grind
it out like we have, you know, there was, what, about six weeks ago. Iowa
State was a top-16 team in that first, whatever they announced the top 16. So
it says a lot and they end up 9-9 in our league.  
  
I have no idea. I don't follow. The coaches do. I gotta believe we're
somewhere between 3 and 5. But, you know, we'll just have to see. I think we
found out last year it doesn't matter. It's how you prepare and if you're
ready to go.  
  
Q. Coach, it looked like you started so well in the first half. The
second half, it kinda looked like you ran out of gas in both halves is the
tempo of the game and injuries and illnesses just add up on you tonight?  
BRUCE WEBER: There is no doubt. You played last night and tonight and it's
hard fought and they go at you. That is the one thing they do is push the
basketball. You guys asked what happened to offense. One, they blocked three
unbelievable shots. Those were big-time plays. Two, we missed, what, four,
five, wide open threes where they weren't guarding us, and we went out and
missed them. I thought after the first couple go to the hoop, get in the
paint, get some layups. But we didn't do that.  
  
And, you know, I don't think either team made threes down the stretch except
for Shayok's because you're tired. How do you make threes without legs, and I
think that might have been the difference.  
  
Q. Following up on the seeding question, you think the Selection
Committee looks more at your regular season co-championship or the tournament?
Is there any way to figure that out?  
BRUCE WEBER: I know they say the entire package. I think that's, and we'll see
with the new "net rating." I know there are some questions about the net and
it's been brought up to them. I don't know if they're concerned, but they're
definitely looking at it. But we will know more is it net, RPI, is it all the
different BPI, whatever it is, what becomes a factor. But I hope our
consistency in the league, our schedule nonconference. We went and played road
games which not a lot of teams did in nonconference. We won road games in the
league, and we did it with injuries, without guys. So I'm just proud of 'em.
But whatever happens, happens. We just got to have a good mental mindset going
into whoever we play.  
  
Q. Bruce, how do you feel you can assess Dean's status right now? X came
out limping. Is he okay?  
BRUCE WEBER: X has something. An aggravated thing through the season, probably
needs a couple weeks of rest. But we don't have that chance. He fought through
it, still played 28 minutes. We need Mike McGuirl not to get in foul trouble
because it kept putting us in a bind. Dean, we will wait and see how he's
feeling. Says it feels better than it did two days ago, but we've kept him in
the boot. He did treatment basically all day today. He will do it all day
tomorrow and then lots of hope and prayers that maybe we find a way to get him
back.  
  
Q. Coach, I wanted to ask about Shaun. I know he struggled, but he gave
you guys some good minutes that first half. Does that give you some confidence
going forward?  
BRUCE WEBER: I hope so. If you look at the bench scoring last night it was
18-6. We won it and tonight. It's 12-0, but I thought Shaun gave us a nice
boost, made a couple nice plays, played with confidence. I was happy with
that. Levi was really good last night, didn't quite give us that tonight. But
we need everybody. We gotta do it together, and if we stay together we will be
fine. We can guard. We play our butts off. If we share the basketball we'll be
good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Good luck next week.

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Ochai Agbaji](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36848)

### [Dedric Lawson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30608)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas 88, West Virginia 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we are joined on stage now by the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach
Bill Self, and student-athletes are Dedric Lawson and Ochai Agbaji. Coach,
congratulations on the victory tonight.  
  
BILL SELF: Thank you. We didn't get off to a really good start and didn't
guard very well to start. Certainly West Virginia played better than we did
the first 15 minutes or so, but then we got hot and Quentin carried us in the
first half and we were pretty efficient in the second half. Certainly looking
forward to playing a talented and a red hot Iowa State team tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Dedric and Ochai, what does it mean to play for the title tomorrow,
and how do you think you played today in beating West Virginia?  
DEDRIC LAWSON: I think we played okay. It wasn't our best game. There are
definitely things we can improve on and looking forward to tomorrow and
getting a championship, looking forward to winning something meaningful for
the season.  
  
OCHAI AGBAJI: We're all excited for tomorrow and our guys are all going to be
ready. Coming off this game we weren't, you know, ready to go from the start.
But I think tomorrow we will be ready.  
  
Q. For both of you, kinda going back to what Coach touched on a little
bit, do you feel like y'all played with more energy the second half than you
did the first half?  
DEDRIC LAWSON: I guess to a certain extent we went out big and got
lackadaisical with turnover and stuff and we could have put them away and we
got easy baskets to get our guys more confident. So we just gotta keep our
foot on their neck when we got them down.  
  
OCHAI AGBAJI: Like he said, we got a lead going in the second half and I think
that kinda got us going, but later on in the second half we made some mistakes
and we gotta clean that up.  
  
Q. Ochai, what did you think of the way Quentin played today?  
OCHAI AGBAJI: He played great. He is shooting with confidence. That's
something we need moving into tomorrow. Definitely in the second half when he
got hurt I think he will be fine. But I think we need that going into
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Dedric, what do you think of his four-point play?  
DEDRIC LAWSON: It was pretty impressive. He made one like that at practice the
other day.  
  
OCHAI AGBAJI: Did he?  
  
DEDRIC LAWSON: Yeah, doubling fist.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
DEDRIC LAWSON: The two walk-ons.  
  
BILL SELF: They foul a lot.  
  
Q. Gentlemen, thanks for coming. Questions for Coach Self?  
Q. Talk about the match-up with Iowa State?  
BILL SELF: You know, we played 'em both so early. I can't remember the exact
date, but I think it was the first week in February, our second game with
them. So it's been like six weeks since we played 'em. They handled us easily
at their place and we had to fight and scratch to eke out a win at our place.
They're the best offensive team in our league. They've got more weapons. They
create problems for a lot of folks and we're also one of the them because they
play small. So they got shooters at all four spots around the perimeters.
We've been playing big, so we will have to make adjustments there and try to
figure it out. I love their personnel and they always play good in Kansas City
it seems like.  
  
I'm sure that they'll get a ton of support here tomorrow and it should be a
fun game. I think it will be one of more fun games we've played this year.  
  
Q. Bill, how is Quentin, and where has this been all year?  
BILL SELF: Well, he just got a cramp. So he's fine. I mean, I guess he needs
to drink a lot of water and he should be fine. But he shot the ball
ridiculously well the first half and there was absolutely no hesitation. He
was so confident. Second half his looks were good. The last one he didn't get
close because I think he cramped in his shot. But it's a weapon that we
desperately need and certainly something that, you know, we need a guy to
catch fire like that, that can carry us for a four or five-minute stretch. If
it weren't for him over a four or five-minute stretch, West Virginia
controlled the first half and we ended up going 8 just primarily because of
Quentin.  
  
Q. I don't know if you saw the first game, really, really loud in favor
of Iowa State. You obviously have a big crowd. What kind of energy do you
expect for tomorrow night?  
BILL SELF: I hope our fans are creative, but I bet you Iowa State has 70% of
the building tomorrow. The reason I say that is because when you play that
first game and you win, now you're able to hustle the tickets off the team
that didn't win. And they're pros at hustling tickets in Kansas City. I would
say that it will be the first time in a long time that we probably won't have
a comparable home court is what I predict. But, you know, our people show up
and they'll compete just like we will tomorrow. It should be a fun day and
certainly a game in which I think will be a fun game to play. There will be
good players out there on the court.  
  
Q. Bill, I don't know whether it's Quentin or Marcus' ankle, is there
anything big picture that you've taken from these games or that you want to
see tomorrow heading into next week?  
BILL SELF: You know what? I don't know. I think if anything I would like to
have our core group, meaning our nine guys all contributing in a way where
they have confidence going into the next week. If you look at it, hey, Devon
has had two games. Dedric has been solid. David has been solid, and Ochai
kinda came out of it tonight, which I thought was really good. Marcus
obviously is playing at a, moving better than he has in a long time. This has
been a good weekend for us. But, certainly, we need to learn how to close
something out. We get opportunity to do that tomorrow and of course they have
the same opportunity. But it's just going to make for a fun game. The winner
of the game will celebrate for a span of about 20 hours, and then it's over.
It's not like, it's over. Who cares after that, once the pairings come out?
That's how everybody will view it, but tomorrow I think it will be a highly
competitive game where both teams are really hookin' up.  
  
Q. Coach, what were some things that you saw from David McCormack
tonight or maybe some things you didn't see?  
BILL SELF: I thought David was not as good as he has been, being candid. I
didn't think he came ready to guard and that was his main assignment,
obviously, was to cover, and we subbed him early. I thought that did he a much
better job in the second half defending. I thought he was pretty good second
half. He's a guy that gives you points but they're bonuses. He doesn't have to
score for him to play well, but he has to defend and rebound to play well.
Derek Culver is a load, and he's still got his numbers. But I thought David
did a pretty nice job, second half.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the effort and the presence that Mitch Lightfoot
has had over the past few games and especially tonight.  
BILL SELF: Mitch does some good things. Mitch, I guess you could describe him
as a head scratcher from him because he can do so many good things and then
you just remember what we're thinking about on some other things. But I
thought his activity blocking shots and everything were terrific. He's got to
rebound. He didn't get any rebounds tonight, three turnovers in limited, guys
shouldn't be turning the ball over.  
  
So he does do some really good things and his activity level is really high
for the most part, but he can tighten up some things as well. I love Mitch,
but sometimes I think that he can get a little bit more done than what he
does.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

### [Michael Jacobson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36254)

### [Marial Shayok](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30844)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Iowa State 63, Kansas State 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the Cyclones of Iowa State. Our head coach, Steve
Prohm, and student-athletes are Marial Shayok and Michael Jacobson. Coach,
congratulations on your victory.  
  
STEVE PROHM: Thank you. First of all, it was a great game, great atmosphere
and I knew playing Kansas State here and the way our fans travel the game
would be great. Congratulations to Kansas State and Coach Weber for the
regular season championship. That's hard to do, extremely hard to do. Great
job in the second half. Really making it tough for us offensively. We got
stagnant. The ball didn't move as well. They were able to get out of
transition, off turnovers. Turned it over 17 times. I was most proud of the
guys today. We were down 5 late, flipped the script back in Ames. We were up 5
or 7 late and they came back on us. Nick got two free throws. We chased down a
couple of lose balls. Mike had 16 rebounds, Marial's three rimmed it, and
Marial made a shot that a lot of fans here will remember if we're fortunate to
go on and complete this deal tomorrow night. Congrats to K-State. They've had
an unbelievable year up to this point.  
  
Q. Mike, talk about the 16 rebounds, you guys owned a 14 rebound
advantage for the game.  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: It's something that we have focused on as a team, one of our
goals as a team is to be plus in the margin, so playing a team like K-State
you're going to have to do that. You're going to have to control glass,
especially when shots weren't falling like they normally do. So controlling
the defense glass and getting offensive boards that can get us extra
possessions is a big deal in a close game like this.  
  
Q. Marial, talk about the 3-pointer that you made with less than a
minute left that gave y'all the lead. What kind of spacing did you have over
there in the corner and how did the fall feel when it left your hand?  
MARIAL SHAYOK: The ball felt good when it left my hands. I had my space, but I
had all the confidence in the world. I was missing a bunch of shots in the
second half and that's -- Coach Prohm and my teammates they give me the
confidence all year down the stretch to shoot those shots.  
  
Q. Could you scout the upcoming game. If it's KU, give us a scouting
report, if it's West Virginia as well.  
MARIAL SHAYOK: I mean, our coaches are going to handle that part. We just got
to execute whatever scout they provide us later tonight, and I'm sure we're
going to be ready. It's going to be an exciting game, exciting atmosphere. So
we're all looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Michael, considering the way this team is playing down the stretch
what was the discussion among the team heading into this tournament about the
state of this team?  
MICHAEL JACOBSON: I mean, we were just fighting to get back right I think was
the biggest thing. We just got back to competing in practice and working hard
and going at each other and I think, you know, to be honest sometimes you've
got to hit rock bottom to start building it back up and I think that's kinda
what happened to an extent and we came out of the Texas Tech game and didn't
win. But they are a good team and we felt like we played better than we had in
a while and we knew if we could keep building on that and the get our
mentality to where it needed to be in early January and February we would have
a chance at this.  
  
Q. Marial, you had gone without a field goal from 5-17 in the first half
until those back-to-back threes in the corner. Were you aware of that?
Frustrated? What was your thought process being held down without a make there
for a period of time?  
MARIAL SHAYOK: I wasn't really thinking about it, just doing what I can to get
the win and despite all that I kept my confidence and like I said earlier, the
team has my back and the coaching staff has my back to shoot those shots. So
credit to them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we will let you go back to the locker room.
Congratulations. Thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on the win. You have a unique perspective of
you played K-State once with Dean Wade and once without him today. How
different of a team are they without him?  
STEVE PROHM: They're really good. That class has been coming together for
three years. This is a three-year run for them, really, and I've been here for
all four years. I got here when Dean Wade was a freshman and Stokes and Brown
were freshmen and then they added Sneed. They went to the tournament. Without
Wade last year they make the Elite 8 run. I think they're a good team the way
they play with Wade and without Wade because Coach Weber is so good
defensively. Their teams are resilient. They have championship DNA that we
talked at halftime. Those guys were going to respond. Barry Brown is a winner.
He leads the way from a toughness standpoint for them and I got a lot of
respect for those guys. To win the regular season in this league isn't easy. I
don't know to talk X's and O's what makes 'em different. What makes that team
good is their character and their toughness on the defense end.  
  
Q. Coach, if it's KU tomorrow this place is going to be absolutely nuts.
Can you talk about the atmosphere for the championship game if it's KU? And
then I have a follow-up.  
STEVE PROHM: That's what you want to be a part of. You're playing the elite
program in our league, Hall of Fame coach, bunch of McDonald's All-Americans.
We got a ton of respect for Kansas, I know a couple of years ago, I think it
may have been Coach Hoiberg's last year, they played Kansas and beat them in
the championship. I heard those stories and my second year here when we
thought we may play each other in the Sweet 16. We thought that may happen,
but we got beat by Purdue. Iowa State and Kansas, ESPN, that should be fun.  
  
Q. Iowa State has never lost in a championship of the Bog 12. Talk about
the pressure that puts on your guys?  
STEVE PROHM: There is no pressure. There is no pressure. We're going to
prepare tonight and prepare in the morning. There is no pressure in that. Our
guys don't know it, and unless you tell them, I'm not going to tell them. I'm
proud of where these guys are at over the last week of trying to change their
habits, but you can see we got stagnant tonight and we can't do that. It may
not be Kansas. West Virginia drilled us a couple of weeks ago up there. That
was a tough moment for us and our team. So if it's Coach Huggins and their
team we're going to have to play really well too. But obviously I know your
message was about Kansas with the atmosphere. But we will be excited either
way. There is definitely no pressure and if there is any pressure it needs to
go on me not the kids.  
  
Q. Coach, I know this is a semifinal win, but with what your team has
been through, would you say that the mojo is back and the corner has been
turned now?  
STEVE PROHM: I don't know. We've always been a good basketball team. We just
haven't been very good for the first three weeks. Three weeks prior we were
13th in the NCAA seeding polls when that came out, so that's pretty good.  
  
We got into a bad rut, and we weren't playing the right way. We struggled
defensively, and we had to make changes. It's more about not basketball
changes just us doing the right thing. I think once the regular season ended
and we got a little bit better against Texas Tech, coming down here gives you
a new state of mind, peace of mind and obviously our fan base helps down here
as well.  
  
Q. And playing the best basketball of the season again at a very
important time?  
STEVE PROHM: Well, this is when you want to be playing your best. I thought
yesterday against Baylor was a really complete game. I thought we had a good
half tonight. We struggled in the second half, but Kansas State had a lot to
do with that. They're so good defensively in the half-court and we've got to
do a better job tomorrow night of moving the basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Congratulations.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Derek Culver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36793)

### [Brandon Knapper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36847)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas 88, West Virginia 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by the Mountaineers from West Virginia, Coach
Bob Huggins, student-athletes, Derek Culver and Brandon Knapper. Questions for
our student-athletes?  
  
Q. For either player, guys, take me through Kansas' 11-0 run right
before halftime. How did they take charge of the game right before the
break?  
BRANDON KNAPPER: Like Coach said, we just didn't get back on defense. Our
transition defense wasn't good enough, and they was getting the rebound and
pushing the ball up court. We just made simple mistakes, basically, on getting
back on defense and that's what hurt us.  
  
DEREK CULVER: Yeah, to piggyback on what Knapp said, we failed to get back in
transition defense. We weren't talking. Just little mishaps like that can make
a big difference in the game. Like I said, we didn't get back on defense. We
weren't talking or communicating and we weren't knowing where we were supposed
to be. When you don't execute things like that it's kinda hard to make the
game go in your favor.  
  
Q. Follow-up to that, is it lack of execution or fatigue? You guys have
played so much basketball at a high level over the last few days, which is
it?  
DEREK CULVER: I don't want to make any excuses and say it's fatigue, but it
kinda just comes down to lack of just paying attention to what's going on
around you. Like I said, I will be the first one to blame. We just gotta go
back to the drawing board and try to fix it.  
  
Q. Either of you, potential to play more basketball, is that an exciting
prospect to try to continue to build off of what you guys have accomplished
here over the last few days?  
BRANDON KNAPPER: Of course. I mean, this team will be here next year, and like
Coach said, we just gotta stay together and stay positive. We've got to
continue to work. We don't come out and basically play the game that we
learned how to play and just learn from this and basically build on to it for
next year.  
  
DEREK CULVER: Like he said, we have to go back to the drawing board and figure
things out. It's always going to be fun to go out and play with my brothers
again. Like I said, blood sweat and tears, I would give everything for these
guys. Like I said, it's always fun to get another opportunity to get to play
basketball with them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Derek and Brandon, we will let you go back to the locker
room. Thank you. Good tournament, guys. Questions for Coach Huggins?  
  
Q. Coach, what defense miscues happened? Derek mentioned down the
stretch there in the first half, how was Kansas able to pull in front and stay
in front?  
BOB HUGGINS: Grimes got hot at the end of the half. We had our hands down and
he just jumped up and shot it in. I think he was the biggest reason or maybe
the only reason for the run. He was very good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you for coming.  
  
BOB HUGGINS: My pleasure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck.

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

### [Barry Brown, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35172)

### [Kamau Stokes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32973)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas State 70, TCU 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined on stage by the Kansas State Wildcats, our head
coach Bruce Weber and student-athletes Kamau Stokes and Barry Brown, Jr.
Coach, congratulations. Your thoughts?  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Just proud of the continuing to be resilient and fight. It's
human nature after Saturday night to win a championship, to celebrate like
that. To come back, I didn't think we had great emotion to start the game, not
very good energy. I warned them, I kind of talked to them about it. But I
thought the bench was really key, other people. Obviously Cartier coming in,
getting us going. Levi did a nice job. Mike McGuirl, we got some stops, turned
them over, got a lot of transition points.  
  
That with the fast break points were really key and Xavier in the second half
really stepped up. I thought a big offensive rebound after Kam missed the free
throw, got it back to Kam, hit the three, broke their spirit a little bit and
got to 10 and then we had to find a way to finish it out. So proud of these
guys, the whole team. They've continued to fight and be resilient and get 25
not wins and move closer to getting a Big 12 Championship.  
  
Q. Kam and Barry, Levi lost minutes in the last month or two and gets
put on the spot today and has a big game. How important was he in the win?  
KAMAU STOKES: He was very important. Coach talks about guys stepping up and
Levi stepped up today and he gave us post presence, and defensively he did a
pretty good job.  
  
Q. Kamau, you guys have been trailing all game and you hit one free
throw and then you had the 3-pointer. It seemed like you guys just took over.
Can you describe that run of taking the lead and just what you guys were able
to do down the stretch to maintain that lead?  
KAMAU STOKES: Like Coach said, the plays we made toward the end of game pretty
much broke their spirit and those were momentum plays as well and we kept
going for the rest of the game and got stops like we did and fast break points
were a big thing, too.  
  
Q. And Barry, you guys have had tight games in the past. Does this team
have championship DNA?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I think we do. We've shown that time and time again. We've
shown that no matter what the score is we're down late, up late, down early,
doesn't matter we're going to continue to compete, continue to fight and just
try to find a way to win.  
  
Q. Kamau, that run we were talking about where you guys took the lead
started with you going down pretty hard. What did you hurt there? How many
thing do you have going on right now with injuries? Is it true Coach Weber
might have been yelling at you to make your free throws while you were lying
down?  
KAMAU STOKES: I don't know if he was yelling at me to make my free throws, but
Coach Weber always talks about toughness and I'm pretty sure he wanted me to
get up. Everybody wanted me to get up. So just had to let the pain wear off a
little bit. Fell on my side. Other than that I feel fine.  
  
Q. When you are going through that, how hard is it to lock in on, I
gotta shoot a free throw now? You got a few things going on, you're wiggling
your hand and limping.  
KAMAU STOKES: It's not hard. You gotta focus on the things that are important
and those free throws are important, and I missed the second one. He did a
great job kicking it out to me and I was opening for the 3.  
  
Q. Barry, about halfway through the first half you guys are in single
digits scoring and I can hear Coach imploring you guys to play with more
energy. What were your thoughts at that time? TCU was slowly pulling way. Did
you think you were getting in trouble there?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: We came out draw and lethargic, didn't have the right energy
and mindset to compete for forty minutes. I feel like the first maybe 10, 12
minutes of the first half we kinda just coasted and thought that we just won a
Big 12 championship maybe are we were going to come in and win a game. I tried
to express to the guys that it wasn't going to be easy. I had never swept TCU
throughout my entire career. Last year we went 2-1, sophomore year went 1-1,
and did we sweep my freshman year?  
  
BRUCE WEBER: No, they beat us at home. Then we came back and beat 'em there.  
  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: There you go. So I knew it wasn't to be an easy game.
They're trying to get that bid into the NCAA Tournament, and they're playing
with a chip on their shoulder. So they came out and punched us in the mouth.
We needed to be the aggressor and we weren't. But I feel like, I don't know,
we got the wet feet from out of us and just played with confidence down the
stretch and end of the first half.  
  
Q. Both of you, what are your thoughts on playing Iowa State on
Friday?  
KAMAU STOKES: You know, they're a good team. We gotta prepare for them the
same way we prepare for anybody else. They gonna come out, play hard. They're
fighting for a tournament championship as well, so we know they're going to
come out and we gotta be ready to compete.  
  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I mean, like he said, they're a good team. We're really
going to have to lock it into what they do and their personnel, they came
into, last time and got a win. So we kinda got that sick taste in our mouth
and we have to do everything possible and everything necessary in order for us
to come out with a victory.  
  
Q. Barry, I was wondering if you could walk me through that 3-point shot
by X-man when the clock was running down, gave you guys a 6 lead? What did he
say? Talk about that setup?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: Top of the key? I don't know what happened, honestly, from
my point of view I was on the right wing and I saw the clock dwindling down,
and I was yelling at him to shoot and I didn't know if he saw the shot clock.
He pumped fake and stayed with his fundamentals and principles in his shot and
he was able to make it.  
  
Q. For both you guys, you guys scored 22 points off turnovers. What were
you able to do to make TCU make poor decisions offensively?  
BARRY BROWN, JR.: I thought we had hand pressure, being in the gap trying to
make them make the extra pass. It worked for the most part. I feel like early
we win the have that hand pressure and that toughness, but for about 30
minutes of the game I felt like we came out and played Kansas State defense.
We pressured the ball, deflected passes, got rebounds also and got out in
transition.  
  
KAMAU STOKES: Like Barry said, I feel like our defense intensity picked up. We
were lethargic in the beginning of the game, and second half Coach Weber
challenged us to defend those guys. You know, wanted to hold them under what
we held them before which I think was fifty five. Fifty two. We didn't do that
today because of the early start they had, but second half I felt like we were
locked in defensively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, guys. Congratulations. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Bruce, obviously toughness means a lot to you and when Kamau is down,
you're assuming he's going to get up. How much does all the stuff he's been
going through speak to what you're looking for and I hope I wasn't unfair?  
BRUCE WEBER: I kinda did it in jest trying to get him to smile and laugh, I
got the official to laugh. He begins to laugh probably more than anybody, but
I just said get your butt up and make your free throws. He's been
unbelievable, the last six games, all season, his whole career. That little
guy that keeps getting knocked down and keeps getting up and you gotta give
him a lot of credit for sticking with it, and I don't think he had a great
start. But he had that little stretch there, got fouled made the free throw,
made the three, made some plays. Again, he's just doing a lot of little
things. His defense is better. But he is truly played inspired basketball and
he showed a lot, a lot of toughness.  
  
Q. Bruce, how impressive was Xavier's second half and can you walk me
through the 3-pointer at the buzzer?  
BRUCE WEBER: Well, you know, we all got after Xavier. He struggled early and
he didn't have great body language. One time he said he wanted to come out and
I said heck with you, stay in there. I ended up taking him out; but, you know,
I got after him a couple of times and the coaches got after him and he
responded.  
  
You know, the shot clock is going down. We wanted the ball in Barry's hands. I
don't know what happened, but somehow it didn't get there. Xavier got it, and,
you know, the thing we all say if you're going to shoot it, shoot it to make
it and follow through. Barry talked about it. He stuck with it and it looked
like he shoots those all the time. Really good effort. I thought his offensive
rebound was huge, 19-7, 5 assists. Good game for anybody and a lot of that was
in the second half, and he had the big 3 at the end of the half after we gave
up the layup. The other unsung hero is Mak, 10-8 offensive rebounds, defending
energy, you gotta run every time. They put you in so many binds, and I thought
him and Levi, you get 18 points from those two guys and 10 rebounds, that's
pretty efficient for a big guy. We gotta find ways to make up for Dean and
that means a little from different people you get Carti, Mak, Levi, and Xavier
steps up and that's allowed us to win the game.  
  
Q. You're down 13, 10 minutes into the game, you go to that lineup at
the end of the game last time, Barry, Kam, X, Carti and Mak, and how big of an
impact did Carti have?  
BRUCE WEBER: He gave us energy and he is fresh. He hasn't played. He got
tired. You could see him huffing and puffing. He didn't want to come out. The
only thing I screwed up, they told him to not dunk and I ran that lob play.
Luckily he caught it because we didn't want to take a chance. He definitely
gave us a great boost of energy, 8 points, 5 rebounds, 3 assists, just got to
the hoop, made some plays that helped us kinda penetrate their defense which
was really key.  
  
Q. Coach, that same segment, you guys were down quite a bit, I think it
was 12 points or 13 points and you were imploring your team to play with
energy. How concerned were you that this was one of those games where you just
couldn't wake 'em up at that point?  
BRUCE WEBER: I was concerned. I sat down a couple of times and you know I
don't like to sit down. But I was frustrated, not only, I didn't think we had
energy. We took some tough shots, some quick shots, and, you know, you gotta
give 'em credit. They have been resilient. They fought back today. We talked
about wearing TCU down, and I know TCU had a lot to play for. But they did
play last night at 6:00 and they didn't get back to their hotel room until
9:30. I thought they played with great energy and right before half we
remember able to take advantage and wear them down, made some plays, shut them
down. I didn't know what the score was, but they only got 27 second half, they
were up 27. You think about 54 the rest of the game. We did a much better job
defensively, turned 'em over 18 times. We did that at home, the same thing,
active hands, like Barry talked about, that has allowed us to get is some
transition, get some easy baskets and probably got us going more than
anything.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much. Congratulations.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

### [Jase Febres](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36807)

### [Dylan Osetkowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34861)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas 65, Texas 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the University of Texas. Coach Shaka
Smart, student-athletes Jase Febres and Dylan Osetkowski. Coach, thoughts on
tonight's game?  
  
SHAKA SMART: I thought our guys fought a lot down the stretch, and we got
stops at the latter part of the game. But we didn't score enough points,
earlier in the half we didn't get enough stops, particularly in transition. I
think the difference in transition baskets is one of the key factors that led
to Kansas winning the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Dylan, there were times where a lot was clicking for you out there.
What did you feel against their defense when it wasn't working for a lot of
other guys?  
DYLAN OSETKOWSKI: Nothing really that their defense was doing. I was just
playing aggressive. Yeah.  
  
Q. Jase, how hard was it for Snoop to find rhythm in the game tonight,
and the how much may that have hurt you all offensively?  
JASE FEBRES: Can you repeat the first part please?  
  
Q. With Snoop missing the last five games it seemed he struggled to get
in an offensive rhythm. I wondered how that set your offense back tonight?  
JASE FEBRES: When you haven't played five games it's going to set back your
offense a little bit, but regardless he came in and contributed what he could.
As for what he could have done better, I'm not the sure, because I'm not him.
But I know he gave it his all and that's all I could ask for.  
  
Q. In your heart, have y'all played well enough to get in the NCAA
Tournament?  
DYLAN OSETKOWSKI: Absolutely. Absolutely, no question about it. Regardless of
our record, every game that we've played, it was there for us to win, and
we've been in every game. It's a tough place leaving it up to the Committee
now. But I think we've definitely done enough for them to see that we are a
NCAA Tournament team.  
  
JASE FEBRES: Same. I think we've given our all every game we've played. We've
had our ups and downs during the season, but regardless we have stacked up
enough wins to put ourselves in a good position to get deeper into March.  
  
Q. Dylan, how much did y'all feel hamstrung with Jaxson's foul trouble
and the few minutes he played tonight?  
DYLAN OSETKOWSKI: What do you mean by feel hamstrung?  
  
Q. One of your best players, he played 15, 16 minutes.  
DYLAN OSETKOWSKI: I mean, he had, whether he had 2 points, 2 rebounds. Forget
about what the stat sheet says. When he's out there he makes a difference. So
he only had 2. Matt didn't have any. Regardless of the points, guys are out
there and they affect the game and Jaxson definitely affected the game on the
defensive end as well.  
  
Q. Guys, how aware are you, I assume you are by now, that a 500 team has
never made it into the NCAA Tournament and I guess, again, how would you state
your case to the Committee that you're deserving?  
DYLAN OSETKOWSKI: I actually didn't know that. I mean, like I said, look at
our games, early on in the season, North Carolina, Purdue, Michigan State. We
couldn't finish that out in the second half. Kansas at home, at Kansas, every
game in the Big 12. I think Big 12 is one of the toughest conferences in the
nation. Look at the Texas Tech-West Virginia game, team that won four or five
games in the regular season comes out and punches Tech in the mouth. Every
night in the Big 12 is a dog fight. All that war. Not to say you don't get
that in other conferences, but every night is a fight. Like I said, I think
we've done enough to put ourselves in a position to play in March and go win
games in March. I think you get to a one-game situation, teams don't want to
see us. Teams don't want to see us out of our league.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, we will let you go back to the locker room. Thank
you. Questions for Coach Smart?  
  
Q. Shaka, you touched on it a minute ago, but their transition points
and just how much of that was a killer, do you think? Do you think that may
have been the game itself? Transition buckets?  
SHAKA SMART: That was definitely, defensively that was the biggest key and
going into the game we knew we needed to do a good job on them in transition.
I thought for most of the first half we did. Lawson got loose and got a
3-point shot in the first half. There was one or two others that were caused
by turnovers. But the second half they were able to get out in transition too
much. Particularly there was a 3-point shot that Quentin Grimes hit midway
through the half that was a big one for us because it was after one of our
makes. That's unacceptable. We can't give up a three after we make a shot. Our
guys got confused, got their wires crossed in terms of match-ups and defense.
That was a big factor in the game and I think defensively that was the biggest
factor because in the half-court possessions we guarded them pretty well.  
  
Q. Shaka, how did you present this game to your guys as far as the
significance? Did you present it as, hey, we need to win this to make sure we
get in?  
SHAKA SMART: Yes. Absolutely. We talked about the fact that this was a game
that I didn't necessarily tell the guys that it would get us into the NCAA
Tournament, but I told the guys that it was a game that we had to win if we
wanted to play in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
I thought our guys "want to" was definitely there from the standpoint of,
like, they really wanted to win the game. You can see the looks on their faces
after the game. They told that story. We just didn't do enough to win the
game, particularly on the offensive end, didn't make plays and down the
stretch we missed some good shots that didn't go in that could have made a
difference.  
  
Q. Shaka, does it leave you a hollow feeling? It seems like you have a
patent to the close loss. Seems like you played well enough to be right there
at the end?  
SHAKA SMART: We put ourselves in a position where, you know, we were within 4
points. Matt missed that three in the corner. That's one way to describe it.
Hollow. There's a lot of different areas where we could have been better
tonight. Somebody mentioned Jaxson obviously having him on the floor more
makes a big difference. It was not Matt's night. He didn't play particularly
well. Then, again, as a team there was a lot of things offensively that we
needed to work together to do better. But Kansas deserves a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Shaka, two things, do you have an update on Jaxson? I know it's
early. And two, what would you tell the Committee why you deserve a bid?  
SHAKA SMART: Jaxson hurt his left knee. Don't know the extent of it. We will
evaluate him when we get back to Austin. Hopefully it's not, you know,
extremely serious. But he was in some pain.  
  
In terms of talking to the Committee, we don't get that opportunity to speak
directly to them. But, you know, if you're going to evaluate teams based on
the quality of their wins we definitely, I think, deserve strong
consideration. But, you know, for us, our focus is on our guys and helping
them process this game today and understand what we can learn from it.  
  
Q. Shaka, I know the game just ended, but how are you going to approach
the next 48 hours until Selection Sunday with the guys knowing the 500 team
factoid and all that. Are you going to keep their hopes up? How are you going
to approach that?  
SHAKA SMART: We'll spend a lot of time together as a team. You know, we know
that we will obviously, the season is not done. So we will practice and work
on getting better. We've got a lot of young guys that need to learn a lot from
this game, from this experience up here.  
  
That's what we will do. No different than what we do any other time. It just
happens to be a couple days before Selection Sunday. Certainly you want to
control your own destiny and that's the most disappointing thing about
tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much. Good luck.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Marcus Garrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36809)

### [David McCormack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36810)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas 65, Texas 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the Kansas Jayhawks, Coach Self and
the student-athletes are Marcus Garrett and David McCormack. Coach,
congratulations on your victory tonight. Your thoughts?  
  
BILL SELF: I thought it was, you know, kind of a typical March game when you
played somebody for the third time. Not many easy baskets. I thought both
teams guarded the first half. The second half, I didn't think we guarded great
and we got lucky that they missed some good looks. We made 4 shots outside of
3 feet for the night. So to come away with a win when the ball didn't go in
the basket, certainly I'm happy with that and happy that we get to spend
another night here and play a much improved and tough West Virginia team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. David, could you talk about the difference between the last game
against Texas and the job you did on Jaxson Hayes trying to guard him
tonight?  
DAVID McCORMACK: Just playing them for the third time, you know, you get a
really good feel for your opponents and I know we have to get physical with
him. As far as getting inside of them because he likes to be a shot blocker,
so I used my size and strength to my advantage as far as playing against him.  
  
Q. David, do you feel like you are able to push it inside and then on
defense just force them to take perimeter shots that you would win this
game?  
DAVID McCORMACK: I definitely think so. Having the presence inside and making
them take outside shots is definitely an advantage that we had, and it was the
right things we did to force them to take bad shots.  
  
Q. Marcus, what do you think of KU's defense tonight and the challenges
that Texas presented?  
MARCUS GARRETT: I feel like we guarded great tonight knowing that when we
played at Texas our ball screen defense wasn't great at all. I feel like they
got anywhere they wanted to go on the court. We played great defensively.  
  
Q. Marcus, how important was it for you to mix it up on the glass today,
8 defensive rebounds?  
MARCUS GARRETT: Coach tell us to rebound before the game and I just trying to
help out and put all the rebounds on the bigs, help out the bigs. Not just put
all the rebounds on the bigs.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we will let you get back to the locker room.
Congratulations. Questions for Coach Self?  
  
Q. Bill, how much do you think Jaxson Hayes getting into foul trouble
changed the complex of the game for Texas?  
BILL SELF: I thought it did. He got two so fast and he got his third if I'm
not mistaken to start the second. But Lawson got two fast, too, not as fast as
Jaxson. But we have to have Dedric in the game, offensively. So I thought it
probably kept both teams from being their very best. Candidly. Certainly I
don't know what happened after the game, did they take him to the locker room?
You haven't heard anything, but I hope he's okay. He's a tremendous talent and
got a great future. That was a break for us for him only to play 14 minutes.
Although Jericho did play well.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned West Virginia briefly in your opening remarks,
certainly a team you scouted during the season and played twice. I don't know
if you had a chance to see them earlier, but how much different do you view
them now with the run they've gone on as opposed to maybe what you saw a
couple of weeks ago?  
BILL SELF: Well, they beat us at their place, obviously, and that was
basically to start the league. That was around January 20th, and then we
played them, I can't remember, eight games ago, maybe, and that was right when
they had just let some guys go and they obviously weren't together like they
are now. So we caught a break by playing them at maybe one of the lowest
points. And every team goes through ebbs and flows and ups and downs, but the
team I watched play tonight is hungry. They're playing with a free mind. The
basket looks big to them and certainly they're rebounding the ball like
Huggins' teams have historically done at West Virginia. Forget about the
records when Kansas and West Virginia play you usually get your money's worth
as a game and I'm sure it will be that way tomorrow night as well.  
  
Q. Did Roach seem to timid to you and how did you plan to attack him on
defense?  
BILL SELF: We didn't have a game plan to attack anybody. I was asked that
question earlier, what I would expect and I would expect nothing different
than what we have known for the last four years. I assume he's been practicing
with them. So that's a little bit different than an injury where you have been
out and you worry about conditioning and those sorts of things. But, you know,
he didn't have a great game numberswise, but he's a really good player and he
played 20 minutes and he made a big three late when we totally screwed up,
defense coming off a missed free throw. But I like Texas' team talent, and I
certainly love Kerwin's talent and I've enjoyed competing against him the last
four years. You probably wasn't, you know, maybe had his A game maybe because
of a little rust. But we didn't try to game plan for that at all.  
  
Q. Bill, I know you're focused primarily on the games, right, but how
much thought if any have you given to sort of what this weekend could do for
you guys staying closer to home next weekend, the weekend after that?  
BILL SELF: You know, Sam, in years past I've given it a lot of thought. If we
can do this or win two over here or one over here that solidifies something. I
have no idea where we are right now.  
  
I obviously think and maybe people will disagree with me, but a great showing
this weekend, I think we could at worst be a three with a great showing this
weekend, with an average showing this weekend. I don't know, 4 or 5. I have no
idea.  
  
But I do think that, you know, the ultimate goal of being in Kansas City, if
you could win two games, I think that's a little bit of a reach to be candid.
I don't think it's a reach that we could still play in Des Moines or Tulsa.
But I think things will have to happen positively for us to do that because
right now I would say the chances are we would probably be out of our area,
but I don't know. The way I understood it, or understand it is if you're a top
4 seed they try to keep you in the area. So we've got a chance to be that if
we play well the rest of the weekend. So I think that could happen, but I
think Kansas City would probably be a long shot.  
  
Q. Coach, another strong game for David McCormack, 13 points, 9
rebounds. Have you placed emphasis on getting him touches, getting him in the
rhythm, getting him going early to keep his confidence up, or is that
something that just happened in the flow of the game tonight?  
BILL SELF: If you followed us at all for the last 20 years, we love throwing
the ball inside early in the game. That's how we've always played. He's the
beneficiary of that usually. But we did want to give their bigs something to
guard. That was something we wanted to do. David has scored the ball better of
late and he's getting more and more confident and obviously playing at a much
higher level now that he's had more opportunities in the last month, month and
a half.  
  
Q. Bill, are you surprised Shaka has had more struggles getting wins,
momentum? Is there any way you could make a case for Texas getting in the NCAA
Tournament?  
BILL SELF: Well, I can make a case for Texas because I really think Texas is
one of the more talented teams in our league, without question. I think that
they played a really good schedule and they've got some wins that I could be
wrong, but was Purdue and North Carolina? So they have two of the best
nonconference wins that anybody's had all year long as a nonconference
situation and going 8-10 in the league certainly in a year where you could
have as many as eight get in, I think for sure, seven. But I think that's very
respectable without question.  
  
So Shaka hasn't had some great luck in some games. They've had some, I'm
thinking of the Baylor game. That was a game down there that they played great
in and it just kinda got away late and every team has a game or two like that.
But it seems like to me that's kinda bit them a little bit. But from the a
talent standpoint nobody is going to see Texas when they're in the tournament.
I think they're positively a tournament team. The thing you are probably
looking at from a one-loss standpoint how many teams historically have gotten
in. But you have to look at now teams who are considered bubble teams whose
conference record was 7-11, 6-12. So if you look at it that way I think there
is a strong case to be made for Texas being in the tournament.  
  
Q. Dotson and Grimes only had one turnover. They scored a lot of points.
What do you think of your freshmen in their first tournament game?  
BILL SELF: Quentin didn't have a great start early. He had maybe one point at
halftime and maybe one or two from the line. But second half he got his free
throws and made a big 3 and he got a run out. I thought he played well. I
thought Devon was solid the whole game. He played a lot of minutes. He
accepted the challenge to guard Matt, and I think it wore him down. So he
needs to get some rest, but I thought they both did well. I've got to get
Ochai playing like he was playing before, but certainly those two did well. I
thought Marcus gave us a nice lift off the bench as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Congratulations.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

### [Talen Horton-Tucker](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36762)

### [Marial Shayok](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30844)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Iowa State 83, Baylor 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, we are ready to begin with our first news conference of
the day with the Cyclones of Iowa State. Head coach, Steve Prohm, two student-
athletes, Marial Shayok and Talen Horton-Tucker. Coach, we'll call on you
first for your thoughts on today's victory.  
  
STEVE PROHM: This was obviously a great atmosphere. This is the elite
conference tournament. You know, I've coached for a long time, but I love
coming over here the last four years. Our fan base obviously travels
incredibly well, unbelievable venue. But it was a great win for us. Obviously
wish Baylor all the success in the world as they go on to the NCAA Tournament,
but this was a really good win for our team. I thought we really competed. We
kept the rebounding to -5. That was our goal. We didn't know if we could win
it, but if we kept it in a reasonable range we thought we had a good chance.
Then we did a good job outside of the initial thrust defending the 3-point
line and that was the biggest two keys to the game. Our core guys played well.
Tyrese made shots. Lindell off the bench, but collectively our team was bought
in and competed the right way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our athletes?  
  
Q. Talen, can you talk about your game and how you got it going early?
Good to see that a couple go down early?  
TALEN HORTON-TUCKER: I would say my teammates feeding me the ball, having that
confidence in me is a big thing for me as a freshman and with them passing the
ball and having the faith in me to knock down those shots is big. I credit
them for everything they did for me this year and so far up to this point.  
  
Q. For either one of you, thoughts of the next game, either a chance to
redeem yourselves against TCU or a chance for a rubber game against K-State?  
MARIAL SHAYOK: Both opponents are pretty tough. We've got to bring our A game
from here on out, the rest of the season. So whatever wins we're going to get
right tonight and lock in on the scout.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Congratulations. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, the opportunity in the next round, you went to K-State each
one on the other's home court and then you got swept by TCU which is not
normal for you guys. Your thoughts about the next round?  
STEVE PROHM: We're glad to be there. We'll watch this game this afternoon and
the assistant who has the scout he has both teams prepared and we will go back
to my room and whichever team wins start preparing for them. I thought we were
detailed today. We had several days to prepare for Baylor so obviously that
helped. As you get further in the tournament play with the quick turnarounds
you don't have as much time to process it to your kids so you gotta go off
your habits and be fundamentals. Both teams present different problems,
obviously TCU beat us twice. We didn't defend them the right way and then
Kansas State, they were able to slow the game down at our place and at their
place we were able to get the lead and make the game at a little bit faster
pace.  
  
But obviously both teams are really good and congratulations to K-State on
winning the regular season, but it will be a great atmosphere, semifinal
tournament, Big 12, it will be a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Coach, I think in the first couple of games against Baylor y'all were
like 15-41 from three. What was the difference today? Was it creating stuff?
Knocking down open jumpers? What was it?  
STEVE PROHM: You know, when you make shots life is a lot better. That's just
the reality of it. In some games you can break down to really the Baylor game
at our place last five possessions. Marial, the shots he made today he missed,
a wide-open three in the corner. Babb missed one. Marial missed a layup and a
15 footer and you loose a possession game. When this team is making shots and
competing the right way defensively it's a very good basketball team. When you
get really those three guys Talen and Tyrese and Marial 12-23, we're going to
be tough to beat if we compete the right way.  
  
Q. How inspiring was that crowd out there? It was filled with Iowa State
fans.  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, until you really get here there is really nothing like it.
As a kid, you go to these conference tournaments and in college, you know,
when I worked with a team in college you go to the conference tournaments, but
until you come here and experience Iowa State basketball and Big 12 in Kansas
City, it's really unreal. It's surreal. This is an 11:30 game on Thursday, so
you can imagine what it's going to be like tomorrow night at 6. It's
incredible. We showed our guys a hype video from a couple of seasons ago when
we were here and just the pep rallies, the hotel. We've got an elite fan base
that love their school and love their sports and have a lot of pride in their
school. You can see it by the way they come out and support it.  
  
Q. Do you think Baylor played better defense than maybe the numbers
indicate? It looked like you guys had a lot of contested shots today.  
STEVE PROHM: You know, I would have to look at the tape and see. Our biggest
thing from an offensive standpoint is more just about us, are we playing in
transition? Is the ball being moved the right way? Are we cutting the right
way? Are we playing with the right pace? When you're getting stops to hold
them to 66 is how long because it means you're getting stops and able to play
in transition. Anytime you have an opportunity to play in transition,
somebody's defense isn't going to be as good as they are when they're set up
in the half-court. Obviously you've got to attack their zone a certain way and
attack their man a certain way. We did a lot better job attacking their man
today than we have in the two previous games. Some of their physicality in the
past has bothered us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Jordan McCabe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36749)

### [Emmitt Matthews, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36792)

### [Derek Culver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36793)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia 79, Texas Tech 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined now by the student-athletes from West Virginia
University. Coach Bob Huggins will be here in just a little bit. Our student-
athletes are Derek Culver, Jordan McCabe and Emmitt Matthews, Jr. Let's go to
questions for them.  
  
Q. Derek, the rebounding was a big advantage tonight. How much did you
think you could do that against a team like this?  
DEREK CULVER: Yes, sir. I just kept faith, you know, I try to go out there and
play with energy, you know, bring energy to my team and play out there with
pride and heart and everything else that carried on which made me, you know,
go out there and rebound at a high rate.  
  
Q. This is for Emmitt, two of the last three games you've set career
highs in helping this team out. What factors do you think has led to that?  
EMMITT MATTHEWS, JR.: I think my teammates do a really good job of getting me
open. Without them I would be nothing. Coach Huggins does a really good job of
getting me in the good spots to get the right shots off and when I'm open I
just shoot it.  
  
Q. Jordan, what's the biggest difference in this team? You guys look
like you enjoy playing together. You're playing harder. What changed?  
JORDAN McCABE: You know, I can't remember exactly when it was during the
season that we kind of got everything in order and started to grow day-by-day,
but you could just feel a difference in the culture. We knew that needed to
shift in terms of our practices and all of our workouts, wherever it may be
workout, and wherever, on the court. We started to take steps and strides, and
I think to be honest we just got back to what West Virginia does. We got back
to doing the things that made us come here in the first place. We watched the
teams led by Dax, JC and guys before them, just playing extremely hard and
representing West Virginia in the right way. I think once we all bought into
that, I think a buy-in is the biggest thing you need out of a successful team
and I don't know if we had the buy-in early. But we figured that out and
that's been a testament to our success here down the stretch.  
  
Q. Derek, coming off of last night's game Texas Tech was rested coming
into this. Was it adrenaline that kicked in in the last four minutes, or what
do you think held up for you guys?  
DEREK CULVER: Yes, sir. I wouldn't necessarily say it was adrenaline. But I'll
say this has been a long season. So with that being said we have had ups and
downs and we know how it feels to be down. So when it's time to dig in and
we're in the trenches, and you've to go out with your brothers and take the
game over and no mishaps. If you take care of those, everything else will fall
into place and we were fortunate enough to come up with a W.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, we will let you go back to the locker room. Thank
you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, do you feel like you're playing with house money at this
point?  
BOB HUGGINS: We're playing to get into the NCAA Tournament is what we're
doing. We had a meeting. We sat down and talked about it and this is our
chance. Two down, two to go.  
  
Q. Bob, how frustrating was it for you this season as its lowest point?
Obviously, you guys are starting to climb out of it toward the end. Why did
that happen?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, the hardest part is, you know, we had so many injuries and
we basically lost four starters and these guys have been great. They believe
in what we're doing. They're incredibly coachable. They believe we can win. It
seems like every game somebody different steps up. Like Emmitt stepped up
today. Jermaine stepped up. Derek stepped up. Seems like every game a
different guy steps up and we're guarding better. We're guarding better and
rebounding better, and that's been a staple of what we've done over the years.  
  
Q. Coach, how would you sum up the production in the last two or three
games from Matthews?  
BOB HUGGINS: He's getting more comfortable, I think. That's the biggest thing.
He's obviously a talented kid, and he's playing with a lot of confidence. He
listens to everything and he's really learning how to move without the ball
which is critical for, you know, someone that plays his position and he's
shooting the ball better. But he puts time in. Good shooters or great shooters
always put time in, and he's be not afraid to put time in.  
  
Q. Bob, can you speak to the importance of getting out to the fast start
that you did and how that set the tone?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, it's better than a slow start, I guess. I don't know, I
thought our guys were really ready to play. They were really looking forward
to this having gotten beat up pretty good in Lubbock. They were looking
forward to the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we will let you go back to the locker room and get ready
for tomorrow.

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

### [Makai Mason](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30658)

### [Devonte Bandoo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36761)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Iowa State 83, Baylor 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined on stage by Coach Scott Drew and the Baylor
Bears, student-athletes are Devonte Bandoo and Makai Mason. Coach, we will
look to you for an opening statement?  
  
SCOTT DREW: Well, I thought first of all you really gotta credit Iowa State. I
think everybody in the league knows when they're on. They're capable of being
a Final Four team. Reminded me when I saw their game when they played at
K-State how dominant and explosive they were. As far as with our guys, one
thing I shared with them in the locker room I thought was we only had two
players in the locker room that had played in a Big 12 tournament before.
That's not a lot of experience.  
  
The great thing about it is this hopefully will help us come next week from
the standpoint the best thing the Big 12 does is runs it just like the NCAA
Tournament, everything from the police escort to the time, to the routine, and
hopefully that will allow us to have a better chance to be successful in the
next tournament. So if that happens, then this has been definitely well worth
it. Otherwise everybody hates going home after one game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Devonte and Makai.  
  
Q. Makai, how eager were you to play today and how did you feel out
there?  
MAKAI MASON: I was definitely pretty excited. Any chance you get to step out
on the court and compete is going to be fun. Especially, you know, the Big 12
Championship, just to experience that was really cool. Obviously, not the
result we were looking for but a good experience for us, and hopefully we can
build on that.  
  
Q. Makai, y'all were right there with 'em, kinda back and forth, they
ended the half on a 12-3 run. How much steam did that take out of you guys?  
MAKAI MASON: That's tough any time you are going into the half with some
momentum. That's definitely tough. But like Coach said, they're an explosive
team. When they're on, it's really tough to beat 'em. They're super talented.
They just kinda clicked tonight.  
  
Q. Devonte, when they were making shots like from the outside how hard
is that to defend and could you guys just not figure out what they were doing,
or was it just that they were hot tonight?  
DEVONTE BANDOO: Definitely they were tough to defend today. They were making a
lot of shots. When a team gets going like that it starts with, you know, them
seeing the rim at first, getting a good look, which we've got to do a better
job first half taking that away. We're in a good conference where players see
the ball going in a couple of times. They can do a spectacular thing.  
  
Q. Devonte, this is for you as well. You heard Coach say hopefully this
tournament gives you guys experience as a guy who is looking forward to March.
What do you think you got from this experience here in Kansas City so far?  
DEVONTE BANDOO: What I learned, it's physical. The refs don't call a lot. The
atmosphere is different, just something that I've got to learn from it and
build on. So I'm glad I got the chance to experience it. I wish I had
experienced it with a W, but it's something I do appreciate with this
experience.  
  
Q. For both players, obviously you guys have regrouped a couple times
this season. Didn't finish the regular season or the tournament the way you
wanted, but what do you need to do between now and next Thursday or Friday to
get ready for the NCAA Tournament?  
MAKAI MASON: We've got to recover a little bit and then just focus on our next
opponent. I know the coaching staff is going to do a great job and we gotta
lock in as players to try to get better every day. We're going to watch the
film and try to learn from it. I think the biggest thing is we can't punch
second or react to a punch. I feel like they came out first and hit us and
it's tough when you're back on your heels to respond.  
  
DEVONTE BANDOO: Absolutely, same thing. You know, we gotta go back, rebuild,
see what's ahead of us. You know, just learn from this for hopefully the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Makai, you played in the NCAA Tournament three years ago. How
exciting is this for you to get back after all the injuries you've had?  
MAKAI MASON: Yeah, like you said, it's been a pretty long road, so just to get
the chance to compete on that stage again, you know, it's what you dream for
as a kid and that's what you're, working for pretty much your whole basketball
life to this point. So just to get to that moment, especially with this team,
kinda been doubted the whole year. It's going to be a special moment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, we will let you go back to the locker room. Thank you.
Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Scott, you said before the game that first couple games y'all got
back in transition really well. Were y'all not getting back today, or was it
more just them making shots?  
SCOTT DREW: I think on turnovers, especially live ball turnovers, sometimes
it's impossible to get back. I thought 14 turnovers for us was way too many.
Then there were some other times where we didn't get back quick enough. So
credit Iowa State for pushing it and then credit them for making shots.  
  
Defensively if you can't stop people in transition it's not good and if you
can't take care of the ball they go hand-in-hand. And I thought especially in
the last 5 minutes of the first half we tried to make too many one-on-one
plays and those bad shots or turnovers led to their points as well.  
  
Q. Scott, first couple of games I think Iowa State was a combined 15 of
41 from threes. Were they doing anything differently or were they just making
shots?  
SCOTT DREW: I think they got a couple of players, Talen Horton-Tucker is one
of them. Seems like if he's on, he's on, and if he's off, he's off. The first
two times we faced them he was off and we faced him now and he was on, and I
thought that opened things up for them.  
  
Other than that, he was the major difference. Everybody else, Shayok had 20
the last time we faced him. He's a really good player. I thought defensively
he was locked in today, too.  
  
Q. Scott, I know you would prefer to have a couple more games in the
tournament, but you got pretty close to a full week now to prepare for the
NCAA Tournament. What do you want to accomplish in that time? How do you
approach it? In terms of regrouping a little bit with the way you finished,
what's your priority list?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, I think first of all you gotta look at the glass being half
full and that means Makai gets a couple days to take care of his foot. Jared
Butler, gives him a couple days to take care of his knees. Mark Vital is
nursing an injury. That will give him a couple days. That's a positive to
hopefully get healthier. The second thing besides that is hopefully we can
spend a couple of days working on executing and trying to be better
offensively and trying to get back into a rhythm. We've been so blessed in
previous years to have basically one or two starting line-ups, and it seems
like this year we've had more different line-ups, different combinations, and
I know that's been tough on the guys, tough on us. Hopefully we can keep
everybody healthy and then get back to kinda like how we were playing when we
were playing really well.  
  
I know in the Big 12 you can loose a couple games and it looks like you're not
playing well, but at Kansas we didn't play bad. Kansas State, we didn't play
bad. At Oklahoma State, you take away transition defense and we played okay.
It's not like we have been playing bad. It's just the margin of error isn't
high in this conference, and you have to be at your best to win, because you
can't rely on them having off nights. Obviously Iowa State didn't have an off
night. If we take away this experience and it helps us for the postseason
that's definitely been worth it. I know it will put a hunger in everybody now
knowing, hey, it's a great environment and we want to be there longer than 24
hours.  
  
Q. When you were set up half-court defense, did you like the way your
guys were playing? Were you contesting shots well enough?  
SCOTT DREW: Obviously not. There is always some defense breakdowns that you
can correct. Then it comes down to them making some tougher shots. I thought
because we had a couple of breakdowns because they made some shots, they got
some confidence. Then it makes it easier to make tougher shots. That's what we
allowed them to do. We allowed them to get confident so they could make
tougher shots and the tougher shots it's hard to do something about those
because if you got a good player if you're up on 'em, they can drive, which
they got guys that can do both. They can shoot and drive.  
  
So the goal is, don't give 'em anything easy so that now they're not making
those tough, contested shots so you can take away the drive.  
  
Q. Scott, because of what you already done, do you go into this weekend
feeling good about NCAA and all that?  
SCOTT DREW: I mean that's the blessing of being in the best conference in
America. You finish fourth and you finish 10-8. In the past, teams with 8 wins
have gotten in. So that's why you go through this grind is so you have a
chance to reap the spoils, and hopefully it works out that we get 80% of the
league in, if not, 70%.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck next week.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Desmond Bane](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32886)

### [Alex Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32825)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
Kansas State 70, TCU 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the TCU Horned Frogs, head coach, Jamie Dixon,
student-athletes today are Desmond Bane and Alex Robinson. Coach, we will call
on you first for an opening statement.  
  
JAMIE DIXON: Well, obviously a disappointing result for us. I mean, obviously
we had the lead, played well early. Just seemed to be the more physical team,
Kansas State. We weren't able to get it done, so congratulate them. We've been
playing good basketball. Played well for the first half and did some good
things, but eventually the turnovers got to us. Certainly proud of our guys.
Proud of how we responded, how we played good basketball down the stretch,
proud of 20 wins in a really tough conference, the toughest in the country.
We've proved that we're a very good team. However, we've come up short against
the top-10 teams, top-12 teams in the country in our league, Kansas State
specifically and Texas Tech and Kansas. But otherwise we have played well.
Disappointed to lose this game because I thought we had the opportunity to win
it.  
  
Q. For both of you, Coach mentioned the turnovers. What was K-State able
to do defensively to get you guys out of rhythm?  
ALEX ROBINSON: They do a really good job of rotating and playing the passing
lane. I felt like they did a pretty good job of that.  
  
Q. Do you have anything to add?  
DESMOND BANE: Pretty much that's it.  
  
Q. For both you guys, what allowed you to get back after I think they
pushed it back out to 9, but you cut it back down to 5 or 3 with a couple
minutes left to go?  
DESMOND BANE: Just our resilience and fight. We got a lot of fight in us. I
knew there was nobody quitting when they went on that run. We have been
preaching stick together and stay together and that's what we did. We were
able to get some stops and make a few plays on the offensive end to cut down
on the lead.  
  
Q. How stressful is the next three days going to be, whether or not you
guys make the NCAA Tournament, and do you guys feel like you've done enough?  
DESMOND BANE: I mean, it is what it is. But I feel like we've definitely done
enough. We got 20 wins in the best league in the country. That's really hard
to do. Like Coach said, 7 of our 11 losses came to top-12 teams in the
country, others on the road. So I feel like we have no real bad losses. So
playing in this league and winning 20 games I feel like we should be, we're
deserving of a tournament bid.  
  
ALEX ROBINSON: Just going off what Desmond said, we have 20 wins. We're
playing in the best conference in the country. We don't have any bad losses. I
definitely think we deserve to be in the Big Dance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys, we will let you go back to the locker room. Thank
you. We will go to questions for Coach Dixon now.  
  
Q. Coach, when they were making that 17-2 run in the second half to take
the lead and you know, the free throw bounces their way, they kick it out for
a three. At that point, how do you try and slow down their momentum?  
JAMIE DIXON: We were trying to slow it down before, we played well, did some
good things. Eventually the turnovers got to us and they got some transition
baskets, but we were emphasizing the rebounding and the numbers were gradually
going back their way. Those two things were the obvious statistics that stood
out.  
  
They just seemed to get more physical, more aggressive on our drives, on our
penetration, and, you know, they were able to keep us from getting direct line
to the basket. Then they hit a couple of shots and obviously that can kill
you. A 3 after a missed free throw can really hurt. So, you know, but the
turnovers by and large are eventually going to catch up to you and that's
where we got a lot of their baskets. In the half-court I thought we defended
well, but live ball turnovers can be baskets the other way in most situations.
They certainly got us in that area.  
  
Q. Coach, you, Desmond and Alex all mentioned this is the toughest
league in the conference. Is it the double Round Robin. What is it about this
Big 12, you obviously used to coach in the Big East. What makes this
conference tough?  
JAMIE DIXON: I think the bottom teams are as tough as the other bottom teams,
top to bottom and that's what it gets down to when you talk about the NCAA
Tournament, you get no easy wins. And then you play everybody twice. We have
seven losses versus Kansas State, Texas Tech and Kansas, games we were in and
had chances and opportunities. You don't get the unbalanced schedule. You get
maybe one of those teams once and maybe get 'em four total and we've got seven
losses against those teams and this is a neutral game. You lose on the road to
them, you feel like you could get a home win out of it. But we didn't.  
  
That's the challenge. Those are very good teams and we had some situations
where we weren't playing with obviously some number situations. But you've got
to find the way. But we did a lot of other good things, too, to obviously Iowa
State is highly ranked and we got two wins against them. But those seven
losses, pretty much everybody in the country is going to loose to those teams.  
  
Q. Coach, how much does the fatigue in a seven-man rotation factor into
this second half decline?  
JAMIE DIXON: Again, you knew they were going to make a run. They got more
physical and more aggressive. I don't know that fatigue was it. Desmond not
playing a lot in the first half, but then playing with three in the second
half. You don't want those things to happen and against them we've been in
foul trouble pretty much every game, and it amazes me. But, you know, we've
got to figure that out. They're a physical team, but yet they play very good
defense at the same time. Very good at guarding the dribble. Very strong at
the end of finishes, but I felt like we were fine with that.  
  
We were able to play guys 20 minutes or so, everybody. I thought that would
balance it out, but again, I don't think it was a fatigue thing. I just think
they just got more physical at the end and we get Desmond with three right
away in the second half and it changes a lot of things.  
  
Q. Jamie, you guys have won 2 of your last 3. If you get in, do you feel
like you can make some noise?  
JAMIE DIXON: I do feel like we've been playing well. I went through the game
last night and watched it and I thought we played, and I told our players that
we played really 74 minutes, I said 70 after the game, of really good
basketball. Then I switched it to about 74 because we had a 6-minute spell
against Oklahoma State where they seemed to be getting some second shots and
that was a turning point. I guess you could say we played 20 good minutes
here. They made the big plays. At Texas, seemed like we made those shots at
the end of the clock, you know. They get et three at the end of the half after
we score. That's momentum even though we've got the lead. Obviously they get
the three at the end and it's a 3-point game, shot fake shot. So they kinda
made some big shots. They got the guys scramble play at the end of the first
of half. The guy steps out-of-bounds, gets a layup, you know what I mean? They
made some plays at the end of the clock. But give 'em credit. The guys that
made it, the shots, were Sneed and he's an experienced guy along with those
other seniors. I know he's a junior, but he's been playing all the way
through, and to me he's a big factor of the team. He seems to be the toughest,
most physical guy they have among a bunch of tough, physical guys. He made
those big shots. I thought those two threes were the ones that got us, down a
3-point game. He shot fake shots and gets a three on it, and the end of the
half was a devastating three. You know, those are plays where you think you're
playing pretty good defense and you end up giving those up for 6 points.
That's really the difference when you can get it, get down to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll let you go. Thank you for coming.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Chris Beard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30671)

### [Jarrett Culver](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35109)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia 79, Texas Tech 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the Red Raiders from Texas Tech,
Coach Chris Beard, student-athlete with us is Derek Culver. Coach we will go
to you first for an opening statement.  
  
CHRIS BEARD: I will just answer any questions you guys have.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will go to questions for Jarrett and we'll come back for
Coach.  
  
Q. Jarrett, could you speak to the team's slow start. You guys were
playing from behind the whole game. What was the impact of that?  
JARRETT CULVER: We just didn't come out ready to play. I feel like our
leadership wasn't there today, me and some other guys got to get ready to play
a big game. We came out slow today, so we just gotta fix it.  
  
Q. Jarrett, what can you learn from this adverse situation? I know Coach
says you all can learn from that, that three-game losing streak or the one-
possession type deal that happened with y'all. What can you learn from it and
what do you take away from it?  
JARRETT CULVER: It's definitely a learning experience. We've got to come out
better and play 40 minutes. We've got to put 40 minutes together, everybody
gotta come out hard and play forty minutes.  
  
Q. Is this a dose of reality for y'all?  
JARRETT CULVER: It's definitely a learning experience. I feel like we can
learn from it. Losing hurts, but you learn from wins and losses.  
  
Q. Jarrett, last four minutes you're making your charge. They played
last night. Did you feel that your fresh legs might have had an edge before
the game was ultimately decided?  
JARRETT CULVER: I mean, in a way we did. But they came out ready to play,
credit to them. They played hard forty minutes. Credit to them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Jarrett. Thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Two things, just the start and West Virginia's rebounding veracity
and how that affected you guys early.  
CHRIS BEARD: Yeah, the story today is all about West Virginia. Give them
credit. To say that we, I disagree with Culver. He said we came out ready to
play. That's disrespecting West Virginia. They played great, won three of on
their last five, got a chemistry. Obviously some additions and subtractions
from their program and they have some guys that play with joy, and we were
concerned about this game. In no way did we take them lightly, they have a
Hall of Fame coach and really good players. West Virginia played great. Our
game plan was to try to rebound with West Virginia. In no way did we think we
could outrebound them, but we wanted to be competitive on the boards. We
worked on it for three state days. We wanted to take care of the basketball,
have a low turnover game. We did neither. So give West Virginia credit they
beat us.  
  
Q. What made 'em so hard to stop today offensively?  
CHRIS BEARD: The big thing is offensive rebounds. He created a lot of offense
for himself by getting second chance points. He's a talented guy. West
Virginia is playing loose right now. They are playing with a lot of
confidence. He's a joy to their team. I watched 'em play last night in person,
and I told our guys I think this is one of the hottest teams in college
basketball. It wouldn't surprise me if they won this tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, with Jarrett's last shot was that what you looking for there?
What was the game plan going down the stretch with obviously that one-
possession game with West Virginia?  
CHRIS BEARD: You know, I got a lot on my mind right now, so I don't want to be
wrong. But you're talking about when they were up three?  
  
Q. The last Derek Culver shot.  
CHRIS BEARD: I understand, Carlos, they were up three?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
CHRIS BEARD: So, in that time you come down it's always about time and score.
If you can take the quick two, you do. But I thought, you know, one of our
best players, the most valuable player in the Big 12 gets a relatively open
look for three. So I thought Jarrett made a good decision on that possession.
I want him to take that shot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [Kristian Doolittle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34843)

### [Christian James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30613)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia 72, Oklahoma 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are ready to begin with the Oklahoma Sooners, Coach Lon
Kruger and the two student-athletes, Christian James and Kristian Doolittle.
Coach, we will turn to you first for an opening statement.  
  
LON KRUGER: Obviously, a disappointing loss. I thought West Virginia really
dictated on the boards. We had trouble keeping them from second shots,
especially late in the ball game. That's always a big factor when you play
West Virginia and I thought they, again, won that battle with us. Again, had
some opportunities early in the second half there to widen it out and couldn't
quite do that. Again, both teams battled, and we didn't make the play at the
end. As many plays at the end as they did.  
  
Q. Christian, obviously this game had a lot of similarities to the last
time you played West Virginia with the Buddy Hield review, what was going
through your head as you took the shot?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Felt good. I tried to create space and get a good look. I
didn't know my foot was on the line. It was a tough moment, just like my
freshman year.  
  
Q. That team in 2016 did go on a Final Four run. What do you have to do
to get past this and prepare for a possible NCAA Tournament berth?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Got to play together, play together more. West Virginia did a
great job on the boards. We gotta clean it up a lot. We've got to play hard.
We gotta play hard, play together and make plays. March is all about making
plays down the stretch and that's something we have to do. My teammates have
been working so hard to get to this point, and it's in God's hands whether we
get a bid or not.  
  
Q. Kristian, besides the rebounding where did you think you let it get
away tonight?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: I would say we were lacking emotion and fight from the
beginning of the game, which is something that can't happen. We were playing
catch-up. We knew going into this game that West Virginia was going to be
crashing the glass and playing really hard. That's what they pride themselves
on. We weren't ready to master energy and create our own energy. To hit them
first was something we talked about at the beginning of the game. Something
that we can't do. We've got to hold each other accountable, something that the
coaches can't always do. They can't always bring all the energy and that's
something we have to change before our next game.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, Kristian mentioned most people have the NCAA
Tournament, does this result not tonight bring any doubt into your mind? Are
you worried about that? Do you think you're safely in?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: It's not something I'm too worried about. I've never paid
attention to the outside noise of if we're in or out. We've got to focus on
the game at hand. We had it in our hands to fully seal it and not to leave
doubt in anybody's mind, but now we have to wait for someone else to decide
for us.  
  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: I hope we're in. Like I said, we've worked so hard to get to
this game and this game could have sealed the deal and my teammates have
worked on hard and I just want to see them get a chance to see what it's like
to go to the NCAA Tournament. It's going to be a stressful couple of days, a
lot of praying and hope we get a bid and go far in the tournament. Make a run.  
  
Q. Kristian, what was going through your mind when that shot went up and
they were reviewing that final play?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: Knowing that he got the shot off in time they were going
to check to see if it was actually a three. That's why they have instant
replays, to make sure they get the right call. It just didn't go our way this
time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, guys. Thank you. Questions for Coach Kruger?  
  
Q. Lon, do you agree with Doo's assessment that they just didn't bring
the fight tonight? If so, how do you explain that in the month of March?  
LON KRUGER: He's referencing the thing we talked about a lot, fighting on the
boards. We got whipped on the boards. Yeah, we didn't do what we had to do on
the boards, and they beat us up pretty good. Seemed like every missed shot
especially in the last four minutes they got those shots back. So that was a
major topic of conversation throughout the preparation of the game and the
game itself so we lacked the -- we didn't win that battle, I'll put it that
way.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you tell your team that they still may have more
basketball left but having to endure this heart breaker?  
LON KRUGER: We had a lot of opportunities and advantage plays in transition
that we didn't finish. You've got to finish those. But, again, it came down to
primarily winning the rebound battle, and we didn't do that.  
  
That was the major thing coming out of it when you talk to them. Can't change
that in this ball game, but we've got to learn from it going forward.  
  
Q. Coach, you scheduled pretty aggressively in the nonconference to give
yours a really strong strength of schedule. Do you think you've done enough to
get into the NCAA Tournament because of that?  
LON KRUGER: You know, based on what people say, again, the parameters are all
30 games count the same. It doesn't matter if it's conference or
nonconference. So given that, you know, based on projections it appears so.
But we won't know that for sure until Sunday. But, yeah, those are the rules
going in and our guys won a lot of ball games. But like to have won a couple
more.  
  
Q. Lon, that Christian shot was right in front of you. Did you know
before they went to the review his toe was on the line?  
LON KRUGER: No, not at all. Even in the review it looked like the pump fake he
was behind the line and when he did pump fake he moved it every so slightly to
get on the line. No, I didn't know at the time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, we'll get you go. Thank you.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

### [Lamont West](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35161)

### [Jordan McCabe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36749)

### [Jermaine Haley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36750)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
West Virginia 72, Oklahoma 71  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the Mountaineers from West Virginia, Coach Bob
Huggins. Our student-athletes are Jordan McCabe, Jermaine Haley and Lamont
West. We will go directly to questions for our three student-athletes. Then
welcome back for Coach Huggins.  
  
Q. What's the feeling like for this team having gone through what all
you've gone through this year and come down here and keep the season going
another day?  
LAMONT WEST: I just think that our goal was to come out here and play hard,
and we wanted to give it all we got because we didn't want to go home early. I
feel like it's the start of a new season even though it's the tournament or
whatever we came out here and we knew it was 0-0. We just wanted to come out
here and play as hard as we can.  
  
JORDAN McCABE: We have been talking about it since mid-season, where we were
in the standings and everything like that. We knew our only chance to make the
postseason or the NCAA Tournament was going to be this tournament right here.
We came in knowing that we had nothing to lose, so that meant we should play
as hard or harder than everybody else in this tournament, so it was good to
see us doing that out there today.  
  
Q. What's going through your guys' mind when they were going through
that review? Did you see it on the floor that his foot was on the line, or did
you have to wait like everybody else?  
JERMAINE HALEY: I'm going to be honest. I thought we were only up 2 points, so
I don't know if you guys seen me in the end. I was on the ground thinking that
we lost. Luck was on our side. He had his foot on the line and even if the
game went into overtime we would have been prepared to play another couple
minutes.  
  
LAMONT WEST: I didn't want to foul him. I had my hand in there and I was
thinking of practice. I can't let him shoot it, but we've been jumping at
those puff fakes all day. I knew he was going to do something so I just had to
stay on the ground and he hit it. I was nervous. I thought we was going to
overtime, honestly.  
  
Q. Jermaine, you guys sorta spurted away 10 minutes to go or so in the
game, took command and sorta took control. What happened midway through the
second half that allowed you guys to get control of that game?  
JERMAINE HALEY: I think rebounding the ball. We outrebounded them by 10, and
staying aggressive in the second half. We had a couple of mental errors not
getting back on defense in the first half, and I think we cleaned them up in
the second half.  
  
Q. Lamont, the last few weeks it seems like guys like Jordan, Jermaine
and Derek have carried the load on offense. They weren't hitting the first
half and things were going well for you. Did you feel when you saw things
weren't going well for them that maybe there was added pressure on you that
you needed to do something?  
LAMONT WEST: No, I didn't really feel like it was pressure. I feel like since
I'm one of the older people on the team I feel like I've got a certain
responsibility and I wanted to keep them in the game and keep everybody
involved. I didn't want to do anything different. I just wanted to tell them
to keep their head up and stay in the game and stuff like that, especially DC
because he had no fouls. I just wanted to keep everybody's head locked in.  
  
Q. Next opponent, Texas Tech, what's the first thing that comes to your
mind when you think of that team?  
LAMONT WEST: We owe Texas Tech.  
  
JORDAN McCABE: Texas Tech is a very good team. We know obviously from the
regular season what they did to us at home where we thought we had a chance to
win the game. We went to their place and it kinda got out of control. So the
biggest thing is we're a completely different team from when we were playing
in Lubbock. I think all the guys in the locker room know that and just like
going in this first game against Oklahoma our mindset was it is a new season.
We've kinda been waiting for it because we've gotten better each and every day
since we've got things figured out as a team. With Texas Tech obviously a
really good team. We're going to go in there and compete just like we did
tonight.  
  
Q. Lamont, what was your response?  
LAMONT WEST: We owe them.  
  
Q. Own or owe them?  
LAMONT WEST: We owe them. They beat us last time.  
  
Q. And Jermaine, playing in that west Texas area, is there anything
special for you about playing a west Texas team?  
JERMAINE HALEY: No, it's just another game.  
  
Q. You guys shot thirty 3-pointers tonight. What was it that made you
want to keep shooting from outside so much?  
LAMONT WEST: Honestly, we only supposed to shoot about 20 a game. So we might
get in trouble for that. But, no, I feel like the coaches have a lot of
confidence in us to make a lot of shots and they was open, so we was just
takin' them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, congratulations. Thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Bob, that ending got to bring up memories of the last time you played
Oklahoma in the tournament, the Buddy Hield game.  
BOB HUGGINS: Uh-huh.  
  
First thing I did was look over and see if Fran Fraschilla jumped up on the
table and screaming, healed! Healed! Ripping his shirt open, a real non-biased
announcer. That's what we like.  
  
Q. Bob, Culver was in foul trouble most of the game and yet you still
won. How satisfying was it to win knowing you can get very little out of him
tonight?  
BOB HUGGINS: Those other two guys, Andrew just started playing basketball. So
he's going to make some mistakes and we realize that. Logan has been in the
program. This is his fourth year. I thought he did a really good job on trying
to stay in front of him. That was really good to see.  
  
I mean, obviously we gotta have some confidence in them, because we're going
to play 'em. They gotta play. We want to I think at Baylor and those guys
played a lot of minutes. Derek was in foul trouble there as well.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think of your defense, final few minutes of the
game, particularly that steal by Brandon Knapper that led to do a Derek Culver
put back that put you up by three?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, we're getting better. They've been looking at a little bit
of film of kinda what we did before, where we made every pass hard and we had
good ball pressure. You've got to understand these guys really are just --
they played half of a year. Because they didn't really play when those other
guys were around. They played a little but they didn't play very much. And
Derek didn't play at all the first semester of the school.  
  
They're having fun. They're having fun and they're playing hard. They're
excited about playing together, and they're trying to do the things that we
ask them to do that we had other guys do. I think when you're playing four
freshmen like we are if they continue to get better I think it bodes well for
the following years.  
  
Q. Coach, next opponent, Texas Tech, what comes to your mind when you
think about that match-up?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, they're really good. What do they got the number one ranked
defense in the country, something like that. Culver is the Player of the Year
in the league, so obviously they're very talented. I think Chris is the two-
time Coach of the Year in the league. So they've got a lot of components.
We're just going to play hard and see what happens. We played them really well
in Morgantown. It was a really close game. Hopefully it's a real close game
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Lamont talked about owing Texas Tech. Is it easy for you guys to get
past a game like that when it's possibly fresh in their minds?  
BOB HUGGINS: I don't know what Lamont thinks, man? Why do you ask me what
Lamont thinks? I don't know if Lamont knows what Lamont thinks. I don't know.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously with the season that you've had this year, how does
it feel to come into the conference tournament and get a win?  
BOB HUGGINS: Well, it feels good anytime you win, I think. I think when you've
done this as long as I have and as long as Lon has, winning is a kind of a
relief and losing is like a near-death experience, you know? I'm relieved.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot has been made about your young players stepping up, but
at times tonight the veterans like Logan and Lamont carried you. Can you
explain your thoughts on how those three including Chase played tonight?  
BOB HUGGINS: I thought they played well. I thought they played hard. We went
through a spell, which is uncharacteristic of us. I didn't think we played
very hard and we had some breakdowns. They scored 24 points in the paint the
first half and that's unacceptable and that's pretty much what we talked about
at halftime was making sure we get back and find a man.  
  
They're getting better, you know. It's a learning, and growing experience, I
think. Somebody asked me why is Jordan playing better? He's not looking over
his shoulder now, not looking to see who is behind him to come in. You've got
to play with confidence, and he's always had confidence. But he went through a
tough spell where he just didn't make any shots and turned it over too much
and couldn't find his man, you know? He can find his man now. I keep telling
him it's the one with the different color shirt on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much. Congratulations.

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [Kouat Noi](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36740)

### [Alex Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32825)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
TCU 73, Oklahoma State 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: The TCU Horned Frogs have arrived in the interview room. We
have Coach Jamie Dixon and we will have three student-athletes, Desmond Bane,
Kouat Noi and Alex Robinson. Coach, we will turn to you first for an opening
statement. Congratulations on your victory tonight.  
  
JAMIE DIXON: Thank you. It's a great win for us obviously getting 20 wins and
for our seniors an opportunity again to play against one of the teams that won
the league. Excited about how we played. Obviously, first half we did exactly
what we wanted to do. But as you know, they're a tough team, playing well,
Oklahoma State and came back and battled, not at all surprised by that. I
think I could have done a better job of sustaining our aggressiveness both
offensively and defensively, so put that on me for their comeback. I thought
we moved the ball the first half and got a change to the other side of the
floor against their defense, but defensively is what we got going and
obviously shot 35%, outrebounded by 2. That's where everybody is best. It's a
great win for us and certainly an opportunity to go play tomorrow.  
  
Q. Desmond, take us through that last 3-pointer and what you kinda saw
and how you guys kept your composure when they were making the late charge?  
DESMOND BANE: We've been here before, as far as keeping our composure. We've
got a lot of guys that have played a lot of those games and on my last play I
got downhill and I kicked it down to him and he kicked it back to me and I was
open and just shot it.  
  
Q. Guys, for all of you, what was the thought when the lead was
shrinking down? How were you trying to stay together and trying to get through
and get that win?  
KOUAT NOI: We just wanted to keep the momentum going, un, get stops and that's
what we did and we came back with the win.  
  
ALEX ROBINSON: What Kouat said. We just wanted to stay locked in and made sure
we stayed together. We knew they were making a run. We wanted to make sure we
stopped it and turned it around.  
  
DESMOND BANE: For sure. A team like that they're going to hit shots and part
of it was our defense and part of it was them hitting shots, but we kept our
composure and was able to finish it out.  
  
Q. Alex, you guys had a be 21-point lead. But your offense stagnated
down the stretch. How much was Yor Anei and the way he protected the rim. I
think he got 4 blocks in the last 7 minutes.  
ALEX ROBINSON: He did a great job of staying down and getting blocks and I
felt like a lot of it was us on the stagnant part we weren't moving and
cutting it and that's on us and he's a great defense player and he's going to
make a lot of noise in this league.  
  
Q. Kouat, you were able to score 14 in the first half, 20 in the game.
After only scoring 4 over the last week what allowed you to snap out of your
shooting slump today?  
KOUAT NOI: Like we said earlier, passing the ball, moving the ball. I give
credit to my teammates for helping me when I was open and that's how it
happened.  
  
Q. For all of you guys, short turnaround for K-State and with the depth
how do you guys think you will be able to bounce back tomorrow?  
DESMOND BANE: Thanks to Coach Dixon we practiced hard every day and there is
nothing like it. We'll be ready.  
  
KOUAT NOI: What was the question again?  
  
Q. The short turnaround and the depth you guys have, coming back
tomorrow?  
KOUAT NOI: We're going to be ready to play tomorrow for sure.  
  
ALEX ROBINSON: Yeah, yeah, yeah what Kouat and Des said. We'll be ready. We've
been here before. We have a lot of experience. So this is nothing new to us
and we will be ready to go.  
  
Q. For all of you, how much does Dean Wade likely not playing for
K-State tomorrow affect the way you go into this game against Kansas State?  
DESMOND BANE: Every team in the league is good so you prepare and think the
same way regardless who is going to be out there. We're here all high, major
basketball players so we gotta prepare the same way we would as if he was
playing.  
  
ALEX ROBINSON: Yeah, what Des said.  
  
DESMOND BANE: Hey, bra!  
  
ALEX ROBINSON: It's true. We're going to prepare for them like we prepare for
any team, whether Dean Wade plays or not, we still need to prepare for Kansas
State. They beat us twice so we need to come out and play hard.  
  
Q. Since it will be what Des says, I will ask Des, what did K-State do
well against you guys? You struggled to score against them in the two matches
earlier. What can you guys do to combat that and get a little more offense?  
DESMOND BANE: They're a good defense team. As soon as we played them we made a
few adjustments. And we didn't have this guy the first time we played them.
But they got us at home so we gotta come out and play harder than them
tomorrow from start to finish.  
  
Q. Being down 21 points and then having the lead cut back to a tie game
and eventually losing the lead, what does it say with your toughness and
wherewithal to finish?  
KOUAT NOI: Coach is always preaching toughness at every practice, so we
knocked it down and got stops toward the end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Guys, thank you. We will let you go back to the locker room.
Congratulations. We will see you tomorrow. Coach?  
  
Q. Two questions, first of all, does this give you a spot in the NCAA
Tournament?  
JAMIE DIXON: 20 wins in the Big 12, toughest conference in the country and we
played a tough nonconference, so I would think so. But you never know what
plays out in the other things, but given that's a safe bet in history and I
would say as things have played out in history this year, and clearly with the
different conferences and our conference clearly being the best we've put
ourselves in a good spot.  
  
Q. Kansas State held you to your two lowest scoring games of the season.
Talk about playing their defense with short rest?  
JAMIE DIXON: Kouat didn't play in that game at their place. It was a close
game. We had six guys. This time we will bring out 7, and we will be ready to
play. As I told our guys it's an opportunity to play the team that won the
league and beat us twice and we're looking at it as a great opportunity. We
think we can win two in a row. We think we're playing a little better defense.
I think we were very good on offense. They're a team that's dangerous because
of the threes and they're going to keep playing and they've been in this
position before. It was almost like it was scripted and we just handled it
better offensively, and we played really well and I'm good in the last 10
minutes. We've got to handle those things better.  
  
Q. Jamie, going off that, I guess you guys have built big leads and seen
'em come down this season. Is there anything specifically you need to do?  
JAMIE DIXON: Sometimes I think we could have played more guys, when I say more
guys, more minutes for the other two guys. That might have been something that
could have helped us. I thought it was good for us against Texas that we had
fresher guys out there, especially our guards. But it just didn't work out
that way today. Again, I was not at all surprised. I figured there was no way
we could sustain what we were doing in the first half, nobody can. You get a
20-point lead and they're going to make a run. I felt I could have done a
period of time job offensively getting us into different things. But, again,
you miss free throws, we got some drives to the basket we didn't convert and a
lot of it came from there. We're not perfect.  
  
Q. So toward the end of the game obviously the lead was starting to
dwindle down. What were you telling your players in the timeouts?  
JAMIE DIXON: You know, we just -- I mean, there was obviously it was a long
game and we had the big lead, but there was times when you knew they were
going to make the run, I thought we could have handled some things, we throw
it out of bounds, we have a layup and we use our inside hand and it gets a
block when it should have been a layup. We've got to do things better. I think
we've done some things better defensively in the last seven, eight days and
maybe in this last lesson that we got to finish and sustain and discipline in
what we're doing. But I've got to do a better job as far as running plays out
of timeouts and we've got to do a better job than that execution and down the
stretch. I think that would be a big thing for us. We've got to make some free
throws. A lot of times it's been we missed free throws in some of these
situations.  
  
It's an interesting thing because Kevin doesn't shoot it well, we want to have
him on the floor. But at the same time he's shooting free throws, it's almost
a turnover on good offense.  
  
Q. Jamie, came question I asked Alex about the impact on the comeback
for Oklahoma?  
JAMIE DIXON: He was big, especially in the second half. He got a bunch of
layups. At our place he killed us. He made some thoughts. I don't think he's
made any since, but he's obviously very good. He plays very hard, makes free
throws or at least he does against us. He changed a lot of those shots. I say
that we didn't run great offense, but we didn't get layups that we got in the
first half that seemed to be shot-blocked late in the game. Give him credit
for that. We've got to do a better job. We got a 3-second call so some turn
overs and not changed shots by him.  
  
Q. You talked about K-State's defense. What challenges do they have for
you guys tomorrow?  
JAMIE DIXON: The oldest team in the country, experience is good and both of
these teams that won the league, Texas Tech and K-State have played like the
oldest teams because they are the oldest teams, both well-coached and
defensively they're very good and very physical. Amazed at how physical they
are. Kansas State, they push you around, they bang, they reach, they get hands
on balls. So those are the things that they do really well, but I think we're
a better team know, but, you know, we've got to do it for forty minutes but
everybody runs through these things where they can't sustain, forty minutes,
play their best basketball. There ain't no blowouts in this thing. It's what
it is. It's good teams in the best league.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Mike Boynton, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36738)

### [Curtis Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32202)

### [Yor Anei](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36739)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
TCU 73, Oklahoma State 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: The Cowboys of Oklahoma State have joined us with Coach Mike
Boynton, Jr. and his student-athletes are Curtis Jones and Yor Anei. Coach, we
will turn to you for an opening statement first.  
  
MIKE BOYNTON, JR.: First of all, congrats to TCU, obviously played really well
to start the game. Put us in a really, really deep hole. Really controlled
most of the game to be honest. We made a really good comeback. So I'm proud of
our kids for not giving in. It's been the theme of our season in a lot of
ways, but happy I had the opportunity to coach these guys and looking forward
to getting back and trying to figure out how to be better.  
  
Q. Yor, can you talk about that stretch down the end of the game, last
7, 8 minutes when you guys took over defensively and the way you were able to
protect the rim and knock back some shots?  
YOR ANEI: It just felt normal to me. I was trying to block everything that
came to the rim and I was trying to get the stops for our team that we needed
to win us the game.  
  
Q. Curtis, you guys are down 21. It's not been a great season. How did
you find the fortitude to hang in there and be able to make a rally and take
the lead?  
CURTIS JONES: I think that's something we've done all year is continue to
fight. We came in at halftime Coach said continue to fight. We didn't want our
season to end that way, and I think we kept fighting and cutting the lead and
kept playing for each other. It didn't finish the way we wanted it to, but I
think we went in with a little momentum.  
  
Q. Yor, for most of the game they did control it, but what switched in
your mind and in the players' minds to get you guys going in the second
half?  
YOR ANEI: Coach had, like, came in during halftime and really got us fired up
and ready to play like we should have from the beginning, but he reminded us
what we were playing for. We were playing for the program and it's bigger than
basketball. We were representing Oklahoma State and that's what got us fired
up.  
  
Q. Curtis, can you talk about what you've seen out of Yor and his
development this year, how he went from not playing a lot early and the kind
of player he's become down the stretch?  
CURTIS JONES: Yeah, he's made a big jump this year, his willingness to learn,
come to work every day, have a great attitude about the right things. That's
what I've seen from him and then just as the year got o he got more
comfortable and you got to see the growth. Excited to see him as we go into
next year and as he continues to grow.  
  
Q. For both players, can you talk about the difficulty of this season
and how you think the adversity you've gone through is going to pay off in the
future for you guys in the program?  
CURTIS JONES: Yeah, we went through a lot of adversity this season, but I
think it will make us stronger. One thing we never did is never gave up. We
came to work every day. I think as the year went on we got more comfortable
with each other, got more familiar and I think going into next year we can use
this to really try to help us and have a great season next year.  
  
YOR ANEI: Yeah, with all the adversity, going through like our Coach told us
"adversity introduces a man to himself," so it was part of all of us growing
up.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Curtis and Yor, we will let you go back to the locker room.
Thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, talk about how big having 5 double digit scorers was. As the
game started and you guys got a slow start but talk about ball movement and
how big that was?  
MIKE BOYNTON, JR.: Honestly, we're a team that the whole is better than the
parts. For us to have success this season, we had to have multiple guys play
well. We didn't have that in the first half, obviously, so we were down, big.
Really kind of turned it on and our balance showed there. Lindy obviously made
a lot of plays. Yor made some. Isaac Likekele made some. Cameron made a big
shot. Kind of a summary of our season. Got down big, face an uphill battle and
the kids just kept competing because that's what they do.  
  
Q. Mike, you played such great defense the last six, seven minutes, but
it looked like a breakdown on TCU's last possession. From your perspective
what happened on that play?  
MIKE BOYNTON, JR.: I will be honest, I don't know, it's hard for me to say
right now. There was a breakdown somewhere in the communication. I don't know
exactly who was involved because we were switching a lot in that possession.
We wanted to avoid exactly what happened, which was Bane specifically getting
a rhythm jump shot there. I'll have to go back and watch the film, and I would
be more than happy to get back for you on it. But you've got to give credit to
the kid. He still has to make the shot. So credit goes to him and his
teammates for being able to make the big shot and be able to move on.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk about how you've seen the players grow through
all that they've gone through this season and having such a short roster and
how they have, I would assume, come together as a unit?  
MIKE BOYNTON, JR.: Yeah, those are the type of things that give you a chance
at life, really. What they've gone through basically is what a lot of people
go through, adverse times.  
  
You really find out about yourself when things aren't as easy as you hoped
they would be. What I learned about this team is they are guys that love to
compete. They love each other. They love representing this program and the
school and I'm certainly proud to have been there with them the whole way. We
chartered some rocky waters this year, but every day they showed up with a
good attitude. They stuck together. No one pointed fingers at one another and
there was a reason why here in the last two weeks we've played better
basketball. They've gotten really comfortable with one another and they've
laid it on the line for each other.  
  
Q. Coach, your guys obviously had times during this game where they
could have just said we're going to give it up and call it a season, but they
didn't do that. What's this say about your players and does it surprise you
that they kept fighting like that?  
MIKE BOYNTON, JR.: Doesn't surprise me. Again, I've been with these guys since
June. I've watched how we've transformed, a lot of positive. But certainly
there has been some negativity also, some things that we were not necessarily
happen that happened during the season, but I never came to practice and felt
like the guys didn't want to be there or didn't care it about one another and
what we were trying to accomplish. The record doesn't indicate that this
season was a success at all, and I wouldn't stand here and tell you I'm proud
of being 12-20.  
  
But I do believe the way we got better, the way our kids played gives me hope
that, you know, everybody talks about the future but the future is here. Now.
One of them was sitting right next to me. So we're excited about what we can
become as we get back in the off-season and figure out how to get better for
next year.  
  
Q. A few weeks ago when we were talking, we were talking about most
programs need a star and I asked you where one was coming from and you said,
well, I might have one in Anei. Is that what you were talking about? The way
he played the last 20 minutes?  
MIKE BOYNTON, JR.: Yeah, really, and a lot of the last part of the season.
This is not against players I don't know how many times we have had a player
lead in blocks and not get any recognition, not even an honorable mention and
that's not saying that the players who made it weren't deserving. But we think
we have one that may be a little more deserving as well. I'm excited about
what he can become, he's really just scratching the surface, Barry of what he
can become. A lot of times he's playing on I think not something. He's got to
develop in the weight room and develop a go-to inside and the instincts he has
from a shot-blocking stand oint you can't teach and it's a game changer for
the other teams in terms of game preparation. So it's a good start with when
you have a 7-foot kid in there who can change the game without scoring a
basket.  
  
Q. Toward the end of the game you were forcing a lot of turnovers,
scoring a lot of points which is the complete opposite of the beginning of the
game. What were you seeing out of your players at the end of the game where
you went on a large run and got those turnovers?  
MIKE BOYNTON, JR.: I think a sense of urgency kicked in. We knew coming in,
our season is over when we lose here. It's that simple. I think these guys
cared enough about each other that they wanted to play together again. So they
played with a great sense of urgency in the last ten minutes and if maybe we
had played that way for the first 30 we wouldn't have been down so big. It's
water under the bridge. It's something to learn from. This whole season has
been a learning experience for all of us, and I'm just really proud that I had
the opportunity to coach this group.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 23, 2019

  

### [Bruce Weber](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14492)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
BRUCE WEBER: Obviously we're all excited to be here, start of the season,
earlier than ever for us. We open up our first exhibition game Friday night,
another one, then open up November 5th.  
  
For us as a team, it's an interesting season. Obviously we lost a lot of
points, rebounds, assists, steals, everything that you could have to deal with
as a coach. But we do have some experience back. Three guys that started on an
Elite 8 team, started on a Big 12 championship team. I wouldn't say we're as
much a young team as we are a new team.  
  
We have to go through some growing situations as a new team trying to figure
out roles, who is going to get the extra minutes, who is going to be the guy
putting up the shots.  
  
I think my biggest fear is the gut-check part of games, the close games, who
is going to make those plays. The last two, three years it went to Barry
Brown, Dean Wade, Kam Stokes stepped up, made shots. Now we have to have some
other people do that.  
  
It will be interesting. It's fun. We have a great group. They play their butts
off. We're looking forward to Friday night, see what our guys are like in the
live competition.  
  
Q. In a game like Friday, this team is not young, but different and new,
what are you looking to accomplish?  
BRUCE WEBER: Big thing is just getting in front of people, play against
somebody else. We'll probably script the minutes more than anything, I would
hope, to get some guys experience, maybe the second one try to get into
rotations so you're ready for the game on November 5th.  
  
I know they're looking forward to it. We had the live scrimmage the other day
before the football game, which was good to play in front of people. When you
have new guys, the freshmen, you have guys that are more in the focal point of
our team, it's a little different.  
  
I think playing in front of a crowd will be a positive thing for us to learn
and grow.  
  
Q. We didn 't get a chance to talk to you when the polls were out. You
were ninth in the pre-season poll. You're the defending Big 12 champions.  
BRUCE WEBER: The predictions, obviously it's not great for your fans and
selling tickets. At the same time, for us, it doesn't matter. Every year
there's somebody that's picked eighth or ninth, seventh that ends up being in
the top of the league, that ends up, like Texas Tech, playing for a national
championship. Whatever it might be, its always happens.  
  
The other year we were picked eighth, ended up in the Elite 8. It doesn't
matter. It's what happens every day in practice, our guys' mindset, their
belief, their confidence, their growth is so important.  
  
Q. You had some guys recently, Xavier, the latest go through the NBA
Draft process. For a coach, what kind of things do you hope they 're going to
hear that's going to make them better when they decide not to stay in the
draft?  
BRUCE WEBER: I think it is a stressful situation. I kept talking to Xavier
about just smiling, enjoying the process, enjoying college. He has a chance to
get a business degree, and leave a legacy at K-State.  
  
At the same time, I know what his dreams and goals are, like a lot of the
guys. You hope you get good feedback. I think that's the one thing I'll get
the feedback from, from the different scouts or coaches, player personnel
people that I know at different teams.  
  
Coming from me to them, I'm not sure they always trust it. That's a tough
thing. I guess my hope would be the NBA, when they go through this process,
that they would give them better feedback, whether it's an email or whatever.  
  
I've been through it a long time, kids putting their names in. I've learned to
be positive about it, let them enjoy it, because I got into as a young coach,
Why are you doing this? It's dumb. They're telling us this. Then you lose your
relationship with the young man, with the family.  
  
You try to be as positive as possible, talk to them, help them grow, learn and
get something out of it. It's hard. It's hard for him to come back. He was
stressed. It was a long stretch. He did a bunch of workouts that wore him out.  
  
Even coming back now, there's a lot of pressure on him. He has dreams and
goals, but I keep talking about enjoy it, make the most of every day. Worry
about the process, don't worry about the destination. If you do that, it's
meant to be, it's going to happen.  
  
Everybody's path -- had Rodney McGruder go through the G League, end up on a
roster, now a three-year $50 million contract. I've seen a lot of things
happen. If you believe you're good enough, put the time in, the work in, good
things will happen.  
  
Q. Did you learn anything from coaching USA Basketball? Did you bring
anything different from that to this upcoming season?  
BRUCE WEBER: I was pretty happy and pleased, obviously not only won a gold, we
won by a big margin, if you look at the plus-minus. Somebody asked me this a
while ago. What we do is good, and it works.  
  
I think the thing I learned, you're always learning as a coach, trying to
figure out roles. We had to do this in two weeks, get them to not only figure
out a role, take pride in the role and make the most of that. It wasn't easy.  
  
The guys we had from the Big 12 on our team were unbelievable, Tyrese, Isaac
were unbelievable role models, they were great leaders, they really helped us.
Kept trying to help me as a coach. Stay patient, we'll be okay (smiling).  
  
It was obviously a great experience. To be part of that, you know, a little
bit of the fast pace of FIBA basketball is different.  
  
I think as a coach you're always learning things. We've added some new sets
that we saw that the international teams have used. I think all of that is a
positive thing.  
  
Just a great experience. I'm sure those guys, if you talked to them, lifetime
memories. Got to be very proud they have a gold medal.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 23, 2019

  

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
SHAKA SMART: Super excited to be here. Our guys have been working their butts
off in practice. We finally got a chance to play against somebody else the
other day in a scrimmage.  
  
We're certainly excited about November 5th when we open up.  
  
Our guys ended the year really, really on a strong note last year, winning our
last five games. That's some momentum we've worked to build on in the off-
season. I have three guys up here with me today, Jase Febres, Matt Coleman,
and Courtney Ramey. They're going to be the foundation of a lot of the things
we do, being our back court.  
  
We got three new players, Will Baker, Kai Jones, and Donovan Williams, who
we're very excited about. They're very green, but very talented. I think they
can impact our team in a positive way.  
  
The key for our team is going to be just building a higher level of
consistency than we've had, which I think our experience will help us with.  
  
Q. Could you update us on Andrew Jones, what role do you think he might
be able to play this year?  
SHAKA SMART: He's doing really, really well. He practiced with us all year
last year, but was still in the process of receiving periodic treatments. At
times he would have to have what's called a PIC line, which is a permanent IV
in his arm, even during the season. That didn't really allow him to play last
year.  
  
Completed both semesters, did really well academically. He was with our team
throughout the year, was with our team all summer. Had a couple more
treatments that he underwent over the summer.  
  
Andrew is such a competitor, he's out there working his tail off in workouts
even with that PIC line in his arm. But his last treatment ended in September
just before we started practice, so it was really, really good timing just
from the standpoint of him being able to be full go with our team, with our
guys in practice as we got started on September 24th.  
  
His plan is to play this year. He's definitely played well enough in practice
to be a guy that gets significant minutes for us. Actually led us in scoring
the other day when we had a scrimmage. We're excited about the progress he can
make.  
  
Certainly there's an understanding that he still has to continue along the
process that he's on. We don't want to put any type of pressure on him to be
exactly right back where he was before he got diagnosed. We really believe
he's going to be able to help our team. He's a terrific shooter, can put the
ball in the basket and he has great experience.  
  
Q. When you look back at last year, especially some of those tougher
games, what are the things you think you did last year that you have to
correct to get the positive outcome?  
SHAKA SMART: Well, I think that our team is going to go as our back court
goes. Obviously we've had younger point guards the last few years. We have
more experience at that spot than we've had. Hopefully that will really bode
well for us this season.  
  
Matt Coleman and Courtney Ramey are guys that had very good seasons at times
last year, but we just have to be more consistent.  
  
One of the plays that Curtis was showing up here a little earlier when he was
going through his officials review was against Baylor at Baylor. That game is
a great example. Matt and Courtney played really, really well throughout that
game. But as a team we didn't close it out. They were able to come back, force
overtime and beat us.  
  
Those are the types of games that if you want to compete to be at or near the
top of this league, you have to win those games. You've played well enough to
put yourself in position to win, now you just got to bring 'em home.  
  
Q. In the back Matt was talking about Coach Hudy, what her past
experience being brought into the team has meant. What do you think she 's
brought so far, just changing the mindset in any way?  
SHAKA SMART: Been terrific. She's as good as anyone there is in this
profession. She really is able to connect. The things that she does mentally
and physically with the players, with performance, which that's truly her job,
that's all of our jobs, is to get our guys to perform the best they can in a
game situation.  
  
That's been probably the best part of what she's brought to our program, is
again the combination of what she does with the guys mentally, the ways that
she prepares them, and then also what she's doing with their bodies.  
  
She has a very, very different philosophy in terms of strength training and
performance than our former strength coach. I think there's a lot of different
ways to skin a cat, but obviously she's had phenomenal success over the past
25 years as a strength coach. We're really excited to have her at Texas.  
  
Q. What, if any, changes with the extended three-point line have you
noticed? Do you think that will have a big impact?  
SHAKA SMART: I'll tell you one little thing, but it's obviously significant.
Our game is such one of possessions. I think early in this year you're going
to see a lot more guys stepping out of bounds on the side just because there's
less space over there. There's literally less than three feet on the sideline
where the three-point line is. That's been a big emphasis for us in the off-
season.  
  
Last year playing in the NIT, we played with those experimental rules, so we
got a little bit of a taste for it. I don't think you're going to see teams
shoot less three-pointers. I think people will shoot as many or more. The
question is, are they going to be as effective shooting from out there.  
  
From what I've seen from our team, I think we have a chance to have a really
good shooting team. I like the fact that the three-point line is moved further
back because it does force the defense to guard another foot and change
further away from the basket, which hopefully opens up opportunities to drive
and throw the ball inside.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 23, 2019

  

### [Curtis Shaw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25991)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
CURTIS SHAW: Let's take a few minutes talk a little bit about what's going on
in college basketball. Kind of an exciting time. I don't know if you all know,
but our coach Bob Huggins was on the Rules Committee this year. In my 10 years
in this role, 30 years in basketball, I'm most excited about what they did
this year than anything for the good of the game, for the style of the game,
where they want the game to go.  
  
I think we're at a great time. As we all know in the Big 12, it's the hardest
league in the country top to bottom. Every game is on one of the ESPN
networks, the new Big 12 Network. We're scrutinized every time we play,
everything that happens.  
  
It's a great league and we got a great staff, I'm looking forward to the
coming here.  
  
Two things to talk about that we don't have on video are the widening of the
three-point line, moved it back to the international distance, 22 feet, 1 3/4
inches around the top, 21 feet, 7 7/8 in the corners. We've done a lot of data
over the last four years. The shooting percentages in the NIT tournament, some
of the multi-team events really didn't change a whole lot. What it does is
moves the floor out and provides more spacing for offenses to run.  
  
I think it's going to be a good addition to our game, probably a few growing
pains, but overall I think it's going to help us.  
  
The reset of the shot clock. If the offense shoots, hits the rim, whether it's
a free throw or live ball, and then retains possession, we're only going to
reset to 20 seconds. The theory is you don't need the 10 seconds to get it
down the court. This will provide more opportunities for scoring, more team
possessions, and a livelier game.  
  
I think it's going to be a great rule also. I think it's going to speed up the
game, give us more opportunities to score.  
  
One of the quirks in the rule that the media should know is it's going to
reset to 20, if it hits the rim on a shot, even if it's 26. Let's say you had
a quick transition, the guy pops a three, you grab your own and rebound at 26,
it's now going to go down to 20. It took the coaches a while to understand
they could actually lose time on play, but it's going to get them to shoot
quicker, get the offense going. Good rules.  
  
We'll get ready for the video now. The first one is flopping. They're tired of
the acting, tired of the drama. We want to play real basketball. We don't want
players to have to embellish or fake in order to get calls. We put in some
specific items to talk about.  
  
You get one delay a game warning of any kind, including a flop. The second one
is in a Class B technical foul, which is one shot, then put the ball back in
play. It doesn't mean you have to get two flopping warnings to get a technical
foul. It could be any kind of delays. We've really talked to the teams about
not getting them confused.  
  
It also is one warning per team, not per player. If one player gets one for
head bobbing, the second one gets one for sitting down on the play, it's a
technical foul.  
  
The Rules Committee discussed this for a couple hours, from what I was told,
and decided they wanted to be severe because they want it out of the game. The
signal for flopping, the referee will do this, like you're playing down. That
means they're going to have a whistle. When you blow that whistle depends on
what's happening in the play. You're not going to kill a play if a guy is in
transition for a layup. You're not going to kill a play if a guy is flopped on
a charge, getting ready to dunk. You're going to wait till the play ends or
it's a dead ball.  
  
You could flop, get stepped on, get dunked on, and get called for a technical
foul. It's a severe penalty to get it out of the game, okay?  
  
There's three types: Jump shooters falling without being touched; players
trying to draw a charge and getting minimal, if any, contact; and then the
head snap. On all three of these, they are judgment. There may be some
contact. We'll see the one where we're taking a charge. He may brush him. It
doesn't matter if there's some contact. We have to rule whether the contact
was sufficient for that act.  
  
In the case of the head bob, you may even have a foul called because the guy
did go out and hand check him, but then he embellishes it by throwing the head
back. You may have a foul, and he'll still get a warning or technical foul for
the flopping, okay?  
  
Example of a jump shooter. Nothing is going on on the play.  
  
On this play, the official would initially give this signal, he would then see
the results which go against the rebound, and they got a guy streaking, so
you're going to wait, see if he throws a home run pass and gets a chance at a
layup. If they didn't stop it and pull it out, throw it out of bounds, then
you'll kill it, go to the table and report the flopping warning, okay?  
  
The next one is an example of a sit-down play. Guy gets in the lane, acts like
he's going to take a charge. The guy driving the basketball slips him. There
may be some minimal contact, but there definitely wasn't enough to drive him
to the floor without him sitting down on his own.  
  
As you can see in this case, white dumps it off, misses the first layup, gets
the right hand, makes the second layup. We're going to let him finish the
play. They're at a scoring advantage, let him finish the play, get the two
points and technical foul for flopping, or a warning if it's the first or
second.  
  
The last play is the head bob. Here is a case where he does get fouled;
however, he doesn't need to embellish with the head bob. Even though the
referee calls the foul, you then now have the foul on the defense, you have
the warning or the technical foul on the offense for the head bob.  
  
Three specific plays that they want taken out of the game. We're going to try
to make them a severe penalty at first because players will adjust and stop
when they know it's a penalty.  
  
Class B technical fouls, you get three per player before he's ejected,
different than the flagrant fouls, okay?  
  
The next section we want to go through is post physicality. In a lot of ways,
we've taken most of the defense strength to defend away. We won't let them get
up on you. Can't put your hand on them. Can't drive them out, put your knee in
the butt. We could not allow the offense to then take advantage of that when
it's hard enough to play defense.  
  
In the past, we've had plays to where we would say, Let the big guy settle in
the post, who can get what, wait till the ball is tried to enter. No more. If
we're not going to let the defense play that kind of aggressive, contact
plays, we can't let the offense put them at a disadvantage.  
  
We're going to have an immediate whistle instead of waiting for the result.  
  
The first play, big kid comes off the baseline, clearly just decides he's
going to displace the defender, moves him up the lane with his body. Automatic
whistle. Whether they throw the ball into him or not, the minute he makes that
displacement, we've got a foul.  
  
The defender has a right to their place on the floor. It's not the biggest
person wins the spot. Defender beats him to the spot, the offense strictly
displaces him, we want to whistle.  
  
Same thing goes on a post-up play. Posts up, instantly pins him. In the past
the ball is kind of being passed back and forth out front, we'd wait and see
what happened on the play. No more. If he pins him like that, the minute it's
seen that he's holding the defender who can't get around, we're going to have
a whistle, even though the ball is not involved.  
  
The other one is a defensive foul where the offense does a good job of getting
to where they want and defender shoves him out of the block once he gets up in
the air. This is the case, we're not going to let the defense do it, not let
the offense do it. As the Rules Committee said, we want our post players to
learn offensive scoring moves. We don't want just bull-action type plays in
the post.  
  
Our next play, here is an example of running through, illegal screener in the
post play. Again, post physicality that we're going to address immediately.  
  
Let's go to traveling. If we're not going to let the defense come out and
guard you, we're not going to let them put the hands on, we cannot allow the
running head start.  
  
Traveling has been our worst call in college basketball the last five or six
years. We're terrible at it. During the summer training session, we're
changing who looks at plays, we're trying to get more assistant to the
footwork. Whoever is looking at the footwork, especially when a guy is in the
post and the league is concentrating on the big guys, people come in to help
him.  
  
We have put in a policy this year that excessively missed traveling can result
in referees being held accountable. They're held accountable for everything
they do, but especially this play. We've got to get it out of the game or the
defense has no chance.  
  
The first play is an example of what we call the slip travel. He slides his
pivot foot, shuffles it to get started. There's no way the defense can stay in
front of him. Huge advantage in the dribble.  
  
Second play is an example of what we call a split foot travel. Get the ball at
the top, separate and move both feet. It's the LeBron James running in place
to get started play we call it.  
  
Third example in the post. Here is where it's really hard because the lead
official is watching the big bodies down there, and all of a sudden he picks
up and replants his pivot foot to get around the defender. We've designated
the outside officials to come and help with this play instead of relying on
the guy who is right in front of him.  
  
As I've talked to coaches, Don't get surprised by a whistle by the guy who is
not the closest guy to the play. We want him on these plays.  
  
All those were properly called. We'll get to the next one.  
  
Here is some we missed and why we cannot miss travel, because look at the
advantage. Here the white gets the ball, picks up, resets his pivot to get a
jump-start running. No way for the defender to stay in front. We give up an
easy layup. We cannot miss this type of play or it's two points and the
defense is helpless.  
  
Again, we've designated other officials to help.  
  
Here is going to be the biggest play of the year, especially early, the step-
back move. The college game watched the NBA, watched the James Harden move and
said this isn't legal. It's to the point where the NBA didn't like what was
happening. They've even changed their rule. They're not going to allow the
James Harden step-back.  
  
The rule is, if he steps back off one foot and then lands one, two, it's a
travel. So what we've told the teams is all step-back moves are going to be
called travels except if he can push off one and simultaneously jump back and
land on two at the same time.  
  
It's a reverse jump stop, going backwards instead of forwards, he then can
lift his shoe. If you push off one, land one, two, we want it called every
time because it's indefensible. We want it taken out of the game.  
  
I think you're going to see a lot of that early. The schools I've been to
already, that's what we're talking about. The players are all asking great
questions, looking for examples. Hopefully we get it cleaned up before it gets
too out of hand.  
  
Protecting jump shooters. There's a big concern of injury. You don't want one
of your star players take a jump shot and come down on a defender's foot
because he stepped underneath him.  
  
In the past the NBA had the rule that if they step under, they couldn't come
down on him or it's a defensive foul. We didn't, because by our rules, if his
feet were flat on the floor, he was technically in legal position. No more. We
have to allow a shooter to be able to come all the way down to the floor no
matter where he is before you can initiate contact on the defense.  
  
Good example, the defender is jumping what we call A to B, jumping at him, not
straight up. Comes down, the offensive player makes contact with his leg. We
have a defensive foul. It's on the defender, his responsibility to allow the
shooter to come to the floor because he's in a vulnerable position.  
  
Here is an example of a play you hear fans and players all the time, He jumped
into me. The rule on this play is the offense, as long as they're jumping to
their basket, has the right-of-way. A defender can jump straight up, A to A we
call it, be legal. Any time the defender is moving forward at a shooter, the
onus is on the defense and it's a foul. It's up to the defense to avoid him.  
  
Leg kick outs is the result of this play. If a defender would clear an
offensive player, I'm shooting, he passes in front, he would clear me without
me making an unnatural movement, whether that's jumping sideways or throwing
my leg out, then the defense is legal.  
  
In the past, if an offensive player kicked his leg out, a defender who would
have cleared him hit him, we had a no call. We wouldn't call a foul on the
defense. But the Rules Committee wanted it penalized. It's now an offensive
foul. If you're outside your normal shooting motion, you cause contact with
the defender, you're at risk of a player controlled foul or a flagrant foul.
Here is one coming up you'll see.  
  
In this case the defender would have passed in front and not made contact. The
shooter makes an unnecessary leg kick causing the trip. This is now an
offensive foul. Because the ball has been released, if it goes in, it will
count, then you'll have a foul on the offense.  
  
The additional leg kick we had was a play we had in the Texas-Baylor game last
year where Baylor is taking a shot at the end of the first half. As he shoots,
Texas defender flies at him. He clearly hits him on the arm. However, after or
almost simultaneously being hit on the arm, the shooter realizes he's going to
fly by, he kicks his leg this way. They're both really high in the air. They
go down very violently.  
  
That's an example where even though we had a foul on the defense for hitting
him, the offensive player made an unnecessary and dangerous move, we would
penalize both. Three-point foul, then a flagrant foul for kicking him and
putting him in an excessive contact danger situation. Flagrant foul is
reviewable. If we have a leg kick, we're not sure if it's like the first one,
not that severe, then we can always go look at it.  
  
On this play where he clearly hits him, clearly kicks his leg out, really high
in the air, in a vulnerable position, we can go to the monitor because we're
looking at a flagrant foul.  
  
In this case, Baylor would have got three shots, Texas would have shot two,
then had the ball out of bounds with I think .7 to go, something like that.  
  
The last play we don't have on film, but I want to talk about, is the dive on
play. Loose ball on the floor. Coaches for years: Get down, get on the floor,
get after it.  
  
It's gotten to a safety factor. A guy will be laying on the floor, either
reaching for the ball or holding the ball, we pile on him like football. No
more. If you jump on a player laying on the floor, it's automatically a foul.
Whether they have the ball, whether you're going for the ball, doesn't matter,
you cannot jump on a vulnerable player on the floor, which is part of the
safety, like the leg kick.  
  
I think those are the main points for this year. Those are the points to open
the game up, those are the points for safety, and to take out some of the
"trick the referee" type plays. I think it's going to help our game. I think
it makes it a little more precise to officiate with better guidelines,
especially in the physicality in the post. I'm looking for another great year
in a great league.  
  
Any questions?  
  
Q. Post play is something you 've tried to clear up for the last number
of years. Ideally what would you like to see in the post? The defender making
the choice to play from behind or in front, and then basically two guys
standing next to each other without the elbows? Ideally what would you like to
see the post play become?  
CURTIS SHAW: I think the post play has gotten so physical and bad, as one
coach said, We worried about more time in the weight room than we did learning
basketball skills. We wanted that out.  
  
We slowly started to take away the defense being able to displace them, push
them, body them out. But in order to do that, now we can't let the offense be
the initiators to pin them down or move them out.  
  
Ideally, yes, if a defender is in a spot, the offensive player can't move him.
If the offensive player has a spot, the defender has a choice: front him, stay
straight behind him, stay in front of him, ideal post-up position, the touch-
down position so you're not pinning, then the defense can decide what to do.  
  
One of the things the Rules Committee is talking about is widening the lane.
If we get to that point, we have to have more offensive skills in the post.
Can't just be a bull rush. We have to learn offensive jump shots, whatever you
want to do. I think this is leading to all that.  
  
Q. With the widening of the lane, are you going to more international
rules? Do you see a time where the shot clock will get down to 24?  
CURTIS SHAW: I don't think that. I think they're pretty happy with the shot
clock by just doing the 20 second in the front court. We've gone to the FIBA
international lane. I think we did study for about four years to get good data
on that.  
  
The widened lane is really hard to get data on. You can't really chart did
they shoot better or whatever. So what the Rules Committee did this year is
they sat in a room, and on this big screen they had a FIBA game, on this big
screen they had a college game. They showed the difference about the spacing,
the ability to cut, the ability to run different sets.  
  
I think what's going to happen is as we get this part of the rule settled,
they're just going to have to make a change with their naked eye saying it
does provide better spacing.  
  
The other international rules, I don't know that they apply quite the same. I
think the shot clock is pretty good. I think the three-point line is pretty
good. Now we decide on the lane.  
  
Q. As far as flopping, some would argue there 's an art to selling a
foul. Do you think there's still a balance there?  
CURTIS SHAW: It's strictly got to be determined was the contact severe enough
for the defender to make that reaction. I was at one of our team's practices
the other day, they're running a trap play. The kid on defense runs up. The
offensive player barely hits him, stops on contact. This guy threw 17 feet
across the floor.  
  
You have to determine the severity of the contact to cause the reaction to the
defensive player.  
  
Q. The James Harden step-back, how difficult is it to police that?
Happens so quickly. How hard is that going to be for officials to catch
that?  
CURTIS SHAW: We've struggled a little so far in closed scrimmage and stuff. I
think we're getting better because it's like the teams, we watch film after
every game. It's a matter of seeing it.  
  
Really all you have to judge, did he step back. That's pretty easy to see. Did
he land one, two. If he landed one, two, it's got to be a travel.  
  
Q. You mentioned trying to make this a more lively game. Is there a
specific kind of number you want to see, like 75-70 scores, or is it more you
want a year-over-year percentage improvement?  
CURTIS SHAW: Again, when we say all this, the Men's Oversight Committee kind
of sets the tone for where they want to see the game. The Men's Rules
Committee is charged with getting us to that point. Referees don't do anything
except do what we're told, to enforce it.  
  
I'm not sure there's at point number. It's let's take the physicality, that
type of play out. Let's allow these great athletes to use their skills and
ability to have the most open, free-flowing game there is.  
  
I remember when the NBA scored 140 points a game, and then the Bad Boys, they
got down in the 60s, and they didn't want that. I think that's what happened
when we have the Final Four game that was 52-50. Everybody said, This is not
what we want.  
  
Everything has gone to a more athletic, free-flowing game as opposed to the
physicality.  
  
Q. Is there one rule change that is going to be the emphasis that you
feel is the most positive?  
CURTIS SHAW: I think taking the "fool the referee" plays out is going to be
huge. If we get rid of the flopping where a guy has to make a decision, the
fans are going wild, I think that will help.  
  
I think the biggest thing is the 20-second reset. They think it's going to
average about four to five possessions per team more in a halfcourt game. That
provides more scoring opportunities, a more lively game.  
  
Q. Replay continues to be a bigger aspect in college sports. Has there
been any talk about allowing coaches to challenge plays, like we see in pro
sports? How will replay continue to move on in officiating?  
CURTIS SHAW: I think the replay part of the game is difficult. We're different
than football. We're different than replay in baseball because you have dead
sequences after they have a play. We don't. We're free flowing. Then stopping
that free flow makes for a difficult time.  
  
The world's philosophy of everything has to be perfect factors into that,
though. We really want to get it right. If everybody at home has video
technology that shows we get it right, then why shouldn't we go use it as
referees to get it right.  
  
I think there's an art to the flow of the game, an art to know we're two
minutes into a game, do I really need to look at this minuscule thing, or is
it two minutes to go in the game and this can really affect the outcome of the
game.  
  
One of the things that worries me in the replay was the Kentucky-LSU game last
year that was not reviewable. The Rules Committee spent three or four hours on
it and still couldn't come up with a way to do it.  
  
So now we're going to review basket interference and goal tending, but you can
only do that if a whistle is blown on the floor. We've put in a rule, another
review time, one that's hard to do, but they didn't even fix the problem they
were trying to do.  
  
The Rules Committee is very cognizant of not spending the whole day at the
monitor, but the pressure is on to get more done.  
  
I think the NBA's coaches being able to challenge will be a test ground of
what we do in the future.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 23, 2019

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
BILL SELF: I'm probably more excited about getting to basketball this year
than I have been in most years. I really like our team. I think that we have
some things that when you try to construct a team that you would definitely
look to try to do.  
  
There's still a lot of unknowns about it, as well. But I like our guys. I
think we got big bodies. I think we got a little bit of depth. We got some
speed on the perimeter. A big question will be, can we defend the perimeter
and can we shoot it consistently beyond the arc.  
  
If we're able to do those things, I think this could be a pretty fun season
for us.  
  
Q. Regard the investigation. You said in your statement you put out in
September that you characterized the NCAA 's allegations as a false narrative
and full of mischaracterizations. If that is the case, how would you
characterize your relationship with former adidas consultant T.J. Gassnola and
the text messages and calls you had with him?  
BILL SELF: The message, if you read the statement, which you obviously did,
was one in which I made the statement, then I also said that we cannot comment
to any details of anything going on with the allegations due to the NCAA
process. I'm going to follow that. I'm going to stick to that.  
  
Certainly the things that you just asked will be things that will be answered
at the appropriate time, whenever it can be answered. Certainly this is not
the time for that.  
  
Q. What do you foresee for Isaiah Moss?  
BILL SELF: I think he should be our best shooter. He's the most proven shooter
we have in our program, without question, because he's done it obviously for
three years in Iowa City.  
  
I think he's going to be a contributor. Whether or not he's a starter, I don't
know, because I haven't settled in on anything. He's been hampered by a
tweaked hamstring.  
  
I really believe that Isaiah Moss gives our big guys a chance to be the best
they can possibly be because he can stretch the defense. He obviously has
experience and has played in big games, will certainly help our young guys in
that area.  
  
Q. Dotson 's right foot, the latest on that?  
BILL SELF: He hurt it yesterday. I think whenever anything happens to a foot,
you automatically put a boot on it these days.  
  
He probably will not play tomorrow. I wouldn't think he would in our
exhibition game. It's a day-to-day thing. I can't anticipate him missing more
than three or four days.  
  
Q. With all the success you 've had, a lot of people don't like Kansas.
With the issues involving the NCAA, what happened, do you think around the Big
12 in road games there's going to be a lot more incentive for people to get
after y'all, and can you use it as motivation?  
BILL SELF: I think we've probably given some rabid fan bases some ammunition
to help in some areas to fire them up (smiling).  
  
To be honest with you, we deal with hostile environments everywhere we go for
the most part. I can't imagine that playing a factor into our success away
from home.  
  
I will tell you this. Our guys have always enjoyed playing in the toughest
atmospheres. Usually that bonds us together, unites us. Hopefully we will put
a better performance out because of that.  
  
I don't think that will have any input whatsoever whether or not we're
successful.  
  
Q. With Udoka coming back, being injury-free, how that would be a
feather in your team 's cap?  
BILL SELF: If he comes back, he has a chance to be as good as any five man in
the country. We expect him to play to an All-American-type level as long as
he's healthy.  
  
I do believe he changes our team in a way that few can just because of his
presence, athletic ability, certainly size. He's been dealt a rough hand his
college career so far. He's played I believe nine games one season, 11 one
season, then the year he was healthy we go to the Final Four. Last year we
were actually pretty good, I think 9-0, ranked No. 1 or 2 when he got injured.  
  
He and Devon are as key for us as probably any two players are for any team in
America.  
  
Q. You don 't comment on specific allegations. What concerns do you have
about the impact of this investigation on your job status at Kansas?  
BILL SELF: I'm really not concerned about that, the job status you mentioned.
I know that our chancellor and our athletic director, the basketball program,
are totally aligned in this.  
  
There's been a lot of people say certain things, which everybody is entitled
to opinion. Certainly you can't be angry or bitter because people are writing
and commenting on this because it actually has been big news in the college
basketball world.  
  
I just know the things that have taken place thus far, obviously nobody likes
to deal with it, certainly I haven't liked it, but it's also in a strange way
motivating me probably in a way that maybe I never have been to combat this by
taking care of our business on the basketball court, working with our players
in a way that maybe exceeds any way I've ever done it.  
  
I do believe there could be a positive that comes out of that. That's
certainly one of them. But as far as my legacy or whatever, that doesn't even
register with me. I probably know me better than anybody else knows me. I know
the people that I worked with over the years know me and everything.  
  
I know that we have to get through this, and we'll get through this, be very
happy when it is behind us. My legacy is the least of my concerns right now. I
just want to do the best job I can coaching at a place that I absolutely love.  
  
Q. How comfortable do you feel possibly playing four guards at times?  
BILL SELF: I think we'll have to. I believe the big advantage that this team
could have on paper is that we can play big. We've got good big guys, three
pretty good big guys. We have a fourth good one if we don't redshirt him. We
haven't made a decision yet on Mitch. So that's an advantage.  
  
In order to take advantage of that, then you have to be able to have one of
those guys defend a guard because most teams will play four around one. We
haven't shown consistently we're very good at that.  
  
If that's not the case, you're looking at us playing four guards, unless we
play zone, and we don't play a lot of zone.  
  
I thought initially 10 to 15, but I think there can actually be 20 minutes we
can play four guards.  
  
Q. It 's only been a couple of days since the renewal of the game with
Missouri. What kind of feedback have you gotten?  
BILL SELF: I haven't got a lot directly. Believe it or not, I haven't been a
big reader of newspapers of late.  
  
I think it's been more positive than not positive. I don't think you can make
decisions where you can please 100% of the people all the time. I know I have
my reasons wanting to do it. I think they're very, very valid. Certainly I
know that it helps Kansas.  
  
I'm actually excited about it. I miss the game. I miss the energy. I miss the
fans' hatred for one another, which doesn't pass down to coaches or players,
but certainly that interest level, which is very evident by selling this place
out in 41 minutes in 2017, I believe, is something that kids go to college to
play in games like that.  
  
I'm excited to get that back. From a tactical standpoint, strategic
standpoint, it helps the scheduling. It's more difficult to schedule than it
used to be. Everybody used to play 16 league games, you have 15 games that you
can actually schedule. Some leagues are going to 20. We're at 18. They go to
20. Then you have an SEC challenge or Big East challenge, champions game,
exhibitions. There's no more games to schedule from an intraconference
standpoint.  
  
This is two or three years we know our respective fan bases can see us play. I
think it will be very positive moving forward.  
  
Q. With the NCAA allegations hanging around, what sort of stuff have you
been hearing on the recruiting trail? What effect can things like this have?  
BILL SELF: Recruiting is hard regardless. When you're recruiting at an elite
level, you have obstacles each and every year that may be a little bit
different to try to recruit.  
  
It's something that we certainly explain out and are very transparent with
everything going on. There's not anybody that we recruit that we don't tell
them how it is, at least the way we know it to be.  
  
I would say it's definitely had an impact. I will also say this: I think we're
in position to have one of our better early signing periods we've had in a
long time. Even though it's hard, it's never easy, I think we're going to come
out of it okay.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA

## October 23, 2019

  

### [Steve Prohm](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23490)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
STEVE PROHM: Thanks for everybody being here.  
  
First thing I want to do, because NBA tipped off last night, is wish all of
our former guys great success this season. Came out yesterday I think we've
got eight guys in the NBA right now, on opening rosters. I think one of the 15
schools have that. Really proud of those guys. Seven of those guys have their
degree. So proud of those guys.  
  
Wish all of our guys, guys overseas, G League, great, great success this
season.  
  
Excited to get this season started. A great time of year. Baseball playoffs,
NBA tipped off, college football, NFL is in full swing. We've had a couple of
scrimmages under our belt, getting ready to tip off the new year.  
  
Had a good summer. Great to get this team to Italy to get ahead of the curve a
little bit with new pieces, returning guys moving into new roles.  
  
Proud of (Tyrese) Haliburton, did a great job with Coach Weber with Team USA,
winning gold in Greece. That was a great experience. Did a terrific job. Happy
for Coach Weber.  
  
Really excited to get (Rasir) Bolton eligible from Penn State. Gives us a
chance to move Haliburton around, different positions, take him off the ball
some.  
  
The biggest thing, strength of our team, a little bit different than in years
past, our most experience comes from our three big guys, Mike Jacobson, George
(Conditt IV) and Soloman Young, a couple of those guys that are here today. We
have some new guys, Tre Jackson, Caleb Grill, young guys that can make shots,
doing a good job.  
  
We have a great schedule. We open up with Mississippi Valley State. We go
right to Oregon State the next game. We go to The Bahamas. Got a terrific
field there. Road game at Auburn. We've got home games with Seton Hall, Iowa,
the 18-game league schedule.  
  
Ready to get started. This is a team I think we're going to have to adjust a
little bit early to see what's best for this team as we move guys around, guys
establish new roles. But excited and ready to get started.  
  
Q. How is Haliburton handling the NBA buzz, all the hype?  
STEVE PROHM: Yeah, I think he's handled it great. I think one thing I've done
different than last year, I already met with him and his family, we've gone
over that, the good, the bad, the ugly involved with that. I think we have a
great game plan going forward to where we can leave him alone, he can be where
his feet are, and that's in Ames, Iowa, right now, helping us focus on getting
back to the NCAA tournament.  
  
The biggest thing I've told him is what got him on this stage is his spirit,
and that's what he has to continue to have every single day. If he does that,
obviously he's moving into a new role, he was a 4-1 assist to turnover ratio
last year, had some terrific games, he'll be a lot more on the ball primarily
this year. Like I said, we can put him off the ball with Bolton.  
  
I think he's handled it great. I think there's been a little bit of a learning
curve, which is to be expected. But I think the last week he's kind of slowly
starting to settle down, get back into his comfort level.  
  
Q. You brought up Caleb Grill. What has impressed you most about him so
far? How much importance do you place on guys when going out recruiting and
seeing them play multiple sports?  
STEVE PROHM: Everybody probably has a different thought process on that. I
think the best thing for him now is that he can just focus on basketball. He
was a state high-jump champion, jumped 6'8". He pitched, played quarterback.
He was the guard for his high school team.  
  
He's a guy that really competes. He's probably too hard on himself at times.
But his character is off the charts. His work ethic is terrific. He competes
every day. The thing that he brings to the table right away as a freshman, his
ability to really space the floor and spread you out. Can really make shots.  
  
The best thing about him going from playing four sports to one sport is now he
can really get honed in on the skill level basketball-wise, film basketball-
wise. But I think he understands competition. He understands being a part of a
team, different cultures. I think that's a benefit from playing multi-sports.  
  
The best thing about fine-tuning to one sport now is some of his weaknesses we
can make strengths now.  
  
Q. How does the return of Soloman Young help you with your front-court
rotation?  
STEVE PROHM: I think it's big. There are times last year we probably missed
his physicality, toughness. It's great to have him healthy.  
  
The great thing about Soloman is he has great toughness. He's been a part of a
couple NCAA teams, a couple of Big 12 championship teams here in Kansas City.
But he really is probably our most experienced, elite defender that can really
understand how to guard pick and roll and defend the basket when you're going
against guys the size of abnormal but can he, guys in our conference, have to
get them off their comfort spot.  
  
He's had a great summer and great fall. I'm really pleased with where he's at
now.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 23, 2019

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
LON KRUGER: Everyone is working hard, pretty healthy at this point. Lot of new
players on the roster. Only three guys that have played any minutes at
Oklahoma last year. Everyone is new, everyone is feeling their way around a
little bit, determining roles. Great energy, great enthusiasm. More length,
more size.  
  
Excited about watching this group grow and develop, hopefully become a good
basketball team.  
  
Q. One of your new guys, (De 'Vion) Harmon, give us an update on how
he's progressing.  
LON KRUGER: He's been terrific. Couldn't be more pleased. We started workouts
in June, the first summer session. Couldn't be more pleased by the progress
he's made from that point to this point.  
  
Very well-prepared coming out of high school. Played for a very good program,
a lot of good tradition. Fundamentally very sound. He had a great base from
which to work.  
  
He's doing terrific. He's a tough guy that makes players around him better. He
works extremely hard every day. Just a terrific teammate and a good guy to be
around every day.  
  
Q. Obviously you added a lot of new faces, pretty big signing class. A
lot of talent. How have you balanced the challenge of adding new faces?  
LON KRUGER: It's a little bit unusual to add that many people at one time, new
people, new faces at one time.  
  
Kristian Doolittle and Brady Manek and Jamal Bieniemy, the three guys
returning, have done a terrific job of helping them understand what needs to
be done, understand what lies ahead. Any time it comes from player to player
it's much more effective than it's coming from coach to player trying to
prepare them for what lies ahead. They've done a good job.  
  
The new guys have been enthusiastic, feeling their way a bit, determining what
their roles are going to be. That's determined by what they do every day in
practice and early-season games leading up to conference play.  
  
Again, it's been a fun group to work with every day in terms of watching them
work to get better, work to improve in areas where they need to improve in.  
  
Q. Give us something that has intrigued you about these guys so far in
practice, maybe that surprised you.  
LON KRUGER: Found out early on that the versatility is going to be a strength.
I think the depth will be a strength. A lot of guys interchangeable parts,
chance to play bigger or smaller depending on maybe opponent or the play of
our guys.  
  
Probably the two things there, versatility, flexibility in terms of moving
people around, taking advantage of some mismatches. And depth, being able to
play nine or ten people hopefully on a pretty consistent basis.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 23, 2019

  

### [Bob Huggins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15824)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
BOB HUGGINS: We're ready to get started. That's about all I've got to say
about it.  
  
Q. Derek Culver, what did that experience do for him last year?  
BOB HUGGINS: I guess I think just some confidence. I mean, he is not going to
change how he plays. That's Derek. That's his identity.  
  
I think it's given him some confidence. Other than that, I'm not sure what it
would have done for him.  
  
Why don't you ask Derek that? He'll probably lie to you, but you should ask
him anyway (smiling).  
  
Q. You were on the Rules Committee. What was your input with the cleanup
post play and how much of an emphasis do you think that should be in college
basketball moving forward?  
BOB HUGGINS: How are you going to clean up post play when you have 6'10",
270-pound guys leaning on each other? There's going to be contact.  
  
I think the thing that needs to be called, if they're displaced, shouldn't be
allowed to do that. I mean, obviously if it affects their shot, you shouldn't
be allowed to do that. But there's going to be contact.  
  
This thing that we're going to have a no-contact sport, those people have
never played our game. You got 10 big, strong, fast guys in a confined area.
There's going to be some contact.  
  
Is that what Curt said? Curt was a guard, kind of stood out there away from
the fray, never really got involved (smiling).

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 23, 2019

  

### [Scott Drew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14205)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
SCOTT DREW: For my birthday, there's no place I'd rather be than here with you
guys.  
  
As far as our team goes, I think every coach is excited about the up-and-
coming season, what could be, might be, hopefully is. With our team, I know we
have good chemistry, we really like the guys. Big thing will be, just like
with all of us, is how we handle adversity.  
  
When you're in the Big 12, best league in the country for six straight years,
you're going to hit adversity. We try to challenge ourselves with as tough a
non-conference schedule as we can. Hopefully that will get us ready for Big 12
play.  
  
Q. How surprising was the decision with Mario (Kegler) to leave? How has
your team dealt with that?  
SCOTT DREW: Well, I think first as a coach you always hate to lose anybody.
When you lose somebody, it's tough, it takes some adjustment time for
everyone.  
  
Mario (Kegler) was going to be a big piece to our team this year. He had three
20-plus games in the Big 12, fourth-year college guy. It definitely hurts.  
  
Just like when Tristan (Clark) went down last year, you got to adjust. Next
man up mentality. At least it's before the season so we have more time to
adapt with that.  
  
Q. You were picked ninth last year, second this year. Did you go from a
bad coach with bad players to a good coach with good players? What happened?
How much do you like this team right now?  
SCOTT DREW: I think, first, you'd always rather be picked higher than lower
because it means people think you have some talent, some things to work with.
At the same time every coach will tell you exactly the same thing: what makes
our league such a great league is the parity. The difference between second
and tenth, it's a one- or two-possession game.  
  
Why we're picked high, we have a lot of players coming back. Part of that was
due to Tristan coming back, I mean, six-month rehab, he's been back in the
fold of things. But he's not a 20-10 guy right now. Hopefully he gets to that.
It's going to take him a while still to recover, get used to playing. That's
why you have the non-conference. Hopefully by conference time he'll return to
the player that he was, leading the nation in field goal percentage.  
  
Again, I know it was a tough surgery he had. The recovery time, it's been a
long time. It's going to take him games to get that rust off, get back to
playing how he was.  
  
Part of being picked high also is because Freddy Gillespie and Matthew Mayer
are both guys that went through surgeries, six-month rehabs as well; one with
a shoulder, one with a hip surgery. With those three guys coming back I
definitely know as a coach we'll be much better as they get game experience
because they haven't had the practice time this summer or in the foreign tour
that you would hope they would have gotten.  
  
Q. Is it surprising to see Jamie Dixon picked to finish last? How deep
is this conference right now?  
SCOTT DREW: Again, whoever was going to be picked ninth or tenth, every coach
will tell you they could finish first or second in the league. Why the league
is, again, ranked the number one RPI, net ranking last year, RPI for the last
years, top to bottom the best league in the country. Doesn't mean much
difference no matter where you're picked, what people think you're going to
do.  
  
Everyone is going to be in close games. Whoever wins those close games will
finish towards the top, whoever loses those close games will be closer to the
bottom. There's a lot of transition this year with a lot of teams having new
faces. How quickly and how they adjust, how successful they are will show
where those teams finish.  
  
Q. When you first got to Baylor, you were in there for an awful lot of
the top 50, top 100 players in the country when you were recruiting. You 've
changed your recruiting sometime, player development. Talk about the evolution
of your program by the recruiting standpoint.  
SCOTT DREW: I think the longer we've been at Baylor, too, we've been able to
maybe get a chance to get a better feel for players three and four years out,
recruit them longer, see them in our camps, get a feel for just the
intangibles, the character part, who is going to work hard, who is going to
keep developing, who is going to be coachable.  
  
I think we put more stake into that, more ownership into that. Because of
that, we've had players that have come that haven't been ranked as high,
Taurean Prince just signed an extension, close to $30 million. He was a guy
that was ranked 25th in the state coming out, going to Long Island University.
Didn't start until his senior year. Was a great player for us. But coming in,
people wouldn't have known who he was.  
  
Royce O'Neale might start for the Utah Jazz, transfer from Denver, coming out
of high school was a zero start guy by some scouting services.  
  
I think our staff has done a better job in really looking into the intangible
part, who fits our program, who is going to be coachable, keep working hard,
develop, who would we want to have a part of our program.  
  
Some of those guys aren't ranked, some of them are.  
  
Q. The SEC challenge has been going on for a while now. What are your
thoughts on that? Do you still like it, dislike it?  
SCOTT DREW: After the game you can ask me and I'll tell you (laughter).  
  
I think it's a great thing for our league. It's quality games, home and road,
with a new net. It does nothing but help both leagues, both conferences.  
  
You love the Big 12 competing against another top league in the country, being
able to see how we stack up and compare. That and the Big East challenges are
things I think are tremendous for our league. No matter if you win or lose the
game, it helps your team prepare for Big 12 play, it helps you for having a
chance to be in the post-season.  
  
I know fans enjoy watching quality games, and players like playing in them.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 23, 2019

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
JAMIE DIXON: We're looking forward to this season. Obviously we don't have a
lot of guys returning. Two very good players returning in Desmond Bane and
Kevin Samuel. After that, we don't have much. Obviously we're not picked very
high. I've seen is 8, 9, 10 out of 10. That's to be expected when you return
so few guys.  
  
I'm excited about our guys. We've had a great summer, best summer I've ever
had as far as TCU as far as practice, working out, growth, development,
improvement. We're excited about the new guys. Nine new players, which is a
lot even in today's game.  
  
But at the same time the league is wide open. So many teams are bringing in
about the same amount of new players. It's just the way of college basketball.  
  
We are excited about this group. They've worked hard. Great leadership from
the two guys today, Desmond Bane, the senior, and Kevin, who is really a
third-year sophomore for us.  
  
I'm excited about what we can become because of those two guys, not only as
players but as leaders. So that's where I think our growth will be.  
  
Q. You 've talked about movement before. How much do you have to adapt
in today's game with so many guys coming and going?  
JAMIE DIXON: I mean, it is what it is. I've embraced it. We're going to have
transfers. When you make it easier, the rules, the grad transfers, the
waivers, it's got everybody talking about every kid transfers thinking they're
going to be eligible right away. That's how guys are being recruited, kids are
being moved. AAU guys, you'll be eligible right away.  
  
It is the environment. There's no surprises by it. You work with it and adapt,
as I've done throughout my career in the different spots.  
  
Good or bad, it is what it is. You just got to find the right guys in the
right place. I think we're in a good spot for that because of our location.
We're excited about our newcomers that we have. Some are transfers, some are
high school guys. We're really excited about them and their growth.  
  
Q. Is there a freshman that stands out so far to you that 's taken your
system, adapted really well, been a key for you to lean on?  
JAMIE DIXON: Yeah, I mean, we signed three guys early that we were really
excited about when we signed them. I think the one guy, if I have to name --
because we have five high school guys coming in, high school freshmen, with
three transfers, I guess -- four, actually.  
  
So the one that's probably been the biggest surprise, I guess you can say, we
knew he was going to be good, but is Diante Smith. He's probably more so
physical, he's tougher, better feel, a little bit more versatile than maybe I
thought. I knew he was very talented, but really understands the game, has a
real good demeanor at the same time.  
  
He's got the ability to be a little bit more physical than I would have
anticipated. He's gotten bigger, stronger in the short time he's been there.
He got there in June. I think he's probably been the biggest surprise. Nine
newcomers. Got a long list to pick from.  
  
Excited about him. Always was. But he'll be ready to play for us this year.  
  
Q. Francisco, how has his growth been, in bringing in an international
guy, his background? Do you feel that suits your system style well?  
JAMIE DIXON: We're excited about him. The interesting thing about him, he's
international, Argentina, seems like all the different adjustments he's going
to make. He played in the NBA Academy. He's played a lot of international
basketball. He went to Australia for the International Academy.  
  
His English, I was concerned about that, but that's not an issue, given that
he's been in Australia the last year and a half. Then he grew up in Italy,
too. His dad played on the national team in Argentina with Manu Ginobili. The
guy has been around high-level basketball since he was born, has played in it
as well.  
  
He's a true point. So he's a good, heady player. He's getting better. He's got
to get stronger, quicker, all those things. But he's working, and we're
excited about him.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 23, 2019

  

### [Mike Boynton, Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36738)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
MIKE BOYNTON: Glad everybody is here. I want to open up probably like the
other nine coaches and say we're excited about getting the season started.
It's been an enjoyable summer after what was a pretty frustrating year for our
program last year. We're excited about moving forward. We feel like our
program is on track where we thought we could be at this point when I took
over in the spring of 2017.  
  
We're looking forward to getting started, looking forward to seeing your faces
around during the season.  
  
Q. How much of last year for you was just establishing your way of
coaching, your culture?  
MIKE BOYNTON: Thanks for the question.  
  
I don't know if it was ever necessarily about me or my anything. In my mind, I
have a responsibility as the head coach at Oklahoma State to hold the
program's standards, to protect the integrity of the people who have basically
come before us, who are very proud to know that Oklahoma State has been a
great program over the course of its time. Maybe had a tough up-and-down
stretch the last decade or so, but a program that they should be proud of.  
  
The first-ever back-to-back national championship basketball program is
Oklahoma State University. I'm not lost on that. We can achieve at that level
again, but we can't take shortcuts in doing it. We have to continue to keep
the standards high, keep people accountable when necessary, and keep bringing
guys in who understands what it takes to get us back there.  
  
Q. Yor, the development he had last year, was eye-opening. Tell us about
his development since last year.  
MIKE BOYNTON: Thanks for the question.  
  
Yor (Anei) is a kid who we recruited obviously out of high school two years
ago now who we saw some potential in. I think ultimately part of our job in
recruiting is to evaluate the development prospects of a young man. You do
that by finding out as much as you can about what type of person they are, the
type of work ethic they have, and the desire they have to get better.  
  
He encompasses all those qualities in a positive manner. He's got a great
spirit about himself. He really embraced just trying to become a really,
really good part of our program. No ego. His teammates love him. He really
cares about winning.  
  
I think that ingratiated him not only to his teammates but our fans. We're
excited to see him take another step forward this coming season.  
  
Q. Talk about the three vets you have coming back, what they need to do
for your younger guys to get to another level?  
MIKE BOYNTON: Thanks for the question.  
  
I can't say enough about what Cam McGriff, Lindy Waters and Thomas Dziagwa
mean to me personally. I'll speak more to about what they mean to our program.  
  
Those guys, if I can walk you through their journey briefly, they were
recruited in 2016 to play at Oklahoma State by Travis Ford, bought into his
vision for the program, thought that they could come in and make an impact and
be part of a program they figure could play in the tournament in their entire
career.  
  
Before they arrive on campus, Travis Ford is gone, new coach, they show up on
campus to a different philosophy, different way of thinking. Fortunately for
them they stuck with the process. They go through that summer. We
unfortunately lost one of their teammates that summer, as you can remember.
They experienced a lot before they ever played a college basketball game.  
  
One year later, I can speak to this because I lived it as a player, they're
probably just getting adjusted to college basketball at the end of their
freshman year. They wake up from the day after the NCAA tournament game, and
the coach that they actually played for their first year is gone.  
  
Before they can get to their second year in college, they're now figuring out
who the next coach is, the third coach in their short time at college
basketball experienced guys.  
  
I talk about their character. At no point, because now they're going to be
coached by a guy who never coached a college game before as a head coach, they
never flinched, never stopped believing in each other or our program. They've
given everything they could to Oklahoma State.  
  
I think now is their opportunity to show what winning looks like. They're
winners off the court, for sure. I think this year is going to give them an
opportunity to show they can be leaders for a team that can win on the court.  
  
I'm really excited I've been a part of this journey with them. I'm really
excited to see how this story ends. I believe it will be a really good ending
for them. I know that all Oklahoma State fans can be proud of the way they've
represented our program, and their families can be proud of the way they
represented their families.  
  
Q. You mentioned some of your more seasoned players. You have a lot of
new guys with you, as well. Any one of them who has firmed himself, gotten his
feet planted, doing some really good things for you now in workouts?  
MIKE BOYNTON: We have six freshmen and one grad transfer. Yeah, a lot of new
pieces.  
  
A couple of them have popped up their heads, so to speak, in different ways.
The freshman kid from The Netherlands, Hidde Roessink, who is probably the
least known of the entire group, has probably had as great an impact on our
practices through 20 so far as anybody.  
  
The Boone twins I think will both be really good players. Physically they
still have a little ways to go. I expect our grad transfer Jonathan (Laurent)
to have an impact object our program.  
  
Avery Anderson, the true freshman from here in the States, probably has been
the most consistent in terms of productivity in practice. He's also been able
to give Isaac (Likekele) some challenge at his position, give him a chance to
grow in that spot as well.  
  
I'm excited about the whole group. How much they all will play as freshmen, I
probably couldn't tell you today or a month from now. Once we get to Big 12
play, it's a different story. I'm excited about the whole group. Got a good
group of hard-working young men.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 23, 2019

  

### [Chris Beard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30671)

  
_Kansas City, Missouri_  
  
CHRIS BEARD: Exciting time of year for all of us involved in college
basketball. We're looking forward to another great season in Lubbock. Our team
is a work in progress, but I really like these guys. I think we practiced 18
or 19 times. Got a lot of potential. We're excited about this season.  
  
Q. Have you ever been in a situation like this, where kind of a roster
overhaul, or is this new ground for you?  
CHRIS BEARD: Me personally, I've been here before. Coaching in junior college,
Division II, two stints of professional basketball, your rosters change not
only from season to season, but even during the season sometimes.  
  
Our staff has some experience, some past work with putting together teams
quickly. This year will be no different.  
  
Q. What does that do to a team 's confidence? How does that boost your
confidence collectively?  
CHRIS BEARD: I respect that question. I think trying to stay away from the
coaching clich�s, but it's true. Every season is different, every team is
different. Sometimes even the same players return, but they're different
players, it's a different team.  
  
For us, we certainly build upon a lot of the successes we had last year. We're
pretty quick to embrace it's a new journey. We have three returners, two of
the three played minutes. Morrow (Davide Moretti) was a starter, Kyler came
off the bench, played his best basketball late in the year. We have 10 new
players. Seven of those 10 are freshmen.  
  
We obviously have a lot of learning to do. We're a lot like a roller coaster.
I was telling a friend yesterday, sometimes on the highs we look about as good
as you can play college basketball, other days we can't wait to get back to
the practice floor.  
  
Again, I like our team. I think we have all the ingredients that are needed to
compete in the Big 12. Certainly we're a work in progress. We're going to be a
team that gets better throughout the season.  
  
Q. Two years ago you 're in the Elite 8, last year you're playing for
the big trophy at the end of the year. In terms of sustainability, how do you
look at what you've built so far at Texas Tech and going forward?  
CHRIS BEARD: It's the objective. That's a great word, "sustainability." We use
consistency and validation. Same type of idea, right? It's never been our
objective at Texas Tech to have a good team, but it's always been our
objective to build a program that has consistency.  
  
I think above many, many things, that's probably what I'm most proud of. The
first year we became competitive and relative very quickly. Always have a lot
of appreciation for those five seniors that laid the foundation that year. We
were close.  
  
Certainly in year two, we were right there in the middle of the fight for the
conference championship. Made a nice run in March to the Elite 8, losing to
eventual national championship team Villanova. Last year to get over that
hump, win the Big 12 for the first time in school history, make it to the
national championship game.  
  
I think we have shown some consistency. Year four, nothing changes. We just
need to validate what we've been doing with a new team and new players.
Certainly that's the challenge. It's always been our idea to be consistent.
I'm proud of the consistency we've shown in our first three years. We look
forward to having another great season this year.  
  
Q. Your thoughts for Kevin McCullar, how he fits into your plans this
year. He was a pretty strong get in the recruiting process.  
CHRIS BEARD: Kevin, we call Mac in our program, one of the highest ranked
recruits in Tech history. We were fortunate enough to get Mac last year, came
in mid-semester, how these football guys do. He was able to be a part of our
Big 12 season, March experience, going through the tournament all the way to
Minneapolis. Redshirted, but I thought he gained valuable experience.  
  
Mac is just continuing to develop, like all young players. He's had a couple
of adversity-type situations with some injuries. He's back on the practice
floor now. Not to put a lot of pressure on him, but I would say we have a lot
of confidence in him.  
  
I think he's going to be a guy that contributes not only this year, but is
going to end up having a great year at Tech. He's another guy in the same
class of the Culvers and Zhaires and Keenans and Morrows and a lot of the
young players we have had in these recruiting classes. I have a lot of
confidence in Mac.  
  
Q. When you have this type of turnover, this type of youth, how much
importance do you put on having a lot of success early versus realizing maybe
you 'll round into form a little later in season?  
CHRIS BEARD: I think success is always important. You have to validate what
you're doing. I said that year one when we got to Tech. We were doing some
things a little bit differently, than Coach Smith had done. You have to have
some success.  
  
Certainly with this year, with a young team, 10 new players, seven freshmen,
it will be a key part of our journey. I think there's going to be some nights
where our fans leave the arena and think these guys are as good as anybody in
the country. There's going to be other nights where, man, these guys need to
go practice early in the morning.  
  
Along our journey, it's going to be important to find some success. We look
for that success in practice, we look for that success in daily workouts and
certainly in games.  
  
Any coach and any player would agree on that, as you build something, you got
to have some success early onto validate what you're doing.  
  
Q. Obviously the great run last season. In the off-season, especially
during the summertime, did you have people coming up to you that normally
wouldn 't have talking about the championship game? Any anecdotes of people
you met or heard from in the off-season?  
CHRIS BEARD: I mean, absolutely, of course. It's a great off-season. The one
thing that's been really pleasing is I'm a breakfast burrito guy in the
mornings. Where I like to go, you have to ask for the salsa. They charge you
for it, which is a little bit ridiculous.  
  
The first year when we weren't an NCAA tournament team, I would forget to
order the salsa, I'd have to wait back in line. The lady would charge me
$0.30, $0.33 with tax. Some mornings I wouldn't have cash, which is a common
thing, take my credit card out, run it for $0.33 for salsa.  
  
You make the Elite 8, now I don't have to wait in line, she calls me up. I
still have to pay for it (smiling).  
  
We played for the national championship, and now I'm pleased to say I get free
salsa (laughter). If we would have beat Virginia, maybe I could have gotten a
free burrito. At this point I'm paying for the bury so but getting
complimentary salsa.  
  
Things like this is great. Last year is over. Nobody can ever take it from us.
I don't mind the questions, because it makes me think of those guys, in
accordance, Brandone, Tariq, Matt, Culver, those guys. But it's another
season. Certainly today is one of those days, the start of a new season.  
  
I'm excited to be back in Kansas City with our new guys, our new team. I think
we're going to be relative, part of the fight, both in our conference and
nationally this year.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2019

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Eric Paschall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35201)

### [Phil Booth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34930)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 74, Seton Hall - 72  
  
JAY WRIGHT: A thrill to just be in the final here at the Garden. You guys have
heard me say it all week, but we really do genuinely relish this opportunity
to play in this environment, this building, in this league.  
  
We want to give a lot of credit to Seton Hall. I think Kevin's done as good a
job as anybody in this country. This team, this Seton Hall team right now, if
you look at their games, losing in double overtime on the road to Georgetown
and then beating us, Marquette, all the teams in this tournament, easily could
have won this game. They could beat anybody in the NCAA Tournament, and they
have; they've beaten Kentucky, Maryland. Just speaks to how good our league is
and what a great job Kevin did. We have great respect for them.  
  
Lastly, these two seniors, they're going to go down as two of the greatest
Villanova basketball players of all time. You've got to thank God you had the
opportunity to be a part of our lives. They've meant so much to all of us.  
  
Q. Jay, you knew you had some special younger players, but I'm sure you
were concerned about how they would handle all the attention and the spotlight
of this place these three days. How do you think they did?  
JAY WRIGHT: Really well. I think this really helped us. We got Cole Swider
playing -- you know, coming off with six weeks off with a broken hand and
coming back in this environment, did a great job for us. Joe Cremo gave us
good minutes. Our sophomore, and Saddiq Bey as a freshman, his first two or
three shots were airballs, and then after that, just had great games. Dhamir
is a sophomore. Collin is a sophomore. I think they did a really good job.  
  
Q. And Jermaine?  
JAY WRIGHT: And Main-O. I'm even counting Main-O as an upperclassman because
he hangs with these two so much. Main-O is inexperienced, but man, he was
great in this tournament.  
  
Q. Jay, it feels like your team has been battling this season more so
this year than in recent years. What does it say about the character of this
team to come back from a losing stretch and get three grind-it-out wins for a
Big East Tournament title?  
JAY WRIGHT: It means a lot to our program to get these grind-it-out kind of
games. It's really a tribute to Phil and Eric. They really have been like
coaches this season. We can do so much on the court, but they've got to take
guys in the locker room and teach them how they prepare for practice, how they
prepare for games. They've got to teach them how to sleep at night, how to eat
the right way. They've been like big brothers, fathers almost to these guys.  
  
It's been frustrating for them. There's a lot of times in games when these
young guys don't know what they're doing, and these guys are just trying to
cover for everybody. It's just been incredible experience of leadership by
these two.  
  
Q. Jay, over the past six years now, since the league was rebuilt, you
and Seton Hall in a million close games, by one or two, overtime, title games
both decided by two. What has it been like from your side of the rivalry, and
why do you think there's been so many close games with players changing and
everything year after year?  
JAY WRIGHT: First, I think Kevin Willard is one of the best coaches in the
country, I really do. Look, we've coached against all of them. I really think
he is. X and O-wise, they have great schemes. And then they have that Big East
physicality, that toughness that we try to play with. So when we play them,
then there's no advantage there. That gets knocked out. So it becomes a rock
fight, and that's what's Big East basketball. Kevin played in it. He grew up
in it. I grew up in it. We just really respect them.  
  
We learn a lot -- I joke with Kevin, but in '16, what they did to us here, I
think helped us win a championship because no one had done that to it, and we
knew we had to prepare for it in the tournament. There's a lot of similarities
in the programs, and we're proud to be associated with them in a similar way.  
  
Q. Jay, it's your fourth Big East title in five years. I know you're
going to say they're all special. Can you appreciate this one more considering
where you were at the start of the season with all you lost and all you had to
go through at the beginning of the year to get to this point?  
JAY WRIGHT: Oh, yeah, definitely. I can appreciate it. I really can. You live
in the present, so what you're doing now is most important, and that's really
all that matters. What you did in the past doesn't matter. This is thrilling.
There's more to this one, just watching these two, what they did. We lost our
two top assistants. We had young coaches who did a great job, and these two
were like coaches. I would really go to them and have meetings with them.
"We've got to do this. We've got to get the guys to do this. You have to teach
them this. You have to be patient. Don't strangle Dada." (Laughter). We have
to keep teaching them, and they did it.  
  
And we have really good guys, really, really good guys that allow us to coach
them. So it's really been rewarding. This is a real special one.  
  
Q. Jay, I asked Eric this on the court, and it's kind of going along
with what you were talking about, the responsibility you put on your seniors
in this program. Can you just speak to that and how they have embraced that
and taken that and really taken ownership of this program beyond just as
you've described little leadership moments?  
JAY WRIGHT: In our program, the older you get, the more responsibility that's
put on you. It's not easier on you. It's actually harder on you. And then
you're expected to have the most pride, most understanding in the program, and
your senior year is not about you. It's about you giving back and teaching the
younger guys because the guys before you did it.  
  
Josh Hart was here tonight on the court. He took great pride in these two,
right? Because they were the young guys he was teaching when he was a senior.
And they all know that, and they pass it down. Now, Josh had -- the young guys
he had were these two, who were experienced. It was a little easier. The young
guys these two had have no experience, and so what they had to do was off the
charts. That's what really made it special this year.  
  
Q. Coach, about a year ago, Jermaine was struggling with injuries and
maybe a little extra hesitation in his play. Could you speak a little bit how
in the past year his development and how he helped you guys fill a hole in
your team.  
JAY WRIGHT: He's grown incredibly. Another coachable guy that comes from an
old-school family that teaches him listen to the coach, and then he's their
boy. There's a lot of times I would go to these two, "Guys, you got to talk to
Main-O. You've got to get Main-O to stop playing video games and how to be
serious as a basketball player." And Main-O listens. He tells them -- "Main-O,
how are you doing?" "I'm not playing video games. I'm watching basketball
games." That's what they teach him. You can tell a lot of kids that, and they
won't listen. He listens to everything you tell him, and we're all thrilled.  
  
My wife hears me get frustrated with him the most, and that's my wife's
favorite player because she hears me get nuts about him. She always tells me,
"You should play him more. Don't yell at him so much." He's a real special guy
in our program. No one gets more excited when he has success than all of us.  
  
Q. Jay, odd game in some ways, 54 combined points first half, 92 second
half. It looked like you guys were on the verge of maybe taking control two or
three times, and that never happened. Is that your execution, their tenacity,
or just this place, this setting?  
JAY WRIGHT: Well, I hate to say this, but that's why you're a good writer, but
it's those three, it really is. This place is crazy. It just doesn't let you
get out of a game. The fans stay behind you. Crazy things happen here.  
  
If you look at their season, they have been down in a lot of games, even games
they lost. Like they lost to Butler, they were down 20. They had a chance to
win it. They've been like that all year. They just never go away. And then we
did some -- we tried to lose that. We did some crazy things at the end, but
that was all our young guys that just weren't experienced in these situations.
So it was a combination.  
  
Q. Jay, two-parter: Were you surprised after the missed free throw that
Kevin called a time-out? And then when he did, was the defensive message to
the team about Myles Powell and generally what makes him so tough to guard?  
JAY WRIGHT: No, I really wasn't surprised. I was saying earlier he's a really
good X-and-O guy. He knows what you're doing, and he does a great job of
countering that with his players. That's what we talked about. When we prepare
for them, we say, look, I show them, look what they do. This guy is a really
good coach. So we say to them, we can't just expect them to run a certain play
for Powell. They could run action, as use Powell as a decoy, and I just tell
these guys, you've got to read it because I can't tell you what they're going
to do because he could set it up for what you think they're going to do with
Powell, and get someone else a shot.  
  
So I really put it on the players. They did a great job of communicating
together.  
  
Q. Phil, this is for you: I heard Coach talk about how tough it is to be
a senior, and Eric mentioned it on the court. When you have a game like this
where the young guys actually kind of get it, how satisfying is that for you,
and how much does that sort of take a load off you when they're giving you a
contribution?  
PHIL BOOTH: They've had times throughout the year when they've done a lot and
won us some games -- Jermaine, Saddiq, Collin, Dada. The list goes on. When
they score and make points, that doesn't really surprise me. Us two guys as a
team defensively is more important to us. We've got to connect as a group of
five on the court. Offensively, they can do a lot of different things today,
as you've seen with Saddiq today, what Jermaine did. It's no surprise to any
of us.  
  
Q. Can each of you guys tell us about what it's like to be Big East
Tournament champions three consecutive years, and you guys should know that
for the first time in the history of this great event, you guys are the first
group that has won three consecutive Big East Tournament championships.  
JAY WRIGHT: That's pretty cool.  
  
ERIC PASCHALL: I mean, it's pretty cool to know that (laughter). We never
really talked about it. We just talked about each year, I mean, coming from
the first one of this streak, we just talked about being the greatest team we
could be, greatest Villanova basketball team we could be. There was nothing
really like in our plan. We just tried to be the best Villanova basketball
team and see where it takes us.  
  
PHIL BOOTH: Just very fortunate. It's nice to be among some great teams. Great
teammates, great players. Stuff like that. You can't really talk about it and
try to think in your mind, and think we won three straight tournament
championships. It doesn't happen like that. Like he said, you have to be
focused on being the best team you could be by the end of the season. Each
year we try to do that, and I've been blessed with great teammates.  
  
Q. Phil, you spoke about your teammates coming through. For you
individually, as you were struggling, but they maintained the floor for you.
When you got going in the second half, what did you see offensively?  
PHIL BOOTH: The team kept telling me, "Booth, stay aggressive. When shots
fall, keep leading us, do whatever you've got to do." I was just trying to
read the defense. If it's a shot, make it, or pass it, pass it then. Just
trying to make the right read on the offense and be strong with the ball.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday Xavier had Hankins, who had a good game. Today Seton
Hall shot 42 points in the paint. How much of a concern is that?  
JAY WRIGHT: It's always a balance. The game's changed. It used to be back in
the day that would really upset you, but you always have to check on that
balance. If you're giving that up and giving up threes, you're in trouble. If
you're giving that up and you're taking away threes, it can be okay.  
  
So sometimes that gets you, and sometimes you say, you know what, they're just
twos. How many -- they had seven threes. They beat us with 13 threes the last
time. So it's a trade-off.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2019

  

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

### [Myles Powell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36805)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 74, Seton Hall - 72  
  
Q. Kevin, again, almost like last night except not a victory. What can
you just say about the way your team kept coming and coming and just kept
coming back no matter how many times you were behind today?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I'm so proud of this team. I'm so proud of what we accomplished
and where we are. I'm also excited, if we play that hard next week, I'm
excited about next week. I really am. That's what I told the team. That's a
good basketball team out there cutting down the nets. They deserve it. They
fought hard. They had some big stops. But I love the fact my team fought, and
we had a chance to win it. I'll take him shooting the last second shot every
day.  
  
Q. Myles, did the shot feel good at your hand? Just take us through your
range of emotions from the ball leaving your hand to seeing it hit the back
rim.  
MYLES POWELL: I thought it was going to drop. Shooters usually aim for the
back of the rim, and it just hit off long. We got another opportunity at it.
We tried to throw it up to Sandro to see if he could tie it, but we just
didn't have enough time.  
  
Q. Kevin, you got a really nice run out of Anthony Nelson. What did you
think of the way he played and prompted you to leave him in there?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Ant played phenomenal. As many minutes as Q's played, when he
pivoted on the offensive end, he kind of slipped and tweaked his groin, and
then he sat for a while. It's hard sitting that long and then jumping back
into it. And Ant, I thought, played phenomenal. He played with great
confidence. I thought he played really well defensively. But Q will be fine.  
  
Q. Myles, it's obviously a tough loss, but you had almost 80 points here
in three games. Just how confident and how good do you feel going into next
week? What kind of damage can you guys do in the Tournament?  
MYLES POWELL: We feel very confident. We're playing our best basketball right
now. This is the best time to play your best basketball. We're just going to
get through tomorrow, see where we wind up going, who we're playing, and we're
just going to get back and pick our heads up and keep fighting.  
  
Q. Coach, in this game, you were outrebounded, in contrary to you
outrebounding them in your last victory against Villanova. In a tough game
like this, could you point to something else on the margins that caused you
guy to lose the game?  
KEVIN WILLARD: No. We knew going in that their offensive rebounds were going
to be critical. Early in the game, it kind of got them going a little bit.
They got two big offensive rebounds for threes, and then they got two big tip-
outs late in the second half that kind of kept their possessions alive. It's a
two-point game. We have a shot to win it.  
  
So I thought we did a good job of not turning the ball over, and I thought we
did a great job of turning them over. That's why it was such a close game.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, more basketball to play, but you had a young team
at the start of the year, and Sandro played well this week, Anthony Nelson
played well tonight, Romaro Gill has played well throughout the stretch. What
can you say about how your team has grown up over the course of the year but
particularly this week?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I can't talk enough about how proud I am of them. This team has
been -- I told them this team has been so much fun to coach and so much fun to
be around, so much fun to battle with. This one hurts because I think both
teams just laid it out on the line, and we had a big, big shot to win it. But
I think it shows more about the heart and the character of these kids. We've
gotten down, down, and these guys keep fighting, they keep believing, no
matter what's going on within the flow of the game, they seem to fight
everything and stay together and just keep making great plays. It's been an
absolute pleasure to kind of be along for the ride with them.  
  
Q. Kevin, did anyone on your bench or anyone say anything to you about
the clock? It looked like a few seconds ran off, a little under a minute left.
Did you notice that?  
KEVIN WILLARD: The clock continues to run on a made basket until it hits a
minute.  
  
Q. It was under a minute then.  
KEVIN WILLARD: I'm not going to say anything about the refs. Who knows? That's
their job. Basically, they stopped the play. We had a 15-minute delay the
other day to fix nine seconds. So you would think towards the end of the game,
if time -- that's their job.  
  
So, no, no one on the bench did.  
  
Q. What reason were you given for the T? Have you ever gotten two T's in
two days?  
KEVIN WILLARD: No, first ones in three years.  
  
Q. Kevin, Myles had 78 points in three nights. Just what can you say
about how he's played, and what's it like having a guy like that next to
you?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I think it's exciting. I think the country already knows him,
but I think they're going to get an even bigger taste next week on the
national stage. It's more fun being around him, Adam, to be honest with you,
than watching him play because he's a better kid off the court than he is --
well, most of the times. Better kid off the court than he is on. He's such a
pleasure to be around. He's such a pleasure to coach. He listens. And I think
that's why he's come from a good player to a great player.  
  
Q. Myles, I mean, I think there's some people out there maybe don't
think -- with obviously both teams safely in the tournament, but a game like
this, and obviously, you didn't get it, but how much does it mean to try to
hoist that trophy? How much was at stake tonight even though both teams are
going to the Tournament?  
MYLES POWELL: We had a good opportunity to make history tonight. I mean, we're
definitely hurting from it. Everybody was comparing us to the 2016 team, and
we just wanted to match their legacy. When you come up short like that, it
kind of hurts.  
  
We have a lot to be proud of. We fought. And at the end of the day, that's all
you can ask for.  
  
Q. Myles, how can you guys use this as fuel for the next tournament?  
MYLES POWELL: We made it here. Everybody didn't expect us to be here. We
believed in ourselves, our coaching staff believed in us. We can play with
anybody in the country. So I mean, yeah. We just beat Marquette twice, Nova
last week, and they were the top two teams in our conference. And today we
gave Nova a hard fought. We know we can play with anybody in the country when
we're playing our basketball. We're just going to get ready for the tournament
next week.  
  
Q. Coach, I heard you're the first Seton Hall coach to win 20 games four
years in a row. Can you talk about that and the fact that your program is
really on solid footing?  
MYLES POWELL: He should have won Coach of the Year.  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: Thanks, kiddo. I really appreciate that vote of confidence.
You're the best.  
  
I'll be honest with you, the reason this program is on solid footing, we had
an unbelievable recruiting class come in -- Isaiah, Angel, Khadeen, I love
when I talk about Desi, Desi, Ish, Michael. I think the career Michael's had
is unbelievable. And those guys came in with the attitude they wanted to put
this program on the map, and they deserve the credit because they worked hard,
and then they passed on this legacy to this young man, and he's taken it by
himself and single-handedly kept it going.  
  
So I've just been lucky I got a great group of kids over the last four years,
and that's kind of where we are where we are.  
  
Q. Kevin, you've won this tournament, and you followed up, obviously,
with not a great run in the NCAAs. Do you expect this team to use this and to
be extra motivated and hungry next week?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, I learned a lot from that year. That was such an
emotional ride. We went out west, and I left too early. I've learned a lot. I
have so much confidence in this group. I know they'll be back, tomorrow? I
know they'll be back Monday ready to work. And as long as they come back, the
way they did after we lost a tough one to Georgetown or after we lost a couple
in a row earlier in the year, I know and I have such great confidence in the
team that they'll bounce back. To be honest with you, I'm more looking forward
to the NCAA Tournament. I have more confidence in my team than I think I ever
have.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Eric Paschall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35201)

### [Phil Booth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34930)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 71, Xavier - 67  
  
JAY WRIGHT: What a fun game to be a part of. When you win, it's a lot more
fun. Either way, the atmosphere in the Garden, Friday night, semifinals,
there's just nothing like it in college basketball. That place was rocking. I
just think this is the best tournament in college basketball. This is just an
incredible place to play.  
  
A lot of credit to Xavier. I told Travis he's making it look easy. First year,
he did a lot with this team. They've got a young team too. They were playing
as well as anybody in the conference coming down the stretch, and we knew it.
This was no surprise at all. They were extremely tough defensively. They got a
lot of answers offensively. Scruggs is awesome. Hankins inside. They're a
really good team.  
  
I thought it was big when Marshall -- he's another great player. Finally, just
leadership from two great seniors, who have done it their whole careers, their
whole lives. They've done it in high school and college. We're just really
lucky to have these two.  
  
Q. Coach, at one point Jermaine was 2 for 10 from the field. Did you or
any of the players give him words of encouragement at some point to help him
out of it, or you just let him play through it?  
JAY WRIGHT: Jermaine's got a great attitude. He really doesn't need
encouragement. He is kind of a young basketball player, kind of just got to
give him -- we all just give him little thoughts, like he was open. He was
driving the ball. We said to him, "Take your shot." It's simple.  
  
He does not fear failure. He stays aggressive. It's a special characteristic
he has, and it was big tonight.  
  
Q. Jay, I know Collin didn't have the game he wanted to on offense. What
about that play on defense that forced that charge in the last few seconds?  
JAY WRIGHT: He's so valuable to our team. He does all the little things.
Obviously, he's had big nights scoring. Defensively, he's always one of the
smallest guys on the court, and he's one of the toughest. He'll outrebound big
guys sometimes, but that charge was huge, man. That was a big play.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of struggled offensively for most of the game, and
you found your offense, specifically your three-point shooting late. How were
you finally able to get the buckets you wanted?  
JAY WRIGHT: We really couldn't run any offense. They just were switching
everything. We just put it in Phil's hands, and it's kind of embarrassing to
say as a coach, we didn't have any offense left. We just put it in Phil's
hands and told him to just make decisions. Drive it if you thought he could
get to the rim. If you didn't, try to find people for threes. When he got hot,
it forced him to leave to help, and then he found people for threes.  
  
Q. Eric, could you please put us in your shoes for the moment and walk
us through the play, the tip-in play to force overtime. What did you see on
the floor after Phil drove in?  
ERIC PASCHALL: The bench was yelling at me, "offensive glass", and I saw Booth
drive. I was on the weak side. Most shots go off on the weak side. I was
thinking aggressive rebounding and the ball was there. I just tipped it in,
and that was it.  
  
Q. Jay, can you talk about the way even though your three-point shots
weren't dropping, how does it feel to grind out a game like this and force it
into overtime and win it?  
JAY WRIGHT: Really proud of our guys. It's really gratifying as a coach to see
young people under pressure in a really tense environment keep a positive
attitude and stick to our core values, stick together, and just grind it out,
man. If you can take that into life and handle everything in life, that way
you're going to be a pretty successful guy. I was really, really proud that
they got to experience that, and I was proud that they did it.  
  
Q. Jay, you've had a lot of players have great performances up here.
Where does the performance Phil ranks?  
JAY WRIGHT: Right now the greatest ever (laughter). It's the only one I can
remember right now, Terry, honestly. I couldn't tell you another one right
now, when you give me some time, but right now that was the greatest one I've
ever seen.  
  
Q. Phil, talk to us about your ability to get to the rim off the dribble
and just take advantage of what you saw. You really seemed to be in a zone
late in regulation and then in the overtime.  
PHIL BOOTH: Just trying to stay aggressive. They're doing a good job on the
ball, just trying to get in the lane and either make a pass or either score.
So I was just trying to make a read on what the defense was giving me.  
  
Q. For Phil, this is the eighth consecutive tournament win for you guys.
I think it's the fifth straight final you're in now. Do you always have the
eyes of, this is our tournament? It's always full of Villanova fans. You guys
have had so much success here. What's kind of the whole attitude and mantra of
this team in this tournament?  
PHIL BOOTH: I definitely don't think it's our tournament. We were just down
seven a couple of minutes ago. We try to focus on the next game and focus on
the opponent in front of us.  
  
It's great how much the fans come out and support Villanova. You can hear it a
lot, especially when the game gets really tight. So we try to take each game
and take on our next opponent.  
  
Q. Coach, if you could talk a little bit more about Xavier. You saw them
twice in the middle when they were somewhat struggling, and then they beat
you. To come out of that, can you see a difference, a growth of them between
the last?  
JAY WRIGHT: Huge difference. Anybody who's in their first year in any sport --
the coach, the staff, you've got graduate transfers, you've got freshmen -- a
lot of people in their first year. That's what we're struggling with a little
bit. Our staff, we lost our two top assistants the last two years. Young guys
in new positions, graduate transfer, freshmen. They had it worse, new head
coach. It takes time, man. It takes time.  
  
What Travis did with that team from the beginning to where they're playing
now, I don't know all the tournament stuff, but that team could beat a lot of
NCAA Tournament teams, a lot, the way they're playing right now. I think it's
a credit to Travis and their program. They get all those guys back, man,
they're going to have a hell of a team.  
  
When we play games like this in the tournament, you don't want to lose,
definitely don't want to lose. But if you do, it would have been nice for them
to get in the tournament because that team is playing as well as anybody right
now.  
  
Q. Jay, this is very similar to that previous game. They were hurting
you in the paint, and it seemed like you were searching for a lineup where you
could defend the paint and yet still have an offense. Is this something, did
you learn some stuff, and is this something that might pay off later on if you
run into matchup with a team that's similarly talented?  
JAY WRIGHT: That's been our struggle all year, Bob. We have lineups good
defensively and we haven't found a way offensively with that group. And some
good offensive lineups and we haven't found a way defensively with that group.
So like football lineups, playing offense-defense a lot, and it got us
through.  
  
I think we did find some things. I don't want to share them. We did have the
defensive lineup in there offensively, and we did find some good things at the
end of this game.  
  
Q. Phil, I don't think you guys had a lead in the second half at all,
and we always talk about how young this team is with a couple of experienced
leaders. How comfortable are you executing down the stretch knowing the game
is basically on your shoulders at times?  
PHIL BOOTH: This is a whole new team. We've been in close games throughout the
season. We lost some, won some. We've been down the stretch in tough games. We
just try to stay together and just stay together. Get another stop. Don't play
the score. Get another stop. Get another stop, and play like that. Eric's tip-
in tied it up. We didn't even have the lead second half. I didn't even know
that. Just trying to tell the team, keep getting stops. Focus on the next
possession. That's all you can do.  
  
Q. Jay, going back to Gillespie charge in the game. When it's a tie game
and it's late, do you want your guys to go out and try to take a charge in
that situation, given that the call can really go either way and decide the
game?  
JAY WRIGHT: We want our guys to always try to make the right play. There are
time-and-score plays. You don't know if they're going to tap that in. They do
a good job of driving, putting it up on the glass, and then tap that in. So he
had to come to help, if they don't call a charge there, that could be an
offensive rebound. So it was a big play. We just wanted to make the right
play.  
  
Yeah, the play that was scary is at the end, you have one -- what, do we have
1.4 seconds or something like that? If you don't throw that ball inbounds and
they get it baseline out of bounds, that was the most difficult decision.  
  
Q. Coach, Hankins, it seemed like for a while you didn't have an answer
for him.  
JAY WRIGHT: The whole game we didn't have an answer.  
  
Q. What did you do to finally get him?  
JAY WRIGHT: He's so long. They do a great job of throwing it up over the top
to him. He's really got extension on the shot. We just try to keep Dhamir on
him as much as we could and try to pressure the passers. That's why at the
end, Welage got to the rim because we were up pressuring him so much, play
went right by us. It's just a constant cat and mouse game, trying to pressure
passers, trying to keep moving on him.  
  
They're very well coached on how to feed the post. Most teams aren't good at
that anymore. They're really good at that.  
  
Q. Coach, what elements do you take from a game like today and playing
in a championship game tomorrow that go right into next week and the week
after?  
JAY WRIGHT: There's pressure in these games here, and there's intensity in
these games here at the Garden that's like nowhere else. Believe it or not,
sometimes when you go to a first round NCAA game after playing here in a
championship game, it's actually a downer, and that has affected us in the
past. The intensity and the environment in the Garden is far more than an
early NCAA Tournament game. I worry more about that, after you play in this,
you get in a first round game. It's quiet. It's in the middle of the day, and
you were just in the greatest environment in basketball ever. That's my
concern about playing in games like this.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Seton Hall - 81, Marquette - 79  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: First off, my hat's off to Kevin. Kevin is one of the
best guys and best coaches in college basketball. So he had a really good
thing happen for him tonight. So for that, I'm happy for Kevin.  
  
I've never had anything like that happen in a basketball game before. It's
unexplainable. Unexplainable.  
  
Q. Coach, what happened with Markus' wrist? What's the update with him?
How did that affect his game?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: He was fine. He was well enough to play. He banged his
wrist. There's a lot of guys that are banged up. He's well enough to play.
Boy, he takes punishment, man. He takes a lot of punishment. We're going to
just have to get him through with all the bumps and bruises he's endured,
especially over the last few weeks.  
  
Q. Coach, what was the explanation they gave you for ejecting Sacar?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: He said it was his second technical.  
  
Q. What was unexplainable tonight?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Did you watch the game?  
  
Q. Yeah, I just wanted to know why you felt it was unexplainable.  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Just so many unusual things happened. I don't know if I
want to get into specifics. It was the most unusual basketball game I've ever
been a part of, and I feel bad for my kids. They're in there, and they're
sobbing. I wish our kids would have had a chance to decide the game and their
kids, too.  
  
Q. What did you think of the officiating?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I don't judge officials. That's for you guys to decide.  
  
Q. Coach, with everything that happened --  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: It's hard for me to keep track of everything that
happened. You're going to have to ask a more specific question. So many things
happened in that game.  
  
Q. With regards to the stoppages --  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: It was really tough for us not having our two best
defenders in the game, Sacar and Theo. Two of those guys are all-defensive
level players. It was hard for us, but I thought the other guys stepped up. We
put ourselves in a position to win. We didn't make some plays that we are
capable of making, and so down two guys, you know, and our two best defenders,
our guys showed a lot of grit. So that was good. That was really, really good.  
  
Q. What would you say to your players and all the fans were disgusted
the way that game ended, unfolded?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: We've got more basketball to play. We're going to the
NCAA Tournament. We've got a chance to do some things.  
  
Hey, the game of basketball can be extraordinarily crazy. We all were in the
gym tonight for an extraordinarily crazy game, and hat's off to Seton Hall.
Best of luck to them in the championship. We wish it was us, but it's not.
We're going to the NCAA Tournament. We're going to the NCAA Tournament, and
we're going to attack that.  
  
We're looking forward to having a breath of fresh air because we need it. We
need it.  
  
Q. Coach, you're going to the NCAA Tournament, you say. How do you put
this completely behind you? And any concerns about Howard and the bruises and
the bumps?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: No, he's going to be fine. Markus is a hell of a player.
He's bumped and bruised. He's been bumped and bruised all year. He'll just be
fine. We've got to regroup and get better. You know, usually in the NCAA, they
get back to the initial points of emphasis. So I think that will help Markus,
too.  
  
Q. It looked like there was some words exchanged in the post-game
handshake line. Do you want to share anything that was said?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: No.

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Travis Steele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36242)

### [Paul Scruggs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35160)

### [Zach Hankins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36252)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 71, Xavier - 67  
  
TRAVIS STEELE: Congratulations to Villanova. They've got a really good team.
It's a high-level game today. That's what everyone would expect for a Big East
semifinal game. Obviously, our guys were excited to play and have the
opportunity to compete against Villanova. We competed hard, man. We really
did. I thought we battled all the way to the very end. Unfortunately, we
didn't come up on top. We got to bounce back and looking forward to whatever
kind of the future holds here.  
  
Q. Travis, that Naji charge call there at the end of regulation, that
was a tough one.  
TRAVIS STEELE: Yeah, it was.  
  
Q. What did you see through your eyes, and how do you think that
affected Xavier moving forward?  
TRAVIS STEELE: I'm not going to comment on that. I will tell you that was a
huge, huge call, though.  
  
Q. Travis, I feel like this game is kind of almost a microcosm of what
you guys went through this year kind of fighting and never giving up. What do
you tell these guys after a game like this?  
TRAVIS STEELE: I'm proud of them, how we competed. I thought we competed the
right way. Villanova is obviously a really good team. We knew they had to get
our best. I always tell our guys, execution doesn't have to be perfect, but
our effort does. I thought that was there today. Obviously, we came up a
little bit short against a really good Villanova team.  
  
Q. Travis, you guys had Nova for a majority of the game, but over the
last 4:30 they held you to just one shot. What did they change that made it
difficult for you guys?  
TRAVIS STEELE: Nothing really. I don't think they changed anything
defensively. They were switching 1 through 5 most off screens and ball screens
throughout the game. We tried to get the ball to the rim as much as possible
for us to the post. Paul did a great job driving the ball as well. We just
came up a little bit short.  
  
Give them credit. Jermaine Samuels made two enormous threes. The one three hit
every part of the rim. Give him credit, he knocked them in.  
  
Q. The last two games we saw you guys play with different styles. Last
game Zach performed extremely well. Tonight Paul did. Can you speak to the
versatility of our team and how that could be beneficial to you going
forward.  
TRAVIS STEELE: We have a lot of good players. Paul stepped up. He was terrific
tonight. Zach was terrific. We had a lot of guys be really good tonight. I was
really proud of our guys' effort. When you scout Xavier, the go-to guy for us
is the open guy. I thought our guys did a pretty good job. I know we ended up
with 22 assists, right? We had 22 assists -- I can't read the stat sheet. 13
steals. So 22 assists on 27 made field goals is pretty dang good. It means the
ball was moving. Guys were making the right plays.  
  
Obviously, Paul did a lot of scoring tonight, but our guys did a good job
finding him as well.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you feel now about the NCAA? Do you feel -- I mean, a
win probably would have put you in, but do you feel better about it? Second, a
couple weeks ago, losing streak, you guys were taking it. What's been the big
difference, and are you surprised to be in this kind of position?  
TRAVIS STEELE: So I'll answer the first one first here. I will tell you, we
haven't even talked about the NCAA Tournament with our team at all. We know
what's at stake. Our guys know. We've just got to take care of business every
day, get better in practice, and let our playing do the talking, which I
think, again, if you see how we've been playing over the last month or so,
we're a top 30 team in college basketball for sure. We're a team that can
advance. There's no doubt about it. We won at Seton Hall. Won at Providence.
Won at St. John's. Beat them on our home court. Beat Creighton on a neutral
court.  
  
There's no question we'd be good enough to obviously advance. That's obviously
up to the committee to decide whether we're in or not.  
  
What was your second question?  
  
Q. Are you surprised after what --  
TRAVIS STEELE: I'm not really surprised. I think our defense has gotten a lot
better. Again, we played against a really talented Villanova team today. Eric
Paschall, Phil Booth. They're well coached. They move the ball. They're hard
to guard. They're really hard to guard. They space you out a lot like
Creighton did to us yesterday. Our defense has gotten a lot better. Like I've
been telling our guys, our defense travels whether playing at Cintas Center,
on the road, or here at MSG.  
  
Q. We all know how much talent Villanova lost from last year, but what
makes them so hard to put away? For 36 minutes you were the better team, and
they find a way to scratch and claw. What is special about their team this
year? What makes them so tough?  
TRAVIS STEELE: I think they have two tremendous seniors. I would start right
there. Phil Booth and Eric Paschall are First Team All League guys. They have
an ability to make tough shots, make plays. Those guys are hard to handle.
Starts with their leadership. You can tell on the floor. They're winners.
They're used to winning, right? They've been in positions like this a lot
during their career.  
  
And, again, for us, unfortunately, we came up short tonight, but I thought our
effort was good enough. We just came up a little bit short. Give Villanova a
lot of credit.  
  
Q. Coach, for much of the game, it looked like Villanova didn't have any
answers for Zach Hankins. Were you trying to get the ball into his hands much
in the overtime period?  
TRAVIS STEELE: Yeah. Zach, we tried to use our size to our advantage.
Obviously, they were fronting as much as possible. We were trying to clear
that back side, trying to lob over the top. Zach is 6'11", and Jermaine
Samuels is 6'7" or Dhamir Cosby-Roundtree is 6'8". So we were trying to pound
that ball inside as much as possible, but Villanova does a great job making it
difficult to get it in there. They do a great job of fronting.  
  
Q. To the players, what do you feel changed the most over the last
minute of regulation?  
ZACH HANKINS: Yeah, I think rebounding was big. I think -- I mean, a lot of
offensive rebounds we gave up to Villanova and let in second-chance points.
That more so is true for the overtime, but even that last play, that was a big
time offensive rebound by them. They're going to make tough shots, and we know
that, but we just got to stick to defensive rebounding. That wins games.  
  
Q. Travis, in that last time-out between Paul's free throws, what was
your message? I mean, did you tell him to leave it short and want someone to
come in and get that rebound?  
TRAVIS STEELE: Yeah. Obviously, we told him he's got to obviously hit the rim.
I wanted him to make the first, not have to even think about the second one
because what a lot of time happens is coaches will tell, hey, I want you to
miss the second one, but then they miss the first one. I wanted him to think
about making the first one, which he did a good job of.  
  
We tried to use Tyrique and obviously Zach. Size is our advantage. I thought
that was probably going to put us in the best position to win the game, try to
get an offensive rebound or foul right away, which obviously we fouled.  
  
Q. Travis, if the NCAA Tournament doesn't happen, do you still want to
continue to play with this team if there's another opportunity out there?  
TRAVIS STEELE: Absolutely. I love coaching these guys. These guys are working
hard every single day. Even when people were doubting us, we stuck together,
kept on working. We've still got a lot to play for. Hopefully, we'll be
getting back to practice here soon and see kind of what the next step is.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Myles Powell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36805)

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Seton Hall - 81, Marquette - 79  
  
Q. Kevin, what does it say about the guy on your right and your team and
your players that they could just withstand everything that happened out there
and keep their poise and finally put the game away? What does it say about the
growth of this team?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, I like the fact that Marquette came out really, really
good. Both the Hausers played phenomenal first halves, really, really tough
first halves. We got down, and we were a little sluggish today, I thought,
mentally. We weren't as sharp as we have been. But I thought both teams played
really, really hard. Both teams fought.  
  
I'm proud of the way my guys continue to fight even though there's times we're
not playing overly well.  
  
Q. Kevin, there's nationwide outrage right now over the way that game
ended. What would you say to your players, the fans, about what happened
there, what transpired, and how everybody handled it?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I'll probably be -- I'm not being political, but I thought
after the 12:00 mark, when they got all that straightened out, I thought the
three refs did a pretty good job, to be honest with you. It was an emotional
game. It's Friday night in the Garden, Big East Tournament. Both teams played
extremely hard. Emotions were running, which it's the Big East.  
  
And I thought after the scrum underneath our basket, I actually thought the
refs did a great job of kind of getting everything back where the kids were
playing and focused on playing, and I'm not just saying that. I thought they
did.  
  
Q. Myles, from your perspective, how did you feel your teammates
responded after every particular technical or tough foul was called against
you guys? It seemed like you guys made a big run, big surge every time that
happened. From your perspective, what are we seeing?  
MYLES POWELL: Like I've been saying to the media all year, the best thing
about this team is we're fighters. Our backs were to the wall the whole time.
We came together as brothers and had each other's back. Sandro did a great job
for me, and I love my teammates.  
  
Q. Are you having flashbacks to 2016 a little?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, a little bit. I mean, this team reminds me a little bit
of that just because we're young. We play really hard. We're scrappy. We're
led by a phenomenal player, just like we were with Isaiah (Whitehead), who's
as good as any player I've ever coached, but he's kind of done the same thing
as Isaiah. He's kind of put a team on his back and stayed with it. It's a
testament to him that he's an emotional kid and he's our emotional leader and
he's our leader, and he's done a phenomenal job, just like Isaiah did.  
  
Q. Myles, did you think that you had gotten ejected? Could you kind of
just walk us through the confusion after all that went down and then you came
back out?  
KEVIN WILLARD: He's not going to answer any questions about refereeing. I'll
answer all those questions.  
  
Q. Could you explain the confusion there.  
KEVIN WILLARD: The confusion was his first foul was a flagrant 1. It wasn't a
technical foul. When they came over and said that's obviously his second, I
thought James Breeding did a good job of going to the book and correcting it.
So I know he was a little upset after he got tossed, but I think it was more
of a scorebook error than it was anything else.  
  
Q. Coach, Markus Howard the last two games against you guys, 3 of 25
from the field. Could you speak about the job Quincy McKnight has been able to
do defensively against him.  
KEVIN WILLARD: Q and our big guys have done a really good job on his pick-and-
rolls, trying not to let him turn the corner. Markus is a phenomenal player,
can hurt you in so many different ways. You can tell by how many times he gets
to the free-throw line. He uses his body great off pick-and-rolls. But Q's
worked really hard, and I thought Romaro Gill was really good in pick-and-roll
defense in the second half, just using his length and being big. I think it
helps, when Markus is coming off pick-and-rolls, just trying to make sure he
can't see.  
  
I think we've done a good job in all three games, after the first half of the
first game, of just being big.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you need to do now to be rested and prepared for
tomorrow?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Hopefully, we can get out of here at some point. (Laughter).  
  
Oh, I'm not being funny right now. Was I supposed to be funny right now?
Tomorrow is just all on emotion. Nova had a tough double overtime game. Right
now it's just getting back, getting these kids something to eat, get them off
their phones, to be honest with you. That's going to be the hard part. And
tomorrow we'll do the same thing we did today. We'll wake up and prepare for a
really, really good Villanova team.  
  
I think one reason this game was so chippy is the fact we just played
Marquette. So everybody kind of knew everybody what they were doing, and I
think it's the same thing. Nova's -- we kind of know what we have to do, and
they know what they have to do against us. So I'm looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Myles, I know you can't talk, but could you just describe the range
of emotions, thinking you're thrown out, and then coming back, and the crowd's
kind of giving you a standing ovation as you come back to the court, almost
like a Willis Reed moment. I don't know if you're familiar with that.  
MYLES POWELL: It was crazy. Just to be able to get called back to the game. I
was happy. I felt like I let my teammates down. Them giving me a second
chance, I really appreciate it. It's all a blessing.  
  
Q. When the assistant coach went back there, what did he say to you?  
MYLES POWELL: He just said, "Coach said come back out." Once I heard that, I'm
wiping my tears. "Come back out?" So I ran back out. Yeah, I was just happy
they gave me a second chance.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Jay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13690)

### [Eric Paschall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35201)

### [Collin Gillespie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36757)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 73, Providence - 62  
  
JAY WRIGHT: Good effort against a Providence team that's really starting to
come together. The guys played a great game last night. If you look at their
team the last five or six games, even their losses, close losses, tough games,
and they're really playing good basketball. So I think we beat a good team, a
good physical, defensive team. It wasn't pretty, but you've got to be willing
to play ugly and win some of those games. So I'm proud of those guys that they
did that.  
  
Q. Eric, you and Phil have taken a big leadership role in this team and
obviously had a lot of young guys and new guys this season. Can you talk about
how this team has come together over the season and what you and Phil have
done to lead these younger guys.  
ERIC PASCHALL: Coach tells us we have to lead by example, talk to our younger
guys, and just do all the little things -- playing defense, rebounding, not
worrying about if our shot's going in. I just feel like our whole team has
been doing that. Our whole team's had a great attitude, and we're taking a
step in the right direction.  
  
Q. Have you seen great changes from November to December until now?  
ERIC PASCHALL: Yeah, definitely defensively, just getting better talking and
all those little things that we need to be to be a good defensive team.  
  
Q. Jay, what did you say during that time-out when they tied it at 44?  
JAY WRIGHT: I don't remember, but it wasn't anything awesomely inspiring, I
can tell you that. You know, we got some good shots. I thought we were still
playing pretty well. I just wanted to just kind of slow down the momentum.
They're a really emotional team. I mean that in a good way, like when they get
going, they get out on the break, and this place gets going crazy. They've had
a lot of success here because of that.  
  
It was more stopping that. I wasn't concerned with what we were doing.  
  
Q. Eric, it seemed like there was a more conscious effort from you to
attack the basket today. You've been struggling from three of late. Is that
something you've talked about, or is that just more how the game flowed
today?  
ERIC PASCHALL: Definitely feel it's just being aggressive. Coach gave me the
confidence to be aggressive, shoot threes, and also just take what the defense
gives me.  
  
Q. Jay, you told us a couple days ago that the first game of this
tournament can be the toughest for the younger guys. Did you see a little bit
of those jitters the first few minutes, and did you like how they settled down
as the game went on?  
JAY WRIGHT: I did. Saddiq Bey goes scoreless tonight. It's his first game in
the Garden in the Big East Tournament. It's impactful, man. It's impactful to
me now. I've been here, we don't need to talk about how long. Still when you
walk on that floor, it's different. It's exciting.  
  
I've also seen over the years in this tournament the team that plays the night
before, they're not affected the next day. It's if they win, it's the
following day. They're actually at an advantage because they played a game,
they're in a rhythm, and we've been sitting around for four or five days. So
that's what I was really concerned about, and I thought we did a good job
coming out ready to play.  
  
Q. Jay, it seems like whenever you and Providence meet in the Big East
Tournament, it's always a slugfest. What is it about the Friars that make it
so tough?  
JAY WRIGHT: I just think they're really well coached, and Ed's been there a
long time. I've been there. We really know what each other are doing, and
we've had so many tough games with each other. I think the players are very
comfortable in terms of style of play. The styles match up similarly. They're
very tough defensively, very physical. They are similar styles of play. I'm
probably complimenting us more than them when I say that, because they play
really physical. We want to be that physical and that tough. That's what all
these games have come down to.  
  
Look at last year, we went to the NCAA Tournament -- you can say it afterwards
pretty handily -- but this game here, we could have easily lost against
Providence in overtime.  
  
Q. I'm sure you told these guys this whole trip that you're starting on
every game's going to be hard, and you probably say that every year, and maybe
you mean it more this year, I'm not sure. But is there a value to this game
being as difficult as it was coming out of the chute so they really know that
now?  
JAY WRIGHT: I think you and I have been doing this long enough that you've
asked me that question before.  
  
Q. I can't remember.  
JAY WRIGHT: It usually is valuable to the other teams, but this team hasn't
really wanted for tough games. We've had plenty of them. In the other years
past, we've been dominant in some games. This team, every game's been a tough
game.  
  
So we would have taken an easy one, but it certainly wasn't. I'm happy that it
was a tough, physical game, and the guys played through it. They played
through the physicality. I thought it was really good.  
  
Again, Saddiq Bey fouls out in 15 minutes. It's a physical game. He's got to
learn how to play physical without fouling. That's what freshmen have to
learn.  
  
Q. Jay, you talked about wanting to get Cole in the game and get him in.
You got him in pretty early in the first half there, about eight minutes ago.
How do you think he played today? How valuable were his minutes?  
JAY WRIGHT: Really valuable, man. His length defensively was great. He did a
good job on the offensive glass. Offensively, he's always a threat to score.
He got himself to the foul line. We couldn't have asked for anything more. He
was awesome. You know, for being out -- he was out six weeks without being
able to play and being able to practice, probably hasn't played in a game
really in seven, eight weeks. It was really impressive. Really happy for him,
happy for us.  
  
Q. It seemed like Eric's defense in the first half kind of jump-started
you guys.  
JAY WRIGHT: Eric's?  
  
Q. Eric's defense in the first half kind of jump-started you guys.  
JAY WRIGHT: Yeah. There's a responsibility on Eric and Phil that's off the
charts. They're our loading scorers, but also we put them on the best players.
They have to defend them. He's our leading rebounder. There's just so much on
their shoulders. We don't feel sorry for them, they don't either, but it's
pretty impressive. And when he starts the game like that, it really does
inspire our team.  
  
Q. The question is about Eric and kind of just overall this season,
obviously, he's been in a different role. You've talked about how much you've
put on his shoulders. What areas has he specifically improved in this year,
and what's kind of the next areas that you guys are working on?  
JAY WRIGHT: He has really improved in each area of the game, but mostly in
being a playmaker, where he was always a great scorer and always a great
defensive player, great rebounder. We now put the ball in his hands to be a
playmaker, where he can score, he can get to the foul line, and he can get
other people shots. Today only credited for two assists, but he hit Dhamir
Cosby-Roundtree, which should have been on maybe three more assists for dunks.
And last game I think he had five assists.  
  
So the ability to do everything. He can guard every position. You know, I
think his game actually fits the NBA game better than college. I think he's
probably going to be a better NBA player than college, and he's a hell of a
college player.  
  
Q. Coming into this year, you had the two seniors, Phil and then Eric,
but how big has Colin Gillespie's kind of emergence this year for you as a
third scorer been?  
JAY WRIGHT: It's been awesome. He's the guy that really had the significant
playing time last year, even though it wasn't a lot, but we count on him in
some clutch situations. Again, he's another guy who's a sophomore and kind of
treating him like a senior. He's got to be a leader, and he's got a lot on his
shoulders too. He's been awesome all year. On and off the court, he's a leader
in this program.  
  
Q. For Eric, what was it that you saw in the Providence defense that
encouraged you to take the ball to the hole as much as you did today?  
ERIC PASCHALL: Honestly, just my teammates finding me in the right spots. It
wasn't anything that they were doing specifically. It was just my teammates
found me, and I tried to be aggressive and make the right plays, passing to my
teammates and try to just do everything.

### [Steve Wojciechowski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26981)

### [Sacar Anim](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34365)

### [Markus Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32862)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Marquette - 86, St. John - 54  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Proud of my team. Obviously, we have a great deal of
respect for St. John's. They made it incredibly tough for us in the regular
season, so we knew we had our hands full. Our guys really responded. It's a
new season. That's how we're approaching it, 0-0. We're proud of the first
step in the new season. At midnight tonight, go back to 0-0.  
  
I thought we played a complete performance. These two guys were terrific, as
were a number of our guys. Really good win on a big stage.  
  
Q. Markus, you guys have had trouble closing out games the last four
games. St. John's cut it to six in the second half, and you kind of keyed that
big run to break the game wide open. Did you kind of take the team on your
back a little bit?  
MARKUS HOWARD: No. My team actually kind of put -- they kind of helped me
through things. They really got us off to a great run. This guy over here
right next to me really gave us a spark to start the game. Sam and Joey really
were aggressive to start. It's kind of opened things up for me. We knew that
coming into this tournament, it was a new season, so we had to have a clear
mind.  
  
When they got on that run, we stuck together. We stayed positive. We knew that
we were going to have to throw a punch back in order to stay in the game and
extend the lead. That was kind of the thought process with that, you know,
just thinking next play, and that's what we did, and we were able to close it
out with a great win.  
  
Q. Steve, when you guys played St. John's throughout the regular season,
they swept you and made it a close dogfight. This time around, you guys beat
them in lopsided fashion. What changed to allow you guys to be so dominant?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I just thought it was one of our more complete
performances of the year. I thought our defense was outstanding to hold them
to 30 percent shooting from the floor and 15 percent shooting from the three-
point line. Ponds was 4 for 14. I thought it all started with our defense.
Then on the offensive end I thought we really shared the ball well. The ball
found the best shot a lot of times.  
  
So it was just a complete performance. They're a very good team. They have a
lot of very talented players, and we feel very fortunate to have won.  
  
Q. Markus, this is for you. Throughout your career, St. John's has done
a really good job of sort of limiting you offensively. What did they do in the
past, and what did you do differently tonight to sort of overcome that?  
MARKUS HOWARD: They definitely used their length and athleticism to their
advantage. They would speed me up a lot, and kind of what was the difference
tonight was, given my teammates, they really stepped up big in terms of taking
control of the game from the early start. Once they were able to do that, it
kind of opened things up for me. So just trusting them and them really getting
us off to a great start.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm going to give you a lot of credit personally because four
minutes in --  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: You know what, don't give me credit.  
  
Q. Four minutes into the second half, St. John's cuts it to six, as
these guys are talking about, less than four minutes in. All of a sudden, what
do you do, defensively, like you said, you throw a center fielder at them. If
people were watching the defense, you had two guys surrounding when they would
start a drive because they had three three-pointers the entire game. Went up
to 15 percent from three-point range. You stopped the drive. You put a center
fielder. And when they were driving, they would hesitate instead of taking it
through and pick up the fouls. That's where you won the game and won big.
Congratulations.  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Great question. (Laughter) Write that and put it all over
the Internet.  
  
Q. Obviously, Markus is a tremendous talent. He went out for 30 tonight
and could seemingly get 30 anytime. Is he at his best when he creates for
others, as well?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Markus is Big East Player of the Year for a reason, and
it's not just because he can score. You're talking about a complete player who
every team's game plan is geared to stop him. What he's been able to do this
year is fantastic. It's hard when you command that much attention from a
defense to make a great decision every time, especially when the ball is in
your hand a lot, but he's done that more times than not. I mean, the vast
majority of the time, or else he wouldn't be Big East Player of the Year.  
  
I thought he played with great poise, great pace. I thought his teammates --
this was a team win. This was a team win, but, again, he's a great player, and
we have a number of great players.  
  
Q. Steve, it's kind of a take on the last question a little bit. You've
known Markus for a good time now, and you've seen great performances from him.
Given this is a team he's struggled against, did you sort of expect to see the
best of him in a game like this?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I always expect to see the best of Markus because I have
an incredible amount of belief in him, but I've also been in the game of
college basketball long enough to know you're not going to pitch a perfect
game every time you step on the mound. Cy Young winners don't go undefeated.
So you're going to have games where you're not at your best. But, I mean,
there's nobody I'd trade him for. Come on, this kid's a great player, and he's
a great teammate, and his teammates are great with him.  
  
So we've just got to continue to focus on the 17 guys that are on our roster
and our coaches and let all the other noise dissipate because there's a lot of
noise this time of year. That doesn't serve anybody within our circle. So this
was a great win. We're going to learn why, and we're going to get on to the
next thing.  
  
Q. Sacar, it seems like every time you're scoring on the drive this
year, everyone else hits the three-pointers. What can you say about your
ability to just collapse that defense over and over and get through them on a
night like tonight, and they light it up from outside for you?  
SACAR ANIM: That was just a big focus going into the game, just trying to
penetrate and create for other teammates. Obviously, I have terrific shooters
around me -- Sam, Joey, and obviously Markus. So I want to get in there and
make a great decision, whether it's being on the finish or kick it out for the
three. So I just get a read off of it.  
  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: There's no question that our team is at our best when
Sacar is in attack mode, and when he's attacking it, at the end of that
attack, when he makes good decisions, our team takes on a whole other level,
and he did that tonight.  
  
Q. Marvin Clark has caused some issues in the past, but you hold him to
no points today. What adjustment was made defensively specifically on him to
stop that?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: You didn't like my answer? [ Sacar left the room ].  
  
Obviously, we put a number of different guys on him, and Sam and Joey were the
two primary defenders, and I thought they did a really good job on him.  
  
Q. Steve, could you just speak to what you guys did differently against
Ponds this time around. I mean, he had two really good games the first time
out, hold him to 14 points, just four field goals. What was different about
the way you defended him this time around?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: I thought you had great urgency and alertness defensively
against him. I thought we didn't allow him to play in space because, when he's
allowed to play in space, obviously, he's a great player. He hurt us, but I
think he's averaging 22 points a game. So he must have hurt more than just us.
Then we tried to make it hard for him to get it back when he gave it up.  
  
Q. Steve, I assume you think St. John's is a tournament team. If so,
what could they do in the tournament?  
STEVE WOJCIECHOWSKI: Obviously, I'm not on the committee, but they're a
terrific team. They're unusual in  
  
that they start five guys who can all play on the perimeter. They have
terrific isolation players, and they have a guy in Ponds who can take over a
game. So their defense is unusual because they can switch all screens, whether
it's on ball or off ball. I think they're an NCAA Tournament team. I'm hopeful
that will be the case. I personally think they're worthy of it, and I'm not
sure the committee cares what I think.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Travis Steele](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36242)

### [Zach Hankins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36252)

### [Naji Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36264)

### [Kyle Castlin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36773)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Xavier - 63, Creighton - 61  
  
TRAVIS STEELE: First of all, I want to give a lot of credit to Creighton. Man,
that was a heck of a game. Creighton really tests you in a lot of different
ways. Number one, they are really, really well coached. Offensively, they're a
juggernaut. With the pace they play at, the amount of shooters they have on
the floor, they're hard to guard. One of the harder teams in the entire
country.  
  
I thought, going into the game, we had to really be able to control the tempo
of the game. Had to be advantage Xavier, which I thought, early on in the
game, is advantage Creighton. Our guys with a little bit of gas, we were
playing up and down fast. They push it fast off misses and makes. We're
playing several of these guys a lot of minutes, so we've got to be able to
control the tempo, which I thought, as the game wore on, we did. I thought,
secondly, we had to be able to control the paint area. Obviously, Zach Hankins
had a tremendous night for us. Our guards did a great job of getting him the
ball, whether it was off drives, off pick-and-roll actions. Really proud of
our group. Obviously, we're excited to play against a really good Villanova
team tomorrow in the Big East semifinals.  
  
Q. Travis, could you speak to that final sequence there. Obviously, a
little bit chaotic. Kyle makes a great play, something of a broken frenzy
there. To your team's poise and how they were able to execute defensively.
Creighton was clearly trying to get a good shot or a foul. Neither of those
happened.  
TRAVIS STEELE: I thought, not even in the last play, Creighton was doing a
great job defending us. We went through a drought in the second half. I
thought our defense was still consistent for the most part. We were there on
the catch. Like I said, they spread you out all over the place, all over the
court with the shooters. They run great actions and make it really, really
difficult. I give our guys a lot of credit for staying locked in, making
multiple efforts. It's like I told our guys, the execution of our system may
not be perfect, but the effort has to be. You have to be able to make multiple
efforts against Creighton because they always put you in that situation where
they're going one more. Just one more pass, they say, to the open guy, and I
thought our guys did a great job playing hard trying to contest as many shots
as they could.  
  
Q. I have a two-part question. Coach, you guys were able to control Ty-
Shon in the second half. In the early part of the game, he scored 13 points
but in the latter parts you were able to prevent him from scoring. How were
you able to do that? Zach, how was it on the interior? Coach spoke about your
presence on the inside. How was it going up against Krampelj throughout the
game?  
TRAVIS STEELE: I'll answer the first question, then, Zach, I'll let you answer
that second one.  
  
I thought, number one, Ty-Shon Alexander is a very talented player. The
improvements he's made, honestly, going from freshman to sophomore years are
incredible. He's a great player. Naji's been one of the better defenders in
our league, in my opinion, during the Big East season. To me, he's been the
best defender in our league. He's long. He's athletic. He makes life really,
really tough on guys. And I thought he did a great job as the half kind of
wore on, in the first half because, you're right, he got off to a blistering
start, and give him credit, but I thought we tried to make him earn most of
his shots. He hit a big one there towards the end of the game on the pullup to
tie the game. You can't pitch a shutout with him with such a talented guard,
but I thought Naji was a big reason for that.  
  
ZACH HANKINS: Krampelj is a great player. He's a great post player, but he's
kind of a different animal because he's kind of expanded his game the second
half of the season to be able to shoot more threes and also drive off the
ball. It was definitely a little more challenging for me, being able to play
on perimeter a little bit outside of my zone. I was able to -- I've been a
shot blocker for a long time. That's one of my claims. It just kind of worked
out for me there. I was happy to do that.  
  
Q. Kyle, on their last possession, they seemed pretty flummoxed and not
sure what they wanted to do. Can you walk us through your block that sealed
the game.  
KYLE CASTLIN: I know they were coming down. They was trying to run the set.
The initial part, we defended pretty well. It was just a scramble. I knew -- I
saw the clock count down on the other end. I saw him try to make one toward
Ty-Shon. He was wide open. I knew I just had to put it all on the line to try
to seal the game.  
  
Q. Kyle, was that your first block ever?  
KYLE CASTLIN: No.  
  
Q. First block of the season?  
KYLE CASTLIN: No.  
  
Q. Two questions for me. First for Travis, earlier in the game,
obviously, when you play Creighton, pace is so important against them.
Seemingly, they were getting their way early, went up 22-13. Then you guys
tried to slow the game down. How were you able to do that? Then for Naji, how
are you feeling health-wise?  
TRAVIS STEELE: I'll answer the first part. Like you said, Creighton, the game
was a track meet at the beginning of the game. We just had to wind our guys
back in. I think, obviously, playing at Madison Square Garden, first time this
year -- when we played at St. John's, it was at Carnesecca, I think our guys
were excited to play. It's like I told our guys, we can't play P-I-G with
Creighton. Can't play H-O-R-S-E with Creighton. We got to slow it down. We got
to make it muddy. We got to make it ugly. That will give us a chance. And I
thought our guys -- Naji, Kyle, Q, Paul, our guards, for the most part, did a
great job, just kind of playing at our pace, slowing down, walking the ball
up, and taking our time.  
  
NAJI MARSHAL: I feel good, no pain. Just trying to ease my way back into the
game after missing three or four days.  
  
Q. Travis, I think it was, like, maybe the first 13 minutes of the
second half, Zach didn't even take a shot. Did there come a point where it was
like we got to get him back involved any way that we can?  
TRAVIS STEELE: Creighton, they're going to post trap every single time the
ball goes inside. When the ball goes in from the wings, and they do a great
job of it. They're really aggressive. They create a lot of turnovers off of
that. Zach had to get the ball different ways. I thought our ball started to
find him a lot more in ball screen situations, whether it was throwing it back
quickly, and making quick decisions, hitting him on a roll, a drop pass or
whatever it was. I know Naji tried to throw him a lob on the one turnover.
Would have been a heck of a highlight play if he'd made it. Wish he wouldn't
have thrown that one, but I think our guys were looking for them a lot more. I
thought we did a good job attacking the paint with our guards. Zach, to me,
was one of the best finishers in the country around the rim with his size and
length and athleticism.  
  
Q. Zach, when you played Creighton twice this season, they held you to
six and ten points respectively. Today you dominated with 22. Was it just a
matter of a revamped effort? What was on the floor allowing you to take
over?  
ZACH HANKINS: I just really take what is given to me. I don't create a lot for
myself. That's why I give so much credit to these guys. They find me. They
were able to get inside the paint and then draw my defender up and give it to
me. I can finish that. So I give a lot of credit to my teammates being able to
find me there, get Creighton in rotation, and just take what the game gives
me.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about some of the matchup issues that Creighton
creates. Now that you play Villanova tomorrow, do you have any thoughts on
playing them?  
TRAVIS STEELE: Obviously, it's been a while since we played them, but they're
really, obviously, a great team, and another well-coached team. Phil Booth and
Eric Paschall are tremendous players, both first team All Conference guys.
They're going to play small. A lot of times they'll play Paschall even at the
five, Jermaine Samuels at the five. I haven't seen them play recently because
you're always kind of consumed with the game that you have that's upon you,
but we're going to be who we are. I thought we did a really good job at center
on center guarding them, giving them different looks. I thought Zach impacted
the game, Naji played terrific, all these guys did.  
  
We've just got to play as hard as we possibly can, leave it all out there, no
regrets mentality, and be the attacking team.  
  
Q. Travis, you guys finished, I think, with nine turnovers. What was the
message to your guards, particularly navigating those ball screens because, as
you alluded to, you guys found Zach.  
TRAVIS STEELE: Number one, Creighton's become a much, much, much better
defensive team throughout the Big East season. And a big part of it is what
you're talking about, the ball screen defense. Krampelj is an incredible
defender. He moves his feet like a guard. He reaches constantly in ball
screens. They create a lot of turnovers out of ball screens. We worked really
hard on that over the last few days of our ball screen offensive game plan
going against them. I give all the credit to our guards. Our guards did a
great job of playing with poise, being strong with the ball, getting the ball
to where we wanted to get it. Obviously, Zach was the beneficiary of that with
several dunks and finishes around the rim.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, you had some tough times this season, the six-
game skid, and a lot of people doubted you, and here you are winning your
first game of this tournament. Do you think today was a statement win for you
guys the way you played and showed people you're not who you were before?  
KYLE CASTLIN: I think the losing streak this season for us was just a great
learning experience. We just take each and every game as it comes. I don't
want to necessarily say that we surprised ourselves or anyone else. We know
how good we can be and how good we are in practice each and every day. We're
just looking forward to the Villanova game tomorrow and just want to keep on
this run that we've been playing well with.

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Myles Powell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36805)

### [Kevin Willard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21832)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Seton Hall - 73, Georgetown - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Myles Powell and Coach Kevin Willard.  
  
Q. Kevin, you guys played so well in the first half. Are you a little
disappointed that you didn't finish it off in the second half, or how do you
feel?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Not at all, J.P. That was a good "W."  
  
I was thrilled the way we played. I thought we played well all game.
Offensively, we got a little stagnant, but that was my fault. That was kind of
-- come out, we did exactly what we wanted to do offensively and defensively,
and I thought we set a good tone.  
  
Q. Kevin, in your career, where does that first half for Myles rank in
the performances you've seen?  
KEVIN WILLARD: This is going to sound crazy. That's what I see every day. So I
don't think it's any different. I'm surprised -- I'll be honest. I'm just as
surprised we haven't seen more of that. I think he's played unselfish all
year, which is maybe one of the reasons. Any time he steps on the floor, I
expect to see that. So do his teammates, to be honest. It wasn't like we were
shocked in the locker room. It was kind of just Myles being Myles.  
  
Q. Myles, in terms of your performance and how you were able to get in
that zone, how did it feel to see your teammates finding you offensively and
everything just coming within the flow?  
MYLES POWELL: That's the best part about my teammates. They're always looking
for me. They're always cheering me on, my coaching staff, too. When you have a
group of guys like that, that's always behind you and pushing you forward,
it's a great feeling.  
  
Q. Just one quick one for Myles and then Kevin. Myles, how do you feel
right now? We saw you come down kind of awkward. How are you feeling
physically right now?  
MYLES POWELL: I feel great. I'm going to be ready for tomorrow. We're going to
prepare for a great Marquette team and go back to the hotel and get ready.  
  
Q. Kevin, this season has obviously been so unpredictable with the teams
and the way it's gone. You played Georgetown a couple weeks ago and had that
double overtime game. Talk about coming here and playing them and just the
game being so different and the way everything's played out for you just this
last week.  
KEVIN WILLARD: They played really well at home, and I was actually -- after we
lost the double overtime, I was really impressed with how hard we played
there, given how well they played. I mean, they beat Villanova pretty easily.
They beat DePaul pretty easily. So it was a place they've played well, which
young teams do.  
  
So I said it after that game, you know, I was very encouraged of the way we
played, and I thought we came out tonight really focused on what we wanted to
do. So we're a good basketball team, and when they're focused and we play
defense the way we do, we're very, very tough to beat.  
  
Q. Myles, you've obviously gotten it going a lot during your career.
You've had stretches like that before, but what was different about doing it
on this stage? You were showing a lot of emotion that first half, especially
off those steals and fast breaks you had. It just seemed something about being
here in the Garden and Big East Tournament that brought it to another level
emotionally for you.  
MYLES POWELL: I know what my teammates need. My coach always tells me, pick up
your energy, get your guys going. I was just trying to do whatever it took to
get my team going and for us to get the "W."  
  
Q. Coach, your defensive effort held them to 36 points percentage. Your
defense, is it where you want it to be, or are we expecting more?  
KEVIN WILLARD: No, I mean, at this point --  
  
MYLES POWELL: Coach is always expecting more (laughter).  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: No, I like where we're at. I do. I like where we're at. I think
we're understanding concepts very easily. For the most part, we're
complicated. That's one of the hard things about playing for me is that it's
not -- we do things that -- we do complicated things on defense to try to get
teams not to be comfortable, and I think at this point with this team, they
kind of understand what we're doing, and because our concepts are down, I
think that's why we've played some really good halves of basketball over the
last -- ever since February, to be honest with you. We've played some really
good defensive halves.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to Marquette tomorrow, Coach, what kind of challenges
are they going to present to you tomorrow with having played tonight and
obviously with them playing well in their quarterfinal?  
KEVIN WILLARD: They played really well. Obviously, I think the biggest
challenge is, obviously, I thought Markus played really well today. I thought
he played under control and got everybody involved. That's what makes him hard
to defend and hard to stop is the fact that, when the Hausers are spacing the
court, and Sacar -- I always mess his last name up, and I apologize. Anim. I
think when he plays the way he played in the first half, they're really tough
to beat. The good thing is we just played them on Wednesday. The reviews will
be quicker. The guys will understand what we're doing. We'll make some
adjustments offensively and a few tweaks defensively, but for the most part,
we have to deal with one of the best players in the country.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about your ability to make teams uncomfortable with
your defense. Are you more confident in your ability to do that against a team
like Georgetown that does have a really young core that's led by three
freshmen?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, our whole game plan was to make sure, if you can get
young kids to stop and think what they're doing on offense, it really takes
them out of a rhythm. We were successful at home doing that. We were really
successful actually there doing it. We just didn't play well offensively
there. Tonight was the same thing, just trying to get -- Akinjo is to
talented, McClung, and they play with so much emotion when they're making
shots. The biggest thing for us is to get them to try to stop and think, be
aggressive with them, and just keep them off balance.  
  
Q. For Myles, were you aware that it was a tournament record for the
first half? And what does that mean when you think of all the great players
who have been in this event and this building?  
MYLES POWELL: I didn't know that. Tom just told me walking out of the locker
room, but it's truly an honor and a blessing from the man above to be listed
with those group of names.  
  
Q. Myles, one more. At the end of the half, when you really had it
working, it kind of seemed like you were testing a little bit, a little heat
check at the end. I wonder what was going through your mind. You guys had a
big lead, so it wasn't like you were going to throw away a possession.  
MYLES POWELL: I just had made two or three in a row, and Coach called a play
for me to get one up. I just ran the play and I saw his hands down and just
tried to let another one go up.  
  
Q. Kevin, after the double-double against Villanova, Sandro goes for 12
and 10 and got involved on the defensive end, too. What have you seen from him
the last few games that has raised his confidence and adds another dimension
to this team?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Sandro has been an unsung hero a lot this year because he's
been really good with pick-and-roll defense. He's battled big guys. He gets a
little worn down offensively with the amount of size he's battled. I think the
biggest thing with Sandro is he's been more aggressive offensively, looking to
shoot, which we've been yelling at him to do all year. Just looking at him to
be more aggressive. And I just think, you look at him and Myles Cale, you have
two sophomores who didn't play a whole lot last year who now got thrown onto
the big stage. I just think you're starting to see kids grow up. When kids get
a little more confident, that's a good thing.  
  
Q. Kevin, when Myles picked up his second foul, I think there was six
minutes left, you guys were up by 20 at that point. Quincy had two. Was there
any consideration to take him out given where the score was?  
KEVIN WILLARD: I take Q out because Q's emotions run -- he'll pick a third up
because Q is going to try to be aggressive defensively. It really is the one
true blessing about how bad a defender my guy is over here is I know that he
knows he has two fouls and that I know he ain't picking up a third foul.  
  
MYLES POWELL: Unless it's offense (laughter).  
  
KEVIN WILLARD: He starts running for like -- I'm surprised he didn't try to
start guarding you guys in the first half. He's going to look for someone
that's going to stand around a little bit. So I trust him. This is my third
year with him. I know he knows what's going to go on. Even though we're up 20,
we're in a good rhythm. He was in a good rhythm. I didn't want to take him
out.  
  
Q. Coach, Myles Cale, you mentioned as of late, six threes against
Villanova, three again today. It seems as the season has gone on, he's not
only gotten more confident, he's taken smarter shots. Have you felt the same
way about that?  
KEVIN WILLARD: Yeah, I just think that him and Sandro are guys that -- they
want -- I use him as an example. His freshman year, he got taken out every two
minutes, every two minutes, because it was a disaster. And those -- Sandro and
Myles Cale didn't really get that opportunity last year. He got the
opportunity as a freshman to play with a group that was still learning. Myles
and Sandro played behind four seniors. So they never really got the chance to
-- I just think that Myles Cale and Sandro have just stayed extremely steady,
they've worked extremely hard, and you're just seeing two really good
basketball players start to grow into themselves.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Chris Mullin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16805)

### [Justin Simon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34842)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Marquette - 86, St. John's - 54  
  
Q. You guys were able to get it close. What changed after that in terms
of what they were showing you?  
CHRIS MULLIN: Offensively, we struggled all night. I thought we cast up too
many early and bailout shots. We never got anything going offensively. The
game changed. We got off to 11 or 13 to 5 to start the half. We struggled
offensively. We got some stops and got on the floor a little bit, but they got
free on the open floor. We had a few miscommunications. That's the type of
team they are. They hadn't done it to us this year, but I've seen them do it
to good teams. They got that quick run and opened the lead up. We had no
rhythm offensively, and our defense broke down. It doesn't take much for them
to create separation. That's pretty much what happened.  
  
Q. How confident are you that you're going to make the NCAA Tournament,
and what would your case be to the committee?  
CHRIS MULLIN: I'll be watching Sunday. I'm not really here to make a case. If
I need a lawyer -- we do what we did, and we'll see what happens Sunday. No
politicking. I stay out of politics.  
  
Q. Obviously, the way your team fell behind in the second half, as you
watched that play out, did it seem like they were abandoning the coaching
philosophies and what you expected to happen in this game? Or did you need
more analysis in the final 15 minutes?  
CHRIS MULLIN: I give a lot of credit to Marquette. I think they're a terrific
team, one of the best teams in the country. I think they're a phenomenal
offensive team. As far as abandoning my coaching philosophies and techniques,
no. When you get beat, it's easy to look at things in one way. So in my mind,
we just let the game go and clean our minds and our bodies and come back and
give our best effort, whatever that may be.  
  
Q. Chris, obviously, there's nothing you can do anymore to -- you've
already built your case for the NCAA, your team. There's nothing for the next
three days that you can do, but you personally, you're just going to wait
until Sunday and see whatever happens happens, or are you going to pay
attention to the other games that can possibly effect? Or are you going to
ignore that and wait to hear from the committee on Sunday?  
CHRIS MULLIN: I told my guys to take a break. They need a break mentally,
physically, little break from each other, and we'll get back together Sunday,
have a good practice, and then probably watch the selection show and see
what's what.  
  
Q. Coach Mullin, St. John's was undefeated, obviously, before Big East
play and it was kind of an up-and-down conference run. What are the things
that you feel could have been done differently and things you can implement
for postseason play even if you don't make the NCAAs, you should be in
postseason play anyway. So what are some adjustments you can make to be more
consistent?  
CHRIS MULLIN: I think being resilient. I think consistency comes with
discipline, good daily work habits, work ethic, and a lot of those things take
time. From where we came from, we're actually much better than we were,
believe it or not. If you look at our conference, from top to bottom really, I
think in some ways probably very underrated. Yeah, I guess it depends how you
look at it. You can look at it as a loss of one or two possessions. Would I
like to change them? Yeah. I'd like to make a few more free throws and grab a
few more offensive rebounds, but you're talking about 33 games now of
analyzation. So each game has its own personality and its own set of
circumstances.  
  
We're in a position now we're taking two days off and going to come back
refreshed and give it a good run.  
  
Q. For Justin, you guys were in the same spot here last year, where you
had a good first win, and then you came back and kind of took a lopsided loss.
How much of a factor do you think is that that you played the night before and
you're playing a fresh team, and how much of a factor was that tonight, do you
think?  
JUSTIN SIMON: It's a big factor. It's a big factor for sure. A little stress
on our bodies, to come out here and play a great team like Marquette. You
know, they're fresh. It was tough. We knew it was going to be challenging, but
we were up for the challenge, I felt. Tonight, we just let it go a little bit.  
  
Q. Justin, let's say you get to the tournament. How do you bounce back
from a loss like this?  
JUSTIN SIMON: It's a fresh start, in my eyes. Coach said we're going to take
these days off and regroup and get our minds and bodies right and wait until
Sunday and see what happens. Just looking forward to that.

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Greg McDermott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15827)

### [Martin Krampelj](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36768)

### [Ty-Shon Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36769)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Xavier - 63, Creighton - 61  
  
GREG McDERMOTT: Congrats, Xavier. Obviously, they made some big plays down the
stretch, big offensive rebound on that last possession. Proud of the way our
guys battled. We didn't have our A-game, certainly, today. Xavier's size and
physicality certainly had something to do with that. But we kept fighting. We
kept digging. We got ourselves back in the game and gave ourselves a chance to
win it. Unfortunately, we didn't execute the last play very well. I saw
something. I thought Davion had one more pass to tie for an open three. So
elected not to take the time-out, obviously, in retrospect. I'd do it
different next time. Still proud of my team, really have enjoyed coaching this
group. Hopefully, there's some basketball left for us.  
  
Q. The last play, Ty-Shon, just what did you see, and what were you
trying to do with the final shot?  
TY-SHON ALEXANDER: I was trying to create a play for one of my teammates to
hopefully either get a wide open three or eventually just try to get a play
down the stretch to get  
  
"Teeny" a wide open look up in the paint, as well, but somehow they just
didn't execute.  
  
Q. Greg, you sort of mentioned you hoped that there's some basketball
left. I guess what would your case be for Creighton to be included in the NCAA
Tournament?  
GREG McDERMOTT: We're -- I think we're 3-7 when we have -- when either Marcus
was out or Damien Jefferson was out. Obviously, Damien Jefferson is still not
totally back to normal and hasn't played a lot. 15-7 against a really good
schedule on the year. It just depends. It depends if playing a good schedule
is going to be rewarded. We played one of the better schedules, top ten
schedule in the country, and if that's important, then we'll have a shot. If
the committee decides that it's not that important, then we won't.  
  
I don't think anybody really knows what this new NET means, how much they're
going to use it. I think everybody had an idea in the past. If your RPI is
terrible, you're probably not getting in. If your RPI's good, it doesn't
necessarily mean you're in, but at least you're in the conversation. I just
don't know that anybody understands exactly what's going to happen. So we'll
wait and see. Hope we get in. If we don't, we'll give it everything we have in
the NIT.  
  
Q. Greg, early in the first half, you guys were playing a really good
pace. You guys were making shots early. Did they do something to slow you down
specifically, or was it more on you guys just not hitting looks after that?  
GREG McDERMOTT: I think we had three turnovers in the last seven possessions
of the first half, seven or eight possessions, and they scored on the last
three. So, obviously, you're taking it out of the net, it's hard to have pace.
But I thought we had some guys that maybe had the jitters a little bit.
Obviously, it's -- besides our freshmen that we're playing and sophomores in a
new role, really, this is Martin's first experience in the Garden. He didn't
play much as a freshman. He was hurt last year. So it's the first time that,
even though he's a fourth-year junior, first time he's experienced it, and I
think until you've been there and done it, I think the enormity of it can
maybe get to you. I think at times it did us today.  
  
I just didn't think we were ourselves with our pace, with our ball movement at
times, and then we have really been flying around defensively and forcing our
opponents into errors, and today we weren't able to do that. Again, that's a
credit to Xavier and their ball security.  
  
Q. Coach, as the team went through some droughts throughout the game,
what were some points of emphasis that you harped on to keep your team engaged
in? As you saw, you guys were able to make a run at the end.  
GREG McDERMOTT: We've been really good defensively really, and today, I think
it was a 65-possession game, and they had 63 points. Over the last 10, 11
games, we've held teams, on average, below one point per possession. So we
felt like our defense could be good enough to get us back in the game if we
just stick to things. And we did, for the most part. Obviously, Hankins had a
great night, or a great afternoon, and some of the guys that you would
probably worry about a little bit more in Marshall and Scruggs and Goodin, you
know, their numbers weren't great. The rest of the team, I think, was 15-45,
and Hankins goes 11 of 15. We didn't have an answer for him. His offensive
rebounds, it seemed like every one was a back breaker.  
  
We were fine in the huddles. We had full confidence we could get back in the
game and win the game defensively and then with our ball movement on the other
end of the floor.  
  
Q. Greg, just a couple of questions about the end. Did you consider
going big at all knowing that offensive rebound was a possibility, I guess, on
that last possession?  
GREG McDERMOTT: Well, they had four guards in, so no. You know, like somebody
would have had to guard a guard out on the perimeter. So we got him --
actually, Goodin took a long two, which is exactly the shot we wanted him to
take. We just didn't clean up that back side on the boards. I didn't see what
happened. I'd have to go look at it on film to see if he just made a great
play or if we missed a blockout.  
  
Q. And then your last possession, I would imagine, ideally, you wouldn't
want to wait until the end, but was that the message to wait for the last
shot?  
GREG McDERMOTT: No. We had a play call that just didn't get executed. When it
broke down, like I said, when Davion got it back, I felt like two guys ran at
him and left Ty-Shon, and I thought he had the opportunity for one more pass
to Ty-Shon. When Ty-Shon caught it, whether he didn't catch it clean, he
decided not to shoot it on the catch, and by then, it was a little late to
take a time-out.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm looking at the board as we're looking at percentages. Free
throws. You had eight free throws for the entire game, hit three of them, 3 of
8. That's five points right there. Is there -- you were happy with the shot
that you got because he can hit it as far as the three-pointer is concerned,
but driving to the hoop, was there a reason that the fear of going down low
against Xavier?  
GREG McDERMOTT: Obviously, they've got some length down there with Jones and
Hankins. When we got in there, we missed some layups the first half. We had
some really good opportunities close to the basket that we didn't finish.
While we struggled shooting free throws in November and December, we've been a
really good free-throw shooting team in conference play. Today we missed him.
The good news is I think they only had 12. We haven't been a team that's
fouled a lot, and as long as we're not putting them on the free-throw line a
lot, we're good with that. We just missed our free throws and the
opportunities we had today.  
  
Q. Martin, just what, for you, was a difference in the second half?
Obviously, you got going and made some buckets. What was the difference for
you?  
MARTIN KRAMPELJ: Just got more comfortable with the space around me, just like
Coach Mac said, that's probably the first time for me playing in here. Just
taking advantage of what they gave me and tried to take it to the hoop.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

### [Isaiah Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28497)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Villanova - 73, Providence - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: Providence is here. Isaiah Jackson with Coach Ed Cooley.  
  
ED COOLEY: The highs and lows, you know. Definitely thought we had great
energy coming out. I thought we had a great game plan. I thought in the second
half, particularly the last ten minutes, was kind of what our year has been,
up and down, make a shot here, keep it close. You know, I thought Villanova's
-- in particular, Paschall, Gillespie, and Booth -- did a good job leading
their team, and there are other guys that play a great role for them.  
  
I was proud of our guys. I thought our effort was good. I thought our energy
was great. We just made too many mistakes. We made a lot of costly mistakes,
especially late, and they capitalized on them. We didn't have an opportunity
to -- you know, to make the right adjustment as far as physically, and they
took advantage of it. Sometimes you have these games, but in tournament play,
you've got to play your best. Today the best team advanced and look forward to
seeing where our next step will be.  
  
Q. Coach, Alpha Diallo was very efficient today, but it never seemed
like he was involved enough in the offense for you guys to win. Did you feel
like that was the case?  
ED COOLEY: You know, I think you've got to give Villanova a lot of credit.
They know he's a focal point for us. I thought he had some looks that he
normally makes, but I think you've got to credit Villanova on what they did
defensively.  
  
Q. Ed, you had 44-44 in the second half and they went on a little spurt.
What happened there? Was it just a matter of you guys with a couple turnovers
and then they made some shots?  
ED COOLEY: In that sequence, if I can remember correctly, we had a really big
transition layup that we missed, really big, and then they came and hit a
three, and we turned the ball over the next possession. When you play like
that against those teams, they're very methodical. They're older. It's hard to
make a comeback on that.  
  
Q. Positives out of this game and toward the end of the season? Coach
Wright said that your team was starting to come around. Do you feel that? Do
you have optimism about the rest of the season?  
ED COOLEY: I'm always optimistic. Part of athletics, you're going to lose, but
I'm proud of our guys. I definitely think we improved as the year went on. I
thought guys got comfortable in their roles. I thought we made the right
adjustments to keep us moving forward. I'm proud of our guys.  
  
It was an up-and-down year, but there's a lot of things to be happy about. I
think our future is incredibly bright. I think the league is in great hands. I
think the league is very healthy with how young we are. It's easy to get up
here and piss and moan after a loss, but at the same time, you have to
recognize the job that Villanova did. They were the veteran team. They were
the more physical team today. They deserved the win, and we didn't.  
  
Q. Ed, do you think your team is in position now to get an NIT bid?  
ED COOLEY: We talked to the team about that, and quite frankly, I was very
direct with the team. We earned exactly what we got this year. If we get into
the NIT, I'll be excited about it because I still want to play with this young
group. If we don't, we've got to look ourselves in the mirror. We deserve to
be in that 8-9 game. That was our body of work.  
  
If we get in, I'll be very excited. I hope we do. If we're not, I'm going to
be really proud of the guys and the effort that they had. But we left a lot of
games on the table with our inconsistent approach in some of the games.  
  
Q. Hey, Ed, just going off of that, with going into a tournament like
the NIT, how much of a benefit would that be for some of your younger players
just to get postseason experience like that?  
ED COOLEY: The Big East Tournament really helps with that, the fact that we
got a couple of games under our belt with that really gives them something to
look forward to.  
  
We'll learn from this if we have an opportunity to play another game as far as
a lot of the mistakes that we made, but there was a lot of positives today,
too, to come back. I don't know if we took the lead. I think we tied it. I
don't know if we ever got over the hump.  
  
But we'll draw some positive from this. You know, the negative is we lost.  
  
Q. You talked a couple times this year just about how challenging it was
for you as a coach, just with the ups and downs. I'm curious if you learned
anything about yourself as a coach this year that you want to share.  
ED COOLEY: I did, and I think that's a great question. I learned I can't get
frustrated early. I think I have to coach with a little bit more joy for the
game and not anger when we're developing such a young group. I think that got
in the way a little bit. Sometimes in some of the games, if I'm being self-
critical, I'll learn that there's a long season, and you've got to go with the
ups and downs. It's better to be more loving than frustrated.  
  
Q. For Isaiah, just thoughts on this game today, Isaiah, and also on
your career at Providence and playing in the Big East Conference.  
ISAIAH JACKSON: My thoughts on today's game, I feel like we came out and we
fought hard. They kind of came out and was way more physical than we were in
the beginning. I feel like the second half, we made adjustments and came out
and gave ourselves a chance and just lack of discipline in the second half
kind of hurt us -- late switches, miscommunication, offensive rebounds, threes
-- it just killed us in the second half and first half.  
  
But on my career, I love Providence College. I appreciate everything that
they've done for me, especially this man on the left. Thank you for bringing
me into this family. I really appreciate that.  
  
ED COOLEY: Appreciate that.  
  
ISAIAH JACKSON: And I'll always be a Friar.  
  
Q. Do you ever feel like they're flying under the radar? They're the
defending national champs. Everybody is talking about Duke and Zion,
SportsCenter. It's almost like people think Duke is going to win
automatically. Does it help Villanova in some ways that they're kind of flying
under the radar here?  
ED COOLEY: I'm not big on listening to naysayers. Villanova's a great program.
They're a great team. I really don't watch a lot of the other leagues. I
concentrate on what's happening in ours.  
  
I do think they're undervalued. When you play them, you run into a really
physical, methodical, tough team. And, again, with some of the television
stations, it could be alienated purposely. I'm really appreciative of what Fox
does for us, but when you look at our league top to bottom, this was a league
where many of us struggled based on our youth and all the people that we lost.  
  
The league will be a monster again next year. We'll be in this room again next
year having the same conversation. Villanova will be good. Providence will be
good. Xavier will be good. Creighton will be good. St. John's will be good.
Butler will be good. So for everybody who doesn't think Villanova is still one
of the elite teams in the country, wait until they play them.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [James Akinjo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36802)

### [Patrick Ewing](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17044)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Seton Hall - 73, Georgetown - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's go for questions for Coach Ewing or James.  
  
Q. Patrick, you said coming into this game that energy and effort would
be the difference. It seemed like you guys came out strong tonight, but what
did you think was the difference maker early in the first half there?  
PATRICK EWING: Turnovers. Turnovers hurt us. You know, we went down big early,
and it was trying to dig yourself out of a hole, and when the turnovers,
unforced turnovers hurt us. They had 22 points off our turnovers the entire
game. But I think in the first half, they had 12 points off our turnovers, and
that's something that we can't -- it's hard to overcome. When you're turning
it over and you're not getting stops, the other end, it's hard to win.  
  
Q. In the first half, you guys missed easy baskets. Did you feel the
moment was overwhelming?  
PATRICK EWING: I don't think the moment is overwhelming. Even though it's the
Big East Tournament, it's a big game, but we've been in other big games. Their
trap put us back on our heels, and we weren't able to get in the floor of our
offense. Then we couldn't -- we're digging ourselves out of a hole for the
whole entire game. I think that's what also hurt. The turnovers, then the trap
slowed us down. We weren't able to get into a good flow, and that hurt.  
  
Q. James, this is the third time you guys have followed a really big win
with a loss like this. How do you account for that difference or kind of the
yo-yoing there?  
JAMES AKINJO: Maturity. I think as a team, we're not as mature as we need to
be right now.  
  
Q. Patrick, what was your message to this team at the end, especially
your senior class that's leaving?  
PATRICK EWING: I didn't really say anything to the senior class. I just said
it's disappointing, we have a good enough team that we could be playing
tomorrow, but because we didn't come with the right focus and the right
effort, we fell short.  
  
Q. Coach Ewing, talk about the chances for the NCAAs and your case for
making the tournament.  
PATRICK EWING: I'm not sure what it's going to be. It's hard when you leave
the decision in other people's hands. We had an opportunity where, with wins,
we would have had enough -- you know, our record would have been good enough
to be able to move on. Now we still have a good record, but it's in somebody
else's hands to put us in or not.  
  
Q. Patrick, Powell is obviously a great player, and he had a hell of a
half. When you're watching that, what are you trying to think of to stop
him?  
PATRICK EWING: He's a very good player. This is the second time he's had a
great game -- the third time he's had a good game against us. He got hot in
the first half. We did everything. We tried to trap him. It didn't work. He
was able to drive away from the trap. In the second half, we switched it a
little bit, and that kind of slowed him down a little bit. He got hot in the
first half, and everything he shot, he made.  
  
Q. Coach, so how do you feel like Georgetown has made strides from last
year? Like what's some differences that you see from last year to this year?  
PATRICK EWING: The difference is the freshmen. The freshmen, they play great.
They had -- they played extremely well. They had their highs and their lows.
For the most part, I thought that they had a great season.

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Chris Mullin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16805)

### [Shamorie Ponds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32815)

### [Justin Simon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34842)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
St. John's - 82, DePaul - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: Shamorie Ponds, Justin Simon, and Coach Chris Mullin.  
  
Q. Coach, can you speak to Justin Simon's energy in that first half when
you guys really needed a strong presence when the game was close?  
CHRIS MULLIN: Obviously, being named Defensive Player of the Year yesterday,
we rely on him tremendously to set the tone. I thought tonight he did that.
And as important as that was having his teammates behind him. Shamorie did a
great job. We had a little bit different game plan. He executed to perfection.
There was a total team effort. But these two guys here set the tone for
everything we do. Like most teams, the guards set the table, offensively and
defensively. Tonight they led the way.  
  
Q. You did a great job shutting down Max Strus, he lit you guys up for
43 points in the last game. What was your strategy? Anybody can answer.
Coach?  
CHRIS MULLIN: From my standpoint, it was to get Justin in the game. I just
told him last game he had seven at halftime. Justin picked up a few fouls.
When he came out, the guy got going. He's that type player, it only takes a
little bit for him to catch fire, and that's what happened.  
  
I just thought again tonight Justin was instrumental in setting the tone, and
then Shamorie and the rest of our team did a good job. When he did catch, he
was looking at two, three, four bodies.  
  
Q. Justin, a very, very important game for your program. Can you sort of
speak to how you feel about savor an assignment, like trying to turn that
guy's water off?  
JUSTIN SIMON: Say that again?  
  
Q. How much you savor the assignment to turn Strus' water off.  
JUSTIN SIMON: Like Coach said, it's a team effort. Strus is a great player. He
can get hot. Just like our guys, they were extending the floor, I was running
off the line just trying to make him uncomfortable. I thought it was a great
team effort out there, and we played hard.  
  
Q. Shamorie, third time here at the tournament. This is so different
from last year you've been to, I guess. How much have you been looking forward
to having a chance to play a game this meaningful this time of year?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: Definitely important for us. I felt like with this group we
could do something special. We are definitely, definitely looking forward to
each and every game. We packed for four days, so we're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Chris, when you look at Shamorie's development this season in
particular, what strides have you seen in his game, and what other strides
could he make in his development to improve going forward?  
CHRIS MULLIN: First and foremost, you're looking at one of the most, for three
years as a St. John's player, maybe the best across the board. Each and every
year, he's gotten much better. He's got a lot of God-given instincts and
ability, but he works hard at his game. I think his defense has improved. I
know for sure his playmaking and his ability to affect the game not just by
scoring. I was always told good players do for themselves and great ones do
for others. He's making players around him better, which is a compliment to
him and his teammates are feeding off of him.  
  
Q. For Shamorie, when you're having such a great night shooting from the
floor, how do you keep it in your mind also distributing to your teammates and
get seven assists and manage to see the floor like you did tonight?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: I mean, well, my teammates, they give me great confidence. I
feel like, with them guys backing me up, there's like no pressure on me. Them
guys, they come on and play hard every night.  
  
Q. Chris, how could you after three losses, just wipe it clean and come
out here tonight like at any point this season when they were playing well?  
CHRIS MULLIN: I felt good about that. We actually have done that. Look at some
of our losses, we didn't play 40 minutes of bad basketball. It was stretches
that things happen in different times of those games that affected that
particular game. So I think we've done a good job.  
  
I always preach to these guys, and I know it sounds kind of silly, but just
our daily habits. That's what it's all about. Makes more sense, some are 55
and 21, but they've done a good job of that. These guys have been with me
three years, they've done a really good job of not only mentally but
physically taking care of their daily schedule.  
  
That's what I always tell them, you can only take care of what's in front of
you. They get that text every day of their daily schedule. Stick to that, and
we'll come back tomorrow and do it again.  
  
So, yeah, we made some adjustments, but to me just having the season end and
coming to the Big East Tournament, my biggest message to them is to come back
mentally and physically fresh. It's a new season. That should reenergize us. I
thought they did a good job tonight on doing that.  
  
Q. Chris, could you speak to Justin's defensive performance today.
Obviously, he's the Defensive Player of the Year in the conference. So he's
had a bunch of good ones. Would you say that this rates among his better
ones?  
CHRIS MULLIN: He's had some great ones. He really has. This is right up there
because, as you play against guys two and three times, it gets tougher. You
know, it gets tougher on both sides, offensively and defensively. But to
maintain that type of mental focus, physical exertion, that's why he's the
Defensive Player of the Year. I was telling you guys that a little bit here
and there, how good he had been playing.  
  
I think it shows up when you play against a guy like Strus and Markus Howard
and things like that, but he's done stuff, you know, in games where maybe he
didn't shine as much. But he's a typical lockdown defender. When you think of
a long athletic guy that can run guys off screens, take away the catch and
shoot, play guys off the dribble, play guys in the post. So, I mean, it's a
well-deserved reward, and we rely on him a lot.  
  
Q. Shamorie, coming back tomorrow night for Marquette, what does it do
for you having beat these guys twice already this season?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: I mean, it definitely shows that we can beat them. We've just
got to have the same game plan that we beat them guys at their home and our
home. So looking forward to the game.  
  
Q. Chris, when you spurred away a little bit in the second half, it
seemed like maybe Shamorie was becoming a little more assertive offensively.
I'm not sure if it was a plan or just something that happened in the middle of
the game. Did you notice that Shamorie was helping you lead the second half?  
CHRIS MULLIN: Yeah, I think that had a huge impact, and that's usually our
game plan. I also thought the second half we did a little bit better job on
the open floor. We got some stops and got some run-outs. We got a few 50-50
balls and turned them into baskets. I felt that was going to be the key, where
at halftime before, I thought we should have been up a little bit more.
There's a few offensive rebounds we didn't get and a few loose balls that just
kept them going their way. So I just thought we did a better job in the hustle
areas and capitalizing in the open floor.  
  
Q. Same question, you've outscored Markus Howard 54-25, same as the
team. How tough is that third time beating great players? Is that an extra
challenge or more confidence?  
SHAMORIE PONDS: It's definitely an extra challenge, but I feel like it's more
confidence. I feel like those guys are going to bring their all, so I feel
like we can't lay down.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [LaVall Jordan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34451)

### [Aaron Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36726)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Providence - 80, Butler - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach LaVall Jordan, Aaron Thompson.  
  
LaVALL JORDAN: Obviously, a ton of credit to Coach Cooley and Providence. They
deserved to win and advance with the way that they played. So it's obviously a
tough one to swallow for our group, as you don't know if it's going to be last
game or not.  
  
As far as the game went, I thought our guys had a good fight. I thought the
start went well, and they came out and adjusted about halfway through the
first half and made it more of a smash-mouth game to get themselves back in
it, and then give Maliek White credit. He hit a couple of big threes to get
the momentum on their side heading into the half, and I thought that was a
game changer, and we were trying to recover from that.  
  
Obviously, they hadn't been shooting the three this well the last two times we
played them. They hit 11, and they hadn't been doing that up to this point in
the season. Their guys are getting better, and they're raising their level at
the right time.  
  
For our two seniors, just in that locker room there's a group of guys that
care about each other, love each other, that wanted like crazy to advance and
continue to fight for Butler, and it just didn't happen. It just didn't
happen. I thought we had some good looks, especially early. I thought we had
some great looks and didn't knock them down. Wish we could have been better
for them with the zone attack in the second half, where they were getting
baskets, and then they jumped out and played the three-point line and took
everything outside away and made us drive it.  
  
But proud of the fight that we had. Wish our execution could have been better.
Wish we would have been better for them, like I said, against the zone.  
  
Q. LaVall, obviously, Kamar had a tough night out here tonight. What
would you attribute that to?  
LaVALL JORDAN: I think earlier there was a lot of attention on him, and it
opened some things up. Obviously, for Aaron, he scored in the first half
early. Jordan came in and did well early when he checked in. And in the zone,
takes a little bit of that away because you've got to move the ball against
the zone and swing it around and look for opportunities to attack. So you
can't just keep it. It's not just going to be in Kamar's hands with the second
half when they switch to zone.  
  
Q. Aaron, you guys took a quick double-digit lead over Providence to
start. What changed that allowed the Friars to take control?  
AARON THOMPSON: I think they just started hitting shots, like Coach said. They
made some defensive adjustments and started going a little more zone, and
Maliek White hit some big shots to get him going, get some energy going for
them and kind of sparked them.  
  
Q. Curious as far as the matchups are concerned because throughout this
league, you know each other really well, 16 days, you guys played three times.
And yet today we were wondering inside the community if there would be some
kind of adjustments, kind of like the Boston Celtics did with the Golden State
Warriors, where you play a little differently at playoff time, at tournament
time, show them something different. You came out on fire, did a great job.
How was the thought process as far as the matchups were concerned?  
LaVALL JORDAN: I thought the adjustment we made led to early success at the
start of the game. We did a good job pressuring them. We switched a couple
matchups, and they were on their heels to start, turned it over a few times,
or they did not get into what they like to get into. Then we mixed up some
defenses.  
  
And then they just -- Alpha decided or they went to him in a couple of
isolations, and he finished a couple of tough baskets. Then White stepped up
and made threes. If they're making threes, they're a different team to guard.  
  
Q. Coach, how tough is it that you haven't had much success here in the
tournament since starting in the league? I know you've only been here for two
years, but how tough is that? Is there something about this place? You know,
other coaches talk about how much they love coming here, but it's a tough one
for you guys to come here.  
LaVALL JORDAN: No, I think we'd love to stay longer. Providence had a
different thought in mind, and you've got to battle. I don't know, just in
terms of the past as much. I know it's a heck of a league. You look at all the
parity in the league this year, every game's going to be a battle. You get to
here in March, and everybody -- there's good coaches, and there's good
players. For them, there's a different guy stepping up tonight. It was Reeves
last time and White this time.  
  
Just in general, I know you come and put your best foot forward and fight the
best you can. You try to adjust and coach the best you can and see where the
chips fall, but I don't know if there's anything to it other than every year's
different, every team's different, and you go out there and do what you know
and do what's given you success in that season with that group.  
  
Q. Would you guys consider a postseason bid in some tournament if it's
offered?  
LaVALL JORDAN: Depends on the tournament. I mean, we'll see. We'll see what
happens. I'd love to have this group be able to fight together again.

### [Ed Cooley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23287)

### [Alpha Diallo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34878)

### [Maliek White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36729)

### [David Duke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36730)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Providence - 80, Butler - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Providence head coach Ed Cooley, Alpha Diallo, Maliek
White, and David Duke.  
  
ED COOLEY: Back in this room in a really good space. I've said it from day
one. There's something about this building that's spectacular for the Friars.
We didn't come out the way we wanted to, a little jittery, a little nervous. I
was really proud of our guys on how we responded. I thought defensively we
were good, but I thought this was one of our more complete offensive games.
After that time-out, I think they went on a 10-0 run and called time-out, and
I thought we settled down and played really A-plus basketball -- offensively,
defensively, our rotations were good. We shared the ball.  
  
I saw our guys playing with just a ton of joy, a ton of happiness. I thought
our zone was really good when we went zone. I thought our length was pretty
impressive in front of the rim, and it was just good to be out there with
them. It was fun. It was fun. Any time you have an opportunity to win in this
building and play in this tournament is something special about it, and
couldn't be more happy for our young men.  
  
Q. Coach, they were up by ten and you called a time-out. Was it strictly
jitters that the guys needed to settle down, or was there something that you
did?  
ED COOLEY: I thought we had some open looks in front of the rim early. Guys
were probably a little nervous. You may have to ask them, in particular, David
and A.J., this being their first Big East Tournament. The other guys have
played in it before. I just thought we were a little nervous, a little tight,
a little antsy. This is our third time playing these guys in the last 16, 17,
18 days, so we were very familiar with one another what we were all trying to
do.  
  
We tried to see what adjustments they made and what adjustments we had to
since the last two times we played them.  
  
Q. Ed, do you think it was their defensive pressure up on the ball early
on that gave you the most trouble?  
ED COOLEY: We made an adjustment with that, with a little bit of the ball
screen action that we wanted. And, again, when you beat a team twice and
you're coming off of just beating them at home, they're going to have a
certain amount of energy coming out of the gate as well. But I was just proud
of our guys on how we were persistent, and we kind of imposed our will
regardless of the ball pressure.  
  
Q. Maliek kind of popped there at the end of the first half.  
ED COOLEY: Maliek looked like Superman out there today. I was really happy for
Maliek. It's been a -- honestly, I'm really, really proud of Maliek and
playing with that level of energy and enthusiasm, making shots, leading the
team. That was pretty fun to watch on this stage. We're going to need him to
do that again in about 15 hours.  
  
Q. The Friars had a slow start, but the three-point shooting was really
huge tonight. What was the key? Were they playing off you guys? Got a lot of
open looks.  
ALPHA DIALLO: Our point guards did a good job of driving and kicking. We
played inside-out basketball. We threw the ball inside to Nate and Kalif, they
made the right plays and found open shooters, and we were knocking it down.  
  
Q. Coach, how tough is it to beat a team three times inside in a season,
but inside of 15?  
ED COOLEY: It's very tough. It's tough to beat anybody once in a row, let
alone three times in a row. But it's a game of matchups. We match up well to
Butler. Sometimes it's about matchups more so than being luck. I'm not a
believer, and it's hard to beat somebody three times. You win the game, you
win the game, you know what I mean? They play with a certain set of urgency
and a certain set of pride, but sometimes the matchup just don't dictate
victories for some people.  
  
Q. And which is the matchup that proves to be decisive for you guys?  
ED COOLEY: Our guards are pretty big. Alpha is one of the tougher matchups
this our league. Nate Watson's physicality and Kalif's physicality. If we're
able to make perimeter shots, we're going to be a tough out if we can make
perimeter shots. It's been an Achilles heel of ours. In that time-out, I told
the guys, take the open shots. If you miss two, three, take the fourth one. I
think, when you instill that level of confidence in your men, it's something
that goes with it. There's great energy and synergy that's in that
conversation.  
  
Q. Coach, so what could we expect from the Friars tomorrow against
Villanova?  
ED COOLEY: Unless you're God, I can't answer that. We're going to play
together. We're going to play excited. We're happy to advance. These
tournaments, it's about advancing and moving on. Everybody has said, well, are
you tired? We have 18 to 22-year-old kids. Nobody has time to be tired. We
came here to try to compete for a championship, and you can only do it one
game at a time.  
  
Villanova is a very tough out. We've played them a ton. We know exactly what
they are. They know exactly who we are. We're making some perimeter shots and
not giving up threes, we'll give ourselves an opportunity.  
  
Q. Maliek, you had something like 17 points in the last four games. Was
it something with the water, the cape, or what?  
MALIEK WHITE: I don't know about all that. I think my teammates just gave me
confidence. They tell me keep shooting the ball. I know I started off and
missed three open threes. In that time-out, Coach told us we have to take
those open shots, and I kept shooting it, and I was fortunate for it to keep
going in.  
  
Q. Is that as hot as you've been this year?  
MALIEK WHITE: Definitely, yeah.  
  
Q. A-plus from your guys tonight. How much beforehand, as far as the
week was concerned, did you focus -- you just had Butler three times in 16
days. Did you focus on Villanova rather than Butler? Since you've beaten them
twice already.  
ED COOLEY: No, we would never do that. That's poor preparation, and I don't
think you give your kids an opportunity to win the game that we just played.
We'll deal with the team we deal with when we get to them. We'll be up all
night with our staff. We'll shut the players down.  
  
A coach wouldn't do that, and I don't want our players thinking past anyone.
We're in this game for a reason - we've been inconsistent. So I'm happy to see
some consistency over the last five games. I think we had a little bit more
offensive rhythm, a little bit more of identity. So I wouldn't do that.  
  
Q. Going into tomorrow, do you think the extra game, played a game
before and gotten a good win, that that could be an advantage tomorrow?  
DAVID DUKE: Yeah, I think it's definitely going to be in our advantage coming
off a win, keeping that same confidence going into tomorrow's game. Hopefully,
we're fortunate enough to win that game as well.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second half, when you opened up the scoring, it seemed
like your interior defense was that much better. They couldn't get the ball
inside, and your guys were, on the other hand, scoring. Your interior defense
has to be very good.  
ED COOLEY: I thought our length played a major part in today's game and at the
last home game at the Dunkin' Donuts Center. Again, Alpha's long. Isaiah's
long. Kalif and Nate are long. David is a big, physical guard. Maliek's --
Maliek, are you the shortest one on the team? I think you are. I think he is.
But Maliek is tough. He guards the ball. So I thought our length played a
major, major role against Butler this whole year.  
  
Q. Did you do anything special on Kamar Baldwin, or do you think he had
a rough night out there?  
ED COOLEY: No, Kamar's a great player. He's a high-alert guy. He was hurting
us early, but he got in foul trouble. He was trying to balance how to guard. I
thought our staff did a really good job trying to run isos in particular when
Alpha was on him, when Isaiah was on him, to try to get him around the basket
a little bit. But he's one of the best players in our league, and he's going
to be -- we're going to have to deal with him another year.

### [Eli Cain](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30497)

### [Dave Leitao](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30496)

### [Max Strus](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36748)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
St. John's - 82, DePaul - 74  
  
THE MODERATOR: DePaul is here. Max Strus, Coach Dave Leitao, Eli Cain.  
  
DAVE LEITAO: Opening statement: I give credit to St. John's. I kind of figured
the game to be, after you play somebody twice, who becomes the most
aggressive. I thought that their game plan was effective and our response to
it wasn't like it needed to be for enough consistency to get what we wanted as
opposed to settling for things. As most teams go, when there's not a ton of
offensive success, it kind of spills over to defense. I thought our defense
had some mental and physical lapses that gave them the kind of confidence that
allowed them to play more aggressive offense and more aggressive defense. So I
give them credit.  
  
In a Big East Tournament, like any tournament, you got to do those things.
You've got to do whatever is necessary to win and advance, and I thought they
did a good job with that.  
  
Q. Max, can you describe what it was like going against Simon today?  
MAX STRUS: Yeah, I think they did a great job. They had a great game plan.
They executed very well. He's a good defender and shut me down today.  
  
Q. Eli, you had a dominant first half in terms of scoring. What were
some things that you saw from them in the second half that was in contrast to
what you saw in the first half?  
ELI CAIN: I think their game plan was pretty much the same. They were setting
off certain guys, trying to deny Max the ball, trying to deny me the ball. I
think in the first half I just got a lane on rip-throughs and things like
that, and I made a lot of free throws. I think that's what contributed to me
getting the points in the first half.  
  
Q. Coach, it's always the same, it's hard beating a team three times.
What were some of the adjustments that you hadn't seen?  
DAVE LEITAO: I think they took a page from our last game in there helping and
doubling in the post, which no secret that our post-game has been an effective
weapon for us. They were in help defense on guys in the perimeter, and our
understanding, even going back two games ago, was just, when you have that,
you've got to increase your ball movement, and I don't know that we did that
enough times. So in a game of chess, they made a move, and we didn't do a good
job executing our move.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a pair of big second halves in the first two games.  
DAVE LEITAO: I didn't hear what you said.  
  
Q. You had a big pair of second halves the first two times you played.
Why do you think you weren't able to do that today?  
DAVE LEITAO: First, we weren't getting the kind of stops that allow us to get
out and get some easy opportunities. Against any team, it's a higher
percentage of an opportunity to score against defense before it's set. We were
taking the ball out, out of the net, or stoppage of play more than we needed
to because they were scoring. And then like I said, I don't know that we had
the combination of really good ball movement and crisp offense like we needed
to.  
  
Q. Question for both Eli and Max: This is the first time in 12 years
DePaul has at least finished -- not losing season. What's your legacy going to
be as you leave the program?  
ELI CAIN: Well, first off, I don't know if we're done playing. So I don't
think our, quote, unquote, legacy is over. But if we were done today, I think
we did -- this season personally, I think we shifted the coaching to a more
positive direction. Coaches did a really good job of bringing some guys in for
the future. So the program is in really good hands going forward.  
  
But me as a four-year senior and Max as a three-year senior, along with Femi,
I think we did a pretty good job of getting over that hump, as you would say,
12, 15 years, whatever it was. So I think that's that.  
  
Q. Max, you too.  
MAX STRUS: Yeah, I'm looking forward to keep playing.  
  
Q. One more question for Coach: Next year, what should we expect from
the team?  
DAVE LEITAO: That is a very, very -- I can't see that far. I mean, it's March
13, and as Eli said, we're just -- we got to understand what just happened
tonight and figure out what happens tomorrow and the next day. Other than when
you take time to make recruiting calls, I can't piece anything together like
that right now.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

  
_Rosemont_  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, it's exciting to be here. It's exciting to have a few
familiar faces back in our program. I think that's one of the things that, as
we had a very productive summer, we had a trip to Italy, it's been refreshing
to have carryover. And to be able to build on some things that we had last
year.  
  
We've got what we feel are outstanding perimeter players in Trent Frazier, Ayo
Dosunmu, Andres Feliz, all with experience now. Two of those three guys were
new last year and had to learn what Big Ten basketball was about. Obviously
Giorgi Bezhanishvili up front now with another year of experience, I think
he's one of the most well-conditioned athletes that I have been around. He's a
tremendous worker. But a year of experience with him.  
  
And then we're looking for leadership from all of those guys. Even though
we're an extremely young basketball team, when you look at our roster, we do
have some experience and some games under our belt. And we're excited about
this group as we continue to build what we think can be a very, very solid
nucleus with our team this year.  
  
Q. With a lot of buzz and excitement coming into the season, especially
on campus, how has the team reacted to this sort of hype and excitement going
into the season?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, I think we have a different swagger. I use that term --
I think there's a different feel about us -- just from the experience
standpoint. I don't think there's that giddiness of the unexpected. I think we
know now. We have the ability to have guys that can lead the young guys, that
can lead the guys that maybe didn't play as much last year. I think all those
things are positive. And I think that there's a confidence that comes with
that.  
  
We see that in our off-season workouts. We've seen that this summer in Italy
and continue to see that as we will head through the fall here.  
  
Q. Your second-best rebounder on your team last season was a point
guard. What are your plans for improving rebounding?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah, it's been a concentrated effort all throughout the
summer. In our ten days of practice that we had with Italy, we know that's an
area we've got to improve on. It's an area Giorgi has got to be improved in.
We've got to get much better consistency from our wings. Alan Griffin was our
top rebounder on our trip in Italy, averaged nine rebounds a game and about
23, 24 minutes. We feel we've added some pieces. Kofi Cockburn will be a guy
that will help in that area we hope, as will Jermaine Hamlin.  
  
So we think we've added some pieces that will help in that area, but it's also
been a big focus for us.  
  
Q. Brad, you added two sit-out transfers in Jacob Grandison and Austin
Hutcherson. Why was that part of the plan and where do they fit, and what have
you seen from them so far?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, they've been tremendous in our early fall workouts. We
haven't officially started practice yet. We'll do that as we head into the
weekend. But I think one of the things that we've tried to do is figure out
how to get older, and then we've looked for certain specific skill sets and
pieces. And both Austin and Jacob provide that. I'm excited about the fact
they get a year with Adam Fletcher, our strength coach. They get a year of
practice, and then they can hit the floor running. And it's not -- it's
different than a grad transfer that comes in and immediately has to learn a
new system and perform. These guys can develop, and then we get two great
years of them, and that excites me.  
  
So we felt we were in a good place with our roster, and we can address some
needs for the future and have two guys that are ready to go as the following
season comes about.  
  
Q. What do you expect from Ayo and Trent just having another year to
mesh together and build on that swagger?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, I think the one thing we've seen -- especially in Ayo,
we've seen a physical improvement that he gained strength, he's stronger. I
think that Trent has done that as well. And then just a year of experience,
being able to play off each other. They both had moments early in the year
last year where one would have a big game and the other one would not. I think
late in the year, we found a very good balance. I thought Trent had a
tremendous year last year, even though he didn't have a 30-point games like he
did as a freshman. But defensively they're both in tune, they're both elite
defenders and can be, and then they're both capable offensively.  
  
I'm excited about them together again, and that year of experience will be
invaluable for them.  
  
Q. Illinois has been known for this tremendous passion for basketball.
It 's been six years since Illinois has been in the NCAA Tournament. A lot of
people are believing you're upper half or better, maybe even top third team in
this league this year, which would almost certainly put you guys back in the
tournament. What would that mean if you guys are able to fulfill that and push
toward that this year, kind of pay off that passion that's really never left,
it's still there?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah, we're very blessed at the University of Illinois. Our
fans are second to none. And I say that we've got the hard part of the
equation out of the way in terms of having an elite program, and that's our
fans, and it doesn't matter. We've got 15,000 every night, and their
excitement level, their passion for basketball is unrivaled. It has been a
while. The program is one that we keep striving to get back to that elite
status.  
  
Nothing would make me happier than -- not just for our players, but for our
fans -- to get back and get in the tournament, be able to make a great run and
continue to lay the foundation for what should be an every-year experience for
us, and that's being in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Kofi Cockburn is a big add. How are the plans for meshing him with
Giorgi coming along? Is that a work in progress as the season goes, or is
there a clear path in your mind right now as you start the season?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, I think I've got a pretty good idea what I'd like to
see. How it all comes together will obviously determine that. I'm also a
realist in terms of I know that they're not going to play 40 minutes together.
We've got to find that happy medium where they're going to be on the court
together. Giorgi was one of the outstanding low post players, not just in the
Big Ten but in college basketball, and we don't want to negate that from him.
Defensively, there's figuring out how to play with both of them, and yet I
think that they're both unique talents. They're both very, very talented, and
offer something that could be a problem for opponents. They'll be a work in
progress as we go, and Kofi is a freshman and going to have to take in a lot
and has taken in a lot already. But I think it'll be something that we'll see
mature as the season goes along.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_Rosemont, United States_  
  
MARK TURGEON: It's great to be here. Obviously I think the Big Ten every year
does a tremendous job with media day. Not a lot of wasted time, which coaches
like, so we get in, get out, get to talk about our team, which is terrific.  
  
I want to thank Jim Delany for the job he's done, making every job in the Big
Ten a great job. We're going to miss him. I know this is his last media day,
so thanks to Jim and all that he's done and the things he did for me when we
joined the league, playing the tournament in D.C., and just a lot of things
that he helped integrate us into the Big Ten. So Jim will be missed.  
  
Obviously I think the Big Ten -- I've been in a lot of leagues in my career. I
think the Big Ten is terrific. We're coming off one of our best seasons ever,
obviously our best NCAA Tournament ever, most wins, most teams on to the final
32. So it was a terrific year. I expect it to be the same, obviously, this
year.  
  
A lot of great teams, maybe a little bit better at the top than we were, but
every bit as deep. That's the thing about our league, there's just so many
good teams, so many good coaches in the league. So it's terrific.  
  
My team, I really like my team. Obviously we haven't played a game yet, so we
all like our teams, but very talented, got some great depth as long as our
young guys keep getting better. And play a terrific schedule. We've got a
terrific league schedule again. Play a lot of the so-called top teams a couple
times, so we're excited about that. Just looking forward to getting started.  
  
With that, I'll open it up.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the expectations on Maryland this year in terms of
being picked second, and how does a young team that maybe hasn 't had that on
them, how do you as a coach help them deal with it?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, we love it. We're excited. Our guys only know one way, and
that's to work hard. Our culture is terrific right now. Our guys are in the
gym early, in the gym late, in the gym with me during the day. They're
embracing it. We're all embracing it. We want more, and we want to be great.
We're excited. We know we have a good team, and if we didn't think we were
good and we were picked second, we'd be worried. But we think we have a good
team. We'll see what happens and you've got to play the games. But we think we
have a talented team that's embracing the situation and looking forward to
everything that comes with it.  
  
Q. How would you compare Makhi Mitchell 's game to Bruno Fernando's?  
MARK TURGEON: Makhi? You know, big, strong, physical guys. Both pretty
athletic. Bruno is at another level athletically. Makhi is very skilled, can
really -- he's got great hands. Him and his brother both have great hands.
They can catch everything. Makhi and Makhel both have great feel for the game,
tremendous passers. They've been able to pick things up real quickly. And you
look at Makhi, and you might not think he's a great athlete, but he can really
run the floor, and he's very physical. He's really what we needed.  
  
We've added some toughness to our team. Last year was amazing what our group
did with five freshmen in the top eight. We weren't very physical, but we
figured out how to win just enough games to make the tournament and win a
game. But this year our sophomores are bigger and our incoming freshmen are
strong and athletic.  
  
But Makhi is a guy, if he continues to let us coach him and continues to get
better and continues to work on his shot and things, he's got a chance to
really, really help us a lot this season.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it means to the program to have two unanimous
Big Ten team selections, and where do you see Anthony Cowan developing further
under your tutelage?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, so Anthony had a terrific summer. Going into his senior
year, he made the decision he wanted to come back to Maryland and make an
impact and have a legacy, so he has a chance to do a lot of things. He's
scored a lot of points, he has a lot of assists, he has a lot of steals, but
he wants to win at a high level. So I think that's really his biggest thing
going into the season.  
  
The thing with Anthony is we're just trying to get him to quit turning the
ball over so much, especially live ball turnovers. It's something we've really
worked on. He's gotten better at it. He's had some tremendous early season
days for us. So you know, we're expecting Anthony to be terrific.  
  
And then he's just a tremendous defender. I think for his size, I don't know
if there's a better defender in the country for what he does. Jalen,
obviously, we're glad he's back, wonderful kid. We don't call him Sticks
anymore, we call him Logs because he's gotten so much bigger. He never has his
shirt on anymore, he's always trying to show his upper body off. But Sticks,
Logs, has really worked hard to expand his game. He's become a much better
perimeter defender. We've worked on everything, worked on his low post. And so
he had a terrific freshman year. I think with Jalen, we just want more
consistency, and that's what he wants, too, and he should be able to do that
for us this year.  
  
Q. What do you think of the California Fair Pay to Play Act, and what
sort of obstacles do you think that presents? And also do you think it 's a
good law, a sign of progress?  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, I think it's obviously a very complex issue. As a coach,
you always want more for your student-athlete. I remember when I played,
missing meals and not having enough money because you didn't have time for a
job. It's a little different today than it was then. So you always want what's
best for the student-athlete. You want them to be comfortable. There's a lot
of pressure on them. They do a lot of great things for our University,
especially my kids.  
  
It'll be interesting to see what happens. I think what we all want is just an
even playing field when it's all said and done. I know it's going to be a
process, and so it'll be interesting to see what happens over the next three
or four years.  
  
Q. Who do you think has made the biggest jump of this group of freshmen
-- group of sophomores from their freshman year?  
MARK TURGEON: That's a really hard question because they've all made a big
jump. During the summer I thought it was Aaron Wiggins. He made a huge jump.
Kid was working out like four times a day. He really got better. We need him
to be more aggressive offensively for us to take that next step. Eric Ayala
totally changed his body from when he came here. You know, Eric -- I'm not
sure Eric could dunk when we got him. Now he's reverse dunking and double
pumping on dunks and things, so he's gotten more athletic. His shot has even
gotten better. I didn't think he was a great shooter when we signed him, now I
think it's he's one of the better shooters I've ever coached.  
  
Ricky Lindo has put on 30 pounds from August going into his freshman year
until now. Ricky just turned 19 last week. He's very young. He's improved
tremendously, just needs to get more confident. But I think he's an
unbelievable defender. He can go one through five for us. He guarded Happ some
games, to switching one four ball screens and being on a point guard. He's
special for us.  
  
Jalen obviously has put on 35 pounds since he's been here, continues to get
better. Serrel has become more consistent offensively for us.  
  
They've all gotten better, which is exciting for us. Josh Tomaic made a step
-- Darryl Morsell, leadership, maturity, calmness. It's really great to see.
He's really at peace with himself. He's not turning the ball over like he was
last year. He really made a huge change the last five or six games for us, and
it's carried over. I think everybody has really been -- we didn't like the way
the season ended. It was devastating because we loved each other, and we loved
that team. We had to say goodbye to a couple guys. We've worked extra hard
because of the way the season ended.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Excited, obviously, going into year seven. Around the corner
we've got a lot of new guys, so it's a good opportunity to kind of reintroduce
ourselves a little bit and start over. So we lost a lot, but that doesn't mean
that we have to take a step back, and I've got to get our guys to understand
that. Just excited about this group. They're good guys. They work hard. They
represent themselves the right way.  
  
Q. Talk about the impact of your transfers on the team. I know obviously
two sat out last year and you brought one in new as a grad transfer, but what
impact are they having on your leadership?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, Marcus is a natural leader, just confident, on and off
the court, tough, competes, versatile, can play a multitude of positions,
fearless. So he's only a sophomore, but he doesn't act like it. So he's got
natural leadership abilities.  
  
Payton Willis may not be as loud as him at times, but his work ethic does the
talking. I think the young guys see how hard he works every single day, and
that's the biggest thing that you can get because everybody thinks a good
leader is what they say, but a lot of it is what you do. And with those
transfers Alihan and Payton and Marcus, they're really, really good at doing
the right things to show those other guys that's how you need to act at this
level.  
  
Q. How healthy do you believe Eric Curry is going to be this season, and
what do you expect from him this season?  
RICHARD PITINO: You know, obviously he's dealt with a lot of injuries. He's
been really, really important to our team from a depth standpoint. He can play
the 4, he can play the 5. He knows how to play. You know, he's a very, very
good defender. He's a very good passer. And for a guy at 6'9" to do that,
that's very valuable. So the biggest thing for Eric is staying healthy,
physically, mentally, just making sure that he gets his confidence back, and
I'm rooting for him. I mean, what he's dealt with the last couple years has
been really, really hard. So he's been doing a little bit in practice, not 100
percent yet, but he's getting close, and every time he's on the court, we seem
to be a better basketball team.  
  
Q. The California bill for players capitalizing on their images and
likenesses, where do you stand on that?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, I think it's progress. I think over the last couple
years, we're headed in the right direction with taking care of our student-
athletes. I don't know exactly what it's going to be, but I think it's a good
idea. I know a lot of people have been pushing for it. I think the biggest
thing now is just getting everybody on the same page, getting all the states,
getting the NCAA, getting everybody working together is the most important
thing. But the more we can get these guys, these student-athletes, I'm all for
it.  
  
Q. I wonder as you 've gone through your coaching career, the challenges
of building a roster and keeping roster continuity, how has that changed since
you've been a coach, and what are those challenges of trying to have
consistency from year to year?  
RICHARD PITINO: It's challenging. That's why you have so much respect for
Coach Izzo and what he's done, to be able to do it every single year. Because
I think that with Amir Coffey, we recruited a really good player. When he was
healthy, he was a really good player, and he goes and makes a decision to go
early to the NBA, which we supported. But if he's back, we're probably a
different team. He's a really talented player. But you can't hold these guys
back from doing what's great for them and what they've dreamed of their whole
lives. If you are able to recruit certain guys that can go early, you've got
to support them, you know.  
  
And then obviously the transfer situation. I've got seven new players, and you
always want to save one or two for those guys that may want to come sit out
and grow.  
  
It's fun. I saw something the other day about -- I think Nick Saban said he
goes into every year as if it's year one. I feel like that a little bit. But
it does make it enjoyable. So you've got to embrace it. It is what it is. The
kids aren't wrong if they transfer or they go early to the NBA or overseas or
whatever. They're taking advantage of opportunities, and I think a lot of us
coaches would do the same.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Steve Pikiell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25225)

  
_Rosemont, United States_  
  
STEVE PIKIELL: Good morning. Thank you for coming. Today we had a great night
last night. Commissioner Delany, had dinner with him. I want to thank him for
making this the great conference that it is. And the great career he had, Hall
of Famer for sure. I also want to welcome Kevin Warren into the fold, who
takes over the reins now for the greatest conference in the country. And I
also want to welcome Juwan and Fred into the league, the league of great
coaches just got even better. Those two guys are going to do a terrific job,
so welcome them into the league.  
  
Excited about Rutgers and where our program is. Last night I heard the great
news, too, about Coach Stringer named a Legends in Coaching, the John Wooden,
so I want to congratulate Coach Stringer, our women's coach, who I get a
chance to work side by side with every day. She's truly a legend, and that's a
really exciting honor for her as she continues her great career.  
  
We have a lot of things going on at Rutgers. It's been a terrific year. We
just opened a brand-new practice facility, $117 million. Thanks to Pat Hobbs,
our athletic director and all the great people in Rutgers nation, it's as good
a practice facility as there is in the country. Really exciting. We went to
Spain this summer with our team, took a tour. The campus is vibrant and
exciting. This was the hardest year in admissions to get into Rutgers. Our
applicants are up, our standards are up, and I really am excited.  
  
I think our basketball team is up, too. Really, really excited about this
year. I have a couple of my athletes in the back. They're great kids with the
highest grade point average in school history, 3.1 grade point average with
our basketball team. Our season tickets are up a ton. I'm very, very excited,
heightened expectations, too, on the banks, and I like that.  
  
But I'm truly honored in my fourth year to be the head coach at Rutgers, and
looking forward to some great things this season.  
  
Q. I want to ask you about your freshman Paul Mulcahy, had a chance to
cover him at Gill last year, and just your expectations for him and what you
think he 'll bring to the floor this season?  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know, we have a couple newcomers to the program this year,
and Paul being one of them, he's a 6'6" point guard, really, really exciting,
New Jersey, Bayonne, New Jersey. He was a triple-double guy in the state of
New Jersey, one of the first ones in the last 27 years to average a triple-
double, which never happens. He can shoot, pass and rebound, really good
rebounder. I think he's going to be a really good defender.  
  
I really like my 11 guys. I think we've got versatility. He jumps right in.
He's 6'6", he's a big guard who can handle pass and shoot, to go along with
Geo Baker and Caleb McConnell. A lot of guys, Peter Kiss, Montez Mathis, that
can shoot pass and dribble. Ron Harper in the back of the room here, one of
the most improved players in the conference. People are going to see him take
the next step. We're excited about Paul, excited to keep a New Jersey guy
home, too, and he's a great kid.  
  
We've tried to build this in the last three or four years around great
character kids that want to work hard and overachieve, and he fits that mold
perfectly, and we're excited about adding him to our roster.  
  
Q. You 've touched on this a little bit, but what sort of momentum do
you feel you're starting to build in the program? Obviously you had a tough
off-season transfer, but where do you think you are as you build this program
and what sort of challenges do you see ahead of yourself this year?  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know, I'm excited really where the program is. It's kind of
taken me a little time to get it where I want it. We have really versatile
guys who are big. I love my front court. We have a kid, Myles Johnson, who's
6'11", with a 7'7" wingspan who's improving leaps and bounds from his freshman
year to his sophomore year. A kid, Shaq Carter, who came in last year; he'll
be one of the most improved players in the league. Had a great tour in Spain.
Mamadou Doucoure is back. He redshirted last year. He started 30 games as a
freshman. He's physical, he's huge. We brought in a player from Stony Brook, a
fifth-year grad transfer who fits in perfectly, great kid, great student. He
shoots the ball deep. He gives us a 6'7" guy that can really shoot the ball.  
  
I really feel like we're really good. And I know what we were picked in the
league, and I said to my players, because the league is great, this league has
unbelievable coaches, these are unbelievable universities. But Rutgers is
pretty good, and we're deep, and we're going to play a little differently
because we can. We're very versatile. We're going to have 6'7", 6'8"s across
the board, to be able to do some different things, and I really believe in
year four here, we now have more solutions to the problems that the league
poses.  
  
Every team poses a different problem. Some run it, some walk it, some -- and
in the past, we didn't have a lot of solutions to a lot of the different
problems that other teams posed to it. We can get up and down now. We can slow
it down. We have good shooters, and we're very young. We were the youngest
team in the league last year or one of the two top. We have two seniors in the
program now, so we're kind of a young program still, but I'm very, very
excited, and I know the challenges ahead, too. The scheduling god here in this
league didn't do me any favors. We open up with a Hall of Fame coach on the
road at Michigan State, so we'll be challenged right off the start of the
season.  
  
But I really like my players. I like their chemistry. They're great kids. They
work hard. We have a saying at Rutgers, when you ring the bells, it means
something great happened at Rutgers. And we hope this season we can ring the
bells and do something great with our basketball team. And I want our guys,
too, to enjoy the journey. I want our fans -- Rutgers nation is awesome.
They're into it. Our season tickets are up. We've already sold out a few games
at this time of the year, which is unbelievable.  
  
Really, really excited, and we're trying to do something that we haven't done
in a long time, and hopefully we've got that mindset and people will enjoy the
journey of the season, because this season throws a lot of obstacles at you.
We're at Pitt and then we are at Michigan State, and those are our first
games, Seton Hall. We have a stretch there that's unbelievable, some of the
best teams in the country all hit you in December. We're going to have to
fight through a lot of adversity, but I think this team has the pieces.  
  
Q. Your team was ranked 13th in the Big Ten in assists per game last
season. What are your plans for moving the ball once Geo Baker is out of the
game?  
STEVE PIKIELL: You know, excited about some of the additions. We've also got a
kid named Jacob Young who is a transfer from Texas, a point guard lefty, a
little bit different than Geo, who can really move the ball and pass the ball.
I think we were young last year. I think that was part of it. We didn't have a
lot of depth at any position. Now I have Jacob Young as a point guard, Paul
Mulcahy is a point guard, Geo Baker is a point guard. And I tell you what, Ron
Harper and Caleb McConnell, when they rebound, they're point guards, too.  
  
I really feel like we've improved our passing and our depth in those areas a
tremendous amount, and I think all 11 guys on my roster are going to play, and
they're all important. And I think all 11 can be starters, so there's not a
lot of drop-off we're going to have when we sub guys in.  
  
But I think being able to move Geo around -- which I wasn't able to do last
year, too -- I think is going to help his scoring, I think it's going to help
him defensively. Jacob Young can sit down and guard people. Paul Mulcahy, a
really good defender, Montez Mathis a really good defender, and Caleb
McConnell a really good defender, Peter Kiss. So I feel really good about
being able to move the ball. I like our post players a ton. I think we can
throw the ball inside now and get some assists.  
  
Feel like we've improved tremendously in that area and just have a lot more
guys capable of getting assists for us.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_Hilton Rosemont - Rosemont, Ill._  
  
MATT PAINTER: Obviously like everybody else, excited about the season. I
thought we had a very good season last year after losing four senior starters,
and had a tough non-conference but we also had a really good schedule. And I'd
like to talk about having real problems. I think a lot of times you can work
through your non-conference and you don't get to real problems. And if you
have a tough schedule, you can also lose some games in there, and it's kind of
tough sledding at those points.  
  
But I think we learned a lot about our team. We grew. We were able to have a
fabulous conference season and be co-champs along with Michigan State and then
make a good run in the NCAA Tournament. So was really proud of our guys last
year, and hopefully we learned something from that. We lost a lot with our
three guys in Carsen Edwards, Ryan Cline, and Grady Eifert, who was the most
efficient player in college basketball last year. And it kind of shows if you
get guys that play hard and do what they're supposed to do, they're going to
help you win games. Sometimes that gets lost.  
  
We just have to have guys learn from that experience, and we need some new
guys to come in and be able to adapt to our system and our understanding of
how to play. I'm really excited about it. I think we've got some good interior
players on Trevion Williams and Matt Haarms. Nojel Eastern has a lot of
experience, a guy who's really helped us win games. And then we have a lot of
guys who can make shots, and so just trying to get that balance and that
growth from our guys, especially the guys that came off the bench. We had four
freshmen come off the bench for us last year that will now be sophomores, so
it's going to be a big jump for those guys, but looking forward to working
with everybody and having a great season.  
  
Q. You 've been in this league as long as about anybody who's currently
coaching. The new three-point distance, how do you think that's going to
impact play in the Big Ten this year, the first year there?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, I think it'll be different for each team. I think the guys
that can make threes, it's probably not going to bother much, and the guys
that are trying to be three-point shooters, it's really going to bother. We
have a couple guys that are working towards trying to make threes now. That
made it really hard for them. But the guys that already shoot threes that walk
on campus and that's the reason they're there, we really look into their skill
level when we take them. We've taken guys -- Ryan Cline was one of those guys
that had no high major offers, ended up being a really good high major player,
but it was because he could shoot threes. The line doesn't affect him. The
line doesn't affect Carsen Edwards.  
  
But it will affect guys trying to do that. So I think as the season progresses
and you look at guys' percentages, I think you can end up seeing for certain
teams people really packing it in and making you earn it from the three-point
line because the three-point line has changed how we guard things. You're
trying to get threes, but you're also trying to stop your opponent from
getting threes. So I think it's one of those wait-and-see things, but it's
going to be interesting. I think it'll fluctuate from team to team.  
  
Q. With all that Carsen showed last year in regards to just taking over
games and finishing that, how much of a carryover can there be in your guys
who are back this year, just seeing that and being a part of it and wanting to
step up and do the same thing themselves?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, I think we have to be different when it comes to scoring
the basketball. I think we had a real good balance two years ago, and then
last year obviously he had a lot of responsibility in terms of shooting the
basketball. But the people around Carsen Edwards had a great collective assist
turnover ratio. They took care of the basketball. They made good decisions. I
thought Matt Haarms was one of the best defensive players in our league. I
thought Nojel Eastern was one of the best defensive players. I just mentioned
Grady Eifert was the most efficient player in the country. So then you throw
someone like Ryan Cline on top of it that had the best assist turnover ratio
in the history of Purdue basketball, that was a good mix. That was a good stew
that we had with our starting five. Then Trevion Williams and those guys that
really came off the bench, really gave us a bunch.  
  
I think trying not to be like that team is going to be really important. Like
no one is going to take over Carsen Edwards's role for us. We didn't have a
Carsen Edwards before, and let's not have one afterwards. And I think that's
important in basketball, because I think in recruiting, a lot of times people
say you're going to come in and you're going to play the same role as this
guy, when in reality you're just going to be the best version of yourself.  
  
Each team is different, even if you have a lot of experience. I think that's
important for us to kind of learn -- we played a lot different than we did the
previous year, and I look at us doing a lot of the same things but in a
different way.  
  
Q. December 4th you 've got the rematch against Virginia and the Big Ten
ACC challenge. Looking back on your career, your tenure at Purdue, has there
been a pre-conference game, a non-conference regular season game that has been
maybe as much of a circle-the-date kind of affair as this one?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, we have a very difficult schedule, but to be able to play
a program like Virginia who won the National Championship the next year after
we had a tough loss to them, to go to the Final Four, you know, it is a big
challenge. But it's also -- we play Texas at home and we play at Marquette. We
play VCU in Destin, and then we either play Florida State or Tennessee in
Destin before we play them. So we have so many challenges before them.  
  
But, no, Tony Bennett is a great coach, and it'll be very difficult for us.
They lost a lot, we lost a lot. But whenever you play them, it's very
difficult to go against them. They're very stingy on defense, very efficient
on the offensive end. But it's going to be a big challenge for us.  
  
Q. As we creep closer and closer to 2020, if you had to name the best
player you 've seen in the Big Ten you've seen this decade, who would you say
it is?  
MATT PAINTER: Man, you should give me some candidates because I'm going to
forget people. Obviously I'm going to be biased. We've been able to win some
Big Ten championships. We've been close a couple other times. Carsen Edwards
was a really good player for us. In the beginning of the decade, obviously
E'Twuan Moore, JaJuan Johnson, and Robbie Hummel, really good. Caleb Swanigan,
he was the Big Ten Player of the Year. JuJuan Johnson was the Big Ten Player
of the Year.  
  
So I'd probably give one of those two guys the nod just because they got that
award and we won the league with those guys. JuJuan's year, I don't think we
won the league then, but we won it previously. So one of those guys. But
there's obviously a lot of good players. That's kind of a loaded question.  
  
Q. How has Jahaad Proctor kind of adapted during summer workouts?  
MATT PAINTER: Well, Jahaad has been really good. He's a guy that can score the
basketball. He has a lot of experience, really trying to really separate
himself. We have some guys that are very similar in those positions. We have a
freshman, we have a redshirt sophomore. So those guys have done a really good
job of competing. Just trying to learn our system. We run a lot of stuff, and
so just trying to get everything down. When they're thinking too much, now
they're not going full tilt, and they've got to get to where they know what
they're doing so they can compete and play hard.  
  
But, no, Jahaad is -- we thought when we lost Carsen, we needed somebody with
a little bit more experience in that mix. But he can really put the ball in
the basket. He averaged 19 points last year for high points, played for one of
the best coaches in the country in Tubby Smith. So when he messes up on
defense, I'm always on him that he should know better because the guy he
played for at High Point was such a good coach. But we're excited to have him.  
  
It's hard. Everybody sees the fifth-year guys and they come into a new
program, they're learning -- part of what they have to do is the same as a
freshman. Even though they have some experience, they have no experience of
being in your program. So if they can get through that hurdle and be
productive right away and build off of it, it really helps them. But if they
don't, they kind of get into some struggles that freshmen do.  
  
Q. I wanted to know about freshman Brandon Newman, what does he bring,
and his athleticism, and also, what do you expect from Sasha in his third year
in the program?  
MATT PAINTER: Yes, well, those are the guys that are in that same fray that I
just mentioned with Jahaad Proctor -- Sasha Stefanovic and Brandon Newman. But
Brandon is very competitive, plays hard, can make threes. Just got a lot
thrown at him right now as a true freshman. Just learning the system.
Competes, and lays it on the line. But just looking for him to keep improving
every single day and give us that punch in the backcourt. Sprained his ankle
the other day, so he's going to be out here for a couple days, but look for
him to be back hopefully tomorrow or Friday.  
  
Sasha Stefanovic has been really good for us. He kind of got the short end of
the stick last year because he was behind Ryan Cline and Carsen Edwards. He'd
go in and play well, but he wouldn't play more -- which is frustrating if
you're a player -- just because those other two guys were there. But I look
for him to really help us. Out of those three guys, he knows what we're doing
the most. He has the experience. He can move and shoot. A lot of times guys
get credit for making a play and shooting and then being able to stand still
and shoot the basketball. But if you can sprint off things and catch the
basketball and shoot, you're a weapon. We're looking forward to him bringing
that experience and that understanding and being able to shoot beyond the arc.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

  
_Rosemont_  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: Excited to be here at Big Ten media day. It's always great to
get started here. It's such a phenomenal league, and the conference race is
always such an exciting thing, not only for the players and the coaches but
the universities, the fan bases. It's just a phenomenal thing to be a part of.  
  
So to be here today as it gets kicked off, it's always good to be here, and
excited to get back to our team later here in the week as we continue to keep
preparing to build this group and approach the season with a lot of optimism.  
  
Q. Having been a player yourself and now coaching one of the biggest
brands of college basketball, what 's your thoughts on the new California
bill?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Well, I mean, there's a lot of different opinions out there,
from obviously university leaders, administrators, long-tenured coaches, to
the college student-athletes themselves. I think there's a lot that's going to
go into it, and there's a lot of unanswered questions.  
  
I think the big thing is that in today's day and age, if you're not evolving,
if you're not forward thinking, you're standing in cement, so to speak. The
days of what was once always the way to do things and good, in 2020 maybe
isn't the way to do it. And I think that there's a lot of bright people in a
lot of rooms that are going to get together and make the best decisions
possible hopefully. And number one is to take care of the student-athletes the
best way possible, protect the game, protect the universities, and to continue
on with an unbelievable product. I think that's step one.  
  
You know, if you can make a young kid, student-athlete's life a lot better, if
they have the ability to take advantage of it, then we should be able to do
that at some point. But there also has to be consideration for the overall
good of the game, the overall good of collegiate sports and the universities
in general. There's a lot that goes into it.  
  
Me, in particular, I was a student-athlete. I know what it's like to play. I
know what it's like to play on TV and get all the perks that go along with
having your face out there and all that stuff. And I think in my time, I never
probably realized who actually made money on those names, on those faces, on
those games, jerseys, newspapers. I never really thought of it that way. Now
it's a different age. It's a different time. So there's a lot more to think
about when it goes into it.  
  
But you know, I think there's a lot of smart people in a lot of rooms, and
hopefully at the front end it's about the players, it's about the student-
athletes, doing what's best for them. And then we'll move forward, and let's
keep the game going in a positive direction.  
  
Q. As far as your front line goes, the options you have with a number of
guys 6 '7" and taller, how do you approach that? How do you want to maximize
what you have up front?  
ARCHIE MILLER: It's a good question. I think the strength of our team and some
of the experience level of our team and talents, it really starts on paper
with the size and the ability to hopefully play an inside game. We have a lot
of different guys that I think can play together. That's exciting. And I do
think we have a lot of different guys that are able to contribute, whether
that be a freshman or whether that be a fifth-year senior, fourth-year senior,
whatever it may be. We have a lot of guys that expect to play. Our staff
expects them to play. So I think one, competition. Earn everything is always
the best way to do it. That's always how we've done it, and I think there's
great competition level to get on the floor and to play minutes.  
  
I think the second thing is to play a lot of guys. For us to be able to
maximize our talent, for us to be able to maximize our production, we have to
get a lot of different type of contributions. And like I said, when you have a
stable of guys, you have to have the ability to use them. You can't play just
one or two and say this is how we're going to do it. You have to have
versatility in your lineups. You have to have competition and give guys the
rope to get out there and play. And I think with what we've got going on right
now, I like it. I think that there's a group that should take some pride in us
having one of the best front lines in college basketball, and that adds in
even the Damezi Andersons and the Jerome Hunters of the world who are 6'7"
plus. Jerome, quite frankly, is every bit as big as Justin Smith.  
  
So we have a big, strong, long group that in my opinion has some versatility,
and we've got to get the most out of it by having them challenge each other
every day. But without question, I think that's definitely something we have
to find a make that a strength.  
  
Q. Trayce Jackson-Davis has been mentioned on a few preseason freshman
player of the year type lists. Can you talk about incorporating freshmen into
your team and what you may have learned about that in the past few years here
at Indiana?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Well, whether you're at Indiana or anywhere, young people take
different paths to the floor. We've always played freshmen, our staff has.
We've played freshmen here in our first two years, whether that be Al Durham
or Justin Smith as a true freshman played. Last year's crew had a number of
guys step in with Robert obviously coming back as a sophomore, playing a lot
of minutes.  
  
This year's team will be no different. Our two true freshmen, Trayce and his
counterpart there, Armaan Franklin, both have been fantastic since they've
stepped foot on campus in terms of their ability to do what we've asked them
to do, fit in, and be productive. And I think through our first couple
workouts here, looking at things, I think both guys have a chance to really
impact our team.  
  
Obviously Trayce coming in, being a McDonald's All-American, there's a lot
around him in terms of accolades and hype. But right now he's been very, very
humble in the way that he's worked, in the way that he's fit in. Very, very
proud of him and Armaan both in the way they've approached things. They've
been as good as any player on our team in terms of our fall camp and what
we're doing.  
  
Now, there's a lot of learning. There's going to be a lot of strength and
weaknesses about the grind of college basketball, playing in games for the
first time, playing against older players, scouting, all that stuff goes in.
But both those guys not only have to contribute, but they can impact our team.
And I think that's the exciting thing for us is to keep recruiting young
players that obviously we're bringing in to play right away.  
  
Q. Getting back to the California law, is it fair to say that you think
it 's an issue that needs to be settled on a national level and not on a state
by state basis?  
ARCHIE MILLER: That could be a little bit bigger than me. I'm not as well-
versed, to be honest with you, in exactly what the pros and cons, the
ramifications of each state to state, each university to university. But I
would say this: When you're dealing with collegiate sports -- or specifically
us, men's basketball -- what you'd like is for everyone to have an equal say
and obviously have their opportunity. But definitely probably -- however it's
going to work out, for the good of the game, it needs to be governed, needs to
be looked at as a wholesale thing, not as an individual thing.  
  
But, again, I'm probably not as well-versed, that educated right now on the
grand specifics of how each state handles it and what the NCAA is able to do.
We've got a while to figure it out, and I know the fact that it's on the
forefront right now means there's going to be some really, really important
people to the college game in terms of administrators, presidents,
commissioners, they're going to have their say. They're going to do the best
they can to help everyone.  
  
Q. You brought up Damezi. We covered Damezi in high school. He didn 't
get a lot of playing time as a freshman. He was a superstar in high school.
What's it like for him now to know that it's his time to get on the court and
really shine?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Well, Damezi is like a lot of young guys that come from certain
situations and they walk into uncharted territory and you've got to learn the
ropes. I think the great thing about Damezi is he's a fantastic kid. He wants
to learn. He's very coachable, and just in his communication in this off-
season and what we try to do with him, he'll be the first to tell you that he
had a lot to learn, and there's some things he needs to do better.  
  
But I'll tell you what, he went to work on them. Right now he's as big and
strong and as well-conditioned as he's been. He's a 6'6", 220-plus pound guy,
can shoot the ball for us. He's going to have to bring that to the table for
our team.  
  
But for him more importantly and watching him as a sophomore, it's just a much
different feeling for him. It's not the first time he's went through it. He
now has the advantage of going through a year under his belt, and he knows
what we expect of him. He kind of knows right now what he's going to need to
do to help our team. And I think everyone from players to coaches feel that
he's going to do that, and we're excited for him.  
  
But he has an opportunity right now to really grab a hold of a role, and he's
got to do some things better than he did in year one. But I think he's much
more equipped mentally to do that more than anything, which is what you want
from your young players, to grow and to keep playing better. Damezi has done a
great job as we've finished last year and as we've entered into this October
of having a good way about him. And just in watching him practice even
yesterday, he's a much different player, he's a much different guy out there
than he was as a young player as a true freshman.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_Rosemont_  
  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: I'm really excited about this team. It's a different team than
last year. Got a lot of new faces, and I think that's the challenge,
especially going into a season where Michigan State is the clear favorite. But
20 league games against what I consider the best this league has ever been,
top to bottom, and we put together our most challenging schedule to go along
with that.  
  
I'm excited for the challenge, and we started practice on Saturday, and we
were anxious to get going.  
  
Q. A lot of people talked about the new three-point line, speculating
how it 's going to have an impact. How do you think it's going to impact
college basketball and in particular, how do you think it's going to impact
Big Ten play, the first season it's in play?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: It's funny because I thought initially it would have a great
impact, and it may. We don't know yet. You're expecting three-point
percentages to go down a little bit, fewer -- maybe fewer attempts, fewer
makes. Does that lend to more pack line defense, does that lend to more teams
playing zone, because you don't see a lot of zone anymore.  
  
So I think those are things that could eventually happen. I think all in all,
it will maybe open up the post a little bit. We have Luka Garza, Ryan Kriener,
Jack Nunge. So for us, I think it's a good thing to be able to throw that
thing inside and play in and out, as well.  
  
So I think ultimately it will be better. We don't know what it's going to look
like in the short run, but we might see more pack line and more zone defense
as a result.  
  
Q. There 's a game that stands out, December 21st, the return to United
Center to play Cincinnati. How big would that be, especially in the fact that
you guys had that tournament game last year against them in Columbus?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, it's interesting because when we scheduled the game,
obviously we didn't know we were going to play Cincinnati in the NCAA
Tournament, so to play them again so quickly, new coach, different style. But
for us, I think we looked at it to play a prominent program in a fabulous
facility in a city where we have a ton of alumni. Just a great opportunity, I
think, for our program to get on television in that atmosphere.  
  
I felt like the more you think about it, the more you hear, you more you
listen, you have to challenge your team with a tough schedule. If you want to
be considered on Selection Sunday, the message has been pretty clear. You have
to do that.  
  
So that was -- we play two challenge games, we're in a great tournament with
Texas Tech, Creighton, and San Diego State. We're at Iowa State, we're playing
Cincinnati in the United Center, 20 league games. By far the most challenging
schedule we've ever put together. But I think even though we still have some
new faces, I still think we have enough veterans that can handle that and
that's the challenge of it.  
  
Q. Do you guys plan on playing with or without Jordan Bohannon this
season?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, if he's healthy, we plan on playing with him. If he's
not, we'll play without him. I don't know what else to say about that, other
than he -- I think it's a good question because nobody knows what his status
is, and he's obviously critical to our team.  
  
I would have said eight weeks ago, seven weeks ago, we're playing it without
him. Now there's, I think, the possibility. He's not playing, but he's
dribbling and shooting and doing some things. So yeah, you feel -- we're
trying not to put pressure on him in any way, shape or form. I want him to be
able to play his senior year as pain-free as possible.  
  
So we're planning as if he's not playing. If he plays, we'll be thrilled that
he is, and he'll be able to jump back in because of how good he is and because
he's our senior leader.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_Hilton Rosemont - Rosemont, Ill._  
  
TOM IZZO: Like all of us, we're excited. It's a little early to start. I can't
believe with 24th. We have the Pistons in working out at our place right now,
they have their training camp, and to think we started a week earlier than the
NBA is hard for me to believe after all those years of going October 15th, and
it's now starting to creep in September.  
  
I've got a good team that I like with still a lot of question marks. Josh
Langford, health, question mark. What we do at the 4, question mark. And
probably the other one is we did lose 30 points and 15 rebounds and trying to
figure out how we get those. And yet with Winston, Henry, and Xavier Tillman,
we have three guys that played awfully well at the end of the year, and
hopefully they've grown some now.  
  
Excited to be back and excited to get started.  
  
Q. Tom, obviously we 've been asking coaches the same question, but the
California bill that would allow players to capitalize on their images and
likenesses, where do you stand on that?  
TOM IZZO: You know, I'm embarrassed to say this, but I had my SID get all you
writers, get your articles on it, and I tried to read up on it and figured
that you guys are the experts and you would know. So I had nine articles, and
there were nine different opinions. Mine is probably the tenth.  
  
The only thing that I would say on it, I sure as hell don't think it's a
politician's job to get involved in this. I'm baffled by that a little bit.  
  
But you know, I heard Mark say, I'm in for players getting whatever they can
get. I just don't know what the effects are going to be. And so I'm wide open
on it, like I've been other things. I don't think I'm giving a politician's
answer. I've learned over the last few years that it's hard to comment on
things that you don't know a lot about, and I don't know. All this stuff gets
thrown at you. I don't know what it'll be like to be on a team if some guy is
doing this and some guy is getting nothing. I don't know what that does to the
chemistry. I don't know how many people it's really going to benefit or to
what level it's going to benefit anybody.  
  
So I wish I could get more information, but if I said one thing that I think
we should do, I think we've got to get in front of this a little bit more. I
think sometimes we're a little bit reactive -- meaning schools, NCAA, whatever
-- and I think sooner or later, we've got to get a little more proactive.  
  
But I'm big on helping people with cancer, I'm big on the Coaches vs. Cancer,
and every time I go to an event, we're always trying to do more and raise more
and this and that. And every once in a while I tell people, don't forget what
we've accomplished. I mean, we've made great strides in that area.  
  
You know, I think the cost of attendance, the meals, the different things, and
having the Pistons there and learning about the G-League and their travels,
there's a lot of things that we've done that are really good. I hope we can
keep progressing in that manner. And if more money and there's better options,
I'd be all for it. But I just -- I'm a little afraid to comment on something
that I don't know what the residual effects will be on a team, a program or
anything else. So I'm for players getting as much as they can get that keeps
the playing field even and keeps everybody happy, and that's hard to do now.  
  
If you guys have got any good answers, because those of you that I read, you
guys were all over the map just like I am all over the map. So I think we're
all kind of questioning each other right now, and hopefully we'll all work
together to come up with a solution.  
  
Q. Fred Hoiberg was up here talking about you guys ' relationship,
specifically this winter when he came up to East Lansing and spent a lot of
time with you. Can you reflect on that time and the bonding you guys had and
also what his addition to the league means?  
TOM IZZO: Well, his -- you know, his son is on my team, so that makes a bond
in itself, and I asked him when he got the Nebraska job, does he want to take
him with. I think he felt the pressure of his wife and said, hell, no.  
  
But I'm glad his son is with me, but I've followed Fred -- I heard he made
some comments on his name and likeness. When you're called "the mayor," that
means you're probably bigger than anybody in that state. They might as well
have called him the governor when he played, so he probably could have made a
fortune in this.  
  
But I've enjoyed the chalk talks with Fred. Now he probably won't share those
same things with me, and I enjoyed watching what he did at Iowa State. I
thought he did an incredible job there, taking that program to what was
starting to become an elite level.  
  
You know, his opportunity at Nebraska, I think his grandfather was a coach
there, he was born or raised there, his parents are from there, his wife is
not that far away. Pretty unique situation. And the fans at Nebraska to me are
some of the best. You know, when they weren't even great they've packed that
place, and I've enjoyed Nebraska people. It'll be fun to see Fred there. We
just probably won't share chalk talks anymore.  
  
Q. You mentioned Joshua Langford 's health still be a question mark. Can
you update us on where he stands at this point?  
TOM IZZO: Yeah, and what I mean by question mark is he was out seven to seven
and a half months with the little bone in his foot, and just because it
doesn't get as much blood. And we were a little extra cautious on him because
we think he's very valuable. He was playing so good for us until he got hurt.
And if you look at NBA people or even college people and talk about how long
is the actual recovery once you start playing, sometimes it's half the time.
Well, half the time with our schedule early, there's going to be some question
marks.  
  
But he has been practicing just about every day. Now he's in live stuff for
the last two and a half weeks, three weeks, and making great progress. It's
just the unknown of how long it'll take to get him back to where he was
playing last November, December, and part of January before he got hurt. And I
think he's a key guy for us because at 6'5" he can really shoot it. But he's
kind of like a Gary Harris, he's a two-way player. He's one of our best
defenders, and losing McQuaid, we're going to need a perimeter guard that can
defend, although Aaron Henry has done a very good job of that, too.  
  
No lightning rods that are against them, it's just the time it's going to take
to get him back.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Juwan Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38047)

  
_Rosemont_  
  
JUWAN HOWARD: Good morning, everyone. Well, I'm the rookie. I'm excited about
this opportunity to be here today, my first Big Ten Media Days. I'm sure
there's some people here out here in this audience that I will get a chance to
meet and develop a relationship with. I'm looking forward to that. But let me
get right to it.  
  
I'm excited about this opportunity. This is a dream come true for me to have a
chance to come back to my alma mater, University of Michigan, one of the most
prestigious universities there is in this country. Michigan is a beautiful
place that helped me develop, become a student-athlete. I got my degree at the
University of Michigan, and I'm proud to call myself a Michigan man.  
  
Now I get an opportunity to coach at the University of Michigan and help
develop some of the best world-class athletes to become a student-athlete, to
play at a high level, to represent an amazing university.  
  
Q. I 'm sure you've followed Michigan from afar over the years, but now
that you've been around the team, now that you've seen them in the gym, what's
surprised you the most about this team?  
JUWAN HOWARD: Well, I've had a chance to watch them from afar. Being an
assistant coach (with the) Miami Heat organization -- and a chance to see a
guy like a Zavier Simpson who I've watched for many years, how he's developed
as a player, now having an opportunity to coach him, I see why he's been so
special, because he's a great person, an excellent leader, and a hard worker.  
  
But then the list falls after Zavier. A guy like Jon Teske, another person who
has improved a lot as a player. My goal is to help him get better as a player.
Isaiah Livers, who's developing day by day, high-character guys that are on
our team. It's a dream for a coach to have those guys in the trenches with
you.  
  
Q. As a graduate of Chicago Vocational and Chicago Public League, how
important is it going to be for you to recruit to the city and the CPS, and
will Chicago be an essential part of your recruiting strategy with the program
going forward?  
JUWAN HOWARD: Well, my walk has been special. Growing up here in Chicago, this
city, as we're here today, being a part of the public league was not only easy
for me, but it was challenging at times. So I wouldn't think because I had so
much success that it was an easy route. It was not like that. I had to face a
lot of adversity that helped me develop as a young man. Been through a lot of
wars with King and Simeon High School that taught me to compete at a high
level.  
  
Chicago has amazing talent in this city, and I will continue to recruit, not
only here in Chicago but in other parts of the country.  
  
Q. Been around long enough to remember when you played, obviously, there
at the University of Michigan. I 'm curious as you made the transition from
NBA player to the staff with the Miami Heat, when did it dawn on you that you
wanted to coach and eventually you wanted to be a head coach? When did those
ideas start to really foment in your mind to where you're in this position
today?  
JUWAN HOWARD: Well, it started early on when I was playing, my latter years of
my career. Like I would say back when I was playing for Portland before I
signed with the Miami Heat in 2009 as a player under Nate McMillan, that was
the time when I had conversations with Nate and Monty Williams asking them
questions about what it takes to be a coach, what it's like coaching in the
NBA. I started to put my brain around, you know what, before I was more
interested in like the front office, but that bug, that coaching bug, that
teaching bug became like what I wanted to do for my next walk.  
  
Signing with the Miami Heat, getting to know the Heat culture, working under
Erik Spoelstra, David Fizdale, Dan Craig, those guys were teaching me how to
prepare myself as a head coach. As I was an assistant with the Heat, those
were the moments where I was preparing myself, like you know what, this is me,
I'm embracing this opportunity. I started preparing myself as a head coach.  
  
Erik Spoelstra started teaching me how and what to look for, how to prepare
for it as a coach, how to prepare the game planning for opponents. All that
information and data I started collecting, and that was helping me prepare for
this day moving forward.  
  
Q. Curious to know your thoughts on the recent California law that was
passed where players are able to profit off their name and likenesses. As a
former player, now a coach, a feel like a lot of coaches are kind of
straddling the line on where they stand. Where do you stand?  
JUWAN HOWARD: Well, I don't know too much about it, to be honest with you.
I've heard a little bit of some information that's out there. I haven't had a
chance to really read about it. I've been more focused on our players, on
practices, getting ready for the season, day-to-day stuff that I'm dealing
with back at the University of Michigan, whether it's players' academics,
practices, planning, recruiting. But I've heard a little bit about it, and
unfortunately I haven't read anything on it, so I can't really comment. If
it's something I don't know about, I would prefer not to comment about it.  
  
Q. What are the challenges taking over a program that John Beilein
obviously put in a really good position?  
JUWAN HOWARD: Coach Beilein did an awesome job for this program. I don't know
if you know the story or not, but when I was working for the Miami Heat -- and
I told you before earlier that I was preparing myself for a head coach for
some day getting ready for if I ever had a chance to be a head coach, whether
it was in the NBA or college, what -- and how I would want my team and how I
would want my team to look. So every summer I used to go and visit Coach
Beilein. He would pick my brain on defense, on post defense. There were times
when we would have a session -- I call it a career workshop day -- where he
would have his staff, coaching staff out there, and we all would talk about
basketball and developing and skill development from an offensive standpoint.  
  
I've always had a lot of respect for Coach Beilein and his philosophy. There
were times I would ask Erik Spoelstra to reach out to Coach Beilein because I
would say, hey, this guy is interesting. He's one of the best basketball minds
out there. For now he takes his staff and makes a huge jump to the NBA and
becomes the Cleveland Cavaliers' coach. Now, I'm sure a lot of people think,
you have a lot of pressure on you to try to fill those shoes. All I can say is
this: I'm not going to try to be like Coach Beilein. He has his philosophy,
his way of doing things. I have my philosophy, and I feel that works for our
team moving forward. But I do respect the gentleman who was there before me.  
  
Q. The addition of Phil Martelli to your staff, how much have you leaned
on his experience already and how much do you intend to lean on his experience
going forward?  
JUWAN HOWARD: His name is the Godfather. I think hiring Coach Martelli, to let
you know this, that, A, I'm humbled; B, that I respect guys who have been head
coaches and have a ton of experience. I would be a fool not to sit there and
pick Coach's brain or use him. He's on the staff. He's a guy that I'm going to
lean on a lot. I think he has so much experience. 24 years as a head coach, 34
years total, that says a lot. That he knows a lot about college basketball,
and that's why -- and I'm very fortunate that I was able to get this Christmas
gift early by hiring Coach Phil Martelli.  
  
Q. Do you have to explain to your players and the guys that you 're
recruiting who the Fab Five is and what your relationship is with Chris
Webber, or do they know?  
JUWAN HOWARD: You know what, that's a very good question. I haven't had a
chance to even talk about the Fab Five. I think a lot of our guys do their
homework. They're very smart. They know what the Fab Five is. They understand
what I've done at my collegiate level. They've seen -- I think the majority of
them have seen the Fab Five documentary. Chris Webber in my opinion is a Hall
of Famer, not only on the collegiate level but also on the NBA level. Keep in
mind, I recruited Chris Webber to come to the University of Michigan, and at
that time people said, hey, how can two guys that play the same position
coexist on the floor? But we had an amazing coach like Steve Fisher who
figured it out, and we've had a lot of success and learned a lot from Coach
Fisher. But Chris is a Michigan man.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

  
_Hilton Rosemont - Rosemont, Ill._  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Let me begin by thanking Jim Delany for his incredible work
here with our league in particular and obviously our men's basketball
programs. I think we're all very appreciative and really excited about the
next step, the next phase, with Kevin here as we move forward in our league.  
  
I think our league obviously had a tremendous year collectively last year with
a number of NCAA Tournament teams as well as the number of teams that advanced
to the second and to the Sweet 16, and obviously Michigan State's run. So
congratulations to all those teams.  
  
Listen, I wish I had a lot of answers for you today. I'm not sure that I do.
This is a little earlier than we typically have this time. Like all of our
coaches, I'm sure we're anxiously anticipating consistent work with our guys
on a regular basis so that we can figure out a little bit more what our team
looks like and continue to grow and develop with our team, and that's really
our focus right now is we're focused more on the bricks than the wall right
now.  
  
I think as much as we can, that's going to remain our focus here as we move
forward.  
  
But like all the coaches, we're excited and anxious for the season to continue
to get moving in the second and third week of practice.  
  
Q. I was in Nebraska this past week at Ohio State-Nebraska and the
football game. We 're here about basketball, but Ohio State is such a big time
university for all athletics, what's it like for you to have this energy
coming in every year from the football team coming in to get you guys started
off great on basketball season?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, listen, as I've said to a lot of our local media, I
think it's a tremendous asset to have a program like our football program and
some of our other programs that compete at the highest level and compete for a
National Championship. Like you, I watched that game. It was a tremendous
environment in Lincoln, as you'd expect for really all the basketball games
and the football -- tremendous environment. I'm so happy for Ryan and his
staff and how they're playing, and obviously I'm sure he's focused on the next
game, which is Michigan State on Saturday.  
  
Q. What do your guys say about your drip?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: You know, I just ran into them, and they were pleased. They
were pleased. I didn't get the drip comment like I did after one of our games
last year, so maybe I need to step up my game.  
  
Q. You had mentioned maybe a week or two ago that E.J. and Justin and
Musa were all dealing with some injuries, and it sounded like you expected at
least Justin and E.J. back at some point. Is there any update on Musa and
whether or not you 'll have him back for camp or for the start of the
season?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: So we have three guys out right now, Justin Ahrens -- they're
not in contact, though, not in full contact. Justin and E.J. have had limited
work in noncontact drills. Musa Jallow is out and will remain out probably for
certainly the next week or two. So obviously we want to get those guys back as
quickly as we can. I believe that E.J. and Justin will begin to go full
practice here in the next few days, as long as their test results come back
positive.  
  
Q. I know this league is always good, but can you talk a little bit
about the depth of this league and especially with a 20-game schedule, what
that grind is like from beginning to end?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: You know, it's a great question. We experienced it last year,
and you know, I think it is -- last year was the youngest team I have ever
coached, and this year is going to be even younger with over half of our
roster being freshmen and sophomores. So to go through that grind with a young
group, I think it taught me a lot of lessons, and we got beat up, quite
honestly. We really got beat up.  
  
I have so much respect for the quality -- it's clearly in my mind the deepest
league in the country. I think it's arguable there could be other leagues that
you would consider along those lines, but the depth of it is what makes it, I
think, special, and I don't see that changing anytime soon. I think it's going
to be as deep or deeper than it was last year.  
  
Q. Obviously you 've got a talented player out of this state in E.J.
Liddell. When he is healthy what does he bring to your program and what does
he bring to the Big Ten?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: You know, he's one of those really interesting and we've got
them -- Penn State has an incredible one that's a mismatch issue at the
forward position that's a tremendous player on both ends in Lamar.  
  
I think for E.J., he's one of those guys that is just a difficult match-up
when he's really playing well, and he's going to go through some ups and downs
and bumps and bruises. But what we loved about him was his ability to
obviously impact the game on both ends, but really he's got a unique skill set
at that size. And he's one of those guys that you coach, guys that they're
kind of wired to score. They can roll out of bed a little bit and score, and
that's what E.J. can do. He's got to get healthy, got to get in better shape,
but we're excited about his year.  
  
Q. Pat Chambers was up here talking about Lamar Stevens and said he 's
challenged him to have a Mamba mentality, every drill, every practice, every
game. Have you challenged Kaleb in any way like that, and what have you seen
from him in the early going here in practice?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Has Lamar not had that in the past because he's been pretty
danged good without that?  
  
You know, I think that that is the next step for -- Kaleb obviously took a
significant jump at him from his freshman to sophomore year, and he deserves a
lot of credit for that, as did his brother from sophomore to junior season. I
think the next step is more consistency, both in practice -- obviously it
begins there. And then his play, and then beginning to adjust as to how teams
are playing him.  
  
His biggest issue even as good a year as he had last year was he has to play
smarter in terms of his fouls. We've got to help him with that as a coaching
staff. He's got to take the next step there. And we're anxious to see if he
will.  
  
Q. As far as the point guard situation goes, do you guys have somebody
you look at and say, okay, he 's the likely starter, or with C.J. and D.J. are
you going to let that play out for a little while?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, we'll let it play out really with all of our positions
to be honest with you. I think it's going to be -- we're in constant
evaluation mode. I think that position, it's exciting to us because we have
some experience, obviously, in C.J. Walker and in D.J. Carton, a young guy who
is really gifted. So we'll play those two together, as well. So we don't
always look at it as an either-or situation.  
  
I think there will definitely be times when they play together.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Fred Hoiberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21399)

  
_Hilton Rosemont - Rosemont, Ill._  
  
FRED HOIBERG: Just want to talk a little bit about the way things have gone
with our team so far. We have a lot of new faces with this group, and we had a
trip to Italy about a month ago, which was very beneficial for our group. Of
our 16 players, 14 of them are brand-new. The only player returning that had
any Big Ten action last year was Thor, who averaged two points and one
rebound. We don't have a lot of production coming back. Dachon Burke was a
player who's been really good for us so far in the preseason that sat out a
year ago, so he was able to watch what the Big Ten was all about.  
  
With all the new faces, our big thing is trying to make progress every day.
The fact that we had those two weeks, almost two weeks in Italy, the best
thing about that trip was the fact that our players had an opportunity to bond
with each other and get to know each other. And when you have as many new
faces as we do, that was the important part of that trip.  
  
X's and O's, putting in our system obviously is important, but the fact that
our guys got to spend a lot of quality time was the biggest benefit of that
trip over to Europe.  
  
I like this group. They play extremely hard. They come to work every day.
We're going in the mornings right now, sometimes got to kick them in the butt
a little bit to get them going, but they're very competitive. They like to get
after it. We're going to have to be a team that plays fast. We're going to be
-- especially seeing some of the student-athletes here in the practice room
this morning, we're going to be undersized at pretty much every position, so
we're going to have to try to play fast, get out, play with great pace, and
try to win games that way.  
  
But I do like this group. I hope we go out and play with a chip on our
shoulder every time we step on the floor. But we're hoping for a great year.  
  
Q. I saw a statistic recently, you mentioned you only have two guys back
from the program from the year before. But as I understand it, the fans have
sold out your building for the entire season. What kind of excitement level is
building even though the fans have no idea what product they 're going to see
on the court, but they know that better times are coming, I guess, for
Nebraska?  
FRED HOIBERG: Well, our fan support is off the charts, and we had our opening
night event just this last Friday, the night before the Ohio State football
game, and every seat in our arena was filled, and that just shows you the
support. And I think more than anything, the fans just wanted to see what our
players looked like and put a name to the face. It was very well attended. Our
guys did a great job. We went out and played two running clock scrimmages.  
  
But that's one of the great things about Nebraska. We have two things going
for us as much as any in the country. One is the support with our fans,
Memorial Stadium has been sold out since 1962, which is unbelievable, and
we've sold every seat for our upcoming season. And the other one is the
facilities. I think our facilities are as nice as any in the country.  
  
Again, we're excited to go out there. We just want to put a product on the
floor that makes our fans proud.  
  
Q. I 'm going to ask the same question I asked Coach Frost at Big Ten
football days. What's it like for you to be back home, family around, and be
in Nebraska, family atmosphere for you?  
FRED HOIBERG: Yeah, for me, I was born in Lincoln, and I have a lot of family
ties to the University. Both my parents, they went to high school together,
Lincoln Southeast; both went to the University of Nebraska. And then when my
dad got his Ph.D. back in 1974, he had two job offers actually; one was in
Lawrence, Kansas, and one was in Ames, Iowa. And I'm forever grateful to my
dad for making the right choice and moving our family to Ames.  
  
The really cool thing for me, both my grandfathers have a great history with
Nebraska. My Grandpa Hoiberg was a history professor for 30 years. My
Grandfather Bush was the head coach at Nebraska for nine years. And to hear
stories of his former players that have come to practices or sent me letters
or emails and just talk about the impact that he had on their lives, that's
been really cool. And just all the connections that people have. I have an
aunt and uncle that live there, I have two cousins that live there, my brother
lives in Omaha. So it's been great. I always consider Ames my home. There's no
doubt about that. But it's funny how life comes full circle sometimes, and it
certainly has for me.  
  
Q. Rick Ross performed last week --  
FRED HOIBERG: He did.  
  
Q. How did that happen?  
FRED HOIBERG: I'm a huge fan. The way that works is -- that's really your
question? The way it works is he's an Adidas performer, and through his Adidas
sponsorship, that's how that concert was.  
  
I have a pacemaker, the bass was so loud, I thought my pacemaker was going to
explode. Our guys loved it, they were up on stage with him, and really overall
it was a great night for our team.  
  
Q. You obviously had a lot to accomplish in a short amount of time when
you got here. At this point given that you play an exhibition game in less
than a month, are you to the point that you expected to be? And I guess maybe
gauge the progress you 've made since day one?  
FRED HOIBERG: No, I don't think if you talked to any of us right now we're
where we want to be, still so early in the process. Again, I'll go back to our
guys' mentality and their approach. Every day they come in with a workmanlike
approach, and that's the thing that I've really enjoyed about this group.  
  
I do think they're going to go out there and compete. Right now the battle
that we're having with our players -- and this is whether we were playing the
exhibition games over in Italy or we have our inter-squad scrimmage -- when
things are going well, we're pretty damned good. We're out there, playing with
a swagger, playing fast. When we hit a little adversity, that's when you've
got to find a way to break through and continue to go out there and fight.
That's human nature, I think, with everybody. Especially when everybody right
now is still so new and trying to figure each other out, is how do you stay
together collectively and fight through those tough times because we're going
to hit it every time we step on the floor.  
  
Q. Obviously Jack is on Michigan State 's team as a walk on. You got to
spend time around Tom Izzo's program last year. How much did that help you get
a lay of the land in the Big Ten, and how much did you rely on Tom Izzo for
advice in that process?  
FRED HOIBERG: Yeah, Coach Izzo is one of my favorites, and when I got let go
in December last year in Chicago, I spent a lot of time in East Lansing. For
me, it was more beneficial to go up and watch the practices because Jack had a
huge role running the scout team as the point guard. I'd spent days with Coach
Izzo -- even on a game day we spent three hours together just writing ideas up
on the board and talking about different things, X's and O's-wise. But I have
relied on him, and I've talked to him a lot. You know, I consider him a very
good friend in this business, and there's not a better guy to lean on than
Coach Izzo, who's done as much as he has and who's respected as much as he is.  
  
Q. You 've got a lot of new faces on your team, but you've got a lot of
high-scoring players. Do you believe this team could surprise a lot of people
this season?  
FRED HOIBERG: Well, that's what we're going to strive for. I know we've been
picked towards the bottom, and I understand that, with all the new faces and
people just haven't seen our guys very much. We have high school kids, we have
a couple grad transfers that are eligible for us, and we have a couple junior
college players.  
  
But you know, like I said, if we can really buy into going out there and
playing together, buying into going out there and being a low turnover team,
every night we've got to find a way to defend, and we have to rebound. That's
going to be our biggest challenge, I think, is rebounding, just with the size
of our team.  
  
But if we can get that, I am confident that we can get out and run with
anybody. Hopefully, we'll stick to that, but like I said, it's a group that I
really like because of their competitive nature.  
  
Q. You have a lot of experience. You 've been an NBA player, executive,
obviously college coach. This new California bill that would allow players to
capitalize on their images and likenesses, where do you stand on that?  
FRED HOIBERG: I'll say this: As a former student-athlete I would have loved to
be compensated for my likeness. There's no doubt about that. I think
especially playing in my hometown. I think that could have been a pretty good
deal for a guy like me.  
  
It's going to be interesting to see how it all plays out. I have no idea how
it will play out. But I do think it's progress, no doubt about that. And it's
going to take people a lot smarter than me to figure out how to get this thing
moving in the right direction, but I do think it's progress.  
  
Q. What 's something that you learned during your experience coaching in
the NBA that you can now bring back to the college ranks that you may not have
known before?  
FRED HOIBERG: Well, I know this: I'm a lot better coach for being in that
league for four years, and when you're going up against the greatest minds on
the planet on a nightly basis -- just game planning against Gregg Popovich one
night and Mike D'Antoni the next night, Budenholzer -- there's so many great
basketball minds you learn from, and it helped me. I'll always cherish my time
that I had here in Chicago. It was very important for me as a coach. Hopefully
we can apply some of those things that we learned from and be better because
of it.  
  
But I'm looking forward to getting back on the sidelines. I'd had enough of
waking up and drinking coffee and watching game shows and doing puzzles. I'd
had enough of that. So I was ready to get back out here, and I'm really
excited to be at Nebraska.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

  
_Hilton Rosemont - Rosemont, Ill._  
  
GREG GARD: I thought I was going to toe the line with pinstripes, but I see
obviously -- anyway, it's great to be back. Obviously, it seems like this gets
earlier and earlier every year. We're four days into practice, so if my voice
gives out a little bit, that's why.  
  
But for us, obviously it's been an unchartered territory the last three, four
months as our program has walked through obviously a personal tragedy with one
of my assistants Howard Moore and his family. But our players have done a
really good job of handling all this with a mature approach. And like I said,
I had a really good summer, a really good fall, and now into practice and off
and running. Really good group. I'm looking forward to how they continue to
develop and mature as we work through the next few weeks before we start
playing, and excited for what obviously, as always, will be an extremely tough
Big Ten schedule from top to bottom. Terrific league. We get a chance to
obviously have been in it for a long time, long time as an assistant, and then
obviously into my fourth or fifth year here as the head coach.  
  
Like I said, I like my group. We've got a lot of exciting pieces that will
have different roles as this group builds and grows through the year, and I
know they're excited about their opportunities and what's going to happen and
how this year unfolds.  
  
With that, I'll take any questions.  
  
Q. Coach, it doesn 't seem like you put a lot of stock into your 2019-20
season for recruiting but focused more on your 2020-21 season. Is that true,
and if so, what was your strategy behind it?  
GREG GARD: We just try to continue to find the best players we can that want
to be at the University of Wisconsin. Obviously, I can't talk specifically
about the future because of NCAA rules, but recruiting is cyclical. There�s
years you're going to have multiple scholarships open. There's going to be
years that you don't have as many. It's an ever-changing barometer in terms of
who we target, where we target, those type of things.  
  
I would say none of it was intentional. It's just how it kind of -- it
organically works itself out.  
  
Q. Your team has been through a lot about Howard Moore, the tragic
situation there. A lot of young guys on that team (indiscernible).  
GREG GARD: Yeah, the question was about Coach Moore and how we've handled that
situation, how our team has handled it.  
  
You know, I think as I mentioned in my opening statement, it's unchartered
territory. There's not a manual for how do you handle those things. And as
I've gone through my career, I've been advised on many things and have gotten
great mentorship from a lot of different people, but that is an area that I
haven't experienced that there's not a roadmap for that. I think the one thing
we've tried to do, obviously we've always had a very tight-knit family or
group with our program, and I think it's in these times that you really lean
on each other. We've tried to keep our players up to date on a day-to-day
basis or week-to-week basis in terms of the progress of Coach Moore. And then
anything that obviously was much more consistent back in late May, June, as
the details of that accident all unfolded and in the following weeks.  
  
But I think you never know what's coming around the corner. I think that's one
thing we've learned. You obviously appreciate every day, don't take anything
for granted. I think, like I said, it's always been a tight group and a
feeling of togetherness. This is probably because of its -- you always talk
about those things in terms of athletics or the sport arena. And now you have
a real-life experience that everybody is having to walk through that puts a
whole different light and takes it to a whole different level.  
  
But we've had great support. My coaching staff, Alando Tucker stepping in in
the interim role and the job Joe Krabbenhoft and Dean Oliver has done has been
exceptional. And then it works its way down from there, from our support staff
and obviously how our players have handled it and stuck together and helped
each other through. I'm proud of all of them and everybody that's helped walk
through this with all of us, and even the support from the Big Ten community
and nationally has been exceptional. We just continue to keep Coach Moore and
his family in our thoughts as we walk forward.  
  
Q. Obviously we 're here for basketball media day, but football right
now on the campus is phenomenal. What's it like for your players, you're
coming in, practicing, seeing the energy on the campus and them getting ready
for basketball season?  
GREG GARD: Well, I think that's one of the things that makes Wisconsin
special, is that we've got really good sports in a lot of different areas, and
obviously football Saturdays are unique and special, and our guys are good
friends with a lot of the players, so they enjoy to share in those
experiences. A lot of our guys played football before they went to college, so
they understand the game and enjoy that part of it. I think you just -- it
adds an extra level of -- or an extra dynamic to campus and to the athletic
department when you have successful teams, whether it's football, volleyball,
track, basketball, hockey. When you have that type of energy and that type of
positivity flowing around campus specifically with your student-athletes, it's
healthy all the way around.  
  
Q. Like you mentioned, you 've been in this league for a long time. How
do you think the new three-point distance is going to impact Big Ten play
specifically the first year it's implemented?  
GREG GARD: Yeah, it's a good question. I think as I've watched it with our
team through the summer and then now this fall, I really -- players adapt
really quickly. It'll be interesting to see what the percentages do. I think
they may dip a little bit. You just watch what the small sample size was in
the NIT last year, teams dropped just a hair. But our players have seemed to
adapt to it really easily, and I don't think it's going to be maybe as big of
an adjustment as what it's perceived to be. We'll see. Numbers will bear it
out. Duration of the season will bear it out. Does it change defensive
concepts, does it bring more zone into play, do teams squeeze the floor and
pack it in even more? I don't think so too much, just because I've watched our
team adjust and shoot it in our drills and in our workouts relatively the same
as what it was in a little closer.  
  
Q. How do you think the California Fair Pay to Play Act will impact the
college landscape, and what are your thoughts in general on it?  
GREG GARD: Well, I think the one thing is it's so new, and that's such an
unexplored world that there's so much we don't know of where it's going to go,
what it's going to lead to. I'm always in favor of trying to enhance the
student-athletes' experience, and I think what the NCAA and specifically what
we've done at Wisconsin over the last several years has made their experiences
better, whether it's been cost of attendance, meals, those type of things.  
  
I think it's just such an unchartered territory, and the implications and
domino effect that something like that can have are completely unknown.  
  
Like I said, right now there's not probably enough knowledge and information
out about that to understand exactly where that all leads to.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Jim Delany](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24310)

  
_Rosemont, Ill._  
  
JIM DELANY: Good morning. Just have a couple of preliminary comments, some
looking backwards and maybe a couple looking forward. Had a really nice dinner
last night with the coaches and some of our staff. I know they're excited to
get going. Everybody is undefeated, and it's an exciting time of the year for
them.  
  
Looking backwards, also, I'm really pleased with the quality and the quantity
of the teams and the players that we have been able to put out there on behalf
of the Big Ten, especially over the last 20 years or so. There's some data in
front of you that speaks to the postseason efforts, the regular season
efforts, and media coverage and fan participation. We led the country for 43
years in attendance. We also have more media partners than any other
conference, so all of our games are nationally telecast, and in particular I
think the growth of BTN has really aided and supported Big Ten basketball. But
to have CBS, FOX, and ESPN regularly promoting marketing of Big Ten teams, I
think is really good.  
  
I'd like to sort of tip my hat to the basketball committee. I was a member 30
years ago, but they continue to refine the tournament and develop it, and, you
know, they say that strength of schedule matters, and they act that way. So
it's not just a talking point for them.  
  
Last year they introduced a new metric. There's no one metric that's magic,
but the fact that the NET was exposed for the first time early on, it looked
like it was maybe a little bit off, but as the season wore on, I think it was
a good metric. I like the idea of having sort of a bundle of indicators to
indicate who's playing whom and who's winning. Ultimately it's up to the
members of the committee, but last year, I think 13 of our 14 schools were in
the top 100 in the NET, another seven or eight in the top 60.  
  
Going out and playing an ACC challenge, Gavitt Games, and big events, and also
moving to 20 games in a year where we won 80 percent of our non-conference
games really reflected well on us. I think it's measurable success, and
resulted in eight teams advancing to the tournament. And quite honestly, with
a couple of breaks, we could have had a ninth or tenth team. So not every year
maybe will be as successful as last year was, but I think it's indicative of
the committee walking the walk with regard to strength of schedule, and I
think you're going to see more conferences go to 20 games as we have and space
the games. You'll note that we play 14 games -- everybody plays a couple in
early December, which really helps us space games in January and February. I
think we play 58 games in 75 days from January 2 to the end of our tournament.
We play 58 games in 38 days early in the year.  
  
Basketball is a two-semester sport. A lot of people think basketball doesn't
really kick off until football is over. That's not true in the Big Ten with
the games we play against quality opponents. Two years ago or last year, we
had a replay of the Michigan-Villanova championship game of the previous year.
This year we'll have a replay of the Michigan State-Duke game with an Elite 8
game as well as Purdue and Virginia. So you'll see sprinkled through November,
December, games that really pop.  
  
So I think that with two semesters, if you're not trying to make basketball
relevant from the middle of November until the middle of December, you're not
really doing your job. We couldn't do what we've done without working very
closely with our coaches, and so I appreciate them collaborating with us in
that respect.  
  
Let me stop there. That's looking back a little bit. Looking forward a little
bit, we've got a lot of returning players. I think we have 17 players who are
first, second, third team or honorable mention Big Ten, and we've got a lot of
good young players coming into the conference. With the media partners that we
have and the venues that we have and the loyal fans that we have, I think
we're really well-positioned.  
  
Last point, three years ago -- a little bit more than three years ago I think
was the third week of September -- the FBI announced a variety of arrests and
charges. Those cases seemed to be put to bed. The NCAA now is following up on
those cases. While it may have only affected the tip of the iceberg in terms
of recruiting, it really did corrupt the recruiting process.  
  
So I'd like to give a nod to our coaches and programs for the fewest mentions
in sort of the FBI rap sheet. I think most people who follow basketball
closely realize that no conference, no team, no individual is perfect, but I
would tell you that I think that over time that our conference coaches have
recruited in the spirit of the rules, and when something goes wrong, there's
an acknowledgment and we try to work with it. But it's going to be interesting
to see the price that people pay for having participated in what is obviously
some corrupt practices. Corporate entities who work closely with our
institutions clearly were engaged in a pattern of affecting recruiting
outcomes.  
  
So I don't know exactly how the NCAA will handle this at the end of the day,
but while it may have only touched 1 percent of the players, it really did, I
think, affect and impact what ought to be a choice process for our students to
go where they want to go to school, play where they want to play, and sort of
let the chips fall where they may. So that was sort of an unfortunate but not
a shocking revelation, and it's taken three years, and it'll probably be
another year or two before it's finally worked out. But I appreciate our
coaches and the efforts they've made to operate within the spirit of the rule.  
  
With that, let me just stop at this point and see what questions you may have.  
  
Q. A lot of people are talking about the California bill where players
will be able to capitalize on their images and likenesses. Where do you stand
on that?  
JIM DELANY: Yeah, I'm a huge basketball fan, and as such, I appreciate the
games that are played on the playground, I appreciate the games that are
played in high school. I love the college game. I watch the NBA in the spring
and I watch the Olympics every four years, and I think each of those has an
appropriate place. Certainly the high schools and the colleges are education-
based systems.  
  
You know, I think that there's going to be a period of time between now and
the time that bill goes into effect -- and I'm sure there will be lots of NCAA
conversations, maybe some Congressional conversations, maybe some litigation
-- but my view is that there may be some players who are ready for the
professional ranks, but that's not the college ranks. And I would like to see
players who are ready for the professional ranks to be able to access the
professional game, either through the G-League or I'd like to see the owners
and the unions open up opportunities for young people as you have in baseball.  
  
Same thing about the NFL; we're not the minor leagues. We're involved in an
enterprise that touches 100,000 players, and maybe there's 1 percent or 2
percent that may have commercial value, but I would prefer that they have the
choice to move that into the professional ranks, because I really don't see
much difference myself between name image and likeness payments by a corporate
sponsor or pay for play.  
  
It's a belief system I have. I know that people differ on it. I think the law
of unintended consequences and the law of slippery slope apply here, and so my
view is I'll be out in about 85 days. I think this will be discussed, and I
think it will be litigated, and I think it will be a Congressional issue.
We're not perfect, but I think that the opportunities that we have for the
great many shouldn't be sacrificed at the altar of the 1 percent that probably
would have an opportunity to benefit here. It's a college game. It's different
than the NBA, different than the Olympics, different than the playground. So I
hope we're able to maintain the opportunities we have for men and women and
avoid pay for play insofar as we can.  
  
Q. Can you discuss how the transition is going from you to Kevin at this
point?  
JIM DELANY: Yeah, it's gone really well. There have been really two phases.
Kevin was wrapping up with Minnesota this summer, and so we had a chance to
meet a couple times here in Chicago in person as well as I was in Minneapolis
on the BTN football tour and we had a chance to have dinner there. And we were
talking really weekly for an hour, hour and a half. One week it was mine, the
next week was his. So we had a great -- we developed a great rapport. He came
to work as an employee of the Big Ten on September 16, and he shares an office
next to mine. And we've had all of our partners come in, all of our network
partners, all of our law firms, our full partners -- the Rose Bowl has been
through, branding partners. And so I've tried to share with them on a
highlight fashion some of the challenges we've had over the last decade. I
know what it is to be a new commissioner, whether it's in the Ohio Valley
(Conference) or here, so I've tried to be responsive to him.  
  
On January 2, he'll take over. January 1 is my last date, but it's been a
really great experience. I've gotten to know him really well. Experienced guy,
trained as a lawyer, has an MBA degree, has worked for a couple of NFL
franchises. But the real insight that he brings, I think, is as a former
player himself and his kids played. His daughter was a track and field person
at Occidental, and his son is a football player at Mississippi State. So
between his own personal experiences, his education, his career, and now the
opportunity to spend three months together working on a daily basis and put
faces and organizations together, I think has been really constructive. A lot
of people say you can't have two people in the same office in this kind of
way, but for us it's been uniformly positive, and it's been great to get to
know him. I think he'll be a great leader in the Big Ten Conference in years
to come.  
  
Q. Getting back to the California law, what sort of obstacles do you see
that posing for college athletics?  
JIM DELANY: Well, you know, it's three years away. And I've read about the
bill; I haven't read the bill itself. But essentially college sports is a
national undertaking. As such, we have national television, we have national
competition, we have national recruitment. And it just defies -- is beyond my
imagination to know how we can have different states pass laws with respect to
the undertaking of academics or recruitment. So ultimately I think there has
to be a national solution. Whether it comes from Congress or whether the NCAA
is able to find a middle road here, that's sort of to be determined.  
  
But you know, it's unusual. It's interesting. I don't think it was necessarily
predictable, but it looks like there's some copycat bills out there. But I
really don't understand and don't fully comprehend how -- whether you're in
South Carolina or whether you're in New York or whether you're in California,
how we can operate under 50 different statutes. I view it as a national
undertaking. I view it as a unique -- really a unique setting. We have 100,000
student-athletes in Division I, about 500,000 throughout the system. In fact,
Big Ten alone has 10,000 student-athletes, which is double the number of all
the professional sports in America. So you have less than 5,000 professionals,
and you have 10,000 athletes in the Big Ten and 500,000.  
  
So what works in the Olympics with 500 athletes every four years and what
works in the NFL or NBA with 1,500 players doesn't necessarily work for
100,000 players. So they're very different systems.  
  
We have equity across the conference and across the NCAA, so it's about 50/50
in terms of the educational opportunities that are provided. In professional
sports, it's like 90/10. Only the WNBA and a little bit of soccer, that you
have that sort of equity. So they're a different set of organizations. They
have their place. I love professional sports. Didn't get a chance to play
them, but I have great affection for them. I follow them. Bulls fan, Cubs fan,
Knicks fan, Giants.  
  
But very different than what we do, and I would just like to see more
opportunity, more choice for our students for making the choice as to which
college they want to go to or if they're on a professional track. To me it
should be more like baseball where the minor leagues -- I think there's 6,000
young people playing in minor league baseball and really none in the NFL and
just a few in the NBA.  
  
So I think it's an appropriate track for people who want to pursue that, and I
think the college system is uniquely separate, uniquely different historically
and should be retained insofar as possible. As Arne Duncan said, other than
the military, it probably does as great a job of educating, providing
leadership for young people as any institution in the country.  
  
Q. I think the Big Ten distributed about $800 million. I think that was
the revenue last year. What would be your message directly to the athletes in
this league who believe they should capitalize off their likenesses and their
images as to why they shouldn 't be allowed to do that?  
JIM DELANY: You know, my point would be that the student who plays athletics
in the Big Ten is in school for education first, that there's an amazing
opportunity to get a world-class education here, and there's also amazing
opportunity to compete in a great conference with great recognition and, if
they so choose, to prepare themselves to be a professional some day, whether
it's in Europe, Asia or in the U.S. But that it is a unique -- it's not the
NBA. It's not the WNBA. It is an educational arrangement, full-time students
playing basketball or football. We have been fortunate, the world has changed
a lot, and I think we have responded to that in a lot of ways, whether it's
the scholarship plus full cost of attendance plus degree completion, come back
when you need to, a voice and a vote inside the system that didn't exist a
while back, multi-year scholarships. So I think a lot of progress has been
made on behalf of the student. I've been an advocate for students and for
support of students.  
  
But to me, the outer limit is the cost of college. Once we're beyond the cost
of college, we're in pay for play, and I think that puts us in a totally
different game. It probably does affect 1 or 2 percent of the players, but I
would rather see the resolution to have those 1 or 2 percent of players to
have the opportunity to go directly into professional sports, whether it's
baseball, basketball or football, and really not to ask the whole system to
turn. I think there is a law of unintended consequences. I do think it would
undermine the fairness in the recruitment. And while I understand their point
of view, I have a different point of view, and I don't know that I can
convince them of the rightness of my position. I respect theirs.  
  
There are cases in litigation. There is action in state legislatures.
Ultimately there may be a federal solution. But my view is you can differ with
somebody and still have tremendous respect for them, and I certainly do for
our students, and glad we have them, and glad they can take the opportunity of
a world-class education while playing at a very high level in the college
game.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Chris Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26016)

  
_Hilton Rosemont - Rosemont, Ill._  
  
CHRIS COLLINS: It's good to see everybody. Before we dive into my team, just
wanted to congratulate Commissioner Delany on an amazing run of. Being in the
conference for the last six years and being around him and what he's been able
to accomplish during his tenure has been incredible. Also excited to be a part
of Commissioner Warren's new regime. It's just funny how life is full circle.
When I was a little kid growing up outside of Philadelphia, my father was the
volunteer coach at the University of Pennsylvania, and the backcourt was Fran
McCaffery and Kevin Warren, and I was the ball boy. It's funny to see how
things turn out later in life.  
  
But excited to have those. Also wanted to welcome Fred and Juwan to the
conference, two great basketball guys. When you look in the room and you're
amongst all the heads coaches, you feel honored to be part of such a great
group. Although personally I'm a little down because I used to feel really
good about being in the room, about me being the best player in the room. And
if I'm being quite honest, I think I just got knocked down a couple pegs with
those guys.  
  
Anyway, with our guys, obviously it's a new phase to our program, what we've
been able to do over the last six years through the ups and downs. We had a
great group of guys that accomplished a lot of things when we came in and won
over 100 games, went to a tournament, advanced far in the Big Ten Tournament.
Did a lot of things in the history of our program that a lot of people even in
this room thought would never be possible. It was a great group of guys.  
  
As I look in my locker room now, it's a whole new group. For me that's very
exciting. We have eight freshman and sophomores, and it reminds me a lot of
kind of what we were trying to build when that McIntosh-Law-Pardon-Lindsey
group kind of started their journeys. I feel good about our young talent. I
feel like we're on the right track towards our future. But obviously I
understand from afar where expectations can be because you look on paper and
there's a lot of unknowns when you look at our roster.  
  
But it's exciting as a coach to kind of dive into that and grow and try to
build and see what we can become. We have three veteran guys. A.J. Turner and
Anthony Gaines are two returning guys that we're going to really lean on for
leadership consistently, a veteran presence. And then outside of our eight
freshmen and sophomores, our other veteran player hasn't played organized
basketball since his senior year of high school as a grad transfer in Pat
Spencer.  
  
So there's a lot of new guys, a lot of youthful excitement, exuberance. I feel
good about our young talent. We just have to grow. We need experience. And as
you guys know, the Big Ten can be a tough training ground for young players,
and that's why we've got to stay the course. We've got to continue to get
better. And I feel -- I do feel really good about where the future of our
program is heading. Our young group, the talent is there, the attitudes are
there. They work hard. I feel like we have a lot of pieces that can become
outstanding players in our conference as they gain experience and hopefully
get better with our skill development and in our system.  
  
You know, just things are on the up and up in my opinion, even though the last
two years from a win-loss perspective is not where we wanted to be. But you
move forward, and excited to see what we can do with this group. The Big Ten
is going to be Murderer's Row again, just like it always is. A lot of great
teams, amazing fan bases, great coaches, tough places to play. And you've got
to just take it one game at a time and try to put yourself in a position to
try to compete every night.  
  
I thought we did that for the most part of last year. You look at our record
and it doesn't look good. But if you dissect what we did, I felt like we were
in almost every game, and we just didn't close the deal. That's where we've
got to get better. We need to make plays late, we need to find a way to score
late in games when you need to get those critical stops, manage the game with
time and score. And that's an area we really need to improve this year if we
want to make a jump in terms of our wins and losses in the conference.  
  
Great to get started again, and obviously open to any questions.  
  
Q. Like a lot of people, I 'm shocked when I hear seven years, but can
you tell me a little bit about where you think where you're at as a coach now
seven years ago compared to say maybe where you were three, four years into
your time at Northwestern?  
CHRIS COLLINS: Yeah, it's a great question. I think as you come in -- for me,
not a lot of guys -- I was very fortunate to get an opportunity in a
conference like the Big Ten with no head coaching experience. So for me,
there's a lot of learning that goes into that. I feel along the way I'm still
growing as a coach. You know, I always say I'm 45, but I've been doing this --
I started at a young age, so I've been doing this for over 20 years, so I feel
like I kind of have a unique combination of experience, but yet still, in my
opinion, very young in the profession.  
  
I've tried to learn from all experiences. I feel I'm a much better coach today
than I was hopefully seven years ago and definitely in the last couple years.
We've gone through some incredible highs, we've gone through some tough lows,
and I think you learn from those experiences. When you have an opportunity to
coach against some of the greats in the game, you learn from that. You learn
during a game how to make adjustments and how to manage your team and how to
put your team in a position to be at their best all the time, and I think I've
learned a lot of things, and I'm still growing.  
  
I think as a coach if you ever get to the point where you feel like you've got
to figure it out, then you're not going about it the right way. I think the
game is always changing. You have to continue to adapt. That's the one thing I
learned most about being around a guy like Coach K for all those years is he
didn't stand pat with what he did. He always was willing to change as the game
had changed and as the landscape of college basketball has changed. And so I
try to always keep an open mind and learn from others, watch other great
coaches, other great leaders.  
  
And the best experience is -- the best way to get better is just through your
own experiences. And I think what we've been through, we proved that it can be
done at Northwestern. I think that was a huge thing. Coming into a place that
had 80 years of not winning, of not going to the postseason, of not -- and
then showing that you can win. And to be backed up with the commitment that we
have from our administration, to step up with the new arena, a brand-new
practice center that's going to be open in the next six weeks, there's an
investment at Northwestern to be at a high level in basketball. And that makes
me hungry to be even better as a coach and help deliver to a lot of people
that have invested a lot towards this.  
  
It's been a crazy ride for six years. It's gone really fast. Like you said, I
can't believe I'm going into year seven. But I feel like I'm as good as I've
been from a coaching perspective, and I'm going to need to be because we have
such a young group. I'm excited to see what we can build with these guys over
the next few years.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAYS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAYS)

  

## October 2, 2019

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

  
_Hilton Rosemont - Rosemont, Ill._  
  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Good morning. For the first time in our tenure at Penn
State, we have an experienced team, led by Lamar Stevens, and for us at Penn
State, what a powerful statement he made this summer, Lamar and his family, by
returning for his senior season.  
  
They value an education. They value that degree. But they also have a belief
in our staff, and Lamar has a belief in the guys in that locker room. It's
powerful. That's a leader. That's a pioneer. It's an outlier. And for Penn
State, we need guys like that.  
  
Coupled with Mike Watkins in the front court, who's as healthy as he's ever
been. He had a knee injury a few years ago, and now he feels much, much
better. So with those guys anchoring the defense and the offense, that bodes
well for us.  
  
We've added some important firepower in Curtis Jones, a fifth-year senior, and
Izaiah Brockington, a transfer who had to sit out last year, to go along with
Jamari and John and Myles Dread. And a guy that I think is really going to
emerge this year is Myreon Jones. So what you're hearing is depth. What you're
hearing is experience. And what you're hearing is solutions. And that's what
you need in the Big Ten.  
  
When the Big Ten went to a 20-game league season, you need depth because if
you're going to your 10th and 11th guy, there can't be any drop-off, and I
believe we have that this year.  
  
I'll say we have more answers than questions, and for me that's a luxury, an
absolute luxury. Our schedule is difficult, just like last year, and that's
the way we want it. It presents opportunities for us to get better and put us
in position to be the most successful team that we can be by the end of the
year.  
  
Q. With a player like Lamar, what do you challenge him with this year as
far as do you talk about all the things he means to your program? What do you
challenge him with and what do you see as the ceiling for him?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: You know, I've been sharing this with Lamar. I'll share it
here today. I've been talking about Mamba mentality, and I think that's the
next level, that Kobe Bryant mentality, of every day you're going to win every
drill, whether it's one on two, two on two, three on three. Whatever the
breakdown is, you're the hardest worker in that drill. And if he accepts that
challenge -- which he has, statistically right now he's No. 1 in all our stats
in practices. And that's the way it's got to be, and he's got to lead the team
in wins. Whatever team he's on, doesn't matter who is on his team, they need
to compete at a very high level and win. There're no possessions off.  
  
Q. Obviously traditional football school, what 's it like for your
players, you talk about expectations this year for your players, big
expectations for this year, how are they handling that, and what are your
thoughts moving forward for getting these guys moving forward and getting to
the tournament and making a run?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: I think Penn State craves good basketball. A few years ago
our attendance was very high as far as the last five, six home games, 11,500.
Madison Square Garden, we had the most attendance, 11,500, since 2001. Penn
State wants good basketball. I understand you think it's a football school.
They want it. We're going to live moment to moment. We're not going to get
ahead of ourselves, and we're not going to look back, either. We've done that.
We've already been there. Let's learn from those experiences, those shared
experiences and look forward, and take this day right now, how do we get
better. We're promoting our program, we're promoting the Big Ten.  
  
Now today when we go back, we're going to have practice. In those drills, take
each rep as it comes and get better. That's another moment. But if we start
looking too far ahead, if we start looking at NCAA Tournament, if we start
looking at postseason or championships, anything like that, it's going to
become very overwhelming, and we don't need that, and these kids don't need
that, so we'll take it moment by moment.  
  
Q. Lamar Stevens seems to be the only player on the team that has a
history of putting up double digit numbers consistently. Who else on your team
do you believe has that ability day and night?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Myles Dread. I think he had a great freshman campaign. I
look forward to him taking the next step in his progression as a basketball
player. He's going to do more, not just shoot threes for us.  
  
Mike Watkins, I believe struggled last year, had a lot of things going on off
the floor and on the floor physically. So I look forward to him getting us to
that double digit.  
  
I look at Curtis Jones and Myreon Jones, guys that can produce points for us.
So there's four or five guys that really can get us to double figures.  
  
And that's got to be our offensive identity, right? We have to share the
basketball. We have to limit our turnovers. We've got to make timely threes.
We've got to get really good possessions, uncontested shots. And if we do that
and defend and rebound the way we've been doing for the last four or five
years, I think we can get multiple guys, four or five guys, to double figures.  
  
Q. With Lamar coming back and with the experience that you touched on,
there 's kind of increased expectations. How do you anticipate those teams
handling those expectations, and how do you get them to handle them?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Yeah, just like I said, moment to moment, we can't get ahead
of ourselves. And as long as we stay in the present and we're mindful and
we're aware and our mantra is just get better every single day, then you're
going to put yourself in that position. Again, I don't want this to be a long
lens where we're thinking about the end of the season in March and April. That
can't be the task here. We've been there, we've done that, we've got to learn
from those experiences, learn from those setbacks and focus on moment to
moment, practice to practice, drill to drill, and that's the way it's going to
be.  
  
Q. Tom Izzo is a stalwart in this conference, obviously, but he 's been
a guy who's reached out to young coaches or when they first came in the league
went to play you at the Palestra when a lot of people wouldn't. What does he
mean to you as a coach?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: It's a great question. Here's a guy when we're struggling
last January -- he doesn't have to call me, he's got to focus on his own team,
he's has his own injury, he has his own concerns -- but he's worried about me.
Reaching out to me, just giving me guidance, and he's done that throughout my
entire tenure, and I appreciate that. I appreciate his knowledge, his wisdom,
his mentorship, and for a young coach in the league that's top to bottom I
believe the best league in the country, to have somebody like that who's got
your back and who's going to guide you, even though we want to beat each other
so badly on the court, you know, he absolutely gets it, and he wants to make
sure that this league is terrific, and he wants to make sure coaches keep
their jobs and do the right things.  
  
I'm grateful for our relationship. I'm grateful for our friendship.  
  
Q. You spoke about Lamar Stevens and how important he is to your program
and its culture. Is there any player on the team, younger player on the team
currently that kind of exhibits the things that he shows and that they can
continue to prolong when he leaves and moves on from the program?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Great question. That's what's important for Penn State.
We're older this year. We have veterans. We have experience. We have to stay
that way. So the next group of guys -- Johnny Harrar, Jamari Wheeler, Trent
Buttrick, Myles Dread, MJ, and then I think there's a guy out there not many
people know about is Seth Lundy. He's every bit of 6'7", 218.  
  
So I believe that we have stability, we have sustainability, and that's what
you need in a great program. We don't want to be a one-hit wonder. We want,
hey, we're going to succeed this year, and we want to back that up with
consistency.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 17, 2019

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Michigan State 65, Michigan 60  
  
COACH TOM IZZO: I've never been prouder of a team in my life. Coaches say that
every time after they win and year after year, and I've had some incredible
teams and incredible guys, but what these guys have been through nobody will
ever know, and the way they have handled it and hung in there. Again today, a
very, very, very good team. We played very well the first 10 minutes. They
went on a 20-6 run and played extremely well. They are well-coached. They are
a good team and probably outplayed us most of the second half, and yet the
grit and the determination at halftime. I'm disappointed because Xavier was in
foul trouble early, and played a freshman some, and we tried to play Nick
some, which was okay offensively, and some struggle defensively, just because
of some things we did. And then Cassius I didn't think was playing very good
and we didn't think Matt was looking for his shot and we didn't think Kenny
was looking for his. So that's my four best players in the last month and yet
we're down eight and we told them that. We haven't played well and we're down
eight. They played better. Cassius was unbelievable and McQuaid was even
better than him, and Xavier made some big plays, and we found a way to beat a
very good team that, as I said, probably outplayed us more than we outplayed
them.  
  
Q. With the injuries today, how big of a rally call to come back?  
COACH TOM IZZO: There's a lot of reasons I have pride in my team. But at
halftime when Ernie came walking in there, everybody thought it was broke and
it wasn't broke; but you know, he's probably done for the year. It's badly,
badly sprained. But the way they wrapped around him and then Josh, you know,
emotional, and him, and I think at his expense it gave us a lift if you want
the truth. He handled it so well. Josh has handled it so well, because we
needed an emotional lift at halftime. I don't know why, you know, I got a lot
of texts from former players today. Steve Smith might have been the best one.
He said, "Don't worry about the physical; they will fight through that. It's
the mental fatigue." And we were mentally making mistake after mistake on our
coverages, even some of our best guys and I'm sure that was a little bit the
mental fatigue.  
  
Q. This game kind of followed a familiar script, at least against
Michigan. Was there ever any question in your mind that you were going to pull
it out?  
COACH TOM IZZO: Boy, I could be real cocky here again and say, hell, no,
there's no question. Hell, yes, there was a question in my mind. I did not
think we were playing great. But I did think if we got it close, you know,
maybe that would help follow that script, and so that was the battle cry.
Let's cut it to six; let's cut it to four. I would see at certain times, if we
could get it down two more, we weren't greedy. And they all said it, because
we've all been there before. Let's just cut it down two at a time. Let's not
go for home runs. We got it down there and it was bizarre the way it went at
the end. It was bizarre but it was a good bizarre for us.  
  
Q. Thoughts on playing Bradley your first round?  
COACH TOM IZZO: You know, I don't have any thoughts on that. I guess the only
thoughts I have is I've been-1-seed and been a 7-seed. Got to a Final Four as
a 7 and got beat the first weekend as the 1. I don't know much about Bradley.
I'll know a lot more by the end of tonight. But I'm not going to let anybody
talk me into talking about that if you want the truth. I'm going to enjoy this
incredible, incredible win but the players in that locker room, and to be
honest with you, every player that ever played here, I think everybody took
great solace in this win.  
  
So where we play, when we play, if I had my druthers it would be anything but
Thursday because just of our injuries and everything, but nothing's been easy
all year, why change now. I'm happy with whatever we do.  
  
Q. What about as a whole this year, how does this stack up to years
past?  
COACH TOM IZZO: A little disappointed in that I think we should have had
eight, you know -- well, then, okay, don't answer the question if you don't
know the answer. I mean, they talked all year that we're the best conference
in the country, yet there are no 1-seed out of it. And if we don't get eight,
I think they deserve to have eight. I think we've got to start talking about
our conference because it was very about, and by the way, I think we're the
only league in the country that played 20 conference games. So sometimes
that's two less losses instead of automatic with insurance, and I don't think
that was talked about enough. So teams like Indiana and Minnesota and, I mean,
who all got in, do you know? They are the only ones that's not yet? They
deserve to be in. They beat us twice. The league deserves it. I've been in
this league 35 years as a GA on up, and I think everybody would argue that
it's been the best talked-about league, and add that 20 games in. I don't
think we're getting any credit for that. So I think that deserves some credit
for some of those teams that, you know, struggled a little bit at stretches
with some injuries and so I hope we get eight in. I think we deserve to get
eight in.  
  
Q. You beat your rival twice in a week's time. How satisfying is this
stretch in your career?  
COACH TOM IZZO: Well, you know, we've had a lot of games against my rival. You
know, early on, I was getting my brains beat in and then we did some beating
in and now it's been a pretty solid thing. You know, last year, they got us
twice when we had a really about team and that's what rivalries are. I don't
think you could ask for a better game except that it was a little low-scoring,
but both teams clawed and scratched and had a hell of a game. Maybe that's the
way it's going to be from here on out. Maybe we get this thing where some of
the great rivalries are, and that's fine with me and I'm sure it's fine with
John. If we're playing -- like I told a lot of people on Thursday, Wednesday,
I did some radio shows in Michigan, and Michigan fans called in and said,
"Well, we'll see if they are there Sunday." I said, "I sure as hell hope so,
and you should too, because that means your team survived." Because it wasn't
easy to survive this tournament with the good teams that were in it.

## March 17, 2019

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Michigan State 65, Michigan 60  
  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Congratulations to Michigan State. They played a terrific
game, and just really made some plays that we could not make. I don't recall
them taking a bad shot the entire game. That's really important. If you're
going to win basketball games, you've got to minimize turnovers and you've got
to minimize bad shots and just make good decisions. They did a great job with
it. I'm proud of the way our guys played. Obviously they have got a lot of
things to learn but they are really a tough matchup for us. They are just a
bad matchup for us. It's really difficult to play, and so they got us again.
We've had three games with them and we've led in the second half three games,
but in the things that really matter at times throughout the whole game, they
beat us in some of those intangibles and they win.  
  
Q. What do you say to your team after a game like that? They fought so
hard.  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, we did. I tell you, you're going to play at this
level, you talk about being champions. There's 12 Big Ten teams home, right.
There's 12 of them home. You play for a championship, it gets to this point
that -- I'm proud of them, we fight hard, but winning takes just about
everything, winning at this level. You can win games. To win championships,
you have to really do most of the right things. You're not ever going to have
a game of perfection. We've got to learn from it, and hopefully we'll learn
from it so that we go to the NCAA Tournament, we can play for a while in March
again. If we don't, we'll be done. That's it. I'm really proud of them,
though.  
  
And how many wins, 28 wins, right? We lost four pretty good players from last
year, that took us to the Final Four and now all of a sudden, we're not a new
team, but we're not an experienced team in playing games like this. So we'll
be more experienced next year.  
  
Q. What can you take from this game that will help take you guys you
deep into March?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I think it's really important every time down the court,
you've got to get a good shot, right. Only shot clock situation would be the
time it would be questioned. We wasted some possessions on offense and we
can't do that. It's been a problem in any of our losses and we just have to
learn from them. It's a problem in most teams' losses. You're playing a team
like Michigan State who played so efficient, right? They are tough to beat if
you waste any possessions.  
  
Q. What was Jordan's plan there with six seconds left?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: I think they still had two fouls to give, so he thought
maybe he could draw a foul.  
  
Q. Initial thoughts on your NCAA Tournament matchup?  
COACH JOHN BEILEIN: It's Montana again. It the Grizzlies again. They have got
a terrific program to go and win all these games, win the championship.
Anybody that's playing in the conferences that they play in, and you win a
championship, you're playing usually more road games than home, overall.
You've got to be a heck of a team, and they were last year. They got on us
10-0 last year, right, for a team that went to the Final Four. That was the
only team until we got to -- for the rest of the tournament, nobody took us
out 10-0 to start a game. So they have a really good team. We're going to have
be to be really sharp. We're going to have to play. I enjoyed winning last
year against them. I did not enjoy playing against them. They have got a heck
of a coach, a heck of a team.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2019

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Michigan - 76, Minnesota - 49  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, tip of the cap to Michigan. They were really, really
good today. We were not very good. You know, it's kind of been a tale of two
teams with us. You know, we get going offensively and we get energy,
enthusiasm, and today couldn't hit shots in the first half. That really,
really affected us, and you could just tell we totally ran out of gas, and
Michigan was really good. It stings. I don't want them to be satisfied, but
also I do want them to take a step back and say, okay, we had a really good
win versus Penn State, we had a really good win versus Purdue. We were sitting
there coming into this tournament with having to do some things to make an
NCAA Tournament, which hasn't happened a lot in our school history, and they
did that under the most adverse circumstances and the most pressure. At this
point, I'm really proud of the guys that they were able to move this program
forward. That's the beauty of this league when you play so many good teams.  
  
Q. Richard, what are you doing -- I know you've probably been in
countless situations like this, but when a team kind of snowballs you, how do
you counteract that when you're out there on the floor?  
RICHARD PITINO: Obviously, I didn't do a very good job of that. You try to get
your guys' head right, and I thought that they were hitting shots, which they
can do to you, and it deflated us, and probably that, coupled with the fatigue
we have already from two physical wars, down another man in Matz, I just think
all of it kind of happened at once. So you need to get guys on the court to
kind of band together, and we definitely ran out of gas.  
  
Q. Once you step back and maybe get over the sting of this one, what do
you think you'll be most proud of over the last two days and the two wins in
hard-fought games?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, it's kind of like I've said. I mean, we came into this
game -- if you take a step back, we're right on the cusp of making an NCAA
Tournament, and we were picked towards the bottom of the league. We had to
replace two starters. Eric Curry's injury, Dupree's mom, five new players. I
don't know if I would have thought that we'd be standing there with an NCAA
Tournament berth, so we're going into Northwestern, we're staring at Purdue at
home, and at Maryland, and win two of those three. And then we're coming into
Penn State, a Quad 1 opportunity, we get that in overtime, we fight through
it, to enhance our resume. Then we got Purdue. Again, as much as I was telling
our guys, I think we're in, fellas, I think we're in, you never really know.
And then for them to go get one of the best teams in the country in Purdue and
solidify an NCAA Tournament berth, there's guys in there -- Amir, Murph,
Michael, Dupree, now two NCAA tournaments, they should be very proud of that.  
  
Q. They finished the first half on a 19-4 run. What was kind of key to
that part?  
RICHARD PITINO: They were making shots. We couldn't hit anything. We were
really easy to guard today. They were kind of choking down the paint, and we
weren't making them pay by kicking it out. It seems kind of simple. I don't
think we hit a three in the first half. We've had -- the problem with us a
little bit, we've had a couple of these games, so we've got to make sure we
don't have it next week.  
  
Q. When you look at the way that Amir was playing leading up to this
game, would it be fair to say that without that, you wouldn't be where you are
today? And what do you think, in his mind was he thinking that, I need to
carry this team in order to get you where you needed to go?  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, Murph, too. Murph had 27 points last night versus
Purdue, so I think both of them really, really elevated their play. Even
Dupree, you look at those three older guys -- Dupree showed awesome
leadership. So I think all three of them, yeah, they rose to the level of --
we needed it, and they delivered. That's what older players do.  
  
Q. Just looking ahead, what are a few areas you'd like to see this team
improve as they enter the NCAA Tournament?  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, we had really been moving forward before today. So you
know, as a coach, you hate to say that you're tired because that's an excuse.
But maybe it's a valid excuse a little bit. But I thought from a toughness
standpoint, from a defense standpoint, from an offensive execution standpoint,
we were really moving forward. You know, so we've just got to take a deep
breath, not overreact from this one a little bit but learn from it, and see if
we can get Matz back. I do think he's important. You're down two guys. Jarvis
came in and gave us good minutes, but from a scoring standpoint you've got to
be able to establish the low post a little bit.  
  
Q. Maryland game, you talked about maybe burning the film and not
looking at it. How are you going to treat this one?  
RICHARD PITINO: Oh, I'm going to throw it in the Green River and I'm not going
to watch it. Zero chance. I don't know how they called the game. I don't know
how -- Raft's one of the best in the business. I don't know how he did it. He
figured it out.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 16, 2019

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Michigan State - 67, Wisconsin - 55  
  
TOM IZZO: You know, it was a grind of a game. I say that every time I play
Wisconsin, it hasn't changed. It's part of the culture they have that started
with Dick and Bo, and Greg has done an unbelievable job, too. I thought the
difference in the game early, we made all our shots and they missed some wide-
open shots. I mean, they ran some good stuff, missed some good shots, and then
as we got going, I thought we played pretty well. The turnovers that still
haunt us still haunt us. We had some very unforced turnovers. I thought we got
something out of Henry rebounding the ball. That was big. He gets 11 rebounds.
The rebounding in general was big for us, out-rebounding them like that. The
assists to the baskets was really big for us. Whenever you get 18 assists on
23 baskets, that means your guys are moving the ball, and that's the kind of
team I have. Cassius, I guess, hurt another ankle or a different one, and
that's why he was kind of hobbling around before halftime. You know, when I
just asked him if he could grit out the second half, and you know what? He
gritted it out. I thought we missed some shots in the second half. McQuaid, I
didn't realize it, they said Tillman is afraid of heights, so every time he
gets up there he's missing some of those dunks, so hopefully we'll work on
that this week. But all in all, gritty performance by us. I thought a gritty
performance by them. They never quit. They came back. And we're going to have
to somehow get ready to get back up tomorrow.  
  
Q. As long as this team continues to play, do they remind you of some of
your old-school Michigan State teams with that grit, maybe not pretty but
gritty?  
TOM IZZO: You know, we've been pretty, not as gritty. I mean, we're gritty,
but we're not like smash-mouth tough like some of those old teams. But we do
it in a different way, and yet it's -- you know, I thought the way we started
out, we were upset with the way we started yesterday, as everybody knows, and
the first 10 minutes were great and then we kind of died, and then we played
better after halftime. One of these days we're going to put the whole thing
together, and when we do, we'll take another step. But I think the biggest
thing I've got to do tomorrow and next week is got to come up with some better
substitution patterns. Every time I do, Arnie just couldn't get back in, so
that screws that up. During the week we work with him and not Gabe as much. So
the way -- and then Nick got in so much foul trouble, we could not keep a
steady rotation there. But I think besides the assists, the job Cassius did.
You know, when Nick Ward made those three or four plays in a row that kept the
ball with us, probably the -- most people wouldn't look at that as anything.
That was about two minutes' worth of game-winning situations for us. I'm
pleased where Nick is coming. I really was hoping to play him 16, 18 minutes
today. But he'll get his chance. There will be another game to play.  
  
Q. Can you assess the Wisconsin rivalry? How is this rivalry different
with you guys?  
TOM IZZO: You know, I have great respect for Dick Bennett. I worked his camp
when I was in college. I was at Stevens Point. It was a war with Bo for a few
years. Then we got on the board together, and by the end, we were pulling for
each other, and I really mean that, and still talk to him once in a while. You
know, there's not always love sometimes, but there's respect that's probably
more valuable. With those guys, it's both love and respect because we've
played in a lot of big games together. You know, for Greg, I came up the same
way. And so I taught him a lot those first couple months and even first year.
I think he's done an incredible job under some tough -- how would you like to
replace Bo? You know, they had just gone to two Final Fours. His team has got
some youth to it and they've got some veterans, but I thought he's done a hell
of a job with them and he's done a hell of a job, so the respect factor hasn't
changed. Wisconsin, when you grow up in Iron Mountain, I think we're one mile
from the border, so I'm kind of a Yooper Wisconsinite more than I am a Yooper
downstater down here. I know none of you know what that means. But Iron
Mountain is in the finals right now as we speak; that's all that matters to
me.  
  
Q. How important is what Kenny Goins can do to you guys' ability to
shoot, rebound and even made a good pass for a dunk today at a key point?  
TOM IZZO: Well, Kenny has probably been the guy that's changed our team
throughout the last two and a half months. He is one of our best defenders. He
is our best rebounder. He is maybe our best-conditioned guy, and he has really
figured out how to shoot the ball and does it with a high percentage. Kenny
deserves a lot more than I've probably given him, but I think Kenny is putting
himself in a position where there's going to be some basketball for Kenny
after college.  
  
Q. At the Breslin Center last Sunday after the game, I don't know if you
saw John Beilein's comments, but he talked about Michigan, Michigan State
playing for a championship, what it meant to the state, how excited he was
about you and both programs. Obviously you don't know who's going to win the
next game, but for those two schools, same state, such a high level to be
possibly playing again, how special is it for the state of Michigan?  
TOM IZZO: Well, I think we both agree, and people used to laugh at me when I
said, of course I hate my rival. Who wants to hug and kiss the guy that took
your girlfriend, you know? It doesn't make any sense. But I have great respect
for them, and I do agree with him. I think we're on the exact same page, that
if we can make this into a Duke-Carolina, you know -- and I'm not trying to
say we've gotten there yet because some of that is over a test of time. But
whenever you're playing in games that matters in the state, that's big.
Matters in the conference, that's big. When it starts to matter nationally,
then you've got yourselves something special. When both teams -- early on in
my career when we were ranked I think 250th or whatever and they were good,
then we were ranked in the top and they weren't very good, it's hard to have a
rivalry. So we got what the media wants, what the fans want, and believe it or
not, what the coaches want, because it is important that big games matter, and
big games that matter nationally are even bigger games.  
  
Q. When the game got close there in the second half, they went seven
minutes and 24 seconds without a point. How would you assess your defense, or
were they just missing shots?  
TOM IZZO: I thought we played better defense in the second half. I thought the
first half they missed some good shots. But I think in general, Greg wasn't
happy with how they shot it. They've been a little bit up and down shooting,
guys like Trice and Davidson, those guys can shoot it, and they haven't shot
it quite as well. I think the other thing that was a key is Reuvers. We did a
pretty good job on him. We were going to switch. We were going to do some
things not to give him any open looks. So I think in the second half it was a
little bit us. I thought the first half it was a little bit them.  
  
Q. A little bit about the journey because there's steps along the way
every year, but what does this one mean tomorrow? There's another one coming
up after that, obviously, but the Big Ten Championship and what you guys are
playing for tomorrow.  
TOM IZZO: I must watch more TV, and I make my guys watch the NFL when they're
in the Super Bowl, the NBA, I make them watch hockey, because whenever you're
playing for championships, the human interest stories, the things that go on
are really good. You realize a lot of kids have sacrificed or done some things
or coaches or programs, and that's what's great about playing for a
championship. I mean, it is -- people don't say "let's go finish second." You
know, that's not the Knute Rockne locker room speech. It's "let's try to win a
championship." And when you're working in the summer, you always talk about
championship effort. Some thing that will separate you from the rest. You
know, no matter who we play, we have a chance to play for a championship, and
it's going to be very, very important, and then find a way to get right back
up. You know, concerning a little bit with our group? Yeah. We're wearing down
a little bit, to be very blunt and honest with you. And yet, as I told them
after, boy, if you learn how to play through things, a lot of people would
kind of fold the table on, that's going to help you in life because life is
filled, as we all know, with things a lot bigger than a damn game.  
  
Q. How differently do you have to control your practices knowing the
condition of your team and physically where they are?  
TOM IZZO: Well, we have a walk-through room at the hotel, and we've been
walking through. Tonight I'm just going to put like 10 beds in there, and I'm
going to kind of move them around like chess and say, okay, you should be
here. It's hard. Now, the advantage is if we play Minnesota, we haven't played
them so well. If we play Michigan, we've played them. Things change, but they
don't change drastically. My big thing is I've got to get Ward more and more
in there if I can keep him out of foul trouble because I think he can help us,
plus I want to get him ready for the big dance. So there won't be a lot of gym
time tonight. I told my doctors and trainers that coaches are going to work
hard tonight, but not as hard as the doctors and trainers. I'm bringing dinner
in for them because they're going to pull an all-nighter for us tonight.  
  
Q. To follow up on all you guys have been through, does pretty much
adrenaline taking over playing for what you guys are playing for tomorrow?  
TOM IZZO: You know, I think it does to a certain extent, but Cassius has been
on adrenaline for a while. At halftime, you know, I really didn't know what
was going to happen. So adrenaline kicked in, and it got him through parts of
another half. I'm not complaining about it, I'm just being honest with you. I
think everybody hides one thing or hides the other. You know, by tomorrow,
we'll be ready to play, and whoever plays will play. We're going to play as
hard as we can play and see where that puts us.

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Michigan State - 67, Wisconsin - 55  
  
GREG GARD: Obviously disappointed in the outcome. We could never overcome the
start and couldn't get back after they got hot at the beginning, and I thought
we did a good job of battling back at the end of the first half. Second half
obviously extending a lot of it at that 6, 7, 8, 9 point differential, and too
many opportunities given back to them, whether it was a key offensive rebound,
even though they only had eight, or a foul, it extended the possession, and
then they do what good teams do, they make you pay for it. We've got to make
shots. We had some really good looks. Need to be able to score inside and out,
and we weren't consistent enough inside, and obviously really struggled from
the perimeter, even though we had some really good looks. We'll learn from
this. Had a really good regular season, for this group to go 23-10 and be in
the position they've been and the schedule they've played and put themselves
in position for postseason play, so we'll look forward to seeing what happens
tomorrow and continue to get better and see how long we can play in the next
tournament.  
  
Q. Was that pretty much the difference in the game? Rebounding was
minus-14 for you guys and going 2-for-19 from the three-point line?  
GREG GARD: Well, yeah, they're going to have a differential of plus-14 when we
don't make shots. That's a lot of defensive rebounds coming off that they can
grab. I thought for the most part, we did a decent job of keeping them off the
glass. They got a couple key ones there late, and then that four-, five-minute
mark, three-minute mark where we were trying -- I think we were down nine at
that point, or 11, but you've got to make some shots. As big as physical as
they are in the paint, if you get isolated in there -- and we weren't able to
convert near enough -- but when they did collapse, like I said, we had some
good looks. You've got to make those pay because that forces them to separate
a little bit more, spread out a little bit more and maintain focus, which is
much help inside.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 16, 2019

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Michigan - 76, Minnesota - 49  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: So we really played great basketball in the first half. I think
the big difference was, they were staying with us when we got offensive
rebounds, and they really have been great at getting offensive rebounds.
They're one of the best in the country, and once we shut that down, we got
enough stops that we could get out and run a little bit. We also could sort of
frustrate them. So being up 19 at halftime really is uncomfortable. My son's
Division II team was up 19 today with about 18 minutes to go and it didn't
turn out good. So that was in my mind at halftime, and we ended up just
fighting like crazy to come back and just play the same way we played in the
first half -- and they won the first four minutes -- then it was 20, then it
was 25, then it was 30, and proud of our guys. I think Minnesota has had a
great year. One or two more players -- they've had injuries. One or two more
players, as we found out when Charles was out, an injury or two changes --
it's just such a butterfly effect on the team that your depth is a little bit
different, people get tired, and I think that's what happened to Minnesota
today. Richard has done a great job with that team, and I'm certain they're
going to be an NCAA Tournament team, and proud to have them playing out in the
NCAA Tournament and representing the Big Ten.  
  
Q. We all got what we wanted, at least those Michigan guys, rubber match
coming up against Michigan State for everything. What advantages do you guys
got coming into this knowing that you guys have already lost two of them? Hard
to lose to a team three times it seems like.  
JOHN BEILEIN: Well, that's -- I don't know that that's true. If it is true, it
would be really good. But no, they're -- we were talking about it, they've
just played great basketball all year long, played a very demanding schedule.
The injuries, certainly I feel bad for the two injuries that they've had. The
fact is they're playing at a high level right now like they had no injuries.
So you've got to -- you have to understand, you've got a Hall of Fame coach
who is incredible at his team's execution on offense and defense, and we
haven't played well against them, and that's because they played so well
against us. So play them a third time, we go, we're going to go after a
championship again. You only get so many chances to win a championship. We
have a chance to do it, and we're going to do everything we can to win this
championship because we didn't get the last one.  
  
Q. What do you think this team's identity is on offense, and can you
compare it to past teams that you've coached?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think that it's pretty consistent with the teams we've always
had: Low turnovers, a team with a lot of skilled guys that can share the ball.
We've had over 20 assists the last two games. Guys that will share the ball, a
lot of shooters, a lot of skilled guys, a big center who can shoot a little
bit, and that's the identity of many of our players. Now, Jon Teske and Mo
Wagner couldn't be more different than anybody, but they both give you the big
man who can shoot, one gives more rim protection, one gives more offensive
driving, and we've had really good -- if you compare to other teams, going all
the way back to Darius Morris, to Trey Burke, Derek Walton, Zavier Simpson,
great point guards make very good teams.  
  
Q. Tom was mentioning something about the rivalry and the two of you
playing now for the title. How important is it for the two of you to play on
this stage?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think as far as anybody who's a Michigan or Michigan State
fan, it is that. It's not as sexy as the North Carolina-Duke game. We may not
have NBA players here or Hollywood stars, but that's okay. That's okay. But it
rivals it 100 percent. As I said before, show me another place where they've
got two people in the state that have been to four Final Fours in the last 10
years. We have four championships. They've got more than that in the last 10
years. You've got great rivalries everywhere, but not ones that are playing
this deep in March, not the ones that -- as I say, they sweep us, we sweep
them, we split, they sweep us, we sweep them, we split. It's been a great --
particularly the last nine years, we had to get our thing going a little bit,
the first three years were not good to us, but after that, we've got two great
programs -- it's not just great for our state, it's great for college
basketball. Clean programs. We both have had injuries, we still maintain our
ability to be good in the postseason. We've both had guys go pro a lot. We
still maintain that. We get good people, you've got great support from the
administration in these two states, in these two universities, and we've got
great fans and alums.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Isaiah's performance today and what he means to
your team?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Well, that was -- you know, I think that the one good thing, the
only good thing about Charles Matthews' injury is all of a sudden Isaiah had
to be out there for 35 minutes, and it gave him confidence coming off the
bench now to do what he does. He's taking the ball to the basket a little bit
more. He was sort of just a shooter last year. He and Duncan Robinson, he
wouldn't be as long as Duncan, but he did give us some good energy early, and
Duncan was tremendous in February. But he gives us that outside threat, very
much like Goins has done an incredible job at Michigan State as a 4 man that
can really shoot it. What we like about Isaiah, he can play either position
and give people rest. But it's been -- his defense continues to get better.
He's become a very, very good defender, and he's just a young, young
sophomore.  
  
Q. What is the single most biggest adjustment you make coming into this
game? I know ball screens, defense was a big thing with Cassius Winston. Talk
about the A number 1 adjustment you guys are going to have to make coming into
Game 3.  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think that they have changed their offense dramatically, where
-- I don't know what they did, I didn't watch anything today. They used to
throw the ball in the post, throw the ball in the post and play a lot out of
that, and I think that's probably a lot of ways people have prepared for, and
now it's probably 100 different ball screens by the same guy. One guy is doing
it all. Everybody talks about Cassius. He is terrific. Player of the Year
without question. But what McQuaid and Goins are giving them right now and
Tillman is just absolutely incredible. They are playing flawless basketball on
offense, defense, making the extra pass. They're really an awful lot like we
were last year and that we're growing this year. They've got a fourth-year
guy, a fifth-year guy. Cassius is a junior. They're leading those young guys
along and it makes them a tough team. I'm going to have to watch a lot.
Obviously we haven't been very good either time, and I'm not sure what we're
going to have to do, but we've got to be smarter, that's for sure.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Matt Painter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17039)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Minnesota - 75, Purdue - 73  
  
MATT PAINTER: Well, obviously going to the Big Ten Tournament and getting to
the quarterfinals and getting a double bye helps you, but you've got to be
able to win games.  
  
Today was a tough one for us. We just couldn't make enough plays down the
stretch to either get a little bit of a lead or to get them away from us.  
  
But you've got to give Minnesota credit; I thought they played well. They did
some really good things. They obviously shot the ball extremely well in the
first half, and we hung in there and we battled back and put ourselves in a
good position. We just -- they made a couple more plays than we did.  
  
Q. When you win a conference tournament, is the focus there coming into
this tournament, or when you win the conference is the focus not there? Do you
tend to relax a little bit because you've already kind of got it?  
MATT PAINTER: No, I think those are kind of thoughts by a fan or somebody
who's writing an article. I think as a player you just compete. Minnesota beat
us last week; we want to beat Minnesota. So for our guys, for nothing else,
Minnesota got the best of them, and now they want to beat Minnesota. I don't
look at it that way, and I know they don't look at it that way, but Minnesota
obviously was better than us, and they deserved to win.  
  
Q. Carson has struggled in February and he also struggles at the barn.
What was his deal tonight?  
MATT PAINTER: Just getting in rhythm. I think for him, when you've played a
lot of games like he has and got into your junior year in college and you've
seen a lot of different defenses and different people guarding you, for him
it's kind of settling into a game, and sometimes when he can't settle into a
game and somebody makes it really hard on him, now he doesn't get into that
rhythm, now he never really kind of gets it going.  
  
He needs to get to the free-throw line, get some lay-ups and kind of have a
mix, not just threes, have some pull-ups, have some lay-ups, get to the free-
throw line. And they never really allowed that. I thought Minnesota did a
really good job defending him, not just in this game but also at the barn.  
  
Q. Coach, early exit; it can be a blessing in disguise, give you guys
some rest, get you guys ready for the tournament.  
MATT PAINTER: Yeah, when you've done it a while -- when you first start doing
it and you start getting into conference tournaments, you kind of talk about
your first question, like you want to win it all, you want to win the
conference tournament, but you really get judged on how you do in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
We've done it before and won a couple games, and then you get to that quick
Thursday game, and it's a little bit harder. It just depends on the team that
you have and the depth that you have. I think that's also -- and the mental
toughness. If you have a team with a lot of mental toughness, I don't think a
lot of that matters. You're going to run into tough teams no matter who you
play.  
  
But there's only one way to look at it after you get beat. Get some rest and
try to keep your focus on the NCAA Tournament and find out that first opponent
and start to do your homework and figure some things out.  
  
But as a competitor, you'd rather keep playing.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to defend Jordan Murphy when he just makes all
those high-emergency plays all night?  
MATT PAINTER: Yeah, he's a tough guard. For us, we put our center on him and
tried to make it hard. If we can't get to a double-team and it's too far away
from us, we want to put Matt Haarms on him as much as possible. Trevion
Williams has really long arms, and we want to try to contest him.  
  
The thing that he does so well that he really didn't do until the end of the
game was that he can kind of shoot shots, and he knows where they're going and
he can get those balls back, whether he gets fouled or dunks it or makes a
lay-up. He's a really good player. I'm happy to see him leave. And so
hopefully we don't play them in the NCAA Tournament.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Wisconsin - 66, Nebraska - 62  
  
COACH MILES: Well, I'm extremely proud of this group. I'm proud to be their
coach. I thought that they fought as hard as they could. And we were in a
great situation, late even, chance to tie, go ahead. And we missed on a few
plays. And credit to Wisconsin; they did an excellent job all night.  
  
Q. Do you think fatigue played a role in the last five to 10 minutes?  
COACH MILES: Wisconsin makes it look tough anyway. I thought Glynn's legs
looked good, and he was the guy we were riding, had a hop in his step all
night. Maybe. But our hearts are bigger than that.  
  
Q. You played six guys in the game. Given the fact they played so many
minutes the past two days, what was the thinking behind shortening your bench
even further?  
COACH MILES: There was no real design. We'd only subbed out of necessity
earlier. They were playing smaller. So we were able to play smaller. And
that's why we did it.  
  
Q. Job status, do you think you've earned more time at Nebraska?  
COACH MILES: That's out of my hands. I know Bill, addressing that one time
hopefully, Bill will make a statement in 45 minutes. I don't know what it is.
So, I'm sure it's just he's going to wait and see what's going on with
postseason or whatever.  
  
Q. Thomas Allen warmed up with the team before, and then he didn't come
out and close --  
COACH MILES: We haven't been able to get him on a court and put a ball in his
hand. Seemed like a good opportunity to do that, test the ankle a little bit.
Really had trouble cutting right now. And so the only way -- there's no other
gym availability. So this was the best one to be at.  
  
Q. You guys made Happ look fairly ordinary tonight. Was that one of your
main focuses going in?  
COACH MILES: Yeah, Ethan was double circled on the scouting report. I told him
in the handshake line, I told him, "E, I'm not going to miss you, brother."
And he's such a good player. He does so many good things that you have to
attack him. I thought we did a really good job of it. We held him down in
points. We turned him over. They actually played around him, it appeared to
me, for a while. So I thought we did a very good job. But we have to. I
thought that's what kept us around. Because he can take over a game, and then
those other guys get loose on you. And they're tough enough anyway. I thought
the key to the game was Iverson. He was making outside shots. When he makes
outside shots -- you know Weaver is going to make a few. You know Trice is
going to make a few. And Trice is very good end game, end clock. We've done a
really good job on him. Johnny ended up kind of gambling. And we ended up
switching Glynn off of him and he hit Johnny late. But that's what he can do.
But I thought Iverson was the big key to the win for them.  
  
Q. And if this was your last game with this team, how proud of you --  
COACH MILES: I'm proud of this group beyond belief, because as a Coach -- you
guys trying to get me to cry, are you? As a coach, you look at what they went
through and what they tried to overcome, and to go out and try to beat ranked
teams in back-to-back nights and probably Quad 1 -- or three Quad 1 games in a
week or whatever, pretty impressive stuff. I don't know where Iowa was. Maybe
they're a Quad 2. But all the same, I just -- I told them, I'm proud to be
your coach.  
  
Q. On the lighter side of things, you always seem to have, fun no matter
what you do. In this stodgy, buttoned-down world, you don't take yourself too
seriously. It rubs off on your players, even us media guys, we enjoy it. Talk
a little bit about your personality. I know it's tough right now.  
COACH MILES: Right now, it's not very fun. But, you know, I think in life you
just have to enjoy who you're working with and everything. And I work with --
you guys aren't as invested in the team. If it sucks for us, it sucks for you,
and I know that. And the same thing with the kids. So you want to be a mentor.
You want them to -- you want to lead them and teach them. But at the same time
you want to be able to have a relationship with them so they know you're with
them. I don't think you can be afraid to be just yourself. And I was granted a
great deal of independence as a little kid where I could do what I wanted when
I wanted as the youngest of five. That's what we do now. Even as an NAIA
coach, a D-II coach, a Division I independent, Mountain West coach or a Big
Ten coach. So we just feel strong that we're going to put our teams out there
and they're going to compete like heck and want to have a chance to be
successful. We have a disappointed team, but that doesn't mean that we have to
walk around like Pig-Pen. And that's no -- I don't mean to offend Pig-Pen.  
  
Q. Given the health of the team, have you thought about the NIT and what
that looks like?  
COACH MILES: I'll go anywhere. If they take us, we're going. And hopefully we
can get some guys healthier. Tom Allen would be the only guy I think we could
conceivably add to the roster.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Michigan - 74, Iowa - 53  
  
Q. Coach, went 1 for 16 from three-point range. How much of this loss
was from not being able to hit those?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Well, you know, I think it clearly affected a lot of things
for us. You know, you've got to give some credit to our opponent for that. But
typically we're not going to be a team that goes 1 for 16.  
  
It changes the momentum shifts in the game. We started outgoing inside. We had
some success, trading baskets. Then we start missing some jumpers. They get a
lead. They're really good with a lead. We all know that.  
  
Now they're really settled down. They're settled in offensively, and you've
got guys that are low-percentage three-point shooters making threes. Now, the
good players were making threes, the good shooters I should say -- they're all
good players, but the good shooters were making threes. We stopped short on
the first two, Iggy and Poole, can't do that. So that's two mistakes on us.  
  
But I thought we fought for a good portion of that stretch. But once they got
a lead, they really execute well. They get up into your space and make it hard
for you, and it seemed like -- going back to your original question, seemed
like no matter what we did, we couldn't get a three to fall. So at least we
kept taking the ball to the basket. We got into the bonus early in the second
half. We got into the double bonus, gave us a chance to get back in, but they
kept scoring.  
  
Q. Does Simpson get enough credit for what does for them?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: I would think so. He's an all-league player. I think if you
watch their games on TV, he gets a lot of respect from the announcers. At the
end of the day, they have 27 wins, and he's a guy who engineers victory.
That's what he does. Some games he gets 20, some games he gets six. But he's
always going to be up there with assists and steals. He gets people involved.
He seems to be able to make plays at critical points in the game when they
really need it, plays with an air of confidence that you need from that
position.  
  
You know, I certainly have a tremendous amount of respect for him. I think
he's one of the best players in the country. Happens to be -- well, he's one
of the best point guards in the country, but I'd say he's one of the best
players in the country.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to game plan against a team like Michigan that
doesn't have a primary scorer to balance them and that can hurt you from so
many areas?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: You know, it's always tough. I've coached against John a lot.
His offense has a lot of counters. They use different people in different
spots, and so that makes it challenging in terms of how you're going to play
back-pick action, how you're going to play ball-screen action. Where are the
high-percentage three-point shooters, where are the drivers. Does he have a
big lineup, does he have a small lineup on the floor. So he's getting a lot of
productivity from a lot of different people.  
  
Ultimately as a coach, that's what you want because it makes it very difficult
for a team to prepare for you.  
  
Q. Wieskamp and Bohannon only had seven shots between them. Is that more
than not getting into a rhythm or more of your focus of trying to work the
ball inside?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: A little bit of both. We really wanted to get the ball inside.
I thought we wanted to establish Cook and Garza early, which we did. They
really pushed up on Bohannon like a lot of teams do.  
  
I thought Joe, he drove it, I thought he was active. I thought his activity
was really good. They both have the green light, so it wasn't anything we went
away from. We want those two guys to shoot.  
  
Q. Last week you stated winning 10 games in this conference is a big
deal and a big thing. Can you elaborate on that, winning 10 games in probably
the best conference in America, and how is that going to help you going
forward in the tournament, NCAAs?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: You know, I think all of us kind of realized that this was
going to be a special year for our league in many ways, and it is such a grind
when you're playing 20 games, and there's no relief. No matter who you play,
at home or on the road, everybody has really good players, great players, and
a really good coach.  
  
If you win 10, and we won one yesterday, so that's great, it tells you what
you're capable of doing because you have to have a certain toughness about you
and a certain consistency about you, because I think that's the hardest thing
to consistently win in this league, but every night is so tough. It's a big
stage every night in terms of preparation. It's a different kind of prep. Tom
Izzo plays different than Steve Pikiell than Pat Chambers, you go right on
down the line, Illinois plays completely differently, and then you're guarding
John Beilein's stuff, and you just go right on down the line.  
  
I think at the end of the day, that's the fun of it, too, it's the challenge
of it, and it does prepare you as a program for the NCAA Tournament because
when you get there, you don't know who you're going to play and what style
they have, but chances are you have played somebody like that in our league.  
  
Q. How do you feel about your team and your guys going into the NCAA
Tournament next weekend?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: I feel really good in the sense that we're healthy. We got
through a long, difficult season and through a conference tournament healthy,
so I think that's good. I think we had some players develop and get some
seasoning. Some of our younger guys have continued to produce. Our key
personnel, I think, are in a good place, and we're looking forward to the
opportunity to play maybe the greatest spectacle in college sports.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Gabe Kalscheur](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36835)

### [Jordan Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32946)

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Minnesota - 75, Purdue - 73  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, may have been our best game of the year. We're playing
obviously much better basketball. We're getting better. The beauty of this
league is you learn something from every team that you play, and your players
learn it.  
  
And the physicality of that game, to be able to get stops when we needed to,
finish at the basket when we needed to, make some crucial free throws, it was
a huge win for our guys.  
  
Really proud of them. I told them in the locker room. I said, You guys might
be the least talked about team in the country. And that's fine with our guys.
We relish that.  
  
Q. Gabe, you had the task of defending Carson Edwards for most of these
three games against Purdue, and he's had a hard time getting going. What has
been the key to your success in?  
GABE KALSCHEUR: I would just say just giving him really tough shots because
it's hard going off those triple screens, so just giving him the hardest task
of tough shots is what I'm trying to do.  
  
Q. What is it like to track him around those screens, the way he speeds
through them?  
GABE KALSCHEUR: Yeah, it's really tough. He's really good with his speed,
change of speed, so he'll go quick and slow, so it's really hard navigating
that.  
  
Q. Jordan, talk about coming out there and giving it your all and the
match-ups with Purdue, you beat them two out of the last three this year.  
JORDAN MURPHY: Yeah, obviously they're a really talented team. I mean, they're
one of the nation's top teams by far, and that's just credit to them. But we
played really good tonight, played hard, made some really good plays and got
some really key rebounds down the stretch, and I think that's just some
toughness in the last five minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Jordan, after yesterday you guys started so slow. What was the focus
early for you guys?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I think the main thing was throwing the first punch and being
the aggressor, obviously. Last night we let Penn State jump out on us too
early, so it was really hard to climb back.  
  
Just making sure we were the aggressor, making sure we made our presence known
in this game was really important to us.  
  
Q. Jordan, what does a win like this do for the confidence of the guys
moving forward into the tournament and the next couple games?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I think it gives us a lot of confidence just knowing that our
players can stay composed and withstand runs our opponent makes when we're up.
Obviously it gives us a lot of confidence that our best guys can step up and
give us valuable minutes and give us some good plays down the stretch and
rebounding and just staying tough.  
  
Q. Why are you the least talked about team in America?  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, we've lost 12 games. I'm not a big "you're not
respecting us" type of guy. That's not my deal.  
  
But we've just been weird. Like we haven't gone on these huge runs of wins. We
kind of like have gone on some losing streaks, then snuck back, had a big win.
We've got some unassuming guys. Jordan Murphy put up 27 points. He's the most
humble kid on the planet, 7 for 7 from the foul line, never ever beats his
chest, never makes it about him. There's never any type of celebration. Amir
is a quiet kid. I guess that's it. I'm not sure.  
  
Q. What do you think it's going to take to get like a deep run to the
Final Four, to get people talking about you guys?  
RICHARD PITINO: We've got to go to the Final Four to get people talking about
us, huh? Geez. Again, I don't know if this group cares. I really don't think
they care. Like our, quote, stars would be Amir and Murph. They don't care. I
really don't care. I just care that we win. You know, they're a very, very
humble group. They're not a beat-your-chest type of group.  
  
You know, so I think it's just a matter of just winning games. I think we've
won four or five, which is important, so we're playing good basketball at the
right time.  
  
But our focus is not on attention, it's on getting rest right now and seeing
whoever we play next.  
  
Q. The challenge of the emotional high, playing well, and then the
physical challenge of three games in three days, touch on that a little bit.  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, last night was really physical, too. Both games. That
was an old-school game. I thought last night we found a way to win. I don't
know if we played great. I thought today was probably our most complete game.
So they should feel good about it.  
  
But yeah, we've got to get some rest. We're playing guys a lot of minutes.
Matz could be out. He's got concussion-like symptoms. So Jarvis has got to be
ready. So we'll evaluate that and go from there.  
  
Q. I want to know if you correct the Boilermaker code but you defeated
the Big Ten Champions twice this year. Was it about match-ups? You guys just
came in and played hard tonight.  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, I mean, we could have also lost at the buzzer. I don't
look at it like that. I've got a lot of respect for Coach Painter, I've got a
lot of respect for the way they do things. They do it the right way. They play
hard. You could tell their guys care about the name on the front of the
jersey.  
  
So I don't know what it is. I mean, it's like I said, that thing could go
either way. Happy we got a win. That was a terrific win for our guys. And you
know, any win you get in this league versus the opponents that you play, we
respect them all.  
  
Anytime you play a Purdue team, I get better as a coach. Things that I watch,
I kind of learn from, I steal a couple things every time I play them.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about that group that was here two years ago, the
core of that group, Amir, obviously Jordan. Who do they bring to this team
when you go through adversity and even during the game like you had versus
Purdue?  
RICHARD PITINO: You know, that's the way you win is in this league you've got
to get older. You've got to find a way to stay old. It's very, very hard with
transfers and guys going early to the NBA and whatever, but if you can find a
way to keep your roster old, you've got a shot, and then those old players got
to act like old players.  
  
Jordan and Amir certainly do that. Dupree did that. You're going to win games
that way. Dupree, who's not really a great rebounder, had six rebounds. We
need him to do that.  
  
Those guys have played in big games. This group has dealt with probably a
little more adversity than two years ago. Two years ago we dealt with the
doubt of we had won eight games the year before, where now I just think this
group doesn't get really fazed by a whole lot.  
  
Q. What have you learned about this team in the past two wins that you
didn't know before?  
RICHARD PITINO: You know, just a quiet confidence, like I said. They're really
not a -- like I said to them before our Penn State game, I said, "I'm sick and
tired of turning on the TV and nobody is giving us a shot. Everyone picks us
to lose all the time." And I said to Dupree as we were walking out, "Doesn't
that bother you? " He said, "I don't really notice it."  
  
I don't think they pay attention to it. So I just think they've got a quiet
confidence about them, they've got a quiet toughness about them. Like I said,
they're not a beat-your-chest type of team. But they've got a lot of fight and
a lot of grit.  
  
Q. Earlier today in talking about how there's a benefit of a bye but
maybe more of a benefit playing the night before, do you feel like last
night's game gave you a leg up?  
RICHARD PITINO: For whatever reason, it's been that way from time to time. No,
I would like to be top four and get a double bye and roll into Thursday. But
there may be something to it. I don't know. I think it depends on every year.  
  
I like the way our guys are playing. I think they got confidence from last
night. They got a lot of confidence from tonight. Beat two really good teams.
I think those are two quad 1 wins.  
  
So there's a lot of pride for these guys. I mean, Jordan Murphy was an
absolute beast down the stretch. He was terrific.  
  
I believe we're going to make the NCAA Tournament again. I do. You know, it's
funny, and this is a true story and this is the way it works, when you're a
coach this time of year, you look at bracketologists, and there's Jerry Pom
and there's Joe Lunardi are the two that we kind of look at. And when Pom has
you a 9 seed you love him, and then when Lunardi has got you as a bye you hate
him, and then when it switches you hate Pom and you love Lunardi. So I'm down
on Lunardi right now.  
  
But I did look at it on the bus over and I got nervous again. So it just shows
you as a coach you shouldn't read any of that stuff, and I think you tweeted
it actually, so it's your fault that I was nervous. But it's -- trying to
figure it all out is hard. I do know this: They value quad 1 wins, and when
you're in this league, you play a Penn State, who's won 14 games, that's a
quad 1 win. Obviously Purdue is a terrific team, as well.  
  
We'll plan a nice little party on Sunday, but we're not done yet. Hopefully we
can get a win tomorrow, too, and keep this thing moving.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Michigan State - 77, Ohio State - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Michigan State head coach Tom Izzo. Coach,
congratulations on your 600th win. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH IZZO: They asked me what that means. And I said, it means good things;
you're getting old, and you're 600 shy of Mike Krzyzewski and Jim Boeheim. It
keeps you humble and it makes you realize you haven't accomplished that much
yet. I give Ohio State a lot of credit. These are tough games when you come in
and that second game for them and the first game for us, I think it's a big
advantage for that team. I thought that all along. Maybe I've thought that
because I think we played in every -- we've had a bye just about every time
we've been in this tournament -- and Ohio State, with a young team, played
awfully hard. I did not think we had the energy and the focus and the passion
that was needed, which falls on me. And I was disappointed with that
throughout the game. We got some situations that, Cassius has been a little
laid up since the Michigan game. So everybody's wondering why I took him out.
It was some bad play but more because of what he's gone through. He hasn't
practiced, Sunday, Monday or Tuesday. And Kyle Ahrens gave me everything he
could. But he just kind of laid it on the line at the end and finally he was
in trouble. And then Foster Loyer came in and made some big, big plays. And to
his credit, they were big, big, big, big plays. But Cassius Winston's credit,
one of the things you observe as a coach and you kind of try to find out the
pulse of your team, he was his big, big, biggest cheerleader. And at one time
even told me to leave him in. That shows a little bit of the quality of kid
that Cassius is. And it was probably the right thing, too, because they were
able to rest some guys. But our three main guys, Kenny and Cash and X really
struggled early. But we found a way. And the name of this game is to find a
way. We turned it over eight or nine times first half, only two the second
half. I think that really proves my point that why should you need a halftime
to refocus. But sometimes until Nike puts phones on our belts so I can text my
guys, I guess I'm going to have to live with that.  
  
Q. Congrats on 600. State finals are going, state high school finals are
going on in your building. And the way Foster lit it up kind of reminded me of
last year. Talk about that. Do you have any flashbacks out there seeing Foster
and his performance tonight?  
COACH IZZO: It wasn't the state finals; I've watched Foster for three years do
that. He averaged 40 in the state tournament. So that was good. But I'll put
an advertisement in for Mooch and I. I'm wearing this gold and black sport
coat because, if you're from Iron Mountain you're wearing one, too. The
Mountaineers are playing in the finals tomorrow. You talk about something
exciting, Steve and I, our hometown team, not even did he and I make it down
that far to the finals back in the day. So my gold and black is in honor of
them and Foster, maybe it's March time for him. Maybe that's what he figured.
Because I think he averaged 40 a game in both of those games. He looked so
smooth and comfortable tonight and definitely saved us in the first half.  
  
Q. Over the time you've been coaching here, any commonality in how your
team has performed in this tournament translating to the Big Dance?  
COACH IZZO: No, that's the nice thing about me. I'm kind of universal. I've
been here to the Big Dance as a 1 seed and got beat the first game. And I've
been to the Big Dance as a 7 seed and gone to a Final Four. So I'm kind of
flexible. We've won this thing and -- as a No. 1 seed. We've lost the opening
game. I haven't. I think it's always harder on the highest seeds. But it's
good. The tournament is good because it gives you a chance to talk about one-
and-done. The uniqueness of our jobs, different than the NBA, a lot like the
NFL, but the other three sports, it's always best of whatever. And when it's
best of whatever, you've always got a safety net. When it's one-and-done,
that's why I called the timeout at the end. You've got to explain to the guys,
you know, you can do this, but every time you do it now you're going to be
going home. And freshmen don't understand that. Even sometimes upperclassmen
don't. Even if they've been through it -- I've been through it so many times
that I at least understand it. Now, I can't do anything about it all the time
but I at least understand it. I think it's important that you're playing
better in this, but they informed me in '99, went to a Final Four,
Northwestern wasn't very good then unlike now and we blew them out by two.
And, I mean, we went on to win the Big Ten Championship and to get to a Final
Four. So, I don't know, I'm not a big -- I don't believe in why does what
happened 10 years ago have anything to do -- when I see the stats that so-and-
so hasn't beaten so-and-so since 1911. Half those guys are dead so what does
it matter? I don't think they're doing anything to solve it. It's the day-to-
day stuff. And our guys need to learn some things today and yet they grew up
in the second half. They did some better things. We had some freshmen, we had
two freshmen that scored 20-some points, and we weren't led by Cassius Winston
or by Nick Ward or by Kenny Goins. And I've got a feeling if I look back on
the year, those guys led us 99 percent of the time. So I feel good about the
future.  
  
Q. You guys play so well without Nick, and I know you want to get them
back on the floor. What challenges do you have to get him on the floor and not
disrupt the flow you've had the last couple of weeks?  
COACH IZZO: That's a good question. It is hard. Because I think we really need
Nick. I think Nick did a phenomenal job considering he hasn't touched much. He
hasn't practiced two times since -- in three and a half weeks. And I think
that's a big deal. And I thought he played pretty much within himself. Got
enough minutes where we got him some time. But what did he go? Did he go
3-for-4? Couple of rebounds, eight points, 15 minutes. That's a great start. I
think we'll be able to build on that. But when people -- early in the year
people said, you might be better than you were last year with two lottery
picks. Those people are insane. And these same people that are -- you're
better -- we played better. We played good. I mean I can see why the eye test
sees that. But we needed a lot more flexibility, and there's going to be
fouls, there's going to be problems. Getting Nick Ward back, I think is very
critical to us marching forward.  
  
Q. Bench points big today, 24 bench points. And you said if we're going
to win this thing we'll need bodies to step up. They stepped up today.  
COACH IZZO: I thought they did. One of the things we came with is we had to
get some bench points. I didn't think we would get that many out of Foster. We
thought we had to not turn the ball over, and we had eight in the first half.
We thought we had to rebound better and I think we were down in that. We made
progress in all those areas. Our bench did a better job. I think we can still
get more out of Gabe and more out of Nick. Our rebounding improved a little
bit the second half. Our turnovers improved a lot. And part of Cassius earlier
was he just wasn't moving real good. And I'll tell you something, he's done a
heck of a job with Ohio State. They've got a young team. And even though their
guy wasn't hurt, he was out for three games. And he's, -- Wesson is a hell of
a player but I think some of those freshmen are improving. And they're
definitely going to be a tournament team that I think brings something to the
table with Wesson in there that can help. As I still think, as I promote our
league, I still think Indiana is a tournament team. And that's speaking from
experience in getting beat and how they play.  
  
Yesterday was a struggle for them. But in general this league has been
unbelievable this year.  
  
Q. If you were going to achieve 600 wins, what advice would you give to
young coaches going into the game to achieve that kind of success?  
COACH IZZO: (Chuckling). Find an AD and a president that's willing to stick
with you when you start out 4 and 5 in your third year and everybody in the
world wanted to fire you, that would be one thing I would do. But you know
what I'd do, I'd get a good staff. I'd get good players. Better players make
you a better coach. When you got good players -- I ran into Denzel coming off,
and I just think all the things he did for me. I had to remind Gabe in the
locker room, because I wasn't real happy with Gabe today on some things. But
Denzel had three points his freshman year, I think four, that's what he
averaged. Ends up a lottery pick. There's a process. That's what I'd tell
young guys. There's a process. Stick to the process. Don't try to -- you have
a lot of guys trying to shortcut it right now. And some of them are going to
pay for it. And so don't let the pressure get to you. Just stick with the
process. Stick with what you believe in, and hopefully get hired by the right
people. I think this "Hired To Be Fired" thing we're in right now is a little
crazy. If you're going to build culture, you can't change a program until you
build your culture. And culture is not something you build in two years, three
years or four years, if you want to build it the right way. So I'd tell those
guys to follow Mike Krzyzewski and Jim Boeheim and you'll get to 1,200 wins
instead of 600. That's what I'd tell them.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Michigan State - 77, Ohio State - 70  
  
COACH HOLTMANN: Give Michigan State credit. I think they're a terrific,
terrific team. Really solid in every way. And I think they have a chance to
have a really special, special postseason. So give them credit, first and
foremost.  
  
Proud of the way our guys battled, fought, kept fighting, kept battling all
the way until the end. But just didn't have enough today.  
  
Q. You are widely respected as a tactician. I'm curious how frustrating
can it be when you game plan but you probably didn't game plan for Foster
Loyer?  
COACH HOLTMANN: He's a good player. We saw him in high school. And, sure, when
you have, you know, Winston, it's hard to spend too much time talking about
his back-up. But we did talk about him. But he played really well. Give him
credit. I thought his 3s gave them real life, when he was 3-of-3 and then the
one in the zone in the second half when it was a one- or two-possession game.
I thought his 3s really gave them life.  
  
Q. Just your overall thought as you leave here today just on what these
two games meant for your team to kind of stabilize things after the way the
regular season ended. Are you coming away from here a little bit better about
your team than coming in?  
COACH HOLTMANN: Yeah, positive about our group. I thought our group really
competed. I thought our guys really competed both days, really competed. Beat,
obviously, a really good Indiana team and then competed here today. We had
some foul trouble issues that really did affect our team with Keyshawn and
Kaleb. But really positive about this group and obviously we've had some
really, really good moments this year, but as you mentioned finished with a
tough couple game stretch there before we came here. But proud of this group
and feel really good about where we're headed.  
  
Q. Is it enough? Are you guys in your mind in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I believe so, sure. But I think our body of work from opening
night, which a coach says, body of work, opening night, well, our opening-
night win was pretty good. But, yeah, I certainly feel confident in our body
of work. And the league we played in is top to bottom the best in the country.
I really believe that. I think the metrics would show that. Coaches say that
all the time: that's the best league in the country. But I think our metrics
would show an objective look at that, that it is the best.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Greg Gard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26758)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Wisconsin - 66, Nebraska - 62  
  
COACH GARD: Obviously it's never easy. We made it more difficult on ourselves
at times than we needed to. But proud of our guys how we were able to rally at
the end, make some shots, get some stops. And knowing Nebraska was playing
well we were going to be fighting into that momentum and the emotional push
that they had going the last couple of days. So the nice thing about this is
you get a chance to survive, advance and move on to the next, and quickly
learn from this, put it behind us and get ready for Michigan State.  
  
Q. The timeout with just under a minute left, trying to hit the 3, what
were you trying to hope to get out of that?  
COACH GARD: We were playing through Khalil on the post which is exactly what
we were looking for there. We were going to center around him and play around
that. And they backed up enough to try to prevent the catch that D'Mitrik was
able to get enough space and a good look at the rim. So that was a big shot.  
  
Q. Ethan didn't look too comfortable out there, seven turnovers, 2-of-4,
not a usual game for him.  
COACH GARD: You're right. I thought he was out of sorts from the beginning.
Very uncharacteristic for him. Fortunately we had teammates that rallied to
his side and were able to play well when he was trying to, having a harder
time finding his rhythm.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, how do you coach against Tom Izzo teams?  
COACH GARD: They're really good. I don't know how you coach against Tom Izzo
teams. You have to be really good at the things you're good at, try to
minimize the things that they're really good at, and you gotta make shots like
against all good teams. We've got to be very consistent. We know it will be a
physical game as every game is in this league. So I think there's -- Tom's got
really good players, has for a long time. Does a terrific job with them. It's
a really good team. We're excited to have that opportunity tomorrow.  
  
Q. Back to Ethan, kind of a blueprint (indiscernible) view is to send
extra bodies at him. What does he need to do better there, and sometimes even
make that strategy blow up by looking at (indiscernible) getting good shots.
What can happen in that regard today?  
COACH GARD: There were some situations where he did get double-teamed where he
didn't make the proper decision, but there was also times where he wasn't
double-teamed that he didn't make it. Put the ball in traffic, exposed the
ball too much. I thought he was out of sorts defensively, too. He was out of
position more often than not. Just, like I said, uncharacteristic day for him
on both ends. So, like I said, fortunately he's got terrific teammates that
rallied around that and we're able to play again tomorrow.  
  
Q. Khalil hit a few jumpers today which might be surprising to some
fans. Is that even something that he had in his locker maybe a few months ago?
He looked so much more confident on offense hitting those step-backs.  
COACH GARD: He's had that ability. It's a matter of him doing it in a live
situation. It's been encouraged. It's been worked on. I think right now, in
the last month, he's really played at the confidence level and assertiveness
level is at an all-time high. And you want to see a senior that's helped this
program being able to play his best basketball at the end of his career in the
last few weeks of that. And he's definitely doing that.  
  
Q. (Inaudible) preseason before the injury?  
COACH GARD: Yes. That was a piece of the attacking, the on the glass.
Obviously I think getting momentum early, knocking down some shots. Confidence
grew and grew. And he made some big plays for us. Played really well.  
  
Q. To follow up on Michigan State, this is your second matchup of the
year with them. What do you think is going to be the biggest key coming into
this one from your loss a couple months ago?  
COACH GARD: Yeah, that one went down to the wire, going to the big three with
about 30 seconds to go, to take it from a three-point game to a six-point
game. There's a lot of things -- I'll go through the tape again tonight and
catch up on that and look. But the blueprint for how they orchestrate success
hasn't changed. They're really good on the glass. They're really good in
transition. Obviously they've got some depth that's developed. Really good
players. Terrific player in Cassius Winston running the show. When you have a
guard or point guard that good that can orchestrate things and allows the
others around him to do their thing. So we know it's a really good team. And,
like I said, I'm just excited about the opportunity to have that challenge
tomorrow.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [John Beilein](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13675)

  
_United Center - Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Michigan - 74, Iowa - 53  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: We beat a really good team today. That was our February and our
March. The way the season trended and the way the schedule was, we played some
terrific -- we played a bunch of NCAA teams. Nebraska was probably the only
team of our last half dozen of six or seven games that isn't a team that's
going to be in the tournament. We weren't able to win them all, but this is a
real quality win for us. We needed it after our disappointing loss in really
our regular season championship game Saturday at Michigan State, and now we
advance and move on and play a really good Minnesota team. We were fortunate
enough to win at the buzzer and win by just a few at Minnesota.  
  
Quickest turnaround I've probably ever had as a coach to be sitting here right
now at 11:00 with a 2:30 game, but we'll do our best.  
  
Q. Being back-to-back champions in this tournament, what is it that
makes you guys so calm and confident coming into this tournament and
performing the way that you do?  
JOHN BEILEIN: You know, you asked me that question before, how have we been
able to win. I can't really tell you. The only thing I can say, it must be
something we're doing all year long. It might be that mid-major mentality I
had way before that -- how you play in the season doesn't mean anything.
You've got to win your tournament.  
  
There's nothing intentional here. There's nothing -- we're just trying to get
better every day, right, and then I think if you go into tournaments and
you're usually a team that doesn't beat itself during the season, maybe you
have some success then.  
  
It's not intentional. It just happens sometimes.  
  
Q. What did you see in Charles tonight? He seemed --  
JOHN BEILEIN: Well, he was gassed, I'll tell you that, but he played great
defense. He's such a big difference, not only if he's guarding on the ball,
but off the ball he's our best -- I guess he would be a center fielder in
baseball, a safety in football. He directs the whole thing. And a couple of
other games when he was out, that was an obvious issue that we had, that we
didn't have that voice in the background telling everybody who to take,
guarding his own man without help.  
  
Q. How great is it to have him back at this juncture?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, one thing because I love the young man, and to have him
just back as part of this team is huge. But that rotation, that when we have a
follower -- like today, when he and J.P. both got their third foul early,
right, we had somebody else there, right, but then he could come back in and
finish the game. Big difference maker for us. Just look at his record, right,
as a starter at Michigan, 33 wins, 27 wins now, is that 60 wins in two years?
Who does that? That's a pretty good time as a starter.  
  
Q. How good was Simpson tonight, and how big is he for you guys when
he's playing like that?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think the biggest thing is that we've seen him, it's a bit of
an anomaly, where he'll go 2-for-2 from three, like he did today, because five
or six days he's hit 4-for-5, and then he's had days where it looked like the
ball was going in and it didn't.  
  
I just love that he's still confident. The biggest thing is 11 assists and one
turnover, against changing defense all the time, and then Bohannon does not
score, and that's his match-up. That's a heck of a day against a heck of a
player.  
  
Q. How much is Iggy reminding you of Mo right now with stepping up
offensively, kind of being your horse offensively coming down the stretch? Can
you make any comparisons?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Yeah, I think that that's a fair comparison, just that there's
-- he is emotional. He loves to celebrate on the court, right, it's almost
like you're watching a European soccer game and somebody scores a goal.
There's usually something going on there, and he loves that part. You've got
to embrace that.  
  
I know Mo, both of those guys if they were soccer players, right, they'd have
a heck of a celebration every time they scored. So just they like winning,
they like making plays. They enjoy basketball. That's the biggest thing. They
enjoy basketball.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Mark Turgeon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13696)

  
_Chicago_  
  
Nebraska - 69, Maryland - 61  
  
MARK TURGEON: You know, we weren't very good today. I'll just be real with
you. And Nebraska, I thought, was terrific, especially when they needed to be,
shot clock going down, made a lot of shots. You know, we just never had it.
Made mistakes defensively throughout the game. We let our offense affect our
defense. We couldn't make a shot, couldn't handle the double-team. So there's
a lot of things we didn't do very well today. Because our offense was so bad
-- I've already said this, it affected our defense at some critical stages.
But we never quit. We tried. We had a couple opportunities late, cut it to
five, I think, but they just made big plays. Give them credit. They deserved
to win. They were much better than we were today.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you guys had a chance to win when Bruno was not
scoring?  
MARK TURGEON: No, it's not that Bruno wasn't scoring. They doubled him every
time. It was that we didn't make them pay for what they were doing, and that
was a disappointing thing. I'm not going to get into why that was happening,
but that's disappointing, and Bruno usually is good for a couple of offensive
rebound put-backs, and he couldn't get them today. The ball didn't bounce our
way a lot, either. Even when I thought we still had a chance, the one bounced
on the rim three times, and then they got the offensive rebound. One of those
days, but we've got to be able to overcome it. But we had a lot of guys, a lot
of coaches, a lot of people that didn't do well today. That's why we lost.  
  
Q. The technical when you were down nine --  
MARK TURGEON: I think it was down seven. It was nine, yeah, that's right.  
  
Q. What had led to sort of -- I know it wasn't a one-time outburst.
There was a lot going on through the game.  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, I just got on the floor too much. Shouldn't have done it.
I thought Darryl got fouled, but they didn't. That's really what matters.
Shouldn't have got the technical.  
  
Q. You have a real inexperienced team, a lot of guys this is their first
postseason stint. Do you think some guys learned some things about the
difference between the regular season today?  
MARK TURGEON: Oh, I don't know. People make a lot out of that. What are we,
fourth-youngest? We were fifth. I don't know how we got to fourth. We're the
fourth-youngest team, and we played like it today. I don't know if it was the
building, we didn't know who we were playing. We seemed locked in. When we
found out it was Nebraska we had a good walk-through last night, good film
session. I felt we were prepared, we just didn't play well.  
  
We have to learn from this. Last year we were sitting here, we lost a game to
Wisconsin in New York, and we were praying to get into the NIT, okay. We're in
the NCAA Tournament. It's been a heck of a year for us. We've got the fourth
youngest team. We played, I heard, the eighth-toughest schedule. We've
overcome a lot. We'll overcome this. We just didn't play well today. We'll get
ourselves ready to go and hopefully play better in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Going off that, what can you do in the next couple days, in the next
week, to get your team ready to make sure that this doesn't destroy their
confidence?  
MARK TURGEON: Well, we've bounced back all year in a lot of situations. So I
plan for us to do the same thing. We're going to have extra practices now,
obviously, that we didn't want. I think the game experience probably would
have been a little better for us than practices. We practiced well this week.
That's the thing that's tough for me right now sitting in front of you. We
really practiced well this week. So we've got to get our minds right moving
forward. We'll do a lot of things that way and get back to some of the things
that we were doing with them, and hopefully it'll carry over and we'll play
well. But we'll be excited. We're going to be real excited when our name pops
up. Whoever it is is going to be a really good team, and we're going to have
to play better than we did today to have a chance to win.  
  
Q. They matched you in rebounding today statistically. What went wrong
and they were doubling Bruno a lot and that leads to Jalen getting offensive
boards normally.  
MARK TURGEON: Yeah, not today. I wish I had an answer for you on that. But it
just wasn't -- we weren't in it. We weren't in it today, we just didn't play
well. I can't explain it. I'm disappointed. Players are disappointed. But we
just did not have it, couldn't get it going, and if we did for a minute or
two, we couldn't sustain it. You know, Emily asked me a question about Bruno's
three points. Normally he gets some offensive rebounds. He had zero today.
He's a tough box-out. So there's a lot of things that just didn't go our way.
We didn't play well. And I think Nebraska deserved to win. I thought they
played well. I thought they were into it. I thought their two best players
made plays when they had to, and they deserved to win. Happy for Tim.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Jordan Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32946)

### [Dupree McBrayer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32984)

  
_United Center-Chicago, Ill._  
  
Minnesota - 77, Penn State - 72 (OT)  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Obviously really proud of our guys. Got stops when we needed
to get stops. We finally started rebounding the ball well. We did a really
good job on Stevens down low. And then these guys right here made some huge
plays.  
  
So very proud of the fight, the toughness that we showed the last couple
minutes there.  
  
Q. Dupree, did Coach surprise you there?  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Yeah, he called me "old guard," and my heart jumped.  
  
Q. Dupree, can you take us through the run at the end of the game to get
it tied? What was your team's mindset going into those final three, four
minutes?  
DUPREE McBRAYER: We were a little quiet in the huddles, and then I think Murph
stepped up and spoke, and then I followed behind him, and then plays just
started traping at each other, and we got a little bit of energy and was able
to come back.  
  
Q. Murph, you said something in the huddle. What did you say to spark
that?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I think I told the guys that we were pretty much acting like we
were down 20 when we were only down four or six, and we needed more energy and
we needed more life. And that was something that sparked our guys to stay
confident, and plays just started happening.  
  
Q. Dupree, Coach kind of jumped behind you when you were doing an
interview after the game. Just talk about what it meant for him and the whole
team to be behind you after everything you've been through.  
DUPREE McBRAYER: I would say Coach P and my team has been there for me from
the beginning. They flew out to my mom's funeral. They didn't have to do that.
But Coach P never gave up on me. Of course I was playing bad, he could have
made some changes, but he stuck with me. So that shows his commitment to
believing in me.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you talk about the physicality of that second half with
the game going down to the wire? A lot of bodies hitting the floor on both
ends. What was that like inside?  
JORDAN MURPHY: Yeah, the refs were really letting us play, letting us be
physical and not really calling a lot of fouls down the stretch, which was a
good thing. They let the game flow and let us decide the game.  
  
I thought it was a really physical battle, and both teams played really hard.
And obviously it gets a little rough down there, and just being able to finish
and finish around the basket. But I think Amir and Dupree did a good job both.
Yeah.  
  
Q. How key was the defense by the guards down the stretch, kind of
doubling down and getting a lot of deflections to get you out on the run?  
RICHARD PITINO: Huge. Stevens is a very, very talented player. I thought Gabe,
Dupree, and Amir bothering those guys all got crucial steals. We needed to do
that. They make it hard to double big to big, but we had to come off some of
those guards because Stevens is unstoppable down there.  
  
Q. Coach, what I talked to Dupree about, after the game, showing a lot
of emotion for him, being happy for him. When this team went through that
earlier in the season, that was kind of the first adversity and you've been
through a lot of that this year. How has that been for the seniors to get you
through it?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, what's been awesome about Dupree is he goes through
losing his mother. He's been appreciative of everything, and then to see just
kind of the way that he was maturely able to move on, like I wouldn't be able
to do that in college, and honor his mother the right way. I mean, you know
she's watching, she's proud of him.  
  
I look at him on Senior Night, and he's in front of all of our fans, and he's
enthusiastic, he's not afraid to show it. Even tonight, he turned to me and
said, You need to relax. And I looked at him, and I was like, You relax.  
  
But he was right, I needed to relax. But that's confidence. And when we have a
relationship like that, it's very, very strong. He's a special kid.  
  
Q. In the first half it seemed like you were a little bit unsatisfied
with some of the energy. What do you think was lacking? And then kind of Amir
in the first half, too --  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, you know, we really were. We were zombies. We were
walking around. Every huddle was like me trying to get them going, and then
Murph was really speaking, but the rest of them were very, very quiet. I
thought we were close to breaking through, but we needed something to happen.  
  
That middle part of the second half, it was able to get the emotion going, and
then all of a sudden the light came on and those guys were really, really
talking in huddles.  
  
Q. Just on the floor tonight with Dupree, it seemed like some of his
shots late sparked the team and he was one of your more efficient scorers on
the night. How big was that?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, he made that and-one, which was a huge play. That was a
physical play, made a big three. He made some big steals. He was awesome down
the stretch. That's what a senior captain is all about.  
  
Q. Been like that all year for Amir when you need him, he can come up
big. Obviously he didn't start off the game very well, but he figured out a
way to get involved.  
RICHARD PITINO: 40-minute game, he made big plays down the stretch when we
needed him to, five assists, two steals, huge steals. Came down and rebounding
a couple balls and then made some big free throws. Yeah, he wasn't great
offensively scoring the ball early, but he did a lot of things that were
terrific.  
  
Q. To see a guy who even when he's having a quiet game like that, you
just kind of are waiting for him to do something big like what he did at the
end?  
RICHARD PITINO: I kept telling him, You did this versus Maryland. You weren't
really going, all of a sudden you exploded offensively. It'll come. It'll
come. Be patient, be confident. And he did that.  
  
Q. Coming into the game, you talked about --  
RICHARD PITINO: No, you have to ask do I think we're in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. You have to let me get to it. Before the game you thought you were
in. What do you think now?  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, truthfully, I felt like we were in, but you know,
there's so many variables, as we all know, as it unfolds, and you know, the
biggest thing you've got to do to stop all that, you keep looking at, oh, we
need them to lose, we need this team to lose. We can't have an upset.  
  
But at the end of the day, hey, just shut up and go win the game, right? Proud
of the guys for doing that. Absolutely believe that to have five new guys, to
have the adversity we dealt with, with Eric Curry getting hurt, it's special,
and I definitely think we're in.  
  
So Sunday will be fun, but we've got to move on, and we've got to try to beat
a really good Purdue team.

### [Devonte Green](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32074)

  
_Chicago_  
  
Ohio State - 79, Indiana - 75  
  
COACH MILLER: Congratulations to Ohio State. They played a really well-played
game. And we just didn't play at a high enough level for long enough of
stretches in the game on either end of the floor to keep ourselves in a little
better striking distance. And you've got to give them credit for that. I
thought offensively that was probably as poor as we've played here in a long
time. Our turnovers in the first half really broke us down in terms of giving
them 17 points off turnovers. We had 10 in the first half. And that was kind
of a little bit of a deal-breaker for us at halftime. And then I thought in
the second half, hopefully coming out of halftime we would be able to regroup.
But we weren't able to make a couple plays there in the first four, eight
minutes, especially long rebounds and some 50/50 plays that just kept the lead
right at the same time. Then once they broke it open, I thought our team kind
of responded how we normally have. And to their credit, especially the guys
that finished the game, to be 55 seconds in a one-possession game, I thought
showed a lot of heart, which is what this team's had a lot. It's been some
really tough sledding at times and we've had some good moments. But to finish
the game like that was encouraging for the guys that were on the floor. But
just weren't good enough at this game at this level for what was at stake --
needed to play smarter and sharper and at the end of the day be better
defensively in terms of rebounding, some things that we could control and we
didn't.  
  
Q. Juwan, obviously it's hard to play with foul trouble. How much does
that disrupt your rhythm, just when you're having to worry about the whistle
and you know you're going to be sitting down for a while, more than you want
to, what goes through your mind?  
JUWAN MORGAN: Just gotta stay in the game, stay engaged in the game mentally.
That's just as important as the physical aspect of it. And you have to be
ready to go once you go back in. You can't sit there saying, I should be
playing, the refs or anything. You have to just be ready to go once you're
back out there.  
  
Q. You talked about once they kind of broke it open you guys responded.
During that crucial couple minutes, what was going on? Were they just making
shots and you weren't, or what did you see happen there?  
COACH MILLER: Combination of things. Obviously offensively we weren't scoring
or turning it over. And I think just our overall toughness on the ball wasn't
good enough. When the screens hit us, in my opinion we died on a few and we
had to stay a little longer than we needed to in rotation. And I thought they
delivered the ball out of the ball screen a few times off of the corner pass
and they made some timely 3s. We struggled. We just did. We struggled for
whatever reason. We struggled on the ball today. If you look at their guards
play, you know, if you look at C.J. Jackson and you look at Keyshawn Woods, 35
points between those two guys and nine assists and three turnovers. Guards win
at this time of year. They've got to make plays. They've got to make shots,
because it's difficult. And those guys made some really, really big baskets
for them inside out of the post. I thought Woods in particular, he may have
scored the last seven points or at least seven in a row in a tough stretch
when we couldn't do it. So those guys played well. And Kaleb, let's be honest
with you, if Kaleb isn't an all-conference player then I don't know what one
is. He hasn't played in the last three games. That drastically changes the
structure of what you're doing. I thought he did a great job getting back.
They did a great job getting him the ball. And they're a tournament team. And
at the end of the day they advance and I wish them well.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about Devonte's play and stepping up when the team
really needed some bucket late.  
COACH MILLER: He was all we had there for a while. He stepped up and made
shots. That's what it's going to have to be like in this type of a game.
They're going to give some guys some shots. You're going to have to step up
and make some easy, assist-type passes early in possessions where you don't
over-dribble. They crowded the floor on the dribble all game long. I thought
Devonte here in the last three weeks has really raised his level of play. He
was great yesterday in our workout. He's the one guy, he's playing with really
good confidence right now. And he hit some late ones there that were long
ones. But without him I don't think we would have even been close coming back
that last eight minutes. He made some really good plays for us. He's had a
good finish in the last month of the season for us, which is good to see for
an older guy.  
  
Q. What do you think this means for you guys going forward, especially
regarding the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH MILLER: We'll wait and see. It will be difficult. Our resumé at the end
of the day if you put it up there with a blank sketch I'm sure it compares
favorably to some other teams. We've played a ridiculous schedule. And
obviously have beaten teams that obviously made the tournament. And I think
the one thing in this stage when you're comparing everybody -- can you beat a
team in the tournament? Can you win a game? And this team can win a game in
the tournament because it's played good ball here lately and has also played
good ball early. When you're able to beat a Marquette or Louisville, you're
able to get a Michigan State twice. You're able to get Wisconsin here lately.
Those teams are all highly seeded teams. So are we capable? Yes. Did we do
enough? I'm not sure. I know if we are in the tournament, I believe our guys
are capable of winning the game. But for me to speculate, it's hard. I know
that our league is the toughest in the country this season. And to play the
schedule that we've played and be able to sort of come up with our head above
water here these last three weeks is a good sign. So we'll take whatever they
give us. You obviously earn what you get. And for us right now we'll just kind
of wait and see. But I think our league in general, though, will be
represented well.  
  
Q. Ohio State, I assume you think they are a tournament team at this
point?  
COACH MILLER: Yes, they're in the tournament. And I hope they get rewarded
with that. Their last three games, like I said, are playing without a dominant
player. So that has to go in consideration with their resumé as well. And they
should definitely be in the tournament.

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

  
_Chicago_  
  
Nebraska - 69, Maryland - 61  
  
TIM MILES: Well, I thought it was a great effort by the Huskers, and the kids
really came out and established, I thought, very good defense and rebounding,
very solid defense and rebounding, and then we got some offense going later in
the first half, and then just kept going the second half and then kind of held
on at the end. But Maryland plays really hard. Mark, I think, has an excellent
defensive team especially. I thought we did a good job on Bruno, and we needed
to.  
  
Q. Tim, you're constantly running with seven players throughout the
course of the game. How do you keep doing it, and what's your philosophy as
you move forward in this tournament?  
TIM MILES: Well, yeah, we are who we are, not who we not are, you know, and I
don't know that Thomas is ready yet. I think he's still maybe in the next week
before Thomas Allen is ready. So we're just -- we're trying to put players out
there. We know it'll get a little crooked sometimes, but the kids are -- I
think what's cool, and I've said this before, is that the walk-ons, okay, they
come in -- they're in the bench last year, right, and they're just playing as
hard as they can for the team, and the guys like James Palmer is an all-league
guy, Isaiah Roby, Glynn Watson, they accept them. They don't look at me and
evaluate me, they just accept them, like okay, this is what you can -- and
they play off each other that way. Not every team is like that. And so I think
that says a lot about our young guys, and that's really important. You
wouldn't win otherwise. A lot of teams would just say, we've got seven guys,
there's no way, and they'd quit. Not just say I quit, but they just wouldn't
do those things. So I think that is probably that mentality is the thing I'm
most proud of.  
  
Q. How big was the 16-minute timeout, getting that second chance? It
seemed like you guys were sort of teetering and then you scored those five
points.  
TIM MILES: Yeah, there's no doubt Maryland was on the attack and we weren't
able to slow them down. You know, any time you get an extra possession like
that and you're able to run a little more clock, it's like a running game,
right, and I think that was huge. The plays that James and Hon made, even
Isaiah Roby, were really huge, and the defense they played was great, too, but
that was a key moment, and then James made some really difficult shots.  
  
Q. What was the game plan for Bruno coming in, and how were you able to
take him out of the game?  
TIM MILES: Yeah, we just wanted to aggravate him as much as possible, just
make him play in a crowd, send different guys at him, whatever it took. And
then you really run some risk. I always worry about Anthony Cowan, too, going
off the way he can, but we had to get to Bruno, and we did. You don't beat
Maryland without trying to neutralize those two big kids.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
Iowa - 83, Illinois - 62  
  
Q. There's been a lot of talk this year about Illinois's young corps and
the potential that they've showed. You've played them three times this year.
Speak about what you saw out of those guys as the season progressed?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Well, we played them twice, by the way. But I mean, they've
got some really good young players. I think Ayo is one of the best players in
the country. I think Giorgi is a handful. Both of those guys established
themselves, but it's not just them, they've got other good young players, and
they're going to be tough year in and year out from here on. I can tell you
that.  
  
Q. What was the difference in the second half after they seemed to score
a lot in the first half but you guys seemed to turn up your defense a
little?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Well, I think our offense was better, too, and sometimes one
is a function of the other. You know, we only had one turnover in the whole
second half against a team that's pressuring. I thought we moved the ball, we
established a low-post game, we got a little bit in transition, and
consequently we were able to get our defense back. If your defense isn't back,
Illinois is really tough to play against.  
  
So I think by virtue of us not turning the ball over, getting good shot
opportunities, shooting a high number, getting our defense back, we were in a
position to stop them a little bit easier.  
  
Q. Snapping that losing streak, would you describe that as a relief for
you guys, or how would you describe the feeling of just getting that out of
the way?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: I wouldn't look at it that way. We lost four in a row. Three
we didn't play well. But when you don't play well, there are factors in a game
that are still good. There were good things that happened in all three of
those games. Doesn't seem like it. We really played pretty well against
Nebraska on the road. You've got to give them credit for how they play the
last minute, but we were in control of that game, and it's upsetting when you
lose a game that you're in control of, but it doesn't mean the whole 40
minutes was a disaster, because it wasn't.  
  
So I thought we made a big step there. So you turn around with another
opportunity against a team like Illinois, who's very good and had just come
off a win, tough win, on a stage like this. I think it's an important
opportunity for us to kind of put it together a little bit more than we have
been, kind of like we were before that. So I think from that standpoint, it's
very important.  
  
Q. You got Michigan coming up tomorrow night here at the United Center.
What kind of a mindset do you have this time around, especially after you've
beaten them once back home in Carver?  
FRAN McCAFFERY: Same mindset when you play Michigan. They're one of the best
teams in the country with a great coach. They have terrific players. I think
they were ranked fifth when they came in when we played them the last time, so
you recognize what they've accomplished to that point.  
  
And same thing tomorrow, recognize what they've accomplished to this point.
It's an opportunity for us to play one of the best teams in the country in the
Big Ten Tournament. We know they're going to defend. We know they're going to
run that offense to perfection, and it's going to take a very good effort to
beat them. We've just got to get back and prepare.

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [C.J. Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32829)

### [Keyshawn Woods](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33019)

  
_Chicago_  
  
Ohio State - 79, Indiana - 75  
  
COACH HOLTMANN: Certainly a tough win. A lot of credit to Indiana. I knew,
based on how much respect we have for their team and for Archie, that they
would come back and battle. That's just in their DNA. So we knew it could
certainly get tight. But our guys weathered the storm. Players win games and
these two to my right here, obviously along with having Caleb back and his
defensive presence was the difference. Look forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what it meant in general just to have Kaleb back
and how it opened things up for the rest of the team?  
C.J. JACKSON: Obviously it was good having him back. He's one of our key guys.
And just having one of our brothers back that -- we have been working all
season long, all season long. It's always good to have one of our players
back.  
  
KEYSHAWN WOODS: Like C.J. said, Kaleb draws a lot of attention. He opens up
the floor for everybody else. And then also on the defensive end he's a great
presence, too, protecting the rim. And he's a great talker and communicator.
So it's great to have Kaleb back on the floor with us.  
  
Q. Did you feel like when you were up 20 there in the second half that
maybe you let up a little and let Indiana back in, or did they just come and
force the issue?  
KEYSHAWN WOODS: A little bit of both. We kind of got out our way a little bit.
And also they were forcing the issue. But we regained our poise at the end
when it really mattered and we got the win.  
  
C.J. JACKSON: Like Keyshawn said, we knew they were going to come back, kind
of how Coach talked about how they weren't going to quit fighting. And that's
what they did. And we just had to continue to be who we are in those type of
moments and continue to fight and stay together. And we did that.  
  
Q. The nature of this tournament is you play again tomorrow and you've
got to start looking ahead. You'll face a team that's gotten you a couple
times this year. Is that any extra motivation going into this, that they've
gotten the better of you a couple times, and another shot at Michigan State?  
C.J. JACKSON: Yeah, we know what type of team they are. Like you said, we
played with them a couple times this year and we'll definitely be ready
tomorrow at 11:30.  
  
KEYSHAWN WOODS: You always want to play a team that beat you twice. It's
another game for us. It's an important game for us. We've got to keep winning
if you want to advance in the tournament. We've got to prepare tonight for
Michigan State.  
  
Q. As much as you want to focus on the game, when the whole world's
talking about the bubble and if you win it means this and if you lose it means
that. How hard is it to keep that out of the narrative within the team, and
were you able to do that?  
COACH HOLTMANN: You know, I think that that conversation's been going along
for -- they start bubble talk, I think, in November. So that conversation has
been going on for a while. And I think it requires some discipline. And I'm
not sure that we've always been great at it. But as much as possible, we've
just tried to focus in on trying to play more possessions and quality
basketball than what we did the previous time. So, is it hard? Sure. I mean,
it's everywhere this time of year, right? I think our guys did a pretty good
job here this last week and a half.  
  
Q. Woods' background, I'm not sure he ever played in the NCAA
Tournament, to borrow off what --  
COACH HOLTMANN: Play-in game one time.  
  
Q. Looked like a guy that wanted to be in the tournament and really laid
it out there. Just talk about 9-of-13 today, he really hit the shots in the
final minute that kind of got you a little bit closer to the finish line.  
COACH HOLTMANN: Tremendous. He was tremendous. I thought he was tremendous in
every way. I thought he's looked, since the 10-minute mark of the Wisconsin
game, like a guy that wasn't ready to see his career over any time soon. And
that's what you hope in seniors. Like, that is what we've been kind of hoping
to see, honestly, in light of being down Kaleb, we've been hoping to see that.
And he and C.J. were both terrific.  
  
Q. You guys had a couple of pretty good games with Michigan State. How
do you guys get to the next level, and how have you seen Michigan State maybe
change in the past month or two?  
COACH HOLTMANN: I've watched them a little bit. But not as much, honestly.
They had Nick Ward both times. He went out the second half of our game. I
don't know what his status is now. But they're terrific. They're an elite
team, can get to a Final Four, can win a national championship. They're
deserving of everything that's come their way. We'll need to play exceptional
basketball for 40 minutes. But we're excited about the opportunity.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Patrick Chambers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22067)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
Minnesota - 77, Penn State - 72 (OT)  
  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: You know what, I'm really proud of my team. I'm disappointed
it ended today. I felt like we were just starting to figure some things out.
We were just getting better.  
  
Man, February and March were a lot of fun for us, and we had to grow in
November and December and January, one of the hardest schedules in the
country. Couldn't be more proud of a group.  
  
Man, did I enjoy coaching them. I enjoyed coaching these guys when it was
0-10, 0-8, 0-5, it didn't matter. They showed up. They showed up. They gave
great effort in practice, and then I think that's why you saw it flip for us,
And I think that's why you saw us play so well down the stretch.  
  
Our seniors, Josh Reaves, just unbelievable. He played his heart out today,
but he gave -- for four years that kid gave us everything. Deivis Zemgulis,
what he's meant to this program, what he's done on and off the floor for us,
his leadership, just amazing. Again, it's unfortunate.  
  
Give Minnesota credit, give Richard credit. Coffey made some big plays down
the stretch, made a big three there in the overtime where we were reeling a
little bit.  
  
But again, I think this was such a great experience for our younger guys. Our
freshmen struggled a little bit today. It's a big stage. It's a big stage for
them, and they'll learn from that.  
  
So our freshmen become sophomores, that's a great thing, sophomores become
juniors and juniors become seniors. I really like the direction of where this
program is headed.  
  
And I'd be remiss not to thank our athletic director, Sandy Barbour, for all
her support when things weren't going our way. She did not waver. She believed
in me, and she believed in this group, and I think that's why we finished so
well. I don't know many teams that started out 0-10 and finished the way we
did and get a bye. I was very positive with my team in there, and I'll
continue to be positive.  
  
Q. This was a game where in the first half, especially, Minnesota kind
of stayed in it. There were some questionable calls. How do you and the
players stay within yourselves when frustration is building?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: Yeah, we've just got to keep the same attitude. We're built
on attitude. I keep saying that. I tried to calm my emotions, too. Again, the
refs are good officials. They're Big Ten officials, so we have to do a better
job of developing those great habits. I agree, I thought if we let them get to
the free-throw line 25 plus times, we were going to be in trouble because
that's where they scored the majority of our points.  
  
Now, we did foul at the end there. So you take those fouls away, they still
were getting to the free-throw line. I thought Lamar could have got there a
few more times, but they didn't think so.  
  
Q. We talk a lot about Mike finally having his breakout game. We saw it
a little bit against Rutgers, but today I think was his best offensive output.
How important is that to the team as a whole when Mike really has it going?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: I think it was a critical stage, too, when maybe Lamar was
struggling to score and they were really loading up on him and confusing him a
little bit, and then we started to call some plays for Mike and got some
rebounds. That was big. That was big.  
  
So it was nice to see Mike, and I know he played a lot of minutes. But we're
going to ask a lot more of him.  
  
Q. Your freshmen guards, Myreon, Myles, and Rasir, I believe had a
combined three points tonight. Can you talk about how it's a big stage, their
first Big Ten Tournament. Can you attribute their struggles to anything
besides the fact that it was a big stage?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: You know what, they're young. Again, this is the first time.
Everything is new. These experiences are all new for these freshmen. I think
these freshmen are going to be really, really good, and they've shown that.
They showed it especially in the month of February and March. Another great
experience, another great learning lesson, another growth opportunity, and
that's the way I'm going to present it.  
  
Q. We've talked a few times this season where you go through these dry
spells at crucial points in the game, and that did happen again at the end of
regulation tonight. Do you find again this game was kind of a microcosm of the
season?  
PATRICK CHAMBERS: I wouldn't say the season, I would say December and January,
a little bit like that. I thought we got really good shots off, I really did.
I thought Lamar had some good ones, I thought Josh had a good one. We executed
exactly what we needed to execute to put guys in position to be successful,
and it just didn't go our way.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Giorgi Bezhanishvili](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36248)

### [Ayo Dosunmu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36808)

### [Brad Underwood](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26855)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
Iowa - 83, Illinois - 62  
  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Well, commend Iowa. Iowa was terrific tonight. They were the
better basketball team.  
  
Tonight they were a tough match-up for us. Tyler Cook posed some problems. I
thought defensively after the first four minutes of the game, we did some good
things in the first half, but we turned it over too many times, 15, and again,
they've been really good, 12 of 23. We're one of the top 20 teams in three-
point field goal percentage defense, and yet you would never know that when we
play Iowa.  
  
Very, very proud of these two guys. They've had a great freshman year. Three
of our top four scorers tonight were freshmen. Had a sophomore in there. And
as I told this group, tonight was an ending, but I loved coaching this team
each and every day. This is the beginning of bringing Illinois basketball
back, and these two guys, I couldn't have asked for anything more, not just in
terms of what their play was but as who they are as people. And now the best
thing that we get to do is have an off-season.  
  
You know, I think when you look at bodies of Big Ten teams and you look at
ours, you know that that's an area that we're excited to head into. But yeah,
I'm proud. We had a great year. We played a very difficult schedule, and
heading into the off-season with this group is something that excites me a
great deal as we head into the future.  
  
Q. Two-part question: Will each of you be back? And if so, what are you
envisioning in terms of what success might look like next year?  
GIORGI BEZHANISHVILI: Yeah, definitely will be back. A lot of work has to be
done in the off-season, a goal -- there is a lot of goals, personal goals,
team goals. We have to sit back and look at everything. But just a lot of work
in the off-season, that's the goal, as much work as I can personally and as a
team.  
  
AYO DOSUNMU: Yeah, I mean, we've got to get better as a team and just focus on
little details. I mean, it'll be good. We've got new guys coming in, so we've
got to try to get better as a team.  
  
Q. They obviously had two really good offensive games when they played
you guys this year. What do they do offensively that makes them so difficult
to guard?  
GIORGI BEZHANISHVILI: They're just a smart team. When you make a mistake, they
make you pay every time. When we made a mistake tonight, they made us pay.
They're a great shooting team. Obviously we saw they made a lot of shots. As I
said, when you make a mistake, they make you pay, and that's what they did,
and that was the game.  
  
Q. It was a lot of fun to watch you develop throughout the course of the
season. Just curious what memories you guys will take away from this
experience this year.  
AYO DOSUNMU: Memories, it's tough. I feel like we had an up-and-down season,
but I'm just going to remember us fighting as hard as we can each and every
day. A lot of people didn't expect us to win as many games as we did. We
shocked a lot of teams. So just playing each and every game as hard as we can,
that's what I'll remember the most.  
  
GIORGI BEZHANISHVILI: I mean, as he said, we fought every time. We had a
tough, tough year, but we never quit. We stuck together. We are really like
brothers right now. If you see the locker room, you can tell that we are
really brothers.  
  
It's a special group, really a special group. We had a tough year. But as I
said, we fought. We stayed together, and that's the beautiful part of it.  
  
That's just a beautiful brotherhood right there; that's the family.  
  
Q. Coach, you had a pretty big roster turnover at the end of last year,
and you talked about establishing a new culture. With this group, do you feel
like the culture has been established to the point that you feel that roster
continuity is important heading into next year?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Yeah, absolutely. I think that there's -- we have guys -- I
love coaching this team every day, and we have guys that work and guys that
put in the time and got better. It would have been very easy to -- for this
team to fold it up and not compete and yet, as each one of those guys said,
they stayed together.  
  
They're close friends. Some of them are -- maybe didn't have the years that
they came in expecting to have, but that's part of the process. And yet the
character piece is in place, and the future is very, very bright.  
  
You throw Andres Feliz in here, who had a sensational year, a junior college
transfer, and we saw glimpses of Tevi and Alan Griffin, those guys are going
to be good players. Like I said, the best thing about now is we get an off-
season.  
  
Q. I know the stories of a season are told not on paper, but as you look
at the actual final record, are you taken aback by it based on what you
expected going in, and can there be in this case a drastic change from one
year to the very next?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Oh, I don't think there's any doubt. I'm not concerned about
the record. The record -- everybody wants to win. For us, this was -- this in
essence -- it was year two of my contract, it was year one. I mean, we were
trying to establish -- we got through the first year, and then this year was
about establishing an identity and a culture, and that's the way I've
approached it.  
  
Coincidentally, we had the toughest schedule in the Big Ten. We had the second
toughest schedule in the country, with a team that, truth be told, wasn't
ready for that. And yet it's -- we fought, we'll grow. You have to go through
the process to become great. And part of that is the work, part of that is the
struggle. It's the grind. We've been through all of that.  
  
Next year is a new year. You keep adding the right pieces, you've got your
culture established now. The little things, going to class and the work we put
in the weight room and being on time and all the little pieces and little
things, those things are in place now. Now we can continue to grow as a
basketball program.  
  
I've said it many times; I don't want good teams. I want a great program, and
there's a big difference. Illinois is one of the top 10 programs in the
country, and we're well on our way to making those strides to get there.  
  
Q. Do you feel like the five fouls in the first minute and a half of the
second period set the tone for rest of the half?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Didn't help. Didn't help.  
  
Q. Did you feel at all that playing last night bothered you guys at all
in the second half, the legs or anything like that?  
BRAD UNDERWOOD: Not at all. Not at all. We go hard every day in practice. Our
guys are in really good shape, and I thought -- if anything I thought it could
be an advantage. But there's no -- there's nothing to that. I think that was
just Iowa being a better basketball team tonight and causing us some problems
that we couldn't overcome.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Steve Pikiell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25225)

  
_Chicago_  
  
Nebraska - 68, Rutgers - 61.  
  
COACH PIKIELL: Listen, you know, Nebraska played really well, and we picked a
bad day. It was the most turnovers we've had, and I know it's the most fouls
we've had in a game, which isn't a good combination. But I want to give
Nebraska credit. They were awesome. We talked about it, we watched a lot of
film how to stop them, and we certainly couldn't defend the free-throw line.
Did they go 22 times there? So obviously we didn't do a good job with them.
But I want to thank the Rutgers people that came out. This has been a season
of tremendous strides, and I'm proud of that. We saw four freshmen on the
floor. We only have one senior. I want to thank Shaq for being an awesome --
Shaq Doorson for an awesome captain, leader, kid for the last few years. He's
a part of raising this program, and I really appreciate all his efforts for
the last few. But Nebraska was better today, and congratulations to them.  
  
Q. What do you think was the difference in that 15-0 run late in the
game?  
COACH PIKIELL: The whole game like we just couldn't get in the groove. Again,
awful combination, and a little bit of everybody with turnovers. I can't
explain. They don't do a lot of things to make you turn the ball over either.
They don't blitz, they don't trap. But picked the wrong day to have 22. I
think that's our season high, and I think 25 fouls is definitely our season
high. So that's not a good combination when you're playing 40 minutes to keep
your season going. I think those were the keys, obviously, in the game. Palmer
has 30-something points, and that was a key for us hold him to his average,
which is a terrific average. But if we could have done that it would have been
a little different maybe.  
  
Q. (Inaudible) the slow start?  
COACH PIKIELL: I thought we were just grinding it. They weren't scoring
either. So we just kind of grinded it. But we had a lot of turnovers. The
turnovers really hurt us on the offensive end, it helped them get some easy
baskets. Turnovers, and we've done a decent job especially recently of not
turning the ball over. We were a turnover team early in the year. Today it was
a little out of the ordinary. I'm very surprised at that number. But the
turnovers never let us get into any kind of flow offensively, and everybody
was in foul trouble. Constant substitutions.  
  
Q. I know it's a little early, but as you reflect on the season, seven
Big Ten wins, 10th place in the Big Ten. What do you take away from the season
overall?  
COACH PIKIELL: Well, I will tell you, I'm proud of this group. We had six
players out of my 11 that had never played a minute in the Big Ten. This is
the best year of the league, by far, from 1 to 14. You know, seven wins --
took us three years to get seven wins. We got it this year. We moved up.
Everyone picked us last. We're tied for 10th. Won some great road games. Our
fans are unbelievable. We sold the place out. We're building a new practice
facility which will be done soon. A lot of good things. I'm really excited
about players sitting out, Jacob Young, and Paul, I think he's the finest
passer in the country, we're going to add him to the roster. We're going to
miss Shaq Doorson, but everybody else is back. Great athletic director, the
school is great, I love it. Better days ahead. This was just a step. When I
took the job I knew it wasn't going to be easy. It's the best league. This
year, certainly in my three years, by far the best league that I've played in,
and it's been really good the previous two. So to make the strides that we've
made, I feel good about that. Doesn't help me today, but when we look back on
it, a lot of good things were accomplished. I'm proud of our guys, and our
young guys grew up a lot. We got a lot of minutes for a lot of players: Caleb
McConnell, and Myles Johnson tonight with the double-double, you know, Montez,
Ron Harper with some unbelievable rookie of the week performances. And Geo is
a sophomore, Peter Kiss is a sophomore. Those guys are young, you know. Geno
Omoruyi gave us everything every night. Played on his knee. So we had a lot of
good things happen. It's another step, and I'm really excited about next year.  
  
Q. At the end of the week, did Ron say anything about playing on the
court where his dad accomplished so much?  
COACH PIKIELL: He didn't. I know he was excited to come here. I think all of
our young guys were playing on this court. None of them have, you know, come
here to Chicago, so I think they were all excited to play here. I really
appreciate it, thank you, guys.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Tim Miles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18102)

  
_Chicago_  
  
Nebraska - 68, Rutgers - 61  
  
COACH MILES: I've got a lot of respect for Steve Pikiell and Rutgers. I think
he's done an excellent job building them into a formidable team in the Big
Ten, and this league is as strong as any in the country. We were fortunate
today to come out and ride a hot hand, and get some defensive stops and get
the win.  
  
Q. Do you have an injury report on yourself after that fall?  
COACH MILES: I'm fine. You know, I've just -- the wires they jumped up and got
me. I thought I was a better athlete than that. But I'm old, I'm old.  
  
Q. Can you just describe what happened? It wasn't pretty, but...  
COACH MILES: For anybody that doesn't know, I fell down waving at the crowd,
running down the hallway when I was leaving. I think it got caught on TV
according to everybody that's rubbing it in on me. So, yeah. I would say
that's a lot of exhilaration, but, yeah, just enough clumsiness to keep things
interesting.  
  
Q. You guys were down I think 46-51 in the second half, and you go on a
15-0 run. What changed and what did you tell your guys that was different?  
COACH MILES: I thought that we were soft coming out the second half in terms
of they didn't have an offensive rebound in the first half, and they came out
and got two the first two possessions, scored five points. We missed an inside
shot that we were going fading away. So we took a long time out. James, I
thought, played pretty strong after that. But they were rolling pretty good.
Then we just got defensive stops. I think Johnny got a couple steals, Roby got
a couple blocks. They didn't get any second shots. Palmer hits the three. Roby
gets four free throws. We get a couple things. Glynn makes a play. And now all
of a sudden you're feeling like you have a little rhythm.  
  
But it all really started with this team; I thought we were rock solid
defensively the whole night.  
  
Q. Johnny played a lot and he seemed pretty valuable. Is it surprising
to you at all that he's been as productive as he's been when he's played?  
COACH MILES: I hope he makes me look as dumb as he can. It's so cool to see
him out there. The guys believe in him. Nobody is judging or saying, oh, how
come we're playing whoever, whether it be Thor, Johnny, Brady, anybody. So if
we have to change the game plan a little bit when one of those guys is in
there, nobody blinks. Johnny has done so well just playing without any fear,
just fearlessness. What did he have, four steals? And knocked down one of
those foul shots. I think that he's one of those guys that he comes in and he
makes us better, and he does as good a job as he can. He was staying in front
of guys, made a couple errors here and there, but nothing nobody else had made
all night. So I'm very, very proud of Johnny Trueblood.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of speculation about what might have happened at
the end of the season. How do you tune that out? And how do you get the guys
to tune that out?  
COACH MILES: I just told the guys, you know, this is a big-boy business, and
whatever will be will be. I want to be the coach of Nebraska. I love Nebraska.
The decision is out of my hands. So we just to control what we can control. I
told the guys, you can control if you're in stance. If you're ready. How hard
you're playing. I can control how well I coach and how well I prepare. We just
go about our game plan.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE MEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Chris Collins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26016)

  
_Madison Square Garden - New York, New York_  
  
Illinois - 74, Northwestern - 69  
  
COACH COLLINS: Appreciate you guys braving it late night, so I thought it was
a great college basketball game tonight. I really did. I thought you had two
teams that played incredibly hard. Kind of went back and forth punch for
punch. You know, they answered all our runs. We kind of answered theirs.  
  
So it was a really well-played game. Guys playing really hard. That's what I
love. I love when you see two teams playing that hard. It becomes a
possession-by-possession game. Obviously in the overtime their guard's ability
to get in the lane and break us down and either score or find shooters. I
think Frazier hit a three, and I think Ayo hit a big one for six points.  
  
Overall, though, I thought our defense was good. The three times we played
them in regulation I thought that was the best we defended them. Then, you
know, just in overtime they made a couple more plays than we did.  
  
Really proud of my team. To not have one of our leaders Vic Law out there and
one of our main ball handlers and playmakers against their pressure for those
other guys to really step up. I thought Miller Kopp was really good. I thought
A.J. Turner, that was his best game of the year. You know what you're going to
get from Pardon, and it was good to see Falzon hit a couple threes there in
overtime.  
  
Overall, the record isn't where we wanted it to be. There is no mistaking any
of that. We're going to get to work.  
  
I'm proud of my seniors. I've talked about their legacy many of times with
Pardon and Law and what those guys meant for our program. They did a lot of
things that people thought, quite frankly, could never be done at
Northwestern.  
  
To go to an NCAA Tournament, to play on semifinal Saturday in a Big Ten
tournament, to win double-figure Big Ten games. To win a game in the NCAA
Tournament, you know, there's a lot of firsts that that group did that will
never be taken away from them.  
  
That's what I told them. Their legacy is not about what happened this year.
It's about the overall body of work and what those guys have meant to our
program and their belief in us when there wasn't a whole lot to believe in. We
really didn't have the facilities. We didn't have the tradition. We didn't
have the history. You know, I was just trying to sell a vision and a dream of
what I thought Northwestern basketball could be.  
  
Now we face ourselves in a position where we've got to build it again, and I'm
committed to doing that. It's going to take a lot of work. We've got to get
better. I've got to be better. We've all got to get better. We've got to get
it back to where we know we can get it. It's something that I'm anxious to do
once we can let the dust settle and rest a little bit.  
  
Anyway, I'll open for questions about the game.  
  
Q. Giorgi went off early on, just what makes him such a difficult cover?
Were you surprised?  
COACH COLLINS: No, I wasn't surprised. I thought he was doing a good job. He
got deep post position. A couple of his early buckets were on break downs on
pick-and-rolls, but he really got into a rhythm in the post. I think what
makes him is his quickness and agility in the post. You look at him, and he's
a big, strong guy, but his foot work, he makes quick moves. His ability to
pivot.  
  
You think you've got him under control, and he can kind of slither around you
and find angles. You know, he's a terrific player, terrific player. He's
gotten better throughout the course of this whole season.  
  
Certainly it was a handful for us. Being down another guard, you know, and the
last time we played these guys a week ago, we really got hurt by Feliz,
Frazier, and Ayo, and their ability to get out in transition, and push the
ball and drive the ball, we really had to iron that up. I thought most of the
game we did a good job. Now, Trent still got his points, and I thought late in
the game as we got tired it was a factor.  
  
But they went to a steady dose of going to Giorgi. Really in the first half,
his 16 points, I thought if you took his 16 out I thought we were doing a
great job on the other guys. That's why he's a really good player and he's got
a great future.  
  
Q. You mentioned A.J. had one of the best games of the season. Could you
talk about his overall performance in this game, and what you expect next
season?  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah, I think he showed the talent that he possesses. He's a
guy that can handle the ball, he can shoot the ball. For a lot of our guys
this year I felt badly because so many of our guys had to take on roles that
really weren't in their comfort zone.  
  
We very undermanned at the guard position this year because of injury and off-
the-court stuff. So we had to now put guys who are wings and forwards at
guard, and that's not easy to do when you've never done that your whole life.
All of a sudden you're going to do that in the Big Ten. That's not easy.  
  
So for guys like Vic Law, Anthony Gaines, and A.J. Turner especially that have
been wings and forwards their whole life, I really appreciate their ability to
say, you know what, we have to help in these other areas.  
  
I hope that for the guys returning, especially Gaines and Turner, that it can
be a really growing experience for their games. Having to handle the ball as
much as they did and make plays, you know, it forces you to get better with
your decision making.  
  
But A.J.'s going to be a key guy for us coming back. We have a big senior
class. We're losing a lot of guys, and it's going to be kind of a new era of
guys that's going to be the next wave of our program, and he's going to be a
key guy as a senior next year to kind of lead the way.  
  
Q. How did the mood in the locker room today compare to previous years,
and what do the next few days look like for you guys?  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah, it was emotional, which I'm glad it was emotional. There
was a lot of crying in there. I say it all the time like at the end of the day
only one team is going to be crying tears of joy. There's going to be one Big
Ten champion, and then there's going to be one NCAA champion. Everybody else
at some point is going to have a locker room like we had tonight.  
  
The thing I love about being a coach is when you go into those locker rooms
and you see the emotion pour out, you know how much the guys care. If they
didn't care, they wouldn't be emotional. To see them share that emotion with
each other, you know, and cry those tears, that's when you know that you have
the right kind of guys in terms of character.  
  
For us, I mean, obviously now we have to get to work. I mean, like where we
are right now is not acceptable for where I want to be as a program. It's not
the players' fault. I take full responsibility. But if you look at many
programs -- I mean, I had a situation when I was at Duke in 1994. I played for
the National Championship as a sophomore. In 1995 as a junior we went 2-14 in
the ACC and came in last.  
  
So things like that happen sometimes. If you look at every program, every
single program they have times when, you know what, there are peaks and
valleys. I talked about it the other day with Purdue. My first year in the
league, Purdue was in last. Now you look at what they've done the last four
years, what they've built and what they've gotten back to is pretty damn good.
I think a lot of programs can say those same things.  
  
I don't like where we're at right now, and it's not about the guys, but we're
going to get to work. We're going to get to work, and we're going to get
Northwestern guys wearing those uniforms, and we've done it before, and we're
going to do it again. I promise you that. We're going to do it again.  
  
Hopefully it will be better than it was before. That's the way I feel.  
  
Q. Coach, how much did not having Law hurt tonight?  
COACH COLLINS: It hurt. It hurt especially against this team. The way they get
after you, their quickness. I thought it really showed up in the overtime
because they really spread the floor. Everybody was a little tired. I had one
less defender out there than I needed, and that's not knocking the guys that
we had on the floor. But normally if I have Turner, Gaines and Law, those
three guys can match-up with Frazier, Ayo, and Feliz, so just being down --
forget about what he does as a scorer and all those things.  
  
I thought we missed him defensively, and the ability to keep the ball in
front, especially late in the game in overtime when the guards kind of took
over.  
  
Q. You mentioned before a lot of guys playing out of position this
season. How much was not having a pure point guard on the roster, how much
contributes to the offensive struggles, and what is the outlook for next year
looking forward to that situation?  
COACH COLLINS: Yeah, we need to get guards on the roster. I mean, there's no
question. It's certainly, I mean, I said it before, we have a really good
football team. If a week before, two weeks before school you lose someone you
thought was going to be your starter and two weeks into training camp your
back-up blows his knee out, and now your running back has to play quarterback,
and your wide receiver has to play running back, and your tight end has to
play wide receiver, you get what I'm saying. That's what we had to do all
year. So that's what we had.  
  
Our guys did it admirably. They never complained. Guys did things they'd never
done in their whole life in terms of their positions, and I appreciate what
they did. But you cannot win in this league and at this level without elite
guard play. That is certainly something that we have to address, and we have
to continue to add to our roster at that position.

COACH UNDERWOOD: Really, really proud of our team tonight. There were a lot of
things that didn't go particularly well throughout the course of the ballgame
and yet we kept just hanging in.  
  
Northwestern was terrific. Chris should be nothing but extremely proud of his
guys. Law's out, and to rally, which is something that usually happens. You
lose a guy and everybody steps up, and rallies and they did that. They're to
be commended, because they fought and competed.  
  
The game was probably about as ugly a first half as you're ever going to see,
and yet it was Giorgi was tremendous. We felt like he got really good looks in
the last game that he played, they just didn't go down. We want to go back at
him. Obviously 12 of 15 is something we tried to do tonight.  
  
Then Trent, I'm really proud of him. His four game, no turnovers, 40-plus
minutes, and then obviously a couple of big shots down the stretch.  
  
But to miss the lay-up at the end and then have them open the overtime with
the three probably is the thing that makes me the happiest. It would have been
very, very easy to just roll over and lay down, and we just kept hanging in
there. We kept running really good offense. Got the ball where it was. We
didn't have Giorgi, and trying to hit the three. Ayo hits the three, and
really proud of our guys for just being tough enough to handle that.  
  
Q. Giorgi, after having such a big game, what was it like watching from
the sidelines in overtime? What did you see from your guys and what were you
doing?  
GIORGI BEZHANISHVILI: I was just really excited. I couldn't really put it in
words. I was so excited. At the same time I was so confident with any guys
because I knew they would leave all out there. We've been through a really
tough year, and I know these guys are tough, and I know they would give
everything out there on the floor. I was just so confident in them. I really
felt like we were going to win the game, and we did. It was just a great
feeling.  
  
Q. Trent, this is your second go through of the Big Ten tournament. Just
speak a little bit about the difference in the field in the locker room
between last year's team and this year's team?  
TRENT FRAZIER: Coming into this game, you know, these guys throughout the
season we've been fighting a lot. We've been through a lot of adversity. I was
very confident we were going to come out here tonight and play as hard as we
can and try to move to the next round.  
  
I can't really compare the last year. This is a way different team. Like I
said, these guys are unbelievable. We come to practice every day ready to
compete and get after it, get after each other, and we've been successful
throughout parts of the season. We're hoping, you know, to continue to move up
in the round.  
  
Q. It took you a little while to get going tonight. What did you have to
do out there? What did you see in the second half down the stretch that
allowed you to get going?  
TRENT FRAZIER: I kind of let the game come to me. I didn't want to force any
shots. Just play my game, do what I do. Like I said, the team, they trust me
down the stretch to make a play for myself and my teammates. That's what I
did. These younger guys, they're incredible.  
  
I think the biggest thing for us tonight is when Giorgi fouled out, we didn't
let that bother us. We had a lot of confidence. Every time coach was asking
us, you know, where the dogs at, where the dogs at, you know. We took that
personally, huddled each other up, and we locked in on defense, and we got
stops.  
  
Q. Giorgi, what were your emotions in overtime watching that?  
GIORGI BEZHANISHVILI: I was just excited for my teammates to be out there, you
know, and I saw the look in their faces in the timeout. I was like, yeah, I'm
not worried. We're going to win this game. I was so confident in my teammates
because I saw the look. Once you see that look in the faces of the players,
you know they're doing their thing out there. Trent hits one three, Ayo hits a
three, we get the stops. It was a great feeling.  
  
Q. Giorgi, you mentioned when you saw that look, was there a point in
the overtime when you felt pretty confident that you were going to win this
game?  
GIORGI BEZHANISHVILI: Right after the buzzer, the last buzzer we felt
confident. Right after that buzzer. I just saw that look, you know, when the
guys sat down, you know, coach was drawing something up, and I looked at the
guys and I was like, yeah, that's it.  
  
Q. Coming off a game where you only took two shots at Penn State, and
maybe you weren't playing your best basketball, did you feel like you needed
to step up tonight? What was kind of key to you rising up?  
TRENT FRAZIER: I don't determine shots in the game. Whoever got it going,
that's who we're going to get the ball to. Fortunately that was me tonight. My
teammates did an unbelievable job of finding me and trusting me to make big
shots down the stretch. Shots, you know, it doesn't matter how many shots I
take. I'm going to play what coach wants us to do, run the offense, and just
be a good point guard out there. And I was making some shots tonight, and I
got it going. So I continued to be aggressive and I was successful.  
  
Q. Chris mentioned in the postgame that the overtime is when you felt
that Vic Law's absence was maybe felt the most, because you look down a wing
defender. Obviously, Giorgi had a great game, but was that match-up something
that would have helped you in overtime if you had those guards and they played
really well?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Well, I think it was a factor. I thought the one thing that
Vic continued and has done throughout his career is not just be a good
offensive player. He's been a guy that's been very, very good defensively. The
more film I've watched of them, the more impressed I've become with Gaines.
He's an elite defender. You know, Turner has size, and Kopp has size. They did
a really good job especially on Ayo tonight, and challenging him on ball
screens.  
  
I thought down the stretch it was maybe that, but I also think that, you know,
the floor kind of opened up a little bit without Giorgi in there, and we made
some awfully nice plays. Aaron made a nice drive, and we made nice passes to
wide-open shooters.  
  
Q. Just curious about the "where the dogs at?" question. Is that
something you asked throughout the year? Is it a theme? I get what it means,
but I'm just wondering.  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Yeah, it's a competitive phrase that I like to use, and I've
got a couple others I can't repeat. But you know, it's a way to challenge
these guys. It's something that they can rally about it in a moment. In the
timeout of the game, you know, it's a focus point of knowing what I'm thinking
about, not just the Xs and Os.  
  
Q. Can you compare Giorgi before to Giorgi now?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Probably don't have enough time, but, yeah, here's a guy that
to go do that on this stage in this moment, he's light years. He's come so
far. (Inaudible). Ten days ago, two weeks ago, whenever we played them, Pardon
really had his number. He's taken that challenge himself.  
  
Pardon's an elite defender, and he got to his spots. He got a little
frustrated early because he got knocked off his spots a couple times, but we
did a great job getting him the ball. His maturity has changed the most from
day one.  
  
Q. What's it mean for your team not to -- to lose five or six, and lose
the opening round, to survive and advance?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: It's the next round. We've got to move on. I think there will
probably be some positives in that at some point. Right now I've been sitting
in the back. Coming out here, working on Iowa and all their stuff. It's not
the time to reflect on that.  
  
I think our opponents had some of that. I didn't think we played great
tonight. I thought we played actually better in a game or two when they got
beat. But, yeah, it's important to win. There is no doubt about that. These
guys need to feel what this is all about. You only need a little tidal wave or
a ripple to create a tidal wave, so we'll see.  
  
Q. Coach, you expanded your rotation a lot in the first half. I'm not
sure you envisioned overtime necessarily. But do you think when it got to
overtime, the minutes you conserved in the first half made a difference in the
overtime?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: I hope so. I thought that was part of our deal, the way we
play, we need to play multiple bodies, and we subbed out one time, which I
don't usually do, but that was a long four-minute segment, and I thought our
bench guys did a great job.  
  
So, other than Trent, which Trent is the energizer bunny. He never gets tired.
He can go. But you know, for the most part those guys' minutes are pretty much
under control.  
  
Q. How did Ayo maybe respond in the huddle after missing the lay-up in
regulation, and ten rebounds for him? How big was he on that?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Yeah, he just -- I'm running out of superlatives and
adjectives and everything else to say about him and his game: That was a smile
and a dap, he goes, "I got you, coach." He's a kids that been in those
moments. He's made them. Made what I thought was a play we figured they would
switch, and we busted the switch with him, and he got wide open. Iowa gave him
an unbelievable pass. We were bringing Trent off for a little jumpshot, and
just happened.  
  
Next time I'll run the same play or some sort of play to him just like that
again, and he'll convert it. We'll dap again and smile. It's part of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys kind of linked in the postseason a little bit, and
maybe didn't come on and finish the regular season as hot as you wanted to. It
was mentioned during that time that maybe the effort wasn't where it needed to
be or the focus, I should say rather, for a couple of those games. Just talk
about what was the focus this weekend and the mood in the locker room this
weekend?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Yeah, everybody starts zero and zero. You come to these
events, it's a different field. A 20-game season is a grind, it's hard, it's
travel. It just has a different monotony about it, maybe. Then you come in
here and you walk in this building and you see all of this and the excitement,
and it's just a different vibe. We tried talking about that a little bit. And
you get here, and it wasn't the prettiest first half. I thought the first half
we could have been a little better, but, again, I'm proud of where our guys
played, and on to the next round.  
  
Q. Coach, the way you guys came into this one, getting the result
tonight, do you think that is an advantage, even though you had planned short
rest? Just get being that win and getting that momentum back sort of?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: Well, about four years ago I would have said, no, it doesn't
matter at all because they had double byes. Now it doesn't matter. It's been
done before. I think UConn won five in a row. It doesn't matter. It's just
about the next.  
  
You take every game for its face value, and you don't look beyond. I won't
spend two seconds really tonight looking backwards. You don't have time, and
it's on to the next. It's really that simple for me.  
  
Q. What did you think of the play of A.J. Turner down the stretch? He
sort of took over for Vic Law in sort of the lead ball handler role?  
COACH UNDERWOOD: If you look at A.J.'s numbers the last five games, A.J. has
been playing really good. He's been shooting close to 40%. You see a different
confidence about him. That went just about as expected from our standpoint. We
knew he would be in the lineup. We knew he would be the guy that they would
look to go to.  
  
The start of the second half he was terrific, and, again, it was just about
making his stuff hard. I thought we did a little better job in the last four,
five minutes of the game in the overtime making it hard. But he's a terrific
player. I think he did everything that maybe Chris wanted him to do, which was
step up for a fellow teammate.

## December 21, 2019

### [Jeremiah Francis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38404)

### [Garrison Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37064)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
North Carolina - 74, UCLA - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
GARRISON BROOKS (joking, on behalf of Roy Williams): It was a tough fought
victory. We had a really tough stretch in there when B-Rob missed some free
throws, Garrison missed some free throws. And I was getting on those guys over
break to at least do cardio and really shoot free throws and focus. Those guys
are mentally tough, especially down the conference stretch.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: I would rather be Garrison Brooks. I'm starting to see -- I'm
sorry that Anthony can't be in there, but seriously he's got the quickest
flight trying to get out, so I'll brag on him as well. I told the guys all
season long, if you want to play more, play better. If you want to play more,
be tougher. And I think Anthony gave us some of that toughness. And I'm not
saying he's a great shooter, but he willed a couple of those shots in today.
He got a couple of steals and goes down and makes some baskets, so I think he
was probably the biggest story in the game for us. We came out, didn't play
well early and right before the half, had a nice little run and then came out
in the second half and just got dumb again. And, yes, Garrison Brooks missed
two free throws in that stretch, but they made the first missed three. Coach
Williams said he missed three, I thought he just missed two.  
  
But we weathered that storm and then we made a little run and then after that
we got the game where it should have been in pretty good shape. And B Rob made
a terrible turnover on the break, and then Jeremiah, I can't even describe
what the crap he tried to do with that shot. But Garrison told me later that
he would tell me what his description was. But made enough free throws to win.
We didn't shoot them nearly as well as we like to. Jeremiah stepped up and
made several of them there. But five guys in double figures, Armando bounced
back from really struggling the last two games. He was 3-20 in the last three
-- or two games, excuse me. And he and Garrison both made big baskets for us
when it was really a tight game and it helped us open up the lead.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're also joined now by Jeremiah Francis. So let's take
questions for the student-athletes first, please.  
  
Q. Garrison, what kind of energy and toughness does Anthony give you
guys? And also Jeremiah with the way he 's played the last couple games. That
kind of makes you guys a little bit different than maybe you were before you
started to get a lot of minutes?  
GARRISON BROOKS: He's a tough guy. He works extremely hard. One of the hardest
workers I've ever seen in the weight room myself. But he just, he has like a
Kenny Williams affect. Just a really tough on defense, going to do everything
Coach says and just gets the job done no matter what.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, congratulations. When you first got to UNC what was your
expectation for how this year was going to go? And how has it sort of being
reshaped or if it 's following the plan game by game, sort of?  
JEREMIAH FRANCIS: I came to UNC a little bit out of shape so I just wanted to
get myself back into playing shape with our strength and conditioning coach.
I've been working hard in the weight room just trying to get my quads stronger
and just listening to Coach and just, it's been a blessing.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
JEREMIAH FRANCIS: No, I haven't. Just being ready whenever my name is called
and just doing my job to the best of my ability.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, Anthony also had some knee injuries that kept him sidelined
this off-season. Just with you guys working out together and rehabbing
together, what kind of bond did that allow to you kind of form? And how did
that help with the toughness you guys have been showing?  
JEREMIAH FRANCIS: Anthony's my roommate, so I talk to him every day. And just
waking up at 6:30 and we're always in the weight room together and everything
makes a bond. We just talk and talk, and so we just been working out together
and we have a good bond.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: I would intersect something here, and then you can go back to
the players. I'm in the weight room Monday Wednesday -- I know it doesn't look
like it, but I'm in the weight room Monday, Wednesday, and Friday morning and
these guys were in there when I got there. Tyler Hansbrough has always been
the motto of guys working extremely hard to make their bodies as tight as it
can be. What Jeremiah Francis and Anthony Harris have done since they came to
school in June for -- end of June for second session, summer school, is Tyler
Hansbrough-like level. Jonas is so pleased. He pushed them. Doug pushed them.
I would go to the weight room just to try to work out, myself. But I would
find myself watching all the things these guys did. As freshmen coming in and
putting in that work it was admirable and it was a, high high quality every
single day. They didn't balk at anything. And Doug and Jonas put them through
it, and I think what you're seeing now is rewards for what they did busting
their butt.  
  
Q. What was -- UCLA, early in the second half, obviously, was doing some
pressure in the back court. What was it about that that give you guys trouble?
And then how were you able to get around that the rest of the game?  
GARRISON BROOKS: I think that it took us by surprise, especially on the court
at the moment. But we just had to get settled down and get organized and just
do what we practice every day and it eventually worked out for us.  
  
Q. Garrison, had you seen this potential early on from Jeremiah and
Anthony, and if you had, how anxious were you for them to come back?  
GARRISON BROOKS: I saw Jeremiah play a long time ago. Before he committed, he
came on a visit. I knew he was really talented and really could play, really
could score the ball. I was hoping he would be able to play this year, but
before that I was hoping he would come here to play. And he was given the
opportunity tonight and he's making the best of it. And Anthony is a real
surprise for me. I've never seen him play, never. I heard about him a little
bit, but I didn't know he could be this special right now.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: You guys understand they only started practicing two weeks ago.
I mean, seriously. They started doing full practices two weeks ago. Not that
he's a bad evaluator of talent, but none of us had any idea.  
  
GARRISON BROOKS: But it's pretty -- I was pretty excited to get those guys
back out there, especially I can see how excited Jeremiah and Anthony were in
practice because they worked so hard and then they were just energetic all the
time, ready to play, doing whatever Coach told them to do full speed. And I
think that, that right there will help our team so much. We really needed
that.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, can you sort of walk us through some of what -- we hear
about all this hard work. Can you walk us through what some of that looks
like? Like, what is it exactly that you 're doing to try to get your body back
into shape.  
ROY WILLIAMS: Something that none of you guys could do.  
  
JEREMIAH FRANCIS: Just trying to get my quads back to my right body, just
trying to match everything to my right side. I been through a lot of stuff
with my left leg, so just trying to get everything to match and everything
symmetry. And so it's just matching everything.  
  
Q. Garrison, how does this win feel? Is it a relief? Is it excitement?
How does this win kind of feel to you guys?  
GARRISON BROOKS: No, it's very exciting, trust me. It was a tough stretch for
us, and we didn't really plan on this at all, just losing four straight games.
But it's a sigh of relief. We got ACC play coming up, so we know that's going
to be even tougher and we got to be prepared for that also. But it's a good
sign that we got back on the right track.  
  
Q. Jeremiah, do you feel the pressure of kind of filling in for Cole and
trying to carry the team right now?  
JEREMIAH FRANCIS: Well, I wouldn't call it pressure. It's just next man up.
That's what I've always been taught, just next man up, and I'm going to do my
job to the best of my ability.  
  
Q. Garrison, Lewis, like, what he just asked, last Sunday after Wofford,
that 's about as disappointed as I've seen you, other than after an NCAA
tournament losses. How different is the emotion now, or do you allow yourself
to kind of enjoy this, other than just the building process?  
GARRISON BROOKS: The good part is I get to go home, so I'm going to enjoy that
a little bit more. But normally there's a timetable for enjoying the win. It's
24 hours and you move on to the next game. But the Wofford loss was really
disappointing. I tried not to get so down on our team and down on myself,
especially by losing because that's, I think that's all that matters at the
end of the day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let the players get back to their team and take questions
for Coach.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: It's been frustrating, to say the least. At the start of the
season we think that Sterling and Cole were going to be two guys in our top
six, and they're not even here today, much less hurt, they're not even here.
So that part has been frustrating, but those are also excuses because North
Carolina still plays. And it's funny because it's a really young team. For a
good portion of the second half we had Armando, Anthony, and Jeremiah in the
game. So we've got three freshmen, with B-Rob and Garrison. And over on the
sideline, I had Luke and Kenny. For awhile, I had Sam Perkins, David Noel. We
would have been a lot better with those guys in the game.  
  
But it's a shame because Garrison said it surprised on him. We worked on press
offense yesterday. Now, it may have looked like it surprised -- it didn't
surprise us here. It's just that we didn't go a good job of executing what we
do. Very few teams in the past have pressed us. I think now every team in
America that we play will press the crap out of us. But the older guys are the
ones that made the mistake. Don't throw the ball in, and then I'm yelling at
Leaky to go up, go up, and he goes all the way up, and he's in the corner and
he gets trapped and we turn it over.  
  
So, yes, it may have surprised Garrison, but just 24 hours ago we did work on
press offense. But they needed to get something out of their defense, and they
did. But I think they made their first three or four shots in the second half
and we missed the first five, I think.  
  
Q. Early in the second half you took two timeouts during that rough
start. What was your message to the team during that time?  
ROY WILLIAMS: It's not for public knowledge, but it wasn't very pleasant,
because I didn't think we were competing. I asked them if they wanted me to go
get their mama. I mean, come on guys, Jesus Christ, it's a basketball game,
compete your butt off and play. Nobody's going to be killed. I hope. If
anybody dies, it's probably going to be me. But you got to compete, and I
didn't think we were competing. And, again, we worked on press offense
yesterday, plus many times prior to that. And then we got them to miss one
time and they got an offensive rebound and scored anyway. I think that first
four or five possessions they scored every time. So it was all about
competing. But a lot of teams, most of the teams I've had, I never worry
because I think they can fight through these -- those kind of things. But at
that moment I couldn't stand not saying something to them.  
  
Q. Armando had three picks in the last two games and had the foul issues
the other night. How much of what we saw today is partly growing process for a
young guy, just having to play the minutes he is with responsibility he has
here?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, it's big because we need the inside guys to score. We're
trying to throw the ball to them. We need them to come through. And going 3-20
hurts you. It hurts your team. So he's been taking it very hard. I thought he
bounced back today. He did some -- he didn't play well. He had 15-12. That's
pretty doggone good and that's what I told him in the locker room. No, I
wasn't happy with your play, but you had 12-15. And went over and I kiss the
-- Anthony on top of the head, because he played today. Armando did some good
things to help us. We didn't shoot it a very good percentage from free-throw
line. Jeremiah stepped up and we made some when it was tough. But at the end
it was just to finish. But, no, it's hard for a freshman at North Carolina
because everybody expects you to win every game and you start feeling that
stress if you don't do it. And I tell them, just do the best you can do, just
do what I ask you to do and it will usually work.  
  
Just because Virginia wins the National Championship, I got to look at a
Virginia shirt in the back of the fricking room? Jesus Christ.  
  
Q. Roy, Mack Brown likes to tell us that the bench is the great
motivator. You dealt with a ton of injuries this year, you still have some
with Cole and Sterling. But with Jeremiah and Anthony coming back, able to
play, I know they played majority of the minutes in the second half, is that a
good thing for this team to have that kind of competition?  
ROY WILLIAMS: We'll find out. I pointed at three or four guys in the locker
room, and I said: Do you want to play? You didn't play much in the second
half. If you want to play, play better. Anthony didn't ask me one time about,
will am I going to get to play? Didn't ask me one question about playing time.
The only thing he did is when I gave him a chance, he played his butt off.
It's pretty simple. Head coaches have no favorites. Now, parents don't believe
that, but head coaches have no favorites. I'm going to play the guy that I
think helps me win. And there's some guys that have gotten to play in the past
that I didn't like what they did the in the first half, so it's pretty simple.
You if you want to play more, play better.  
  
Q. Sort of on that same note, how surprised are you that this early on,
I mean, you mentioned they only started playing two weeks ago, that Jeremiah
and Anthony are doing that? Coming into the season, what was sort of the
timetable you had in your head for that?  
ROY WILLIAMS: Well, I try to never decide who is going to play how many
minutes. I have never done that. But I was worried whether or not Jeremiah
would -- and, guys, did you read Steve Kershner's notes? You should. 1,000
days between the last basketball game that Jeremiah Francis played in until
the Virginia game. 1,000 days. So what do you think? Do you think I think he's
going to go out there and get 35 in the first game? We had no idea, we're
hoping. But every day in the weight room I saw him I got more encouraged,
every day in the weight room I saw Anthony's toughness. So really, I'm not
lying, it's been about two weeks is all it's been of full court practices. So
on one the hand I'm stunned, but on the other hand I don't really think about
those, just do your job. I've always thought the grass is greener where I was
standing, so do your job. And the next day, maybe you'll get something good
happen. Do your job that day and the next day something good things will
happen. But both those guys have been as impressive as they could possibly be
in the weight room.  
  
Q. Jeremiah talked about how appreciative he is that you took a chance
on him despite the two knee injuries. So what made you, what gave you
confidence, what made you take that chance?  
ROY WILLIAMS: It was an easy decision because I love him as a kid. He
committed to us as a sophomore and when you commit to me that's a total
commitment. And I do that to you. And I told his mom and dad, the first
surgery, second surgery, third, I can't remember how many he's had, that he's
still going to have a scholarship at North Carolina because he's, if you're in
my family at one point you'll always be there. So that was never even a
question. Never even a question. And again, I said that, you had no idea what
he could do, but think in terms of that. If you guys were to stop your job for
a thousand days, when you come back you would suck. You wouldn't know what a
computer was or what e-mail was and think how much things are going to change.
I'm serious. Think about how many things are going to change in a thousand
days. You take a thousand days off and you tell me you're going to be good?
Anybody else?  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you.  
  
ROY WILLIAMS: Happy holidays to everybody.

## December 21, 2019

  

### [Chris Holtmann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28581)

### [Kyle Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38408)

### [Kaleb Wesson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36358)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Ohio State - 71, Kentucky - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach and then take
questions for the student-athletes.  
  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Okay. Yeah, I thought it was a really good college basketball
game. Got the utmost respect for Coach Calipari, his team, that program. So,
obviously, to get a win in a somewhat neutral site is fun. But tremendous --
they're going to have a great year. John's teams always get better as the year
goes on. They're going to have a great year. Players win games like this. We
said that going into the game. Players win games like this and these guys and
others stepped up and made plays.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. You didn 't trail for the final 28 minutes. They kept cutting it to
three, cutting it to one. You guys always seemed to have an answer. What did
it take to answer every challenge they threw to you in the second half?  
KALEB WESSON: Poise possessions, but I feel like we just came out and we tried
to get the best shot on every possession. I feel like that helped us get the
win today.  
  
KYLE YOUNG: That was one thing we preached on in the huddles. We knew it was
going to get loud at times. So when that happened we knew we had to stay
within each other, trust each other, trust our brothers, and we were able to
do that.  
  
Q. In the last game when Nate Sestina was scoreless, and he broke his
wrist, five threes today. I 'm wondering how much of a surprise -- how much of
an impact did he make, do you think?  
KALEB WESSON: He made an impact coming off the bench, scoring 17 points. When
you have a guy like that on your team, that's good for your team, having a
boost like that off the bench.  
  
KYLE YOUNG: He's a great player. We've played him previously, so we knew what
his game was about. We knew he's a player who made big shots.  
  
Q. For both of you: You guys took several charges today and blocked, I
think, seven or eight shots. Just what do those type of defensive plays do
for, like, the team 's psyche?  
KYLE YOUNG: It's huge. Being in the right position at the right time, we knew
we had to be in gaps in order to make that play and that's a huge swing for
us. It's energy, gets us going. When guys give up their body for the team like
that, we can only be happy, so it's good.  
  
KALEB WESSON: Like what he said. No, giving up your body for your team, that's
something we try to preach because we're a brotherhood, try to play every
possession.  
  
Q. You guys both talk about poise. What did you learn about D.J. Carton
tonight? He had the ball in his hands a lot, seemed to make the right play
more often than not in those last 10, 15 minutes.  
KYLE YOUNG: We know what kind of player D.J. is. We know what he can bring to
us. We know he was able to stay poised tonight, make some big plays for us
down the stretch and we're just happy to have him out there.  
  
Q. You guys have a couple of big wins already this season. To win this
game today here in Vegas on national television, what does it say about where
you guys are going into the holidays at 11-1 with some of the wins you have?  
KALEB WESSON: I feel like it just shows we started out good. There is still a
lot of season left, but I thought we started out pretty well. And our coach
prepared us at the beginning of the season and we continue, we're going to
continue to do that going forward.  
  
Q. Thinking of the Walker 3 there with 26 seconds to go. I 'm wondering
if there was a play that's sort of like, we're winning this game. It's a
possession-by-possession thing, but we're winning. Was it that play or some
other play that --  
KALEB WESSON: There was a lot of those plays out there tonight, regardless.
Like you said, Walk's 3, you got to shoot free throws at the end closing the
game, you got some of the charges we took, the blocks we had, some of the big
rebounds we pulled down. You can go to any play during the game, but we just,
we came out, we played hard today and came up with the win.  
  
Q. Kaleb, it looked like first play of the second half was drawn up for
you in the post. Was there a talk at halftime about getting you more touches
in the paint?  
KALEB WESSON: Not talking to me about getting more touches, but that was a
play we drew up. The coaches drew it up and my teammates found me in the right
spot and we just executed.  
  
Q. Both of you: Coach alluded that it was a semi-neutral game, but there
were a ton of Kentucky fans. After you guys won, you ran into the crowd and
gave high-fives to the Ohio State fans. Was that an impromptu thing?  
KALEB WESSON: No, we just try to show love to our fans for coming out to road
games. We understand it's hard to get out to road games, spending the money to
come watch us play. We appreciate that.  
  
Q. Kaleb, can you critique or grade Andre 's chase-down block there?  
KALEB WESSON: It was all right. (Laughing) It was cool. Nice to see. Everybody
said ooh aah. We had to go on to the next play. I was ready to go on to the
next play. Everybody was, like, you know.  
  
Q. Their big guys, Kentucky 's true, kind of true post players have been
inconsistent at best for a couple years now. Did you guys feel like that was
an area that maybe you could enforce your will on them a little bit. They
struggled to score inside today. It seemed like you guys were really bothering
them.  
KALEB WESSON: Getting paint touches was a big thing for us, whether it's post
play or driving or ball screens, anything. So we tried to stay to our game
plan and we executed pretty well today.  
  
Q. Kaleb, you 're sometimes someone who sort of wears your emotions on
your sleeve, and I just wondered, when you see D.J. has a game like he does,
and late in the game it just seemed like he was playing under control, yet at
the same time was also emotional and showing that. How -- what did you see
from him, because I know at times I've seen similar emotion from you?  
KALEB WESSON: We just, when D.J. comes out, he's a big-time player. We all are
big-time players. And for him to be able to, at a young age to be able to
control his emotions during big games like this, you're playing a blue blood
team, you know you're going to have a lot of hype too, so him coming out being
a young guy, showing that poise, being able to make plays, and then when he
gets emotional being able to calm down and still get on to the next play, it's
big.  
  
Q. I don 't want to exaggerate, but how much did this have like a NCAA
post-season feel to it? The punch, counterpunch?  
KALEB WESSON: Like you said, the counterpunches, teams going back and forth
for a 40-minute grind is what we try to talk about at the beginning of the
game. And I feel like we went out there with that mindset and that mentality
and came out with a win.  
  
Q. What will it mean to get Dwayne back in the pregame huddles and
things like that?  
KYLE YOUNG: It's huge. He's really important to us. You can tell when we're
missing somebody like that, a fantastic shooter like he is. But just to have
everybody back and we're all together as one, that's where we kind of do our
best.  
  
Q. We talked about turnovers this year and, obviously, the first half
that was an issue. What was the talk at halftime or in huddles about cutting
those down? And how were you guys able to do that in the second half?  
KALEB WESSON: We understood that they were a handsy team. Guys out there, you
got Ashton Hagans and they play good on this side of the ball. And so just
being able to stay solid, being able to take care of the ball, slow them down,
not trying to rush. That's what they try to do, pressure you, and then you get
out of what you're doing. So we tried to stay in what we were doing and just
stay poised during the possessions and it worked for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thanks guys. We'll let you get back to your team.
Take questions for Coach.  
  
Q. There were a lot of key plays there by a lot of your guys down the
stretch, but I 'm wondering the -- there was one, I think, it was a one-
possession or two-possession game, it looks like Richards was going to get a
layup and D.J. comes from the backside out of nowhere. When we talk about D.J.
learning and growing, I know everyone likes to see his handle and his drives
and stuff, but is that just as important, if not more important, his awareness
to make a play like that?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: It's just as important to me. That's for sure. It's just as
important -- he's learning. He's not there yet. Neither are any of our
freshmen. I don't think any freshmen across the country is there when it comes
to understanding all of the positioning that's required and, really, more than
anything, the attention to detail off the ball defensively. But he made a
critical play there. He's got strong hands, he's quick, he anticipates well,
and when he's alert off the ball defensively, he can really be effective.  
  
Q. You 've beat three Top-10 teams now. What is the, I don't know, the
trait or characteristic that sticks out to you, I mean, not necessarily like
the obvious thing, but just like from a coaching perspective that maybe not
everyone would notice in those three games?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I think we played fearless in those games. I think that's
important for your guys to play loose and fearless. Understand it's not going
to be perfect. You've got to have players that are gutsy enough to do that. I
thought we responded to the emotion of the game. You guys said that it had a
real, I don't know, it wasn't always great in terms of how either team played,
but had a real good feel to it in terms of the energy in the building. And I
thought we responded with good poise. But we just want our guys to be
aggressive and fearless in those moments, and they have.  
  
Q. You guys are, obviously, among the elite teams this season, but to
come to an event like this with blue bloods all over the place here and come
out looking as the best team, what does that mean for the program going
forward?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, I hesitate to talk about best team right now. Who knows.
There's a lot of season left to be played. John's track record for getting
players -- or getting teams to play their best in March is, obviously, well
documented. So that's all we're trying to do. We said after the Minnesota
game, we're trying to learn and move forward. Not one game defines us. Not one
of those three wins defines us. It's a long season. We're just trying to get
better. We'll see if we can do that. Our league's a bear. Our league is a
bear. So we got a great West Virginia team coming up after Christmas.  
  
Q. Right now Kentucky, obviously, has some warts. When you were
diagnosing and game planning, what warts stick out the most where they 've got
to make progress and try to fix this thing?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, I think they're going to be fine. I really do. I think,
obviously, the game the other night was, I thought that Utah played really
well. But they will shoot the ball well. I think Sestina gives them, obviously
-- he was difficult for us. We were -- at halftime, we had our entire halftime
was consumed with how are we going to guard his ball screens. And we talked
about a few different things from switching to full rotating. I think he's
important for them. They will shoot it better moving forward. I know that. And
I think they're going to be fine. But, obviously, that's what everybody points
to is shooting and offense. I really think that will come, for sure.  
  
Q. I think it was after the under 8 timeout you came out and played zone
a few possessions. What was the thought process there?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: We didn't really go into the game -- actually I didn't even
talk to our players about playing zone. We have it in our bag, but I did not
discuss it, I did not anticipate going and playing zone. But literally I'm
watching just one more game this morning and I just had that thought, like I
probably want to give it a look for a possession or two. And I didn't even
tell the staff, but it was just one of those kind of game-time decisions.  
  
Q. How much did this game sort of demand a competitive spirit from both
teams and how well do you think both teams responded?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I thought they had great competitive spirit. I really did. And
you expected that, right, after -- we certainly expected that they were going
to come out and I thought they really did. I just thought our guys certainly
did as well and they responded to every minute -- I think about the three in
the first half that Andre Wesson hit, where the momentum of the game could
have gotten away a little bit, I think maybe if they had went up a point or
two. There were a lot of those plays where we were able to stymie their
momentum just enough. But I thought the game had a really good a really good
life and competitiveness to it.  
  
Q. You talked about both fearlessness and poise and I feel like for a
freshman point guard that can sometimes probably be difficult to balance
those, but it seemed like D.J. only had one turnover and he also made some
clutch plays down in the second half. How did you see him just balancing those
and going through that mentally?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: I think he did a good job with it, he did a good job with the
emotion of the game. It helps, as I said, to have some older guys with him
because, as he should, he listens to Kaleb and C.J. and Kyle and Andre. I
think that's important when you have a freshman point guard out there that he
can take a lead from some of those guys. They level him out at times, but give
him credit, a lot of credit, he made obviously a lot of plays, his back door
playoff on the side out of bounds between him and Kaleb was a really good
instinctive play. So give him a lot of credit. The isolation play on Sestina
was a good play and I thought defensively he made some strides.  
  
Q. We talked to you a lot this week about your ties to the Lexington
area and I wonder what this felt like to you now that it 's over with,
preparing for this and getting a chance against your hometown team?  
CHRIS HOLTMANN: Yeah, you know, I just, I think it was really -- you're so
locked in and dialed in and preparing your team for -- obviously Kentucky's
Kentucky, so they're not just another opponent, they're a tremendous program,
tremendous coach, tremendous players and obviously I am from there. But it was
really about our players executing and that's what I tried to lose myself in.
And I'm sure my brother enjoyed it, mom and dad did, but, you know, we'll move
forward.  
  
Q. I know it 's a blue blood sport like we talked about, but setting up
your team to be No. 1 in country and things didn't quite go as planned. Coach
Cal said yesterday that he thought you were the No. 1 team in the country. So
do you have a message for the haters now that you maybe proved that true?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Coach Cal, I notice, has a way of saying things like that,
right, to edit into the game. He anointed us the No. 1 there going into this
game and I probably would have done the same, to be honest with you. But, no,
we're not putting any stock into the haters or No. 1, we got our fannies
drilled at Minnesota. But listen, it's a great win leading into Christmas, I
don't want to understate it, it's a great win leading into Christmas.

## December 21, 2019

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Jules Bernard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38284)

### [Jaime Jaquez Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38289)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
North Carolina - 74, UCLA - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's start with some questions for the players.  
  
Q. You guys had a nice run to start the second half with the back court
pressure. Can you talk about how that was effective and what you were able to
do with that?  
JULES BERNARD: We have long, athletic athletes and when we put our mind to it,
play with energy on the defensive end, I think that press really -- because we
have a lot of length, so when we start pressing, we're able to get steals,
deflections, and disrupt their offense going down. So that's, we try to get us
back into the game with our press.  
  
Q. The affect of the turnovers, particularly, in the first half, seemed
like that seemed to get in your way.  
JULES BERNARD: For us? Obviously, turnovers hurt us a lot, especially in a
game like this where every possession is important. We were down, I think, 13
at the half, and we had, I don't know, a good amount of turnovers, 14. So
those are just 14 possessions where we could get fouled and put two points on
the board. So every possession, especially in games like this, are extremely
important, and those turnovers definitely hurt us.  
  
Q. Jaime, is it nice to see Jules come back from injury and add what he
was able to add today?  
JAIME JAQUEZ JR: Yeah, definitely. He was a huge part of the game. He hit a
lot of threes, a lot of big shots, caught it in the passing lanes, got
rebounds, played really, really hard and we're glad to have him back and he
was a huge help during this game.  
  
Q. For either player, even though you lost, are there some positives
that you can take from this game, things to build on?  
JULES BERNARD: I think the press is definitely a positive. I think we're going
to have to do more of that during the season. We know, we see what our length
can do on the defensive end if we actually play hard and play aggressive on
defense, and actually try to get deflections. And we have been preaching
toughness all season, so we have to continue to try to build off certain
spurts, like, we had a great first eight or so minutes because -- to the
second half. So we just got to build off that and try to continue those
habits, especially on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Jules for you, are you tending to slow down little bit more on
offense? And are you finding more success doing that, do you think?  
JULES BERNARD: Yeah, I try to. Coach has told me that I have to utilize my
strengths, being under control, being a strong guard that I am. So if I'm out
of control, that takes a way my strengths. So he's trying to get me to play
slower and I'm trying to listen as much as I can and do what he tells me on
offense. So definitely slowing down is going to help me a lot as a player. And
it will help my team because it is less turnovers.  
  
Q. I realize the turnovers came in a lot different ways, but was there
any common theme? Maybe playing too fast as a team or anything that kind of
fed into so many turnovers?  
JAIME JAQUEZ JR: I think we weren't very under control when we got the ball.
We had some travel calls, some just losing the ball, just some fumbling, some
silly errors that we had. I think just slowing down was probably the biggest
thing that we could have done to stop those turnovers.  
  
Q. Jaime, when you look at the three-point shooting, did you like the
looks you were getting or just a matter of not making them, or do you think
you were taking some that, as a team that were ill advised?  
JAIME JAQUEZ JR: There was some that I thought I had good looks at, but others
maybe I could have drove the ball, draw the foul. That's probably what I
should have done during those threes that I missed. Getting the one-on-one in
the bonus.  
  
Q. I know you guys are kind of looking for building blocks along the way
here, but is it hard to kind of go through this process right now? Obviously,
you 're adding stuff that's going well and -- but losing games at the same
time. Is that process hard to go through right now for you guys?  
JULES BERNARD: We're competitors, every single person on this team, our
coaching staff. We're all competitors. So we're not going to dwell on the
losses. We're going to take what -- we're going to learn from them, and we're
going to take what we did well, and we're going to take what we need to work
on, and we're going to try to improve. But we know that there are ups and
downs, so we just have to continue to fight. And we're all competitors, so
we're going do keep competing this whole season and try to get next to where
we need to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let you get back to your team and take an
opening statement from Coach.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Well, we lost the game in the first half. In particular, the last
10 minutes of the first half. So we're just, we're not capable at the high
level against a team that's got, you know, they're out there playing either
fifth-year seniors or eight Top-60 recruits. We're just not capable of
sustaining playing smart, playing hard. We got beat to multiple loose balls.
And the turnovers give us absolutely no chance.  
  
But that said, in defense of my players, I thought that the officials took the
first half off. You watch that -- I mean, you watch the game, that -- and
North Carolina won, so don't misconstrue what I'm saying. The game was
officiated two separate, two separate halves. All you got to do is look at the
fouls per half.  
  
Q. I was a little confused as to that --  
MICK CRONIN: Well, we had 20 fouls in the second half. North Carolina had 13.
First half, six and seven. So in the first half, we're trying to drive the
ball and guys are being fouled the entire time. We got fouled on four or five
shots, we got fouled on multiple drives. And now, when that happens, you got
to be tough, you got to be able to deal with it, you got to play off two feet,
and we didn't and it killed us.  
  
And, in fact, the last couple games we haven't been able to score inside at
all in the half court, so we're searching. We're searching on the offense in
there for somebody to give us -- somebody we can put the ball in his hand, and
he can get a basket or a foul or he can get his teammate a shot.  
  
Q. Did Jules make a case to be, potentially, one of those guys today?  
MICK CRONIN: Yeah, it was great. I told you guys it was a shame when went down
because he's really, really been trying. He's been trying to listen to me in
practice and really slowing down, like he had mentioned, and using his
strength. He's always in the gym working on his game. He's one of our most
dedicated guys. So I absolutely. It really crushed -- it was crushing when he
went down the day before the Notre Dame game. And I was worried he was out for
a long time.  
  
Q. Then, I was confused as to what the call was on Jalen when they --  
MICK CRONIN: They called it on North Carolina, and then they changed it and
called it on us.  
  
Q. It was a review? They were reviewing it? That was what the delay --
or the timeout was for?  
MICK CRONIN: Yeah, the problem was the same foul happened in the first play of
the game against Notre Dame and Jalen turned and it was a foul on Jalen. Now,
North Carolina guy turns and elbows Jalen in the mouth and it's a foul on
Jalen. Just, as a coach, all you want is consistency. Again, that, you got to
find ways to win games. I won 89 games my last three years and these same guys
were all ref'ing. So you got to be tough enough to deal with it. Just right
now, our guys, it threw them off.  
  
Q. In terms of the officiating, would you say that they were trying to,
obviously, change?  
MICK CRONIN: It's two different halves. You saw it. It's two different halves.
For both teams. It's just two different halves. Totally. But I will say that
we were in the bonus with 13 minutes left in the game and never shot the
bonus.  
  
Q. Would you say there 's some positives to take from your press,
though?  
MICK CRONIN: Yeah. The problem is once we stop scoring. You can't press, if
you don't score. So I've coached pressing teams before and the problem is you
can't press -- I mean, you got -- I guess, theoretically, you could -- it's
hard to press a turnover. But, yeah, no question, just, really, it's almost
like forced therapy to try to get guys to play hard. But then you're trying to
generate offense. Right now as a coaching staff we're just trying to figure
out ways to generate offense. So we get some steals, get some layups, because
we're really struggling five on five in the half court right now. Where do we
go with the ball. What's happened is we played 10 games and teams figured out
that you just, you got to double and triple team Cody and Jalen when they
catch it down low. And they have taken that away from us. And now we're 4-21
from three. We were 2-15 at Notre Dame or 3-15, something like that. So that's
where we're really struggling in the half court.  
  
Q. Do you like the looks you 're getting from three or?  
MICK CRONIN: Some of them. I mean some of them are wide open. Yeah. I mean, I
would have to look at the film, but we had some pretty good looks, to be fair.
What really kills us, because that happens, again, I've won games with these
numbers. We shot -- didn't we shoot 42 percent? Shot 42 percent for the year
and went to multiple NCAA tournaments. The problem is you can't turn the ball
over -- the real problem is, when you're missing all those shots in the first
half, we had zero second chance points. Zero. Now how are you going to win? If
you're shooting -- if you have a team that's not shooting the ball well,
theoretically it means a lot of opportunities for offensive rebounds. So much
so that the teams are going to get some up, you're going to get some. But it's
been a strength of ours, it's why we won a lot of our home games.  
  
Q. Seems like there was a little bit more tendency to drive the ball,
Chris Smith was a little bit more aggressive in doing that. Is he coming along
in that?  
MICK CRONIN: He's got to learn to pass -- it this is all of our guys --
Tyger's got to learn to shoot when he's open. And he got in the lane a few
times, and nobody helped, all he had to do was lay it in. And we got some
other guys that when they drive the ball there's three guys on them and we got
to find the open man. So we did get some shots when we did drive the ball and
find the open man. It's not that -- it's not that hard -- you got to drive the
ball and score or get fouled; and if you can't, you got to find the open man.
If you can't, that's because somebody's helping, you must find the open man.
We struggled mightily in this area. Why is which why, when we can't pound it
inside, we have to now generate offense from our guards. I'm not giving away
-- people got film, so I'm not giving you the, you know, the secret sauce,
everybody already knows. Like we can't, in the half court, we can't pound it
inside, we have to, we hesitate, some of those threes were hesitating. We
struggled to know when we're open and then when we drive the ball we don't
shoot sometimes. When we drive the ball we got to create for each other. Three
assists in the first half.  
  
Q. Are you seeing some signs they 're getting better at it though, would
you say?  
MICK CRONIN: I think we got to get a lot better at it. I think we, against
high major teams, I just gave it to you, we got to get better at executing
some things and being able to score from a screening and strategy standpoint.
Whatever we're trying to execute, we got to make sure that we execute it. We
can't, we don't have enough, we just don't have enough, we don't have four
first round picks running around just getting their own, we got to be a really
good execution team, we got to maximize our possessions, because we don't have
somebody who can hit threes five feet behind the line and bail us out when we
don't execute. I got to find a way to get Jalen and Cody back to being a
factor in the post. That's really killing our offense the last three games. We
haven't been able to go inside and come away with anything. As soon as they
trap us we got to be ready and we got to pass out and get wide open shots outs
of it. We got no chance to win, guys, with 23 turnovers. Not against North
Carolina or not against a great coach in LeVelle Moton at North Carolina
Central. Can't win with 23 turnovers.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you, coach.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Thanks.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Ohio State - 71, Kentucky - 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both you guys, Nate, how do you explain the difference from your
game against Utah and the way it unfolded tonight. And Ashton, after he
answers, what sort of impact do you think Nate had on the game?  
NATE SESTINA: I kind of talked to you about it earlier, just coming back for
my first game after an injury I was a little hesitant, didn't want to put my
hand out there, put it in passing lanes, go up with two hands to rebound. And
I talked to the coaching staff and they were just like, listen, you need to
just forget about it, forget about the injury. Talking with our trainer Jeff
he kind of said the same thing, just go out and play and don't think about it.
And I tried to do that today, diving on the floor, not thinking about it. But
I think kind of carrying that over into today it was just a toughness thing.
We knew they were going to be physical, the Big-10's known for that, I played
Ohio State last year, they were physical, so I kind of knew that coming in and
I was just trying to do the same thing for them.  
  
ASHTON HAGANS: Nate's presence being on the floor it was a big deal tonight.
He knocked down some big threes that we needed and then got other guys hitting
shots, which he's a vocal leader at all times, on and off the court and that's
what we need, but also the Utah game we didn't start off with no energy, there
was none of that. Tonight I feel like we had a lot of energy starting off the
game, finishing too, but we just messed up on certain parts, but now we got a
couple days to fix that when we get back from this break, just ready to get
back to work.  
  
Q. Ashton, what 's the most important thing in your mind that this
team's got to get right, figure out in the next however many, two, three
months?  
ASHTON HAGANS: There's nothing too big, I would just say just coming together
more, having each other's back more, helping each other out. But other than
that I think we're getting it, everyone's getting their role coming into it,
but obviously also we just got to start sharing the ball but that comes with
getting closer on and off the court. But it's just small things right now.  
  
Q. There were a couple times during the game you kind of grabbed guys
and were saying something to them after a play or something. Is that something
you 're trying to do more of and kind of what was going through your mind on
some of those things?  
ASHTON HAGANS: Just trying to get guys going, not too much on them but just
trying to talk to them. If we mess up, just keep talking to them, like if I do
something wrong, I know I'm going to hear it from Nate, I know I'm going to
hear it from E.J., things like that, so that's just what I try to do, just
talk to the guys every time.  
  
Q. The Ohio State guys talked about this game being a 40-minute grind,
kind of a test of wills. And you guys were right there blow, counter blow, how
do you feel about coming out of a game like that against a highly ranked team
right there?  
NATE SESTINA: For us it kind of shows where we are right now. I think from the
beginning of the year until now we have really improved our toughness you saw
guys getting chippy, guys were bumping guys around, diving on the floor, guys
stepping up, blocking shots. Like I said before, like this is a big toughness
game for us and I mean I don't really remember the score but I think we were
starting to click and we're like two or three possessions away from really
getting this thing going and it really starts with like Ashton said, it starts
with on and off the court relationships and we're starting to do that. Guys
are hanging out with guys outside of basketball and that trust carries on to
the court so that every time we step on we know that guys are going to be
there for each other.  
  
Q. Nate, after two straight losses on this trip, what was the mood like
in the locker room after the game?  
NATE SESTINA: Pretty solemn, but we have a team full of guys that are ready to
play and the game coming up is huge for us, it's an in state rivalry, it's a
big, another big toughness game for us, and the tension around that game is so
much more and we know that and the attitude for them coming in, the attitude
for us coming in, it's kind of the same thing, it's two big dogs going after
it and whoever is hungrier at the end of the game is going to get the bones as
Kenny Payne said to us tonight.  
  
Q. I know you guys just came off two big losses but the Ohio State head
coach, he did say that Coach Cal finds a way to make runs deep in March. What
's your confidence in him and each other and what are you going to focus on
once conference play starts?  
ASHTON HAGANS: We had our up-and-downs with last year, this year it's the same
thing, we lose we always hear something but we just got to stick with each
other. Cal's coaching us to win in March and so we just got to keep on
fighting no matter what happens, just stick with each other like I said
earlier and just keep fighting.  
  
Q. Nate, you 've not played in the Louisville/Kentucky rivalry yet but
I'm sure the guys have talked to you about it. What are you expecting in that
game next weekend and what have the guys told you?  
NATE SESTINA: It's going to be a dog fight and Cal said to us today that
they're like 1-11 against us and however long and that's big. I mean they're
coming in looking to get a win, we're coming off of two losses, they think
that we're going to come in and kind of lay an egg, so I think for us and for
me personally at least I haven't played in this game you I understand what
it's like to play in big games and in a rivalry game like this is something
that I'm really looking forward to. When I committed here that was one of the
games that they talked about, so I'm really looking forward to it, got to get
away, take a little mental break, be home for Christmas, I know everybody's
going to be in the gym, everybody's going to be working out and we're going to
come back and get after it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, we'll let you get back to your team. Coach, give us
your thought on this afternoon's game.  
  
JOHN CALIPARI: We fought. We tried. Thank God we had Nate. I think we put
ourselves in a position where we had a chance to win, we just wouldn't pass
the ball. We're still, we're opening up the courts to drive people because
everybody will collapse and they did collapse and we tried to shoot it anyway.
I mean we did -- I called my last timeout to make us pass that ball where E.J.
threw -- I called a timeout to say, you're going to pass this ball. So we came
down three straight times with guys wide open and shot it into a guy 6'-10".
We're still learning. But if this is who we are, we'll be fine. Nick didn't
play great, E.J. played okay, we just got to get those guys going a little
bit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, we'll take questions.  
  
Q. Over the last several games you said our guys aren 't passing the
ball. What has?  
JOHN CALIPARI: They started today, we did pretty good for awhile. It was in
the last four minutes they wouldn't pass. I mean, I thought they did a good
job, we got 17 assists and 11 turns, which in our case usually wins games for
us. But there could have been three more assists in the last four minutes and
we would have had 20 assists, 11 turns and it would have been like a good
night. But we chose to try to score it versus, they're collapsing, that's what
they're doing and I, what Nate did for us, folks, is he started making shots
so some other guys, it's contagious, they can make a shot now. So we get seven
today. If we get seven we'll be fine. Seven for us, eight, six, a game, we
just can't go 2-17. 1-12. And the problem is we still had a lot of guys go
1-6, 1-5, and they were wide open like they're wide open and when those guys
start making it, we're spacing the court how I would like to space the court.
So we can get to the rim. Now unusual for us to get, have a team shoot more
free throws than us. Like on the year we're way more free throws than the
other team. This is an aggressive team, they're, they were physical, they did
some good stuff.  
  
Q. After the Utah game, the way it ended on Wednesday, did you get an
explanation on the restricted circle?  
JOHN CALIPARI: I asked about the one today.  
  
Q. Did you get -- the way it ended on Wednesday did you get a different
explanation today?  
JOHN CALIPARI: They, you know, that's my story and I'm sticking with it.  
  
Q. The start, it seemed like this was the Derek Willis plan for Nate?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah.  
  
Q. To come in as a stretch guy and let him shoot threes?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yes.  
  
Q. When did you decide --  
JOHN CALIPARI: Before we talked about it, just so you know. So we spent two
days just like one of the things I said, Nate, what were we running for you to
get you threes? And then we put in some stuff and what they did after he
banged a couple, they just said okay we're going to switch. Well, there's two
things you do, you run him into the post with the point guard, and you bring
that other big out or you tell your point, it's called a boomerang, he throws
it, they get it right back to him and he goes downhill right at that big. You
do one of the two. We'll work on that kind of stuff, we haven't had it. The
biggest thing is we got the ball in the lane like we want to and we just ran
people over. I told Ashton, he played great, but he's got to lead us the whole
game. The play at the end of the half where he just, a minute to go, we could
have gone in up at halftime, and he just, you're down one versus two and you
ran the guy over. Wait a minute. And we had a good game plan of trying to
grind them out a little bit because they're a very good defensive team, they
played very physical, they're a bump and grind kind of team and we wanted to
bump and grind them and I thought we did pretty good. I mean I, at the end of
the day, I don't know exactly what we shot, but it was pretty high and they
make 10 threes a game that was an emphasis for us and we held them until the
last two where we rotated and they made two at the end. So you hold attempt
that makes 10 to basically four, I thought we did good. This was a good time
for us. I mean the last 10 minutes of Utah and this game, I mean that's a top
1, 2, 3, team. That's what they are. Their shooting guard played today, he had
been out a couple games he didn't play against Minnesota in the last game, but
he played today. And so for us to be able to say, okay, now let's clean up all
this other stuff, let's get guys to fight, Nick's got to come back, I told
him, you got to get back in the gym, you put yourself in this position by how
you practice and how you approach this, now we, it's not acceptable, let's go.  
  
Q. Follow-up on Nate. You may have answered it with not passing at the
end, but he goes the last 14 minutes without a three-pointer?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well they switched and did some stuff.  
  
Q. He took him away?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Yeah. And that guy can coach too.  
  
Q. Like you said you guys are generating a lot of open shots and it 's
guys like Tyrese, like Johnny, like Immanuel who are good shooters they're
just missing shots. Do you have any idea like why, like what makes you think
that they're just missing shots?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Probably mindset. Like you can't really say like, well I come
out every time I miss a shot. No, that's not true. So then it become, at one
point I was trying to get them to just say one word in your mind when you go
to shoot it. Straight. Straight. Straight. Because if you're thinking straight
you can't think I'm going to miss this too. I'm missing this, oh my God. So
you just, then that worked a little bit. And then I was like, well, if there's
another word that will make you feel good before you shoot, say that word.
Maybe it was a high school team you got 40 against. "Saint Alysosis" and then
shoot it. Because the mentality of shooting, you cannot be afraid if you miss
one or two, then pass on the next three, because you kill your team. But if I
miss five in a row I'm embarrassed. Excuse me? Get in the gym then. The one
way is get in the gym and master your craft. We got good shooters, if you
watched us practice yesterday, we made 50 threes. They're like -- and then --
and it's not just missing, it's hard right. You hear what I'm saying? It's not
di, di, di. No, it's, like boom, boom, zing. I mean that's what it is. So I
just think, again, the toughness of playing here, got to be tough, got to be a
dog. Every game is someone's Super Bowl. Ohio State played their butts off
today and they ground it out, they played to win a game and they played and
fought and pushed and were big and I mean they played. And that's what -- I
told them, I said you could say it's hard to play -- it's hard to play against
these teams that are trying to kill you. The other thing that happens I'm
trying to explain, they will look at a guy like Tyrese and say, he's a lottery
pick? Well watch what I do to him. Then why am I not a lottery pick? They
don't get, well we're exchanging basket, hi, how are you, good to see you.
These dudes are fighting and this is the process we go through every year.
When they figure it out, if I don't fight I'm not making it. If I'm not a dog,
if I'm not -- you don't make it. And it's not about exchanging basket, let me
get more shots. No. Now you're 1-12. What do we do now? So, but I'm not
spending much time on it, we're just taking a lot of shots and we chart every
shot. And at some point you say, fall back on your training, you made 60 in
five minutes, you made 67 in five minutes. You can't make them when you're
wide open? But I think I got a good shooting team. Thank goodness for Nate
today.  
  
Q. What 's the team plans for Christmas and is it good to maybe step
away for a few days?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Good for me, I know that. I don't know if it's good for them.
Nine of them are already going to the airport, going separate ways home.
Johnny's got the shorter trip to L.A., he's laughing, I'll be home in 30
minutes. The rest of us got long flights. But I grabbed each of them
individually and talked to them and just told them, maybe gave them a critique
a little bit but I said, go have fun with your family, we'll deal with it when
we come back. We do this every year. The NCAA's made it not an option any
more. You got to take four days. Well we always took four days. I didn't care
what -- and I basically did it because I really cared about my own family. I
wanted to be with my family for four days. I don't care. I'm not playing over
Christmas, I'm not, we're taking four, five days, three days, this year we'll
take four, but now the NCAA makes everybody do it. I thought it was an
advantage for us. Because we were playing teams that were given no Christmas
break and they would play and get ready and I thought it was our advantage
because of how we did it. So now it's no longer an advantage.  
  
Q. You talk about guys getting shots. E.J. just took four, first 17
minutes didn 't have a shot. What is he not doing to get more involved and why
is he not shooting it more?  
JOHN CALIPARI: Well one of the things is you can offensive rebound and go get
shots, so now you don't have to worry about someone passing you the ball just
say I'm going to rebound offensively. The second thing is fight in the post
where we can throw it to you. Now it becomes so it's obvious that you got to
get it. Last game he begged me, like get me it in the block. Today we tried to
run a couple things to him, couple of things to Nick, but it didn't
materialize because that guy worked harder than they did. You got to work
harder than that guy to get open than he is working to keep you to not catch
it. And it's all what we're going through. This is normal, it's just, you
know, you would rather learn from close wins, we had our chance today, we were
down two with a few minutes to go. We had our chance. And then the same with
Utah. Tie game with a minute to go, whatever it was. We had our chance. And we
let it slip. So now we move on. Folks, I tell you all, have a merry Christmas,
hope you get to enjoy your family and I hope you enjoyed the game today.
Thanks.

# [CHICAGO LEGENDS PRESENTED BY
ROMAN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=CHICAGO+LEGENDS+PRESENTED+BY+ROMAN)

  

## December 21, 2019

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

### [CJ Fredrick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38411)

### [Luka Garza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34689)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Iowa - 77, Cincinnati - 70  
  
MODERATOR: We'll get started with questions for the student-athletes, C.J.
Fredrick and Luka Garza.  
  
Q. For any of you, what was it like to overcome the 24 turnovers in the
game, especially late -- especially the ones you had in the second half that
almost cost you guys the game?  
CJ FREDRICK: It was big. After a timeout we just kind of collectively came
together and said, be strong with the ball. And we were never in doubt with
each other. We stayed connected as a group. And I think after that we only had
about two turnovers and finished the game. So that's what we pride ourselves
on is just staying together and just staying locked in and I think that's what
you saw late in the game.  
  
LUKA GARZA: Credit to them. They were a really aggressive defensive team. They
tried to get up into you and force those turnovers. And I think we let that
get to us a little bit during that stretch in the second half when we got a
lead. And it's a good lesson for us going forward, just to make sure that that
can't happen again, and if it does, we still find a way to pull the win out.
You got to win ugly too.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the lift that Bakari gave you tonight and the big
shots that he made?  
LUKA GARZA: He was tremendous. He's just been doing everything Coach has asked
of him, so far, playing different positions, just working hard, waiting for
his opportunity, and he got it tonight and stepped up to it. That's what he
presents to our team, he's just a hard worker who is going to come in and do
his thing. And we all have confidence in him and we have seen this in him
since the start of the season, and even in the summer, he's been playing
really well for us. And it was great to see him have a night like this. He
deserves that. And just really proud of him and looking forward to see what he
continues to do for us.  
  
CJ FREDRICK: Like Luka said. We love him, and we have tremendous confidence in
him and just being patient and waiting for his time. And I think you saw,
like, he brings a little bit of everything to the game, and I think you saw,
he's a big-time player.  
  
Q. C.J., what did this performance mean for you being from the
Cincinnati area against this team?  
CJ FREDRICK: It was a lot of fun. I had a lot of friends and family here, made
the drive to come watch. It was just really another -- it was just another
game. I didn't try to make anything bigger than, really, what it was. It was
just another game and tried to execute the game plan.  
  
Q. Luka, you played against this team in the tournament last year.
Obviously, with a new coach and turned over roster. How were they different or
how do they compare at all to the team you saw in the tournament last year?  
LUKA GARZA: I think they still have the reputation of being a really
aggressive defensive team, like I said earlier, and I think that was their
mantra last year, and I think it's continuing with the new coach.  
  
Offensively, they do a little different things than they did last year and I
think they're just as good offensively. They lost a couple guys but they still
got a couple in Williams and Scott, who were tremendous against us last year.
I know Scott and Cumberland really hurt us last year in that tournament game.
So they still got a lot of pieces and they're a tremendous team. They're going
to make some noise in the AAC.  
  
Q. Luka, where do you think this game was won in the last minutes?  
LUKA GARZA: I think, definitely, on the glass we got some key rebounds. I
think as a team we got stops when we needed to. When we weren't scoring on the
offensive end, where our offense wasn't flowing as well as we wanted it to,
they were getting up into us, like I said, and we weren't really getting the
shots we wanted, so we needed to make key stops down there. So credit to
everyone down in that zone that was moving around. And we had to rebound out
of that zone and I think we did a good job of that.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
CJ FREDRICK: It was just, the plan was just getting a little sloppy,
uncharacteristic turnovers. Coach called a really good timeout just trying to
settle us down.  
  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: There wasn't a lot of talk. There was a lot of listening.  
  
LUKA GARZA: That's -- what he said. (Laughing).  
  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: C.J. was being nice. That's why I love him.  
  
MODERATOR: All right. Thanks, guys. We'll let the players join the team. Any
questions for Coach?  
  
Q. What did they improve on?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: The one thing that I think has been consistent with this
group, they have really done an amazing job of sticking to the game plan.
Taking the information, every game. And they did that to a 15-point lead. We
got away from that in that one stretch. This is a proud and storied program.
They're going to come after us. They're quick. They're -- they have athletic
power. They're going to be in the gap. They're going to be in the passing
lane. The X is going to be on the O. It's going to be heat. If you have it,
there's going to be heat, and if you're trying to get open to get it, all
right? So we worked on V cuts to get open, keep your dribble, keep your
spacing, flare screen them in. And we just kind of got a little bit casual,
and we just kind of, we were just passing the ball to the next guy. There was
no purpose to it, and that's not like this group. So give them credit. We --
they forced us into 24 turnovers. But again, we did all those things before
that to get a 15-point lead. So we were still right there. Now somebody's got
to step up and now we've got to get consecutive stops, which we did. The zone
was really good, the press was good, but you say, okay, you turned it over 24
times, how do you survive that? Well, you survive it by going 48, 31 on the
glass and holding them to 34 percent from the field and make 11 threes. So
there's different ways to win a basketball game. And truth of the matter is,
these games before Christmas, you watch, and I don't care which ones you
watch, they all have a kind of a strange flow to them sometimes. How much
practicing did Cincinnati have? How much practice did we have? We had two guys
get operated on Thursday and Friday. We got a guy that didn't make the trip
because he's sick. Everybody's going through the same thing. That's a team
that has some new bodies that they're trying to figure out, and they had a
really, I mean, special season last year, 28 wins. A lot of guys back, but a
lot of new faces and they're trying to figure it out too. They have a freshman
point guard, we have a freshman point guard. We need to get him a new pair of
shoes, apparently. But he'll be great moving forward.  
  
And the bottom line is, when somebody's out, somebody else has to step up. We
had guys step up. Bakari, he went tonight and was absolutely spectacular.  
  
Q. I was going to ask you about Bakari. Is this sort of the kind of
moment that you were expecting for or expecting looking for when you brought
him into the program a fifth year senior?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, you know what, I've been saying this since he got here,
and I think you guys think I'm just saying it. I'm only saying it because I'm
seeing it. You heard what Luka said. Since the summertime, he's been a really
good player, okay. He can play the point, he can play the 2, he can make
threes, he can make plays, he's good in ball screens, he defends, he plays the
3 spot, he knows all 3 spots. He did make one mistake tonight, but he hasn't
played a ton of point, and we have had J-Bo, Joe, and Connor in that position.
Tonight he stepped up and was huge. We're going to need multiple ball handlers
against that pressure. That's why we tried -- there was times we wanted to go
big, but we felt like we needed to have four handlers out there. I think a lot
of teams, moving forward, are going to have to make those decisions against
this team, the way they press. They really had a lot of success with it
against Tennessee, who is a really good team, and they had success with us.
So, fortunately, we have multiple handlers that ultimately got the job done.  
  
Q. Obviously, this isn 't the first time you've brought your team into
this building. You come here annually yourself as part of media day. Talk
about the atmosphere every time you bring your team to Chicago?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: We have, obviously, a tremendous amount of alumni that live in
this area. Hawk fans respond every time we come here. Let's go Hawks cheer at
Northwestern is as loud as you're ever going to here it. We come to this
building, it's the same thing. We when we started talking about this game,
this double-header, didn't know at first who we would play, didn't know how
our fans would respond, and, boy, were they huge, especially when we gave up
the lead. They hung in there with us and helped us get the big win.  
  
Q. I know you have a lot of history with the Fredrick family. You
coached C.J. 's uncle. What's it been like coaching him and what's made him so
effective so early?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, I will tell you, he's a blessing to coach because he's
zero maintenance. That means on and off the floor. What do you need me to do,
Coach? Got it. And he goes and does it. You don't have to keep reminding him,
you don't have to push him, you don't have to challenge him. I've got to come
up with something today to challenge him.  
  
His uncle was the same way. They're both gamers. Big shots, big plays, excel
in the moment. And that comes from being smart and tough, and it also comes
from preparation. He really works hard. Came out of a great high school
program, Covington Catholic, played for a great coach and just is a guy that
keeps working, and I trust him. So I wish I could tell you that it was
something miraculous that I'm doing. It's not. It's him.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well, they're a team that I think, really, runs good man
stuff, you know, pitch, pitch, pitch, run off the ball, screen, iso the post,
iso Cumberland at the elbow. There's all kinds of stuff, I mean, we've watched
every game they played, sometimes twice, all right. So you can prepare your
team for what might come, but they run so much good stuff, you can't predict
what's coming. But if you play zone, they're all right there in front of you.
Where's Cumberland? He's right there. Okay? We don't have to worry about him
coming through and coming back to the elbow, and they clear everybody out, and
he's got an iso drive right. No, he's right there and we've got people in the
gaps, so there's nowhere for him to drive to. Now, you're going to live with
some open 3s. We pushed up on both Cumberlands and we lived with the other
folks. I thought we did a good job defending the high post because Scott's
really good there. He hurt us last year in the tournament from that position,
so we really paid attention to him there.  
  
Q. What was -- was Joe too -- was it just nerves, do you think? Do you
think he was a little too amped up tonight?  
FRAN MCCAFFERY: Well I mean he fell the first three times he got the ball. I
mean, he's quick, but like I said, he went and changed his shoes at halftime.
And then he was in foul trouble and then BK was playing so well and we went
with Connor, C.J., BK, with those guys. I really wanted to get him back in,
but he'll settle down, he's a really good player, this is all part of the
growth process. He's really, he's young, but he's a competitor, he'll have an
opportunity in the next one.

# [CHICAGO LEGENDS PRESENTED BY
ROMAN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=CHICAGO+LEGENDS+PRESENTED+BY+ROMAN)

  

## December 21, 2019

  

### [Anthony Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19553)

### [Obi Toppin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38278)

### [Jalen Crutcher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36837)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Colorado 76-Dayton 76, OT  
  
MODERATOR: We now welcome Dayton. Head coach Anthony Grant, Jalen Crutcher,
and Obi Toppin.  
  
Coach.  
  
ANTHONY GRANT: You got to give Colorado credit. Those guys did a great job. We
knew coming in a few things about them as a team. Obviously really talented
group, well-coached. They're excellent in transition. They're really, really
excellent in their ability to get second shots.  
  
Obviously a couple things in terms of from our standpoint, we knew to be able
to keep them out of transition, we would have to do a good job of executing
our stuff and taking care of the basketball.  
  
A lot of things today. I think a very hard-fought game. Obviously the end of
the game, the way the game ended, it's tough to take. But we'll go back and
look at some things that we can learn from this game in terms of what we need
to do to make sure we don't have this feeling again.  
  
This is a team I think still has a lot of room to grow, a lot of room to
improve and what we have got to be able to do is mature in some areas as a
team to be able to reach the potential that we think we can reach.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Obi, obviously not the result you wanted. What was it like having
basically a home game here?  
OBI TOPPIN: Yeah, our fans are very loyal. They travel everywhere we go.
They're amazing. It's like we got the No. 1 fan base in the world. For all the
fans that came out today, we want to thank them. It was great seeing them
there.  
  
Q. What did you see on the last play, the big shot by Schwartz?  
JALEN CRUTCHER: They threw the ball in the post. We worked on it in practice
that we were going to double the post. It was just a good find by him, a good
shot.  
  
Q. Obi, the game-tying three-pointer, you just missed one earlier. You
were 0-5 at that point. How much of a confidence booster was that going into
overtime?  
OBI TOPPIN: The whole game I wasn't hitting any threes. My teammates were
staying with me, had trust in me, telling me to keep shooting if I was open,
don't stop shooting.  
  
It's crazy because right before that play, Trey was looking at me. It's like,
If you're open, shoot the ball. It was in the timeout. I was like, I got you.  
  
I guess it just went in. It was a good feeling.  
  
Q. The turnovers in the second half were probably your biggest issue.
What did you see? What was going on with some of those turnovers?  
ANTHONY GRANT: I'll go back and look at the film. We have to mature as a team.
We really do. I think a lot of it is self-inflicted. Maybe it was something
that Colorado did that caused us problems.  
  
But for the most part, you know, it's stuff that we need to be able to clean
up as a team. If we're going to reach our potential, we have to do better.  
  
Q. Jalen, second loss like this, you know how good you can be, but do
you feel like you 're just a little bit short of being the great team you want
to be?  
JALEN CRUTCHER: Oh, yeah, we got a lot of room to grow. Like coach said in the
locker room, It's still December. I think we got a lot of room to grow. I
don't think we reached our peak yet.  
  
MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [CHICAGO LEGENDS PRESENTED BY
ROMAN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=CHICAGO+LEGENDS+PRESENTED+BY+ROMAN)

  

## December 21, 2019

  

### [John Brannen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33123)

### [Chris McNeal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38410)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Iowa - 77, Cincinnati - 70  
  
MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for Chris McNeal.  
  
Q. A lot of fouls first half early, in the second half before you guys
really started it to turn them into steals. Was the game called tight, do you
feel like? Do you guys feel like you did something different where you just
stopped fouling and turned to steals?  
CHRIS MCNEAL: I feel like the game has been called tight all season, so I
think we just got to do a better job of defending without fouling, which I
think we do, but they made some calls that could go either way, so we just got
to live with it and keep trying to defend at the level that we're capable of
defending at.  
  
Q. What changed when that run where you guys cut the 15-point lead and
got a bunch of steals? Was there something you guys did different?  
CHRIS MCNEAL: No, we just tried to pressure their ball handlers. We know that
they're without their starting point guard that they have had for quite some
time, so we just wanted to pressure the ball handlers and make them
uncomfortable and then that kind of led to steals, so that's all we did.  
  
Q. What were the conversations like maybe during timeouts whenever you
guys were down by double digits? And how were you able to turn that around?  
CHRIS MCNEAL: Just conversations to just bring energy. At that time it's no
more game planning. It's more so like the way the game was going we just
needed energy and we needed to play harder. So we came out flat and due to
talk that coach gave us in timeouts and at halftime, we just kind of picked it
up in the second half.  
  
Q. Now that you 're coming off the bench, do you feel like bringing
energy is something that is being asked of you now?  
CHRIS MCNEAL: For sure. I feel like that was asked of me from the time I got
here, so I just got to keep on listening to Coach and doing whatever he asks
me to do.  
  
Q. Seven turnovers for you guys in the game. Was that -- what was the
message there and what did you guys do to take care of the ball?  
CHRIS MCNEAL: That's just something that Coach has been harping on since a few
games back, that we got to slow down on the turnovers and make better reads.
So that started in practice. He had us in drills to play off two, just kind of
give me a repetition in slowing down, making the right read and just playing
basketball.  
  
Q. What did you think of their zone? And what did it do to maybe give
you a problem?  
CHRIS MCNEAL: I just think it slowed us down in our offense just a little bit
just because we play with a lot of pace and that's something that a lot of
zone defenses do. They slow down teams that play with pace. So we did a good
job of game-planning and practicing before the game, so during the game, it
was just on us to execute.  
  
MODERATOR: All right. We'll excuse Chris and let him rejoin his team. We'll
start to ask Coach to make an opening statement about the game.  
  
JOHN BRANNEN: Give Iowa credit. I think they're one of the better teams in the
country. Obviously, they're unbelievable offensively. Great shot-making from
the perimeter, tremendous length upfront. I thought they made us look small
around the basket. Do a great job of not fouling. We're fourth in the country
in drawing fouls, and we couldn't draw fouls at the rim.  
  
Didn't come out with -- didn't -- they played harder than we did in the first
half. There were no adjustments at halftime. It was just an attitude
adjustment that was made at halftime. And we came out and played a lot harder
in the second half. And they don't have a point guard right now, so we needed
to pressure them. Caused 24 turnovers, and then when we got a chance to get
the lead late, one of the things that always hurts is being undisciplined. So
you got to marry playing hard and playing undisciplined -- or marry playing
hard and being disciplined. And we were undisciplined. And we had one of our
guys jump out of the way in front of the basket. We had another go for a
steal, and then another go for a shot fake. So we weren't disciplined at the
end of the game to be able to finish it.  
  
MODERATOR: Questions for Coach, please.  
  
Q. Same question I asked Chris: What about their zone do you feel like
gave you a problem with game planning?  
JOHN BRANNEN: Definitely gave us problems. In the first half I thought we
handled it pretty good, we just missed a ton of shots at the rim. Second half
we came in a little timid, didn't handle it as well.  
  
Q. Obviously there 's some frustration on certain fouls, that happens
every game. Do you feel like the game changed the way it was called at all
when you went on that run and started getting a bunch of steals?  
JOHN BRANNEN: Yeah, I thought that we were allowed to be a little bit more
aggressive. It was a little ticky-tack in the first half around the rim. Like
I say, we, give Iowa credit they must know how to guard without fouling
because we're fourth in the country in foul shots.  
  
Q. Full court press obviously is something you do, but in that second
half when you cut that 15-point lead, is that -- I know you talked about it
Wednesday against Tennessee, that 's the way you wanted it to look. Is that
the way you wanted it to look?  
JOHN BRANNEN: Yeah, that's the way we wanted to play when it calls for it,
that's the way we got to play. We didn't do that in the first half, I don't
understand why, but we did in the second half.  
  
Q. Garza had 12 points on 12 shots. Were you happy overall with how --  
JOHN BRANNEN: I was happy overall with our coverage, I thought he kind of beat
us on the glass quite a bit, but I was happy with our overall coverage. But
again, we doubled him and the ball's kicked out and Fredrick killed us. He's a
great player, I always have known that he's a tremendous kid and big-time shot
maker and he plays like he's a senior and he's young and is an outstanding
player.  
  
Q. Did you see C.J. a lot?  
JOHN BRANNEN: I saw C.J. a lot. I offered him his first scholarship. I love
C.J. Fredrick.  
  
Q. How old was he when you first offered?  
JOHN BRANNEN: I don't know.  
  
Q. Seemed to double Garza was the game plan. Does that hurt with some of
the guard rebounds and obviously the kick-outs on threes?  
JOHN BRANNEN: It hurts with the kick-out on threes. To get beat 48-31 on the
glass, it's one of two things, your effort is not good enough or they're
better than you are. It may have been a little bit of both, I don't know. I
think our effort wasn't good enough in the first half, I know it wasn't good
enough in the first half, I don't know what the rebounding totals were in the
second half.  
  
Q. Mamoudou got a little bit of run. Was that a matchup thing, do you
feel like he had earned it?  
JOHN BRANNEN: It was energy. Guys weren't playing hard enough. He gave us
great energy. When he came off the bench he didn't worry about anything he
just played hard, he had no agenda, he had nothing he was playing for, other
than to play hard.  
  
Chris McNeal same thing. When you're humbled, all right, you come in, you do
whatever it takes to play. And those guys played hard as can be. So they
changed the game for us.  
  
Q. Seemed like when Chris came in I think he had four steals --  
JOHN BRANNEN: Completely changed the game.  
  
Q. We talked about Jarron on Wednesday too, but he still seems like he
's continuing to get back closer to what he was like, seems like he was
attacking the basket more?  
JOHN BRANNEN: Yeah, getting to the foul line more and you know, yeah.

# [CHICAGO LEGENDS PRESENTED BY
ROMAN](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=CHICAGO+LEGENDS+PRESENTED+BY+ROMAN)

  

## December 21, 2019

  

### [Tad Boyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21400)

### [Tyler Bey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36844)

### [McKinley Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34825)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Colorado 78-Dayton 76, OT  
  
MODERATOR: Welcome, everybody. We have coach first with opening comments, then
questions for the players, then we'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
I want to welcome coach Tad Boyle and the Colorado Buffalos. We also have with
us Tyler Bey, McKinley Wright.  
  
Let's open with the coach.  
  
TAD BOYLE: I think it's appropriate you see the Chicago Legends, you have some
legendary busts in the making, with these guys to my left and right, D'Shawn
Schwartz who made two big, big buckets down the stretch.  
  
We came to Chicago, Donnie Boyce, got a chance to reconnect with him, had some
former players here. I just couldn't be more proud of this team. I think like
the end of the regulation, I screwed up by not calling time-out, getting the
defense set, talking about fouling a dribbler. I didn't do that.  
  
You know what, these guys gutted it up when they had to gut up in overtime.
The thing I think that made this game special, obviously it was a high-level
game, two big-time, big-time basketball teams in 2019, but to beat a team like
Dayton, whatever the net rankings happen there, this is going to show up as a
neutral-court game, and it shouldn't have been. It should be a road game. This
was a road win.  
  
These guys knew that coming in. It was a big game for McKinley personally. But
this team trusts each other, and we showed it tonight. We haven't necessarily
shown it a lot this year. We haven't at times. But tonight it showed. That
last position, McKinley Wright trusted Tyler Bey. Tyler Bey trusted D'Shawn
Schwartz.  
  
The pass he made to Tyler in the post, we talk about playing inside-out all
the time, that's what good teams do. If we can keep buying into that, this is
a special group, couldn't be more proud of them.  
  
MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Now let's take some questions for the players.  
  
Q. McKinley, how was it coming in to play at the United Center with a
lot of boos coming, having a double-double, amazing game tonight?  
MCKINLEY WRIGHT: It was a really dope feeling. I expected the boos. I told my
teammates before we came to Chicago that it was going to happen. I was getting
messages on Instagram about how much they hated me or whatever because I left.
I kind of knew it was coming. I talked to my teammates this morning, told them
I needed this one personally. They responded for me. That was a big-time game.  
  
I have a lot of family from Chicago. My dad is from here, the Bulls are his
favorite team. He wanted me to put on a show. So I just had to go out and play
my game.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you 've talked a lot about the last time you guys met
in the NIT. You had six or seven turnovers. Only 10 tonight. What does that do
confidence-wise?  
TAD BOYLE: It's huge. I mentioned trust. The other thing we try to talk to our
guys about, we watched some film of last year's game, we had it on at our meal
last night, we also watched it today on game day, because we were playing so
well offensively late in the year last year to beat Dayton in Boulder. I want
our guys to play with confidence. We got good players. They're better than the
way we've played certainly offensively up to this point.  
  
We knew going in we were going to have to have a low-turnover game, eliminate
them. Ten is a great number, 11 is the number we shoot for, we came one under
that.  
  
Again, credit goes to these guys. They did what they had to do tonight in a
really tough environment. I know what it's like to be booed like McKinley was
tonight. I feel his sense of satisfaction, and I think his teammates do, too.  
  
Q. Tyler, take us through the last play. How did you see D 'Shawn out
there on the wing?  
TYLER BEY: I just took my time really. I just passed it. He was wide open. He
was the only person open, so I just passed it to him. It was like slow motion.
It was great.  
  
Q. You and coach have talked about getting you to slow down a little bit
in the post when you get the ball. Was that a good example of it, even with
the clock ticking away?  
TYLER BEY: Yeah, definitely. The other thing is, too, is I had one turnover
today. That feels good (laughter). But, yeah, that shot was big-time. I'm
happy for him, super happy for him. This is his game. He's averaging 30-10.  
  
Q. How much poise did you show in the overtime session being able to
come back like that?  
TAD BOYLE: Great poise. We fell down three. We were a little down after
regulation. I could sense it in these guys' body language, facial expressions.  
  
But look, our program is based on defense and rebounding. You look at the
numbers, they shoot 50%, we shoot 39%, we end up winning. It's just a matter
of making plays when they had to be made. That's what our players did tonight.
That's what great players do.  
  
I mentioned, McKinley Wright is going to be a legend at Colorado before he
leaves, Tyler is going to be a legend before he leaves. Schwartz is on his
way, as well.  
  
Q. Earlier in the game, they 're known for their field goal percentage.
What is it like to sit down, sell your guys, for them to be able to slow down
and relax?  
TAD BOYLE: Yeah, I mean, they made their run at the beginning. Like you said,
they made eight or nine of their first 10 shots. Our guys, that just shows you
what we're made of. We don't fold. We kept fighting.  
  
I think they were 8-20 the rest of the half if I'm not mistaken. So we settled
down, we started having good offensive possessions. We talk all the time, the
only way you shrink leads is by getting stops. We couldn't expand the lead
tonight, but we shrunk that one, in the beginning, one possession at a time.  
  
It's a long game. I'd rather have them make their run at the beginning than
the end.  
  
Look, Dayton's a good basketball team. We beat a really good team tonight. A
well-coached team. These guys are legit. But you know, I think we are, too. I
think we showed it tonight for really the first time all year. Out In Vegas,
we were pretty good, but tonight we took it to another level.  
  
Q. So far this year the defense has been there, it 's the offense you
wanted to take to the next level. What was different about tonight, about
playing Dayton, this game that allowed you to hand in one of your best
offensive performances of the year?  
MCKINLEY WRIGHT: We trusted each other. We got the ball moving, we saw some
shots go in early. Sticking to the game plan, getting stops and getting out
and running. When you get stops, that opens up the game a lot. Obviously we
didn't get stops early in the game, but to close the half and second half, we
did a pretty good job. That gets your offense going when you get stops.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you fell behind early, down by 14 at one point. What
impressed me was the way your team, they were scrappy. How important is that
to stay with your game plan?  
TAD BOYLE: It's key. McKinley just mentioned trust. I couldn't agree more. You
use 'scrappy,' I use 'tough.' I think we were mentally tough. You have to do
that on the road, tough environments, you have to do that when other teams are
making their run. You have to do that at timeouts, when, okay, they hit a
bunch of shots in a row, now it's time to get back to who we are. Just a tough
group. They're mentally tough.  
  
Again, I think this can be a win that, as we look back on it, certainly I'm
not interested in looking back on it right now, but I think as we move
forward, we have Christmas coming up, this is a great way to go into it, be
thankful for all of our blessings, everything we have in our lives, then come
back and use it as a springboard for Iona and Pac-12 play. That's what I'm
hoping for.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the defense on Obi. Was the idea to make him
work?  
TAD BOYLE: They're going to play through him. He slips through a lot of
screens, he likes to shoot threes. I thought Evan and Tyler were terrific on
him. I thought the job that McKinley did on Crutcher was big-time. McKinley in
my mind is one of the most underrated defenders in all of college basketball.
This guy brings it every night.  
  
With the job that Tyler and Evan both did on Toppin, it was big. We really
wanted to go at him definitely on the other end. He expends a lot of energy on
offense. That last play was an iso play for D'Shawn. He was guarding him. He
just took him to the rim and finished. That was the design.  
  
We wanted to make him work on the defensive end because we know how good of an
offensive player he is. He's going to get his. Just have to make him work for
it.  
  
I don't know how many dunks we had, we were trying to take those away, which
is easier said than done, a few breakdowns. But for the most part, we made him
work for everything he got.  
  
Q. McKinley, we talked about it earlier, but you come in here,
obviously, this Dayton crowd knows who you are, your history, wants to let you
know about it. The second you touch the ball, you 're getting booed. Sitting
here looking, you have a smile on your face. What is going on behind the mask?
What does this win mean to you? As a team, with the pre-season hype you had,
the confidence in each other, what does this win mean?  
MCKINLEY WRIGHT: I've been booed before in high school. Obviously it wasn't
the same as this. That was way louder, way crazier.  
  
I told them to keep booing. I wanted them to keep booing. Me it gave me a
little extra juice. I fed off that. I needed that.  
  
To answer your second question, we knew they were 13th. One of our coaches
before the game told us, Don't worry about their ranking, we don't care about
their ranking. We're just as good. We got just as good pieces as they do.  
  
We just stuck to the game plan and fought every possession. It worked out in
our favor towards the end. We got stops down the stretch, made free throws,
besides mine that I missed. That was it.  
  
MODERATOR: Thank you, all.

_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
SHON MORRIS: Thanks everyone for coming today. We really appreciate you taking
time out of your busy day to join us. My name is Shon Morris. I'm with the
Big-10 Network. We're very pleased to be broadcasting the second part of the
double-header tomorrow, the game with Cincinnati versus Iowa.  
  
As you know, Chicago is routinely recognized on the national stage as a
leading hotbed for top basketball talent. Many of the game's greatest legends,
including those we have here today, have called Chicago home. I would like to
introduce our group of legends who are here with us representing the four
schools participating in this year's Chicago Legends doubleheader. First, if I
might interject here, one of my personal heroes growing up in the great state
of Iowa. He was an All-American during his time in Iowa City, leading the
Hawkeyes to the 1980 NCAA Final Four. He's also a six-time -- or six-year NBA
veteran, NBA champion, and gold medalist for Team USA during the 1979 Pan-
American games. Please welcome from the University of Iowa, Ronnie Lester.  
  
(Applause.)  
  
SHON MORRIS: Next, from Cincinnati. A talented center, during the 1990s. He
helped the Bearcats reach the Final Four and Elite 8 in back-to-back seasons.
He was selected by the Chicago Bulls in the first round of the 1993 NBA draft
and would go on to play 11 seasons in the league. Please welcome Corey Blount.  
  
(Applause.)  
  
SHON MORRIS: From Colorado. A three-time all Big-12 conference selection in
the 42nd overall selection in the 1995 NBA draft by the Atlanta Hawks. He grew
up in Maywood, Illinois and attended Proviso East where he now works as the
head coach of the men's basketball team. He ranks third on the Buffaloes all-
time scoring list with 1,995 points. Please welcome Donnie Boyce.  
  
(Applause.)  
  
SHON MORRIS: And finally, from Dayton, the all-time leading scorer in Flyers'
history. He led the team to the Elite 8 in his senior season averaging 26
points per game in the NCAA tournament. He is a member of the University of
Dayton Athletic Hall of Fame and the prestigious Ohio Hall of Fame. Please
welcome Roosevelt Chapman.  
  
(Applause.)  
  
SHON MORRIS: We're going to start off with some questions for our legends and
then after that, we'll open it up to the floor for some questions.  
  
First, we'll start with the gentleman to my left, to my immediate left.
Ronnie, you know Chicago has a great history in basketball. You're part of it
growing up here and playing at Dunbar before going to the University of Iowa.
Why is it special to see Iowa make the trip here to Chicago? And what does it
mean for the program to play in the Chicago Legends against three other
outstanding programs?  
  
RONNIE LESTER: I think Iowa is -- there are a lot of students here from the
Chicago area that go to Iowa. I think this is sort of Iowa's backyard. I think
they consider this their backyard. And I'd love Iowa to get back into Chicago
to recruit some Chicago area kids to go back to Iowa City.  
  
SHON MORRIS: Well, it paid dividends for them in the '80s. Trust me, I know.
And I know you have a lot of great memories playing at the University of Iowa,
but if you had to select one from your tremendous career in Iowa city, what
would that be?  
  
RONNIE LESTER: Going there, we weren't very good in my first year or so there,
going in there. And Coach Olson and his staff built a really good program. And
my last year there we were fortunate enough to go to the Final Four. So I
think the culmination of four years of hard work by not only the players but
the coaching staff that put us in that Final Four in 1980.  
  
SHON MORRIS: So a little editorial comment. If Ronnie doesn't tear up his knee
in a Christmas tournament game at Dayton, they're going to win the whole thing
that year. But that's just my opinion. I grew up in Iowa and enjoyed watching
Ronnie play when I was in high school and listening to all the games, so it's
a personal thrill for me to be up here with all these guys.  
  
Corie, you spent 11 years in the NBA, your early years here with the Chicago
Bulls. What was it like to play here in Chicago? And how did the experience
playing with the Bulls impact and prepare you for the rest of your NBA career?  
  
CORIE BLOUNT: Well, for me, it was just an incredible honor to be drafted by
Chicago at that time. They had just won three championships. And I really
didn't know where I was going to land in the draft. I just remember Jerry
Krause coming to me saying, if you are around when we pick, you're going to be
our guy. And I was getting told that a lot during the draft, but when he made
that call and told me that he was going to draft me, I was excited. So I came
and I was playing with Scottie Pippin, Horace Grant, and it just prepared me
mentally to be a good NBA player because those guys were awesome at that time.  
  
SHON MORRIS: You know, you played at the University of Cincinnati, had a great
career, went to the Final Four in the Elite 8. In addition to playing for,
shall we say, one of the most demanding college coaches in Bob Huggins, what
other things about your time at the University of Cincinnati prepared you for
your extensive NBA career?  
  
CORIE BLOUNT: Well, I was blessed to play with a good group. When I look back
at our team, we all got along and that really made a difference because when
you play with a group of guys that really care about winning but also care
about each other, it carries and shows on the court. And I think that's what
prepared me because we had an intensity about it us and we all thought that we
were underdogs and we wanted to show everybody that we could play. So that
kind of prepared me. Once I got here, I know I still had something to prove at
this level, and I was able to carry that on.  
  
SHON MORRIS: Thanks. Donnie, we'll turn it to you now. You grew up in Chicago,
high school legend at Proviso East, kind of returned home to coach your high
school alma mater. What experiences and values that you learned during your
time at Colorado as a student-athlete there are you trying to carry over and
instill with your young guys at Proviso?  
  
DONNIE BOYCE: Well, I think the biggest thing I learned was how to learn how
to fight through adversity. The University of Colorado, when I got there, they
weren't on the map and known for basketball. It was more of a football school.
I actually lost more games my freshman year than I did my four years in high
school, so that was a little rough adjustment. But the main thing was it
taught me to understand sacrificing for the betterment of the team. It wasn't
until my senior year that the -- as a team, as a group, we learned that and
understood that and that's why that was our best year. Unfortunately, I broke
my leg. If I didn't break my leg, I would have had, I felt we would have had a
chance to experience the NCAA. But I also thought just having that recruitment
and being in part of the process with Chauncey Billups played a big role to
help get the university started on the right path, and they have grown into it
from, I think, my sophomore and junior year we only won 10 games, to where
they are right now.  
  
SHON MORRIS: At what point during, whether it was in college or after college,
did you decide that you wanted to go into coaching? And was there a particular
coach that kind of inspired you to maybe go in that profession?  
  
DONNIE BOYCE: Well, initially, when I got done, I looked to get into scouting
and I really didn't enjoy that. But it was actually by accident how I got into
coaching. A friend of mine was starting a local AAU and asked me, would I help
out, not knowing that he wanted me to coach. I was thinking on the lines of
maybe helping out with some drills. And it started from that experience. And I
would say my grammar school coach, high school coach, but probably put the
idea in my head about coaching, because they used to always tell me when I get
done playing my basketball career, they think I would be a great coach. And I
would always kind of counter, why would you say that? And they would always
say, I'm just standing there and you understand the rotations, you know where
everybody's supposed to be on the offensive side of the ball. And I would
always counter back, well, on offensive, I know where everybody's supposed to
be because I'm trying to find out my scoring opportunities. But those two guys
probably played the biggest impact in me deciding on the coaching.  
  
SHON MORRIS: Thanks, Donnie. Finally, we'll turn to Roosevelt. Dayton has such
an unbelievably deep tradition of college basketball. Been to the NCAA Final
Four, long, long runs in the NCAA tournament, you played for one of the
greatest coaches in college history in Don Donoher. With that in mind, what
does it mean to you to be up here on this stage right now representing Dayton
and the Flyers?  
  
ROOSEVELT CHAPMAN: Oh, this is a great feeling, a great opportunity to be
involved in the Chicago legends. The university has a great tradition of
basketball going back many decades, and I'm truly proud and honored that I
chose that school. I was pretty widely touted for colleges. And Michigan
State, Georgetown, those like that, UCLA, and for some reason or another the
University of Dayton just stuck out. It wasn't on the map like the other
schools, but they had a lot of potential. And I'm so glad that I chose that
school. I feel out of place now to come out and sometimes they want to go too
big a lot of times. They get kind of lost in the program. But that school was
a great size for me and I utilized it and it worked out great.  
  
SHON MORRIS: Roosevelt, everybody up here, there's a special place in their
heart for their alma mater and what the school meant to them. You got to, in
my opinion, the highest honor any school can give somebody that wore the
jersey. You're in the University of Dayton Athletic Hall of Fame. What does
that mean and what did that moment mean to you and to your family?  
  
ROOSEVELT CHAPMAN: Oh, it means a great deal. But a lot of people understand
that if you get an honor or something like that, you earn it. It takes a lot
of work. It takes a lot of hard work behind the closed doors. And nobody gives
you anything. You have to go out and work for it. You got to tie those shoe
strings up tight, you got to sweat. It takes a lot of sacrifice. And just
recently I just, in May I got inducted into the Ohio Hall of Fame, and that's
another big honor as well. So I just, like the other gentlemen said, I feel
blessed also.  
  
SHON MORRIS: Well, we're blessed to have all of these legends here today. How
about one more round of applause for all these four legends representing their
respective alma maters in the Chicago Legends Classic.  
  
(Applause.)  
  
And with that, we'll take some questions from the audience.  
  
Q. I would like to get a perspective from each of you. Coach,
especially, you live it every day. When you guys played, which wasn 't
terribly long ago, it was a different game, and now you got the transfer
portal to every game's televised, you're playing all hours of the day, every
day of the week. These kids are being asked to do a lot. Oh, and by the way,
go to class and get your degree. As you survey the college landscape today,
what do you think about the game that you helped put it where it is?  
CORIE BLOUNT: Well, me personally, I watch the game and I see the transition
as far as, to me, it's not as physical as it was back then, and I'm speaking
on the pro level. But on the college level, the game is a little, it's sped up
a little bit, but the demand for players are a lot more. And what I mean by
that, these kids have a lot of things to deal with, especially with the social
media aspect. I think it's hard for them to stay focused and not, kind of
like, get the big heads when they get a little fame or notoriety because now
their expectations are high. And I think it's like the gentleman said down
there, it's important that you earn it first, and a lot of these kids are
given a lot of things, and I think that kind of messes up the whole state of
college basketball. Because everybody thinks they're a pro or wants to be a
pro without putting in the full body of work to show it.  
  
DONNIE BOYCE: Like Corie said, I'm a fan of basketball so I'm always watching
all levels of basketball. But on the college level, I think the biggest change
is, kind of piggybacking off of Corie, just the outside influences. When we
were playing, I know for me personally, I didn't really have a lot of outside
people reaching for me or contacting me or being a distraction, whatever their
influence may be. On the court, I would like to see the kind of be a little
bit more fundamentally sound, but I think AAU plays a little effect in that.
The biggest thing is I didn't know when playing hard and competing at a high
level became a skill. For me, personally, you couldn't get on the floor for
any coach I played for if you didn't play if you didn't compete at a high
level. So that is probably the biggest change.  
  
RONNIE LESTER: Well, for me, the big change I see, and I'm probably the oldest
guys up here, so when I played, there was no shot clock, there was no three-
point line, so I'm kind of dating myself. But I think the three-point shot has
really changed the game tremendously. It's opened the game up so much. You are
never out of the game because of the three-point line. And I think that the
game has changed so much just because of that, the three-point line.  
  
ROOSEVELT CHAPMAN: Ronnie is a few years older than me so I can relate when
he's talking about no shot clocks, no three-point play. I used to have to get
in the hard way (laughing), so that's how I look at basketball. The game has
changed a lot. They spread out a lot more, the three-point shot, you don't see
too many pick-and-rolls no more, give-and-goes, things to that effect. It
seems like the imaging now, college game off of the pro game gradually, and so
that's what's expected to come. But it's like one of the honorees said
earlier. He said that the game has changed and I don't know if it's for the
better, but it's evolving.  
  
DONNIE BOYCE: I would like to add to that. I can give you a scenario or
something I experienced at the University of Cincinnati. When I first got
there, we played Athletes in Action and it was a scrimmage game, I mean an
exhibition game, and I shot two 3-pointers and they both went in and out. And
next thing I heard was the horn going off, and I'm walking to the bench. And I
don't know, my coach at the time, Bob Huggins, told me, don't you ever, as
long as you live, shoot another three-pointer as long as you have a University
of Cincinnati jersey on. I'm like, coach, they went in and out. He said I
wouldn't give a -- -- I got these little guys for that. And my reason for
saying that is now you got guys six-eight and up, seven-footers shooting the
three so often now that it's just becoming a part of the game. And to me, to
piggyback off what he said, the three-point game has really change the whole
evolution of basketball. And I'm not saying that in a bad sense, but for guys
like us, who like tough, gritty in the paint big men or the inside style of
basketball, it's really no longer exists.  
  
Q. Corie, looking at this as a pro game, you were there for -- you
mentioned playing with Scottie Pippen, and you were there during the glory
years. What you do think the Bulls need to do to kind of get back to where
they were?  
CORIE BLOUNT: Get Scottie Pippen and Michael Jordan back. (Laughing).  
  
No. I'm a big fan of NBA basketball. When I look at the amount of talent that
is all over the league now, it's going to be tough for the Bulls to really
just get back to that upper echelon. I mean, I think they're going to have to
probably do it through the draft. You still got the superstars and everybody
knows the superstars seem like they're gravitating towards the mild weather
cities to be able to enjoy a true NBA life still, I guess. So I think it's
going to be hard for the Bulls unless they get it through the draft or get a
big-name player to come here and really try to revamp the whole franchise. But
I'm a Bulls fan. I love the city of Chicago. It's been good to me and I would
love to see them get back to the top.  
  
Q. For Ronnie and Donnie, the game has changed a lot. One and done. We
saw the kid from Memphis yesterday. What did he play, four games, now he 's,
forget school. He's going to the NBA draft. Ronnie, best guard ever to come
out of Chicago, point guard. And that includes Isaiah. I said it. Donnie, one
of them if he is forwards ever to come out of Chicago. You both would have
been lottery picks as juniors. You both went back for your senior year. You
both got injured your senior year. What advice would you give maybe a freshman
that's getting a lot of pressure to put your name in the draft and forget
school?  
RONNIE LESTER: Well, me personally, that's always going to be a family
decision, in my opinion. That's something that, you know, it's a tough
decision to make. For me, one of the reasons why I felt I needed to come back,
there was some areas I needed to work on, personally, my outside shot, I
wanted to work on, I wanted to get a little bit more stronger. But nowadays if
I had to do it all over again, get out of the kitchen when you're hot. That's
probably the best advice that I would give.  
  
DONNIE BOYCE: For me, I think it's a personal decision when a guy decides if
he's going in the draft or not. Today, with the salaries that they're paying
today, I don't personally think you can take a chance. If you are one of the
top pics, say a Top-10 pick, I personally think you should go because there's
always a risk of getting hurt or something else going wrong. So I think if you
are a top pick, if you're a lottery pick, I think with what they're, how you
can set yourself up with an NBA contract, I think you probably should go.  
  
Q. Donnie, I talked with Tad Boyle about trying to recruit out of
Chicago. Guys like you are actually few and far between, the guys from here
that went to Boulder. Even though they have had a track record of success
under Coach Boyle, there are so many power conference programs within a few
hour drive of here. What would it take to pique a kid 's interest to head west
and go to a program like that?  
DONNIE BOYCE: Well, I always think the style of play plays a big part. I think
Coach Boyle's style is perfect for kids here in Chicago. I think for him to
reconnect in this area the main thing that he probably would need was a guy
like me on his staff (laughing).  
  
No, no. But on a serious note, it's just about doing your due diligence,
Chicago is always a hotbed full of talent. The AAU game has probably played a
bigger factor now days compared to when we were being recruited it was all
through the high school coaches. But probably build a better relationship with
the high school coaches would probably help as well, reestablishing, not only
in Chicago, I told Coach Boyle he should try to recruit all the major cities.
That's one thing Coach Terrence and Coach Whittenburg, they made an emphasis
of trying to recruit the major cities and if they can pluck one kid here from
Chicago, one from Detroit, one from L.A. -- when I was there we had kids from
those cities and even though we didn't have the winning win/loss stats we were
looking for, I think it helped build the culture and it helped build to where
the program is now today.  
  
Q. Corie, your comments were interesting, they don 't -- rarely do they
refer to it as the center position anymore, the day of the big man - now Iowa
has a kid, Luka Garza, who's got seven double double, he's leading the nation
in scoring for big men, he's been compared to Jack Sikma because he can hit
the step back, he can score with either hand. I've heard him compared to Kevin
McHale. It's kind of a sad testament though, a testimony, when you look at the
starting lineups any more on a spreadsheet and they're all forwards or they're
big guards. What does that say about basketball? Are they intentionally trying
to get away from the post-play?  
CORIE BLOUNT: I don't think they're intentionally getting away with it, I just
think that things change and styles change. Me and Donnie were talking
earlier, AAU is a guard-oriented style of play. And when you go to an AAU game
you mostly see up-and-down basketball where they're getting it out and they're
letting it go as soon as it gets past half court. So that's just what these
kids are really enthused by and that's how they want to play. We were talking
also like he's coaching and I'm coaching, and the first thing our kids do is
when they go in the gym they don't even go in the paint any more to warm up,
they're shooting three. So that's just the sign of the times that this is what
kids like to do now it's either dunk or shoot a three, the mid-range game is
gone, I think and that's just got, that, as fans I think that's what we got to
get used to until another Shaq or a Jack somebody that's so dominant in the
paint that all the teams say, man, we got to go find more guys like that. And
I don't think we have that yet, so I think that has a lot to do with it.  
  
Q. Ronnie, I 'm sure we know who you want to win the Big-10 but here we
are two games, two conference games in, everybody's 1-1 except for two teams,
one team is 2-0, the other is 0-2. How to you size up the race, who do you
think the major players are going to be in the conference league race?  
RONNIE LESTER: I keep up with Iowa, I keep up with the Big Ten through Iowa.
Michigan State's always good, looks like Maryland's pretty good this year. I
would say those two teams probably have the best chance of winning the league.  
  
DONNIE BOYCE: Yeah, Michigan too.  
  
RONNIE LESTER: Yeah, I think Michigan is going to be pretty good, but I would
put them behind those two teams. I think Ohio State's pretty good too, forgot
about Ohio State. The Big-10's always a tough league, it's always a tough
league. And they will get a lot of teams in the tournament, they will get a
lot of teams in the tournament.  
  
DONNIE BOYCE: The one thing I find interesting about the Big-10 and we're
talking about the evolution of the game, it was known as the bump and grind
type of league and it's starting to move more now into the pick and pop,
spread four league. You look at a school like Wisconsin where they put four
shooters out there, five shooters out there at all times and to spread you out
and run the motion offense. And they have been successful with their style,
but I'm used to the bump and grind, it's going to be a dog fight every night,
kind of wish the Big-10 was still that way, but the evolution of the game has
kind of changed the Big-10 outlook overall.  
  
SHON MORRIS: Any other questions for the legends? If not, thanks a lot, guys,
we really appreciate your time.

Butler - 70, Purdue - 61  
  
Q. Matt, another kind of tough night shooting the ball. Seemed like they
just couldn 't find a way to get out of that little funk again.  
MATT PAINTER: You know, you're going to have some games where you struggle
shooting the ball from the perimeter. I think that's the one thing that we've
put a lot of time into recruiting people that can shoot threes. But when you
get the ball to the rim and you miss lay-ups, especially against a team
without a shot blocker -- that's what I told them in there, our concentration
level has got to be better, and that's what we've got to work on, whether
that's a post move or a drive or a dump-down, or an offensive rebound put-
back. We had a lot of opportunities in and around the basket that we just
didn't finish. We've got to do a better job with that.  
  
Q. Is it as simple as just shooting or is there a little bit more to
some of the woes that you guys are going through?  
MATT PAINTER: I think the woes that we get to with our guys is that I think it
affects other parts of our game. You know, you get the ball at the post and
you're five feet away and you get to your move and you miss it. You drive and
you get a lay-up on -- we had three, I think, breakaway lay-ups that we
missed. We probably had four or five put-back type point-blank lay-ups that we
missed. I think that is discouraging from a player standpoint because nobody
is trying to miss them. It's like missing a free throw, like nobody is trying
to miss a free throw. But it's discouraging. You feel as a player you should
make lay-ups and you should make free throws, and then it affects other part
of the game, and you kind of get down on yourself.  
  
Collectively we're not a mature group. We're just not. We're mature people,
but we're not a mature basketball team yet. We've got to do a better job of
being connected. We've got to do a better job of just being consistent. A lot
of times with groups that haven't done it yet, it's not the failures that mess
them up. They'll respond to a failure. They don't respond to success. When you
beat Virginia, that messes with them way more than when you get beat by Butler
because it's obvious people leaving this game right here, it's obvious. The
things I just said, it's easy to say.  
  
But when you play Virginia, is that who you are or was that an outlier? Or is
this who we are, or is this an outlier? You get into that with young groups
and young players and even some guys' experience because now trying to get
them in their roles and trying to get them to do what they're doing, no matter
what your role is, you've got to play hard. You've got to compete. You've got
to be able to help the next guy in front of you, and right now we're not
consistent with that.  
  
Q. Trevion, with Matt out, I know you 're trying to pick up the
offensive load down there in and around the basket. How difficult has it been
for you to try to make good decisions on each possession whether to try to
score or kick it back out?  
TREVION WILLIAMS: Just most importantly for us was the defensive end. He helps
a lot on the defensive end because he's so long. It's harder to score with
him. I'm not much of a shot blocker so I try to stay solid without fouling. I
struggle in the past with like get I early fouls and taking myself out of the
game, so it's been kind of tough without him. But just got to move on and keep
playing.  
  
Q. Eric, I don 't know if you just heard what Coach said about this not
being a mature group, being mature people but not a mature team, where do you
feel like that comes from from here on out? How does this team have to grow
into what he was talking about?  
ERIC HUNTER JR.: I mean, I think it comes from just trying to be a consistent
team as far as putting games together. But it starts with putting practices
together, putting workouts together and just being able to do the same thing
over and over again and just kind of be repetitive and play hard and wanting
to win.  
  
Q. Eric, is it as simple as poor shooting, or as Coach mentioned, there
's a lot of other things that when you guys miss shots, it affects the other
parts of your game.  
ERIC HUNTER JR.: I mean, I think it's a nice part of it, simply because, like
he just said to us, the only way you instill confidence in yourself is just
being in the gym, working out and seeing the ball go in on a day-to-day basis.
But I mean, I think it's more defense than anything.  
  
Q. You guys have had a very difficult non-conference schedule. Do you
feel like at least from the wins and losses both that you can take a lot out
of what 's gone on in November and December now that the Big Ten season is
getting ready to start?  
AARON WHEELER: Yeah, I think that's kind of why Coach kind of tries to
schedule hard for us in the non-conference just so when it comes toward March
when we're playing great teams every night, even in the Big Ten schedule, just
so we're used to playing that type of competition. So we know what to look for
or like what to look for. I mean, obviously we don't want to lose, but I feel
like we can learn a lot from our losses, we just have to build on that and
improve.  
  
Q. Trevion, how do you guys get back closer to what you did against
Virginia as opposed to maybe what happened tonight?  
TREVION WILLIAMS: I mean, I think we're just fine, like I said. Just move on
and get better each practice. Last year we walked out of this building 6-5,
and I believe we can do the same thing we did last year. You know, things
happen. It's a part of it. But we've just got to get better.  
  
Q. Aaron, just for you personally, to have the kind of game you did
tonight, to see the ball go in the basket, what does that mean for you as you
get into the rest of the season now?  
AARON WHEELER: I mean, it's good to see it go in, but I feel like regardless
if it goes in or not, I'm going to shoot open shots. My coaches, my teammates
give me confidence to shoot, so it's obviously nice to see it go in, but they
always give me the confidence to just continue to shoot, and I just have to
keep putting extra work.  
  
Q. Just kind of for whoever wants this, it 's kind of been a bit of a
season long deal where you guys have gotten really good opportunities at the
rim, but struggled to finish them. Is there any common denominator to that? Is
there any sort of solution that sort of comes to mind right away?  
ERIC HUNTER JR.: I think it's just concentration, simple as that. I mean, even
the one I smoked in the first half, I was too busy worrying about what was
going on behind me instead of just going at the rim and finishing it myself.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: BUTLER VS
PURDUE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+BUTLER+VS+PURDUE)

  

## December 21, 2019

  

### [LaVall Jordan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34451)

### [Bryce Golden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38402)

### [Aaron Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36726)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Butler - 70, Purdue - 61  
  
LAVALL JORDAN: Obviously playing in this event each year is just something
that's great for the state of Indiana, it's great for all four schools and fan
bases. We're privileged to be a part of it, and it's four teams out there
really well-coached, competing like crazy, and first game and second game,
everybody is fighting for their programs, for their teammates and for pride.
Proud of our guys for the resiliency.  
  
Didn't get a great start. I thought they came out really aggressive,
especially on the backboards, and we had to respond coming out of the media,
and these guys have done that pretty much all year, where you ask them to do
it and they grit their teeth and they respond. So that was something we talked
about, and then they came out and we changed the mood of the game.  
  
Then we had guys step up. Obviously Kamar gets two fouls and it's a next-man-
up, don't-flinch mindset. Bryce Golden, his motor, a lot of credit to him for
what he's done with his body over the summer, his commitment to his teammates,
to train, to be ready for moments like this, where he had to just go down
there and fight and work.  
  
They have a really good team. Matt does a great job. Obviously with Haarms out
it's different for them, but so much respect for them, and I thought our guys
played with the respect that Purdue deserved.  
  
Q. Bryce, you had 14 points today, and like Coach said, with Kamar being
blitzed in the pick-and-roll and being defended really tightly, how were you
able to score? Seemed like they weren 't defending you in the mid range. How
were you able to score with Haarms out?  
BRYCE GOLDEN: Yeah, obviously Haarms is a long guy, shot blocker, but
obviously we've got Kamar coming off pick-and-rolls that requires a lot of
attention from the other team. Get him open, that's my first job, and then I'm
always ready as a secondary receiver. They did a good job finding me today. He
recognized that. All the guys coming off ball screens recognized that they
were up pretty hard, so I was ready to be a secondary receiver, and yeah,
that's it.  
  
Q. I think they were 8 of 23 in the paint. Seemed like you guys were
fighting everything they got in there, especially Trevion. What went well with
defending him and keeping the ball out of the post in general?  
LAVALL JORDAN: Yeah, just mindset. He's low down there, he's improved, he's in
much better shape and he's really skilled. I thought Bryce set a tone early
just being physical without fouling him and walling him around the basket, and
then he throws it up and it's hard to get him off. He's got a good feel for
where the ball is going to go. Derrik did an unbelievable job when he was in,
just effort from the post, moving around, being a wall. I thought our ball
pressure was good so they couldn't get in there as much, something we had
talked about in preparation for this one.  
  
Q. Is Kamar feeling okay? He kind of walked off gingerly a couple times,
which I know he sometimes does anyway, but I was checking to see if physically
he 's feeling fine.  
LAVALL JORDAN: No, he's fine.  
  
Q. You 've talked about balance on this team, but what does it say that
you've had such big wins the last two games without him scoring a lot? He's
been doing other things but not scoring the ball as much.  
LAVALL JORDAN: Yeah, I think it's a credit to him and his teammates. This is a
group that has a ton of trust and love for each other, and so Kamar is a
willing passer. He's going to make the right basketball play. They were really
loaded up on him, so Bryce benefitted some, he found cutters at the basket,
and he was just willing to move the ball. He trusts the rest of the group and
guys trust themselves. You've got to trust your work. We've got guys that live
in the gym, put in the work and they're ready for the moment.  
  
I think we had 16 assists on 21 made field goals. Turned it over too much in
the first half. We had eight and cut it to four in the second half. But 16-21
is pretty good.  
  
Q. Aaron playing off of that basically with Kamar being out a lot with
foul trouble, what did you do differently to find guys other shots, and even
when he was being loaded up on, how did you go about taking advantage of
that?  
AARON THOMPSON: I think we just stuck to our offense. I think we just trusted
our offense a little bit more and tried to focus on defense so we could focus
on the defensive end and then get stops so we could get out in transition and
run, but just trusting the offense and getting the ball more to the sides and
making them guard for longer, we knew if we made them guard for longer it
would be tougher for them to keep up with the pace of our cuts and stuff like
that.  
  
Q. LaVall, I know defense is mainly effort so it 's hard to say when
you're trying very hard all the time, it's probably hard to say when you're
better defensively than others, but can you rank this game defensively? How
good were you guys on the defensive end?  
LAVALL JORDAN: Yeah, I thought we were pretty good, and not at the start but
the second, kind of the middle portion of the game, right, if you were to
place second quarter, third quarter. Then we got up, and when you're down like
that, you get a little more freedom to just let the ball fly, so they made a
couple threes, and then we missed some switches, but I thought for the most
part, guys were locked in. Christian David comes right in the game, gets a
block on one end, takes a charge on the other, Jordan Tucker pressures the
ball and gets a deflection, gets a steal. I thought for about three-fourths of
the game we were pretty good. Bryce Golden is going to be running as soon as
we get back because he let him hit the three to get to 60. He let them hit the
three to get to 60.  
  
Q. Aaron, you had six assists today, and like I said before, they were
really blitzing the pick-and-roll and they were doubling on drives, early help
side. Having Bryce down low, how was he so physical and how was he able to
finish off your passes down low?  
AARON THOMPSON: I mean, I'm not him, so -- but I mean -- I don't know. He
squares his shoulders up.  
  
BRYCE GOLDEN: We're both from the same area. We've got connections down there.  
  
AARON THOMPSON: Yeah, it's a DMV thing, put it that way. DMV, where we're
from.  
  
Q. You mentioned Derrik earlier. First of all, how important was he, and
what did you see him do well, and you mentioned Jordan being out on the
perimeter, obviously he got some switches on Trevion, seemed like he did that
well. Seemed like he was able to guard perimeter and post pretty well. What
would you say about the importance of each of those guys?  
LAVALL JORDAN: Yeah, I thought Derrik, I thought he had great minutes when he
came in, especially on the defensive end. We kind of subbed him in and played
some match-up ball with Williams, and he did a really good job making him
catch it away from the basket, and just being physical and seven feet tall --
second half he did a heck of a job just fronting him, not even letting him
catch it, so it was really good. And he's moving a lot better, feeling a lot
better. He ran the floor, got a lay-up on the run, on the pick-and-roll. Just
good to see him moving like he's starting to move, getting back to himself.  
  
Jordan was -- I thought he had really solid minutes, as well, especially late
against the pressure, him on the ball. Defensively he was locked in, and so
he's grown a ton on that end of the court, and it's good to see him go out
there against a team like this and have success.  
  
Q. LaVall and Aaron both, it looked like one of Purdue 's late game
tactics was to foul Aaron on purpose sending him to the line. I don't know
that I'd seen a Butler opponent try that before. Was there any thought of
taking Aaron out? And Aaron, how did you respond to that? I'm not sure that
you've seen that.  
LAVALL JORDAN: No thought. They used to foul Roos Jones, they used to foul Ron
Nored. When you're a bulldog, you step up there and you win the game. No
thought to taking him out.  
  
AARON THOMPSON: I can make free throws late game, I can make free throws any
time. They weren't falling early, so I guess they thought that would work that
they could still come and foul me. But I'm confident. I put the work in every
day, so yeah.  
  
Q. LaVall, Butler is 11-1, but I still sense that this team, amongst
yourselves, have still identified a lot of growth areas. Probably some people
look at Butler 's 11-1 record and think are they going to get any better. Is
Butler going to get any better?  
LAVALL JORDAN: Of course. Honestly, I know it sounds like coach-speak, we
don't talk a lot about winning and losing. We compete. We're a team, and we're
passionate about daily improvement. That's Butler. These guys do it. They go
at each other in practice to get better. They get in the gym, they improve
themselves, they get in the film room with the coaches. We still haven't put
together 40 minutes when we've had opportunities to see opponents, so we're
still hungry and hunting for 40 minutes.  
  
But obviously there's a lot of resistance when you go against good teams like
Purdue. But they have more in them and we're going to challenge them to get it
out of them.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: NOTRE DAME VS
INDIANA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+NOTRE+DAME+VS+INDIANA)

  

## December 21, 2019

  

### [Archie Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23486)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Indiana - 62, Notre Dame - 60  
  
ARCHIE MILLER: Well, we're fortunate to be sitting here in the winner's
circle. Thought we played really well for I guess 25 to 27, 28 minutes of the
game, and we let our offense sort of frustrate us, and against that type of
team with the way that they shoot and do some things, they can get back in it
quick, and I thought we gave them a lot of opportunities to do that, with not
getting back, not being organized. We really struggled there for a good
portion of the game in the second half.  
  
We were able to get to about the five-minute mark, especially in the last
three minutes, and I was confident our guys were going to make some plays.
We've been in that situation. We had great attitude, regardless of the
circumstances in the game, which is what you like to see, and a couple key
plays by two freshmen. Trayce able to finish underneath out of bounds, and
then obviously Al makes a really good one more off of Trayce's inside out, and
Armaan, who was big all day really kind of showed his courage and just what he
means to the team in terms of how he's sort of embraced his role this year.
He's a terrific player. He's a great kid, good teammate. Happy for him.  
  
But for us, we obviously have a lot of work to do. We can keep getting better
in a lot of areas. For a while there we looked like a good team. For a while
there we didn't. But I think when you're in this type of environment on that
neutral setting against a good team with the crowd, you're starting to see
game experience and real stuff.  
  
We're fortunate to win. We'll take it, and we'll take this break right here,
deep breath. Arkansas is clearly next up for us, and Simon Scott, which will
be a great opponent, great night for us to be able to play before we open Big
Ten.  
  
Q. You mentioned the last three minutes there, and that 's when you put
Armaan back in the game. Talk about your level of confidence in him coming in
--  
ARCHIE MILLER: I give -- I mean, your staff is everything to you during the
game. Sometimes your feel is a little different. But Armaan was playing really
well all game, and sometimes you go with the older guys and sometimes you go a
little bit more experienced. But Armaan had played really well up until that
point. We were struggling offensively, and he was the one guy that had made a
few plays for us. Able to throw him right back in there, and it's not easy to
do what he did. It's not easy to do that, what he did.  
  
But you know, to his credit, like I said, he's got a great attitude. You pull
for guys like him.  
  
Q. He hadn 't made many threes before today. Had he made extra shooting
recently or had you given him the green light and talked to him and told him
to let it fly?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Are you saying his 14 percent from three was --  
  
Q. I wasn 't going to mention that.  
ARCHIE MILLER: I did, and he did that, too, and he needed to stop walking
around with his head down and acting like people didn't know who he was
because he wasn't shooting the ball real well. He can shoot it. He just gotten
off to a tough start. Sometimes that happens for all players, but in
particular young players that can really steamroll them. He hasn't let it
impact his attitude, and he hasn't let it impact his coachability.  
  
I think we finished the Nebraska game, talked at length about confidence, and
he works at it every day, and when he shoots it, I think everybody on our team
thinks he has a chance to make it. He's not the percentage that he is in terms
of how he actually shoots the ball every day. But he stepped up with good
confidence, and mindset was really good.  
  
We're encouraging to continue to do that for us because he's a smooth
offensive player. He knows how to play. He makes good decisions, and for him
to be able to stick some shots for us finally was a big deal. We've been
waiting on a couple of these guys to open it up from behind the line because
they're pretty good shooters when they're open, especially on the inside-out
ones that they're getting. It was good for Armaan. His percentage doesn't
dictate the type of shooter that he is, and as most guys do, you get taken
aback by it. He had originally I think was worried about it too much, and I
think he's stopped worrying about it. What was he going to do, go to 12
percent? It's like, stop worrying about it, you're eventually going to get
your percentage to climb up because you're a good shooter, so just hang in
there.  
  
Q. I know at Wisconsin when they faced adversity you were pretty upset
they were hanging heads, but it seemed like their energy level never really
slowed down today even though it was trouble, so you had to be happy with how
they kept grinding and found a way to finish at the end.  
ARCHIE MILLER: Yeah, unfortunately we had to learn a hard lesson. The stick-
to-itiveness and the togetherness and the players grabbing each other by the
jerseys and holding themselves accountable at different times in the game was
needed, and that didn't happen that day. I think it's happened in the UConn
game, it happened in the Nebraska game, and now it's happened here again where
we're finding different ways to gut it out, finding ways to get a key stop,
make a key play, and different guys are doing it. It's not a one-trick pony,
so to speak. We have different guys making plays.  
  
For us, though, we have a good attitude right now with good leadership. You
know, it's tough. We've got 11 guys. All are trying to get in the game and
play more minutes, and when the game gets tight and you do some things,
sometimes minutes go down, but for the most part we've been able to really
hang tough and show no cracks in the armor in terms of team over individual.  
  
That's probably our biggest challenge as a group is the return from Christmas.
No outside distractions and try to find a way to stay collectively in the
moment and find a way to finish the non-conference some way because when you
get into conference play, every game is going to be so hard.  
  
Q. You talked about the way Armaan has embraced his role. In what ways
has he developed or changed since you first got him?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Well, he's got to become a more vocal kid. He's -- I don't want
to say a timid personality, but he's reserved, he's quiet on the court. I
think he's a vibrant kid, so if he has the ability to show some of that
vibrance on the floor a little bit more, I think it would be infectious. We've
tried to encourage him to do that, and I think he's done that. He's gotten
better defensively. As a young player you're out there sometimes and you're at
the mercy of the other coaches trying to go at you. He's been able to answer
the bell for us a few times defensively for us, but I just think he has a real
calm, smooth approach offensively. He knows how to play the game. He makes
solid, sound plays, and he's not afraid, and I think as he's gotten a little
bit older, the bigger the lights of the game, the more he's been able to step
up, whether it was at Florida State, made huge plays down the stretch of that
one, or whether it was this one, or even finishing the other night.  
  
But Armaan is a really good player. He's going to continue to get even better
as he gets older and bigger and stronger. The experience that he's getting
right now as a freshman, him and Trayce in particular, they play a vital role
for us. Those guys obviously have a lot of room to grow as they keep getting a
little bit older. But I think Armaan's greatest attribute is the type of
person he is. He's just a terrific kid. It's just hard not to pull for him,
hard not to be around. There's no bad days with him. Got to get your dauber up
every once in a while, and I think his body language in terms of being a
little bit down sometimes comes through that he's not had that muscle behind
him sometimes, and I think that's what we've just tried to continue to find of
force out of him a little bit. But all in all, couldn't be happier for him.  
  
Q. John Mooney finished with 10 rebounds but Joey Brunk out-rebounded
him with 14? How vital was Joey 's presence?  
ARCHIE MILLER: Joey was terrific on the glass all game, especially in the
first half and second half. He gave us second-chance opportunities. We've said
it all along how this team has to be successful, obviously drawing fouls and
being able to win the battle on the glass.  
  
We only turned it over 12 times. That's good. We were able to be plus 10 on
the backboard. That's huge. We didn't get smashed on the offensive glass too
bad. I thought we were able to rebound the ball really well. It's one of the
reasons that we've won a few games here in the last couple games. The free
throw disparity tonight indicates that obviously Notre Dame has sort of won on
that style. They don't typically foul a whole lot, so it's hard, and when we
struggle to score, sort of the MO is find a way to get to the foul line. That
wasn't really happening tonight, getting to the foul line, so in those long
droughts we weren't able to chop it up and get a couple free throws here and
there. You get fouled and you're able to go four free throws in a row. We just
weren't able to consistently get to the line in that stretch where our offense
wasn't functioning real well.  
  
Now, last three or four minutes we were better. We were able to get the ball
where we wanted to get to. We got clean looks. Some of them went down, some of
them didn't. But Joe was big in his role in the game. I thought for the most
part defensively he was also good covering ball screens and doing some things
there.  
  
Q. You talked about kind of the difference between Wisconsin when you
didn 't feel like guys were kind of pulling each other along in tough moments.
How do you grow that? Do you challenge guys or is it maybe something this team
has had to figure out, go through it and kind of turn it into a disaster a
little bit on them once but that allows them to understand?  
ARCHIE MILLER: I think after the Wisconsin game you have to look each other
sort of in the eye and explain, certain guys are in different roles. Certain
guys aren't a young guy anymore, whether that's Justin Smith and how important
his role is with our team, Al Durham being an older player, Devonte, De'Ron.
At some level the players have to own the team, and when things aren't going
real well, typically that's when your alpha dogs and your leaders sort of step
up and rally the troops. You don't even have to be in the game to have a great
voice in the locker room or a huddle. That was missing completely from 1
through 11 on that day.  
  
Since then, I think as you address it, some guys are now way more noticeable
in terms of approaching, we're okay, hang in there. There's a voice. Whatever
it may be, move on to the next play. There's much more of that talk with our
team, which is a big, big component to becoming a good team as guys obviously
being able to communicate and stick with one another through the good and the
bad.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: NOTRE DAME VS
INDIANA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+NOTRE+DAME+VS+INDIANA)

  

## December 21, 2019

  

### [Armaan Franklin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38229)

### [Joey Brunk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38175)

### [Trayce Jackson-Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38228)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Indiana - 62, Notre Dame - 60  
  
Q. Armaan, you hadn 't really shot it well from three until today. Had
you been getting extra shots up? Did Coach Miller encourage you to keep
shooting? How did it develop today that you were able to hit four threes?  
ARMAAN FRANKLIN: Even though I was in a slump everybody was telling me to keep
shooting. Putting in extra work after practice, before we practice really
helps a lot, and we saw it helped a lot today.  
  
Q. Joey, the key with the rebounding in this game, everybody knew it
going in, it had to happen. Had 11 rebounds in the first half. Talk about what
it was like in that battle and winning as much as you did?  
JOEY BRUNK: You know, Notre Dame has got a great group of guys inside, and I
wanted to be competitive and bring energy to our team and I knew that was
something I could control from the get-go and I wanted to crash as often as I
could.  
  
Q. Coach kind of talked after Wisconsin about just feeling like you guys
weren 't staying together enough in that game in some tough moments and he
feels like he's seen growth from that, and UConn, obviously today kind of
particularly that second half, how do you grow that? It's an intangible thing,
something you can't just rep in practice. How do you get better in areas like
that?  
JOEY BRUNK: I think positivity helps a lot, and there's a lot of belief
between all of us and our coaching staff, and we knew we had to stay the
course when stuff wasn't quite going our way. That's sports. There's ups and
downs and we had to stay connected throughout all that.  
  
Q. Armaan, take me through the final possession where you hit the shot
that put you up 62-60 to win the game.  
ARMAAN FRANKLIN: I was in the corner. I forgot who drove but they kicked it to
Al and Al had enough confidence in me to swing at one more, so I just went up
with it and knocked it down.  
  
Q. Trayce, in the second half you struggled at the rim and then you got
that possession at the end where you dunk to tie the game. What 's going
through your mind to keep consistently going at it and get that bucket at the
end?  
TRAYCE JACKSON-DAVIS: Really my teammates just telling me to keep going.
Missed a few bunnies, but just got to keep going at the rim strong and then
Armaan threw me a great pass and I finished it.  
  
Q. When Notre Dame goes up five, kind of slipping working on offense.
What are the conversations like you 're having with each other? Miller said
players were holding each other -- kind of saying stuff. What were you trying
to emphasize to get back in it?  
TRAYCE JACKSON-DAVIS: Most definitely just holding each other accountable.
There were some times where our team was selfish, but we got that worked out
in the final two minutes. We were swinging the ball and the extra pass Al made
was just a great example of how the last two minutes were.  
  
Q. It 's a little bit clich� but you're the three Indy guys on the team.
You all seemed up for it from the beginning of the game. What does it mean for
the three of you to put in the performances you did in this game?  
TRAYCE JACKSON-DAVIS: Just to play in front of our home crowd with the three
other big teams that are here, I just thought it was fun to put on a show for
them. They showed us a lot of love, so I saw a lot of red in the crowd, so I
thought that was great to see.  
  
ARMAAN FRANKLIN: Yeah, you've always got to love playing at home. Even though
we're not that far from home, it was still good to play in home court.  
  
JOEY BRUNK: Good to be back in our city.  
  
Q. Armaan, along those same lines, I know you have some South Bend ties.
Any extra juice or motivation in this game?  
ARMAAN FRANKLIN: Not really. I mean, my aunt used to coach there, my mom
worked there. I knew a couple coaches on the staff there, so I mean, there's
not really much to it, but yeah.  
  
Q. Armaan, I 'm assuming Victor probably came to see you guys in the
locker room afterwards. After you hit that three he was going crazy saying, I
told you guys. Did he say anything to you after the game?  
ARMAAN FRANKLIN: He just told me keep my confidence up and keep shooting it.
No matter how many times you miss, just keep shooting it, that's all you've
got to do.

# [CROSSROADS CLASSIC: NOTRE DAME VS
INDIANA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=CROSSROADS+CLASSIC%3A+NOTRE+DAME+VS+INDIANA)

  

## December 21, 2019

  

### [Mike Brey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13733)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Indiana - 62, Notre Dame - 60  
  
MIKE BREY: It's hard to beat good teams, even when you get up five with three
minutes.  
  
Q. Why is it so hard?  
MIKE BREY: I have no idea. Probably their defense.  
  
Q. What did you guys change in terms of the way you played them
defensively?  
MIKE BREY: We were playing a little faster. We were getting down the floor and
we got some stuff -- we actually got stops. We had nine out of ten stops, and
so we didn't have to take the ball out of bounds and play against the set
defense, and we got some early offense. But you know, when their defense was
set with their athletic ability, which took its toll on us over 40 minutes,
they've got great bodies, it kind of -- it was hard to get anything good. And
again, I love how we gave ourselves a shot. But you know, got to see if we can
finish better.  
  
Q. When you were down 17, what did you say in the huddle?  
MIKE BREY: You know, those guys -- I think it was more our old guys talking --
you know, their leadership is good. It's a long game, you know. There was a
lot of time left when you were down 17. There were going to be a lot of
possessions. I wish we could have dug in defensively in man-to-man better to
start the game. I don't think we did that at all in the first half. And so now
you're digging out of a hole.  
  
Sometimes you almost don't deserve to win it when you've played defense for 15
minutes instead of 32.  
  
Q. Franklin only made four three-pointers (indiscernible).  
MIKE BREY: Yeah, we felt that we had to give looks from outside because
they're so potent inside. They're so hard -- we were helping in the post, and
we're going to have to live with some of that stuff. And to his credit, he
stepped up and made some big ones. But you know, they are so physical down
there that you have to go in and help, and jamming it up and helping helped us
in that nine out of ten stop stretch that got us back into it, but the big
possession when they swung it around to him, I almost felt like we maybe
violated the basketball gods a little too much and not guarded the arc, and he
rose up -- he's the one who hit it in the corner, right? He rose up and made a
big one. It's a big-time play.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 27, 2019

  

### [Mike Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20740)

### [Tyrece Radford](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38296)

### [Landers Nolley II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38279)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
BYU - 90, Virginia Tech - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
MIKE YOUNG: Well, needless to say, Brigham Young has a very good basketball
team with a heck of a coach. I think a lot of Mark. And what they do
offensively is difficult and I was worried about some coverages, and I thought
we did a fair job. Nine first half threes is embarrassing, but I thought we
did a fair job in certain sequences of the half.  
  
In the second half, they played like old people and we played like little
fellas and they got the best of us. Y'all go ahead.  
  
Q. Could you both talk about what you take out of here? You beat
Michigan State and then two tough losses. What do you take out of this trip?  
LANDERS NOLLEY II: This trip, you take the good with the bad. You learn from
both. You add what you need to add going forward and you move on.  
  
TYRECE RADFORD: I'm going to go off what he said. We did beat a high-ranked
team, but after that we had to move on to the next game and bring the same
intensity and that's about it.  
  
MIKE YOUNG: Is that it? Is that it? Can we get them out of here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Yup. You can go join your team. Any questions for Coach?  
  
Q. You guys shoot 31-58 from the field, 50 percent from three-point. You
only turn the ball over eight times and you lose by 13.  
MIKE YOUNG: Got to guard a little bit better. That's the short answer. Got to
guard a little bit better. They make it hard. They got a number of guys that
can shoot it and five guys that can pass, catch, and shoot. And Mark does a
good job. I really like some of their actions. I thought, we thought going in
we were going to score plenty enough to win. Can we get enough stops to win?
And the answer to that was no. Anything else?  
  
Q. You seemed to have TJ kind of bottled up. He got in foul trouble in
the first half and then they kind of picked up pace a little bit in the second
half and it appeared that folks were scrambling. What was happening
defensively there when they went on a run?  
MIKE YOUNG: I thought we were a lot more cohesive and connected in the first
half. And Coach Odom over there can tell you, you do this thing long enough
and if you don't hang in there and continue to fight, there's one shot that
can break the back and then they start going in from all corners, and that's
what happened. One shot goes down or a couple of shots goes down and then that
thing opens up. And when you can put five guys on the floor, four at all
times, like Mark can, the ball gets rolling downhill on you and it's not very
pleasant. And that happened tonight.  
  
I think we went through our first six opponents our, first six opponents we
held under 60 points or thereabouts. Five of six under 40 percent from three.
And then we ran into the Flyers last night and this bunch. Suffice to say
we've got a lot to talk about when we get back to Blacksburg.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 27, 2019

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [Devon Dotson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36865)

### [Udoka Azubuike](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35153)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Kansas - 90, Dayton - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
BILL SELF: Well I don't know how people felt, maybe not the most artistic at
times. That was a great basketball game. Two good teams competing against each
other and in a terrific atmosphere. Proud to be a part of it and certainly
very fortunate that we came out on top. But that was a lot of fun and it was
probably the least control I can remember having from the sideline because
it's so loud. And our place is loud, our place isn't any louder than that
because you have space in our place. There's no space in this one. And so I
thought our guys competed and of course, these two were absolutely terrific.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks coach. We'll open it up for questions for the players.  
  
Q. Udoka, can you talk about the battle inside there with Obi? All game
long, it seemed like back and forth. It seemed really fun.  
UDOKA AZUBUIKE: Well, Obi is a great player. He was really good down the
stretch for their team. It was a battle between me and him. I mean, he was
really good. I mean, they tried to play inside out with him. And then when he
got the ball he tried to make plays for his teammates. And also my teammates
trusted me enough to give me the ball and I did the same.  
  
Q. Your third game in three days and you played all 45 minutes. You
still had the burst at the end, you were kind of turning the corner on the
pick-and-roll and beating them to the rim. Do you just forget about the
exhaustion out there or how is it at the end of a game like that?  
DEVON DOTSON: Yeah, at that point you just got to tough it out. I mean, I
really didn't feel it. I think I could have played a little bit longer. But
with that much intensity and that much adrenaline going, you don't really feel
tired. Your whole focus is to try to win that game. I'm proud of the guys.
Every one of them stepped up and so I'm happy.  
  
Q. When you came back you talked about not winning the trophy last year.
You 've got one sitting right next to you now. Doesn't look like you're
letting it go.  
DEVON DOTSON: I'm not. I mean, this is the start of it. Yeah, the first of
many. I mean, so we're not satisfied. Looking to, we're going to enjoy this
one, though, but we're looking to get back to work.  
  
Q. I also wondered what you thought of Dok 's start to OT? Not just
inside but he knocks in free throws. We're always on him about that, but got
to talk about them when they go in?  
DEVON DOTSON: Dominant, man. I mean, they threw that one at him and you know
the result when they do that. So he's the most dominant big in the country and
he imposed his will today, knocked down some clutch free throws. He played
awesome.  
  
Q. For Devon: The way that you were attacking and getting your offense,
and then also with Udoka when you think of the two-man game and things like
that and the perimeter and the inside, was this today maybe the finest example
you 've seen of kind of the height of your potential of you two playing
together?  
DEVON DOTSON: Yeah, right. I mean, when he has it going and the attention is
on him that opens up for other players. So it's just kind of a 1-2 punch. We
read the defense, take what's given to us. We know that if we can get the ball
down low, we're going to go there every time. We know if they're doubling, we
got to look for some other things. So my job is to put pressure on the defense
to make plays for others and myself and try to get the win.  
  
Q. Who is going to keep that trophy?  
UDOKA AZUBUIKE: I'm keeping it. (Laughing).  
  
DEVON DOTSON: Those guys. (Laughing).  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let the two of you get back to your team. Thank you.
Congratulations. Open it up for questions for coach.  
  
Q. At a time when folks are talking about position-less basketball and,
like, yesterday you were talking about it felt like a Big-10 game. You went
Patric Ewing today. You go low to the big guy and he delivers. Talk about his
development and what that meant offensively in terms of helping you.  
BILL SELF: Well, he gets more touches when we play four guards around him as
opposed to another big just because the floor's spaced a little bit. But he's
a, he wouldn't be here if he hadn't been hurt two of the last three years and
only play -- he's only played a year and a half going into this year and he's
a senior. So he hasn't caught many breaks health-wise. But he has developed
and he's worked really hard on his touch and his free throws, and even the
ones he missed actually looked good tonight. So I'm proud of him for a lot of
reasons. But the biggest thing is just I thought both teams competed and my
guys really competed when we really didn't play very smart in some certain
areas. But we made up for it by trying really hard and I got to be very happy
about that.  
  
Q. You mentioned having the least control from the sideline, yet in
overtime I think you went perfect from the field, like 5-5. You did execute in
the half court. What do you chalk that up to and what did you think of their
kind of their poise in key moments?  
BILL SELF: I did. We actually, I thought they were better than us for about
the first 32 minutes or 33 minutes, even though we maybe had a lead in there.
I thought we were on our heels and they had five guys that could stretch it.
But the last eight minutes or so when we got down eight, I thought except for
a couple of bone-headed type plays, I thought we played probably the best ball
we played in a while. I thought we got the ball where it needed to go. I
thought we exercised some patience offensively and we got the big guy post
touches which we hadn't been great at doing. And defensively I thought we
guarded well and rebounded well down the stretch. So I couldn't be happier
with how we performed. Not very often does a team outscore you 36 points from
three and you outscore them by six from the free-throw line. That's a 30-point
differential and you still have a chance to win. So we need to, obviously,
shoot it better and be better beyond the arc. But I guess old fashion ball,
throw it inside, prevailed today.  
  
Q. How big was the zone you threw at them today?  
BILL SELF: Well, we went zone and then we forgot we were in zone, like, the
next three possessions, and two guys were in zone and three were in man and I
think it totally maybe screwed them up or something. But it wasn't great. They
scored six straight points on, against it, to go up eight, if I'm not
mistaken. And then we started switching ball screens, which we should have
been. That's my fault, we should have been doing that the whole game. After
they made their first four or five threes to start the game, we should have
been probably doing that. And that had as much to do with us winning the game
as anything is was just switching ball screens the last 15 minutes or so.  
  
Q. You talked about getting the ball where you wanted to go. How much
did Marcus contribute to doing that?  
BILL SELF: Well we're so much better with him on the court. That was a big
loss. For us to be down, what were we down? One at halftime? And Marcus only
played, what, nine minutes or whatever it was. That's a big deal for us.
Because if you can't play Marcus, then Ochai and Devon can't get a break,
because you need two of those three in the game all the time. So I thought the
second half, I would have to watch the tape and I'm not nitpicking or anything
because that was a great crew on the game, but he got a couple that I thought
maybe, maybe that was all ball and he went to the bench. And but we kind of
piece it together until he was back in there and then after he was back in
there we were, obviously, a much better team.  
  
Q. You won this thing in 2015. You made it to the Elite 8, if I 'm
getting it right here looking at your schedule. What does winning this
tournament do for you guys going forward?  
BILL SELF: I don't know. I don't think, I don't know if it helped us a ton
last time, because we lost it in '11 and went to the National Championship
game here. So, but I think what the tournament does more than anything it
exposes your weaknesses and allows you to prepare and get better for really
big boy games. Because we that was a big boy game. And so the tournament is
tremendous. And, of course, if you win two games, just like Dayton feels, I'm
sure you're going to play a third, you might as well win it. So we would much
rather win it than not win it. But I'm not sure the win will have a ton to do
with what we do going forward. It's still November and I would like to think
that that automatically puts us in a very good or favorable position. But if
you don't play well against Colorado, who is a Top-20 team, next Saturday,
then this probably didn't mean as much. So hopefully it's just a springboard
for enthusiasm and energy to excite our guys that we got a chance to be good
if we just continue to get better.  
  
Q. You can see in Devon 's face the excitement he has just winning this
tournament. There was a lot of chatter kind of going into this season about
what was going to go on with KU. Is there a message you kind of have to those
doubters and detractors and those haters that were coming into this, to kind
of answer the bell and get a win?  
BILL SELF: I think there's a -- I could be wrong because I'm not a big social
media guy and I don't read what's out there -- but I don't think there's been
haters about this team. I think there's been some haters about maybe our
program, because we have been under a microscope or under some scrutiny,
obviously, the last 18 months or so. So, but that doesn't have anything to do
with this particular group and we don't even talk -- I'll be honest, we don't
even talk about that with our guys. We talk about it amongst ourselves all the
time, but not with our guys. And we try to distance from that as much as
possible. But this team isn't perfect and obviously we got to shoot it better
to have a chance to really have a really good team. But I do think we got some
competitive pieces that, if we improve a little bit, this could be a pretty
dangerous team down the stretch.  
  
Q. Curious, is that the best that you 've seen Devon and Udoka play on
the same day at the same time?  
BILL SELF: Yeah, yeah, I would say so. I don't have all the stats, but they
both got their career highs tonight, didn't they? So, yeah, I would say that's
the best. I was excited. You look at different things, Dok didn't turn the
ball over. And so he was patient on the post, he didn't dribble as much, so
there were some positive things that he did that was very good. And Dot, I
don't know how he has the energy to play that fast. He's a welcome addition
too. But that's the best 1-2 punch we have seen maybe with anybody in awhile
in our program.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 27, 2019

  

### [Mark Pope](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16092)

### [Zac Seljaas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38297)

### [TJ Haws](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38283)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
BYU - 90, Virginia Tech - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
MARK POPE: Well, I couldn't be more proud of these guys. What an unbelievable
effort they put on the floor and did it together from start to finish
absolutely together. It was extraordinary. And really excited for the future
that we have together throughout the season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Questions for the players?  
  
Q. TJ, you 're in foul trouble the first half. What did you see in the
second half to kind of get yourself going? You went on a little run there.  
TJ HAWS: I felt like I could see the ball go through the hole one time and
getting a little bit of rhythm. But really I was just getting good looks and
fortunately they fell. But we were or I feel like our whole team was really in
a great rhythm and that momentum and energy is contagious and it's good to see
the ball go through the hoop.  
  
Q. For both guys: How important was it to get the second win here after
losing yesterday?  
TJ HAWS: You know, it was huge for us. Last night, it's hard, it's hard to
lose but I thought our guys did a really great job of throwing that loss away,
moving on, because we needed to win this game and I thought our guys were
really ready to go tonight and that was huge.  
  
ZAC SELJAAS: Yeah, it's like Coach Pope always says. It's a learning, every
game you learn and you grow and you become better each day. And it's most
importantly, you don't lose two in a row. You keep learning from it and you
just go harder the next game.  
  
Q. TJ, the ball movement in the second half, is that kind of what, kind
of envisioned, kind of the perfect way you want to play this season?  
TJ HAWS: Yeah, I thought it really came together for us in the second half. We
moved the ball really well. We trusted in our offense, we trusted in each
other, we trusted in our game plan, what coach has been saying to us. And we
really were just finding the open shots and guys stepped up and made big shots
and that was super fun to be a part of tonight.  
  
Q. Zac, what was it like to see TJ just kind of take over there and just
go on a little run and really give you guys a big boost?  
ZAC SELJAAS: It's awesome. Always. It's fun when your teammate does something
great, whether it's a TJ or Jake or Alex, whoever it is, when you see them go
on a run like that and they're hot and you just keep giving it to them and
it's fun to watch and it's fun to be a part of a teammate to have that kind of
ability. So it's just awesome and it gets everyone going on the team and it
kind of started our run.  
  
Q. TJ, what do you feel like you guys take away from this experience in
Maui? What will stand out? What will kind of carry you as you move forward?  
TJ HAWS: It's like Zac said. It's a learning experience for us and I feel like
when, what I'm taking away so far is when we really put our trust in this game
plan and the things that we have been working on, we're a really good team.
And we move the ball and share the ball and when we guard defensively like we
did, we're a really good team. It showed in the second half when we were, when
we had things rolling a little bit. When we do what we do and do the things
that we practice every single day, we're a really good team.  
  
Q. Both teams shot really, really well. You guys were 50 percent from
three and 32-59 for the game. Overall, what, how soft are those rims? They
shot really good too.  
TJ HAWS: They're a great team and we knew that coming in. We knew they could
really shoot the ball. But for us, I think when helps us shoot the ball well
is we take good shots. And we move the ball until we get good shots and that
helps us shoot a great percentage.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let you two get back to your team. Any
questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Last night I talked to you about pace. In the first half you were
playing a little bit slower. Second half you really picked it up. What did you
do at halftime to really get into that much more of a quicker game?  
MARK POPE: Well, here's the thing is, so it's, we're reaching a little bit
right now. So when you talk about a rhythm to the game that you're shooting
for, it's not a tangible dot-to-dot diagram play or set. It's an outline of
how you want to feel in the game, how you want the game to feel. So it's hard
to learn. It is way harder to learn than it is to just come out and run a set
exactly correctly. So that's why it's elusive for us. It just is. But I think
our trajectory is really good in terms of these guys having a few more
possessions every single game. Maybe the first game we had 10 possessions that
we felt right and maybe tonight we had 25 possessions that we felt right. And
if we can keep on that run where we can just feel right more often, it's
really important. And that's what we talk about. That's what we talk about
pregame. That's what we talk about in post-game last night. That's what we
talk about is we're searching for a feel and rhythm for the game that's pretty
special. And these guys lived in that space for quite awhile tonight.  
  
Q. I look at this box score and there 's some weird numbers here. They
had only 8 turnovers. You guys only had 6. I looked at the stat broadcast. At
the under four timeout you guys had shot three free throws for the entire game
--  
MARK POPE: That's a problem.  
  
Q. Yet you guys walk away with a 13-point win. How do you explain
that?  
MARK POPE: Well, listen, part of this is just due to the difference in the
teams. Tonight you had two teams, maybe the two best shooting teams here and
the two smallest teams here. So neither of us is battling. It's, last night we
were battling against this extraordinary length and physicality, and that,
there's a -- that has an impact on the game. So for us to combat that we have
to play faster and freer and more decisively and make more simple plays
quicker. With us as more similar opponents right here it makes it easier, it
just does. You're not battling length. We could actually hit the roll tonight.
Last night we're staring down a 7'2" wingspan and 7'4" wingspan just trying to
hit the roll. The roll's wide open, but we can't actually hit it. So we will
be able to by the end of the season. So that's probably why you saw some of
that today. Both teams can really, really shoot the ball. We both play a
similar style. We both really want to move the ball. This Landers Nolley,
Michigan State can't guard him, nobody can guard him. I mean, it doesn't
matter how big and long you are, nobody can, nobody's guarded this kid yet
this season. He gets the ball out of his hands so fast it's unreal.  
  
So hopefully, this was a really fun matchup for us. I think Mike Young is one
of the finest coaches in college basketball and I'm not just saying that. I
have so much respect for him. I've actually been a fan of his. I watch his
stuff. I try and steal from him all the time. I think he's so smart and I love
the way his teams feel. And so, man, it was fun for us to play against them
tonight.  
  
Q. How important is it to walk away from here 2-1 rather than 1-2?  
MARK POPE: It's so big. It's just so big for these guys. They're going to get
on the plane tomorrow -- it probably didn't look like it post-game. Probably
post-game it probably looked like we won the tournament championship. But for
us to roll out of here, like, claiming third place in a tournament that's just
ridiculously stacked and minus what people on paper say is our best player,
and to beat -- you know, you think about it, this Virginia Tech team, what
they have done? I mean, it's crazy what they have done this year so far,
culminating in beating Michigan State. And then everybody saw it tonight how
good this Dayton team is that they lost to yesterday. This Dayton team is
probably a Top-10 team right now. So this Virginia Tech team is a great team.
For us to be able to come here and beat UCLA and Virginia Tech and get a
little bit humbled and learn from Kansas is huge for us because our goal is to
keep rolling.  
  
So we'll get on the plane tomorrow, actually feeling really good. I haven't
really seen, my whole family is here I haven't really seen them for about 10
minutes a day for the last five days. And then we don't fly out until noon
tomorrow, so we're about to party all night long and that's going to be great.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MARK POPE: Yes we are. We're going to do a non-alcoholic party for the next 16
hours, baby. We know how to do that. You know that. We know how to do that.  
  
Q. How is Yoeli, with him being out, how does he help this team during
these games when he 's not able to be on the floor? What has he done to help
his teammates?  
MARK POPE: Well, the first thing he's done is he beats us up in scout team
every day. He's really good. So it's a, you know, sometimes you feel like you
can't, you can't actually get the experience you're going to get against an
opponent because you just don't have that much talent on your scout team. We
got probably a Top-20 player in the country on our scout team. We're preparing
for UCLA against those two bigs who had just had put on a show all season
long. And we actually probably had a way better player we were going against
in practice every day, so we were ready. And even Kansas, I mean, clearly we
had issues with one of their players inside. But to have Yoeli to go against
every day in practice has been really special for us. And then him on the
bench, his demeanor, his support, you can kind of see, for example, he's kind
of worked hard to take Kolby Lee under his wing as a personal project. In
fact, both our guys sitting out. Rich has also. And you see how much
confidence Kolby Lee is playing with? Kolby Lee was 5-5 tonight. I think he
was 6-7 last night. I think he was 6-8 the night before. This dude's got to
have the highest field goal percentage in the tournament, maybe. And he didn't
play at all last year. So he's had a huge impact that way. But I'm hopeful
that he's going to have an even bigger impact when he gets to put on a
uniform.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MARK POPE: Because we couldn't make it -- let's go. I'll take the team
wherever they want to go right now. Thank you guys. Happy Thanksgiving

## November 27, 2019

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Xavier Tillman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37079)

### [Cassius Winston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34730)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Michigan State - 75, UCLA - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
TOM IZZO: First of all, I would like to give credit to UCLA. I've known Mick
and I think what he's trying to bring out there is what we have in the
Midwest, a little tougher, more aggressive team. And I thought his big guys
were physical, and a lot of the teams we face in the Big-10, athletic, but
they have length, and what you hope to get out of these tournaments, when you
go to them and all these big games we played early, and I think they have done
a great job in this committee here selecting teams because you got a variety
of different teams. I mean, hell, nothing against Kansas, I look at Dayton and
I think they might be the best team here right now. And we'll see what
happens. But I think there's been a lot of good teams. And we played zone,
today was a matchup-type zone. We've run against different offenses. And we
got to keep in mind that we are still very young. We were just talking,
there's three guys that have any real experience. So when you have tournament
and you don't go to a gym, you just have a walkthrough in a ballroom, it's
hard for those new guys to pick that stuff up.  
  
I thought these two guys played their tail off. I would say the only problem
that I am struggling with a little bit, we go small sometimes. We did get out-
rebounded by one, but they're big. We're missing layups. We're missing lay
ups. And I already talked to X, he's one of them. But it's not just him. The
sad part is I don't think if he would have made his layups in this tournament
he would have averaged probably 18 points a game. So his offense is really
starting to come along and we're starting to go to him a little bit more. And
Cassius is still the guy that stirs the drink, coaches the team, and makes the
popcorn.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the players.  
  
Q. Xavier, wondering how different your role feels than last year for
you. Obviously, you played a huge instrumental role, you started down the
stretch, but does it feel different this year with this team?  
XAVIER TILLMAN: Yeah, only for the fact that last year with Kenny and Quedo I
could only focus on myself and it was a lot easier, so I can just focus on me,
making sure I'm doing the right thing and then covering for other people if
they made mistakes. But this year I got to make sure everybody's good. For the
young guys, I got to make sure I set good screens for Cash and make sure I'm
finishing as well. And my awareness has to be not just for myself but for
everybody. So that's just the biggest difference.  
  
Q. For you Cassius, the ability to shoot outside, get in the lane, how
much did you feel like that hitting those couple threes allowed you to soften
up the defense to the drive and dish?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: That's huge. Once they got to respect you out there kind of
just it opens the floor up being able to hit the threes. And then with my
ability to kind of drive and use my, use off the dribble. So they got to close
out on me on the three-point line and that opens everything up downhill to
kind of make more plays. But when I'm hitting shots it becomes a little bit
easier to make those plays.  
  
Q. For both you: I know you would rather be playing this game right now,
the championship game, but what do you take from this trip out here? You guys
have been through these long seasons and seen how they go up and down. What do
you take, I guess, as a positive from -- or negative even, what 's the most
you can take from this trip here?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: We just learned a lot about our team. To come in and kind of
get punched in the mouth, we haven't really had a chance to kind of respond to
that that fast. We kind of usually got time to practice and go back and watch
film and learn what to do to get better. This time we got punched in our mouth
and then we had to play the next day. And I think we did a pretty good job of
rallying and getting back out there and playing hard for the next couple days.
So we got fight in us, we got the talent, we got the potential, it's about
bringing every day. This time we brought it two out of three days and that's
something that we can fix.  
  
XAVIER TILLMAN: Yeah, I would definitely say our turnaround, even though we
had a tough loss at the beginning, they did a good job of just bouncing back
in that first, like, two thirds of the Georgia game when we were just on a
tear defensively, offensively getting open shots. And then this game coming in
on a tear, everybody locked in everybody doing their job. So I would just say
our bounce back is what I would take from this.  
  
Q. Cassius, everybody has respect and, for what you 've been going
through and playing through. I was wondering with the players party Friday and
then throughout the week if any of the players have been reaching out to you
and supporting you from the other teams.  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Oh, yeah. Every game just about every player gives their
condolences, every coach, everybody just, it's hard. It's something hard to go
through, but the support from all the programs and respect from everyone it's
been real genuine and people are showing a lot of love and a lot of support.  
  
Q. I know that the next step is the Duke game. I guess, what do you guys
use from this as a springboard into that? And how do you use, maybe, the focus
you had to do after the Virginia Tech game and find to go into that next
week?  
XAVIER TILLMAN: For me personally, I'm going to be working on my free throws.
I will not be missing a free throw in the Duke game. I'll be working on my
free throws all week. But as a team just making sure that we follow the
scouting report to a T, know everybody's tendencies, so if a guy drive left,
he's not going to drive left in a game. If a guy's a shooter, he's not going
to get an open look in the game. And so for us, I would say following the
scouting report to a T.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Like I said, bring the positive that we got out of the
tournament. I feel like we did get better as a team. I feel like we did show
good glimpses of what we're capable of. So just take those things, that energy
we're playing like that, moving the ball, locked in on the defensive end, we
play like that, we're potentially the best team in the country. So if we keep
that energy, keep that mindset, we're going to take that approach all the way
through the next game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let you two get back to your team and open it
up for questions for coach.  
  
Q. It looked like you had a few nice words for Mick after the game. Can
you share any of that? And what, he talked a lot yesterday about wanting to
emulate what you have done with this Michigan State program. Can you talk
about some of the core concepts and what all goes into doing what you have
done for so long?  
TOM IZZO: Well, I do think, for the most part, we're a pretty physical team.
We have some toughness to us, we usually rebound pretty well. We're probably
the smallest team I've here for us and that's a little different. He's got a
big team. I've known Mick for a long time. He's been a student of the game,
what he's done at Cincinnati. I think when he brings that to the West Coast,
they're going to have trouble putting up with him early. And as they say, I
guess, it was Bo, those who stay will be champions. I see no reason why he, if
he can get them to buy into what he wants, because you can get a different
athlete out there and there seems to be a lot of length. I don't know, we got
to send some of you California people to the Midwest just for the length
reasons alone. And if he gets length with toughness, then he's going to really
have something. So I just told him he's tougher than he thinks they are,
because he gave me a little Lou Holtz before the game, you know, that I was
afraid that we were playing their cheerleading squad, not their basketball
squad after listening to Mick. But I have great respect for Mick and I think
he's going to be the complete different. He's not John Wooden, nobody is, but
he's got a whole different way of doing things. I think he appreciates that
they scramble, they played hard, they were hard to score against, they have
great length. As he gets, he's done great job with Tyger. That kid couldn't
shoot it and that. He's done a great job, his individual work, they will
improve drastically.  
  
So I'm a fan. I hope they have all the success in the world and I hope we
don't play them again.  
  
Q. As much as you would like to be playing right now, what do you take
from this week?  
TOM IZZO: Well, I tell you what I took from this tournament. I see Dave back
there. I gave a lot of credit to him. They changed it some. I don't know how
many years ago you put the air conditioning in. That's been good. But I think
even the events for the players, that second night, the way you did that,
maybe it's been the same for a lot of people, it wasn't like that when I came
here last time. It was really, like big-time professional. I mean, I've been
in a lot of these and they're all nice events, but that, to me, that night
that I didn't know if I would like, the night before a game you always want to
get going, both my players and my staff thought it was big-time.  
  
So I think when you get the kind of teams you got here and, you know, you can
say sometimes there's a star-studded team. We were out here one year, and I
think there were, seven out of eight teams were probably really highly ranked.
But you get in the NCAA tournament you're going to have to play against some
of these teams that aren't as well known and it's kind of good to tell your
players, I mean, he got our butt kicked by a team that is picked towards the
bottom of the ACC. Now, I think they will be better than that, but it happened
and we learned that we played against a team, real small, 6'6", 6'7", but all
five guys that can shoot. This is going to help us down the stretch.
Everything that happened here is going to help us. I'm not big on losing helps
you get better. I'm just big on playing against different competition and
that's what I've tried to do. We're going to leave here playing an ACC team, a
SEC team, and a PAC-12 team, and it doesn't matter where they end up. If we
end up playing somebody in that league in the tournament, we can kind of
compare what they did against them, how they played them. That's what's been
my MO for scheduling the way I do. I always try to pick teams from different
regions and from different conferences, because I think in the end of the day
it helps us a lot.  
  
Q. What do you think Aaron Henry 's ceiling is this year and how badly
are you trying to get that potential out of him. How important is that for you
guys?  
TOM IZZO: Well this is a lot higher ceiling than what he's playing at. I'll
tell you that. I was disappointed with Aaron today. And, you know, but it's
kind of fun. I've been through so much, as I said, at Michigan State and I had
to kind of curb my ways back to dog-eat-dog. You don't want to play hard, you
don't want to do the right things, your butt's going to sit on the bench.
Aaron Henry is a very talented kid. I think his ceiling's off the charts,
that's the problem. When his ceiling is off the charts and he doesn't cut out,
and he doesn't go in and rebound, he doesn't do this and that, you know, I was
really good at yelling at guys, and as you get older, and then the damn TV it
catches you saying everything and sometimes moms get mad and all that. So just
sitting him makes it easier on my heart and easier on my voice and not as good
for TV, but maybe it will bring home what we need. Aaron's a great kid, a
great student. He's just, as we learned last year, when some of those, I
almost said something I didn't want to, when some of those very intelligent
broadcasters around the country said that the finger wave was a bad thing, if
you were at practice every day, if you were here this week, you should have a
better understanding of what is needed. And right now, we got to find out how
we get that motor running again, because he's still a very talented kid. He
does some incredible things. How he can consistently do that will determine
where his ceiling is.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
TOM IZZO: If I was in Michigan I would freeze my ass off. You kidding me? You
know what, we tried to stay normal, but my daughter gave me this for
Christmas, and she said she wanted me to wear it the last day. I thought she
was hoping it would be in the championship game. But I've learned the last
couple weeks that whatever my daughter says, I'm going to do. So, thanks.
Thanks for the compliment. I don't get that very often.  
  
Q. You often talk about lifting the program as high as you can, and I
was at the ACC media day and this follows up on what Coach Cronin said. The
Duke players all talked about how excited they were not just to play Michigan
State, but to see Breslin Center. Just wondered what your reaction is to
that?  
TOM IZZO: Well, I think that's great. I mean, and I've always been a guy that
I'll schedule anybody in the world home and home. We're getting less of those.
And I think it's cool to go to Cameron, I think it's cool to go to UCLA.
Magic's trying to get me back out there, and with Mick there, I'm probably
dumb enough to do it. I'm kind of one of those guys that does those things
because I enjoy it. So they're 20, I'm 60 and I still enjoy doing that. I
think it's one of the great things in sports that you get to go to venues.
And, you know, even to play out here, I do want to thank all of our fans that
came out, but I want to thank all of the people from Hawaii and Maui and
different islands. They were the kindest people. I think we should bring the
California length to Michigan and we should be bring the some of these people
with the way they talk to you, the way they are excited to see you. It was a
great week for us. Our guys had a great time. It's hard three days, three
games in three days. It really is difficult. But what a better example for our
players than to realize that you have to prepare. 'Til the wee hours of the
night, we all got up at six this morning, another walkthrough, another film
session, you know. That is a good practice for your Big-10 tournament, it's
good practice for the NCAA tournament. And I just want to thank the committee
for having us and I want to thank everybody here. And we're going to get
better. We got a long ways to, a long ways to go. At times, I don't think we
looked very good, so I'm sure you don't think we looked very good. But trust
me when I say this, if we get a rotation down and we kind of figure out,
Rocket, big thing, because we lost a great player in Langford there, we're
going to get better as the year goes on. And you're seeing upsets all over the
country, guys, and it's because people are playing tougher competition. And a
lot of these teams, like the Daytons of the world, they're good. They're
really good. And so thank you all and have a great Thanksgiving and have safe
travel.

## November 27, 2019

  

### [Anthony Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19553)

### [Ryan Mikesell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38294)

### [Obi Toppin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38278)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Kansas - 90, Dayton - 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
ANTHONY GRANT: Well right now I'm very, very proud of our team. Our guys
battled three highly competitive games in three days. These guys gave
everything they had for each other. They battled it out all the way through
the end. Obviously it's a tough loss. But like I told them in the locker room,
whatever it was five, six days ago when we came here we wanted to find out
what we needed to do as a team to continue to move forward, and I think these
guys did a great job of answering that. They fought obviously to the very end.
You got to give Kansas credit. Their guys were able to step up and make plays,
enough plays to be able to come out with the victory. But these guys battled
and hopefully as we move forward we'll learn lessons from this. There will be
some things that we'll look at it and it will be tough to watch and some
things that we'll learn from.  
  
And it's six games into the season, so we're excited, honored to have a chance
to compete here in a great tournament and, yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks coach. Open it up for questions for the players.  
  
Q. Obi, can you talk about what it was like battling with Udoka in
there. It seemed back and forth. Great battle.  
OBI TOPPIN: Yeah. Udoka's a really good player. He's a really strong, big man
in the post. I don't really know what to say, but like he's a really good
player and he showed it today.  
  
Q. Can both of you talk about Jalen 's shot and how you felt going into
overtime after he made it.  
RYAN MIKESELL: It was a good shot. I have seen him make shots like that all
the time whether it's in open gym or in practice and whatnot. So I knew when
he had the ball in his hands I went straight to the rim and I told him, like,
just let it go. And he's a competent shooter and fortunate enough it went in.
And then going into overtime we thought we had a chance. They made a little
more plays than we did, but it happens sometimes. It's basketball.  
  
Q. Obi, the moment 's kind of gone viral now. You hit a three in front
of their bench and it looked like you turned around before you even made it.
Can you just describe what happened on that play?  
OBI TOPPIN: I don't remember turning around, but when I shot it just felt good
and I just started running back on defense.  
  
Q. For either of you guys: Can you guys speak to what you guys think you
showed throughout this tournament to people around the country and for Dayton
basketball?  
RYAN MIKESELL: Yeah, I thought it was obviously a really good tournament. We
got to the championship game. Fortunate -- I mean, unfortunately we wanted to
win, but we went out here, we competed for three days straight, we kind of
showed people what we can do one more of a national level. I'm really excited
about this group. I think we have a lot of talent and just keep improving as
the season goes on, so hopefully we're playing our best basketball at the end
of March and hopefully make the tournament, make a good run in the A-10
division and go from there.  
  
Q. For both you: I know you guys wanted to be a better three-point
shooting team, but in the last three days you showed how improved you are.
What 's been the key to making all those threes?  
RYAN MIKESELL: I think just trusting our preparation. We take a lot of shots,
we work on it all the time in the off-season. In practices we see guys, it's
no surprise that we come out here and hit shots because we put in a lot of
work and we keep telling each other just shoot it. You put in that work, you
put in that preparation, just have the confidence to go out there during game
time and let it fly. Yeah, we just keep building, we build each other's
confidence up. If someone misses a shot we're always tapping them on the back
saying, good shot, let it fly, just keep playing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let the two of you get back to your team and
open it up for questions for coach.  
  
Q. Down the stretch they kind of went old school. They went inside. Were
there some things you were thinking about in terms of wrinkles? I know you
just isolated on him and made them shoot over the top --  
ANTHONY GRANT: I'll go back and look at the film. But he did a great job. He
was able to finish plays in the post. He was able to finish his free throws
tonight. He did an outstanding job. So I'll look at it. I'm sure I'll go back
and look at some things that maybe I could have done differently to maybe help
with that. But they had some guys out there that did a good job of keeping us
honest in terms of the spacing they had on the floor. It was hard to go to him
with two guys based on where they were spaced. But give them credit. They did
a great job getting him the ball. He did a great job finishing the play.  
  
Q. You mentioned it a little bit, but how much did your team grow in
these last three days?  
ANTHONY GRANT: Yeah, I mean, I think coming into the tournament we felt really
good about what we had. Every game you get challenged differently. So six
games into it, I think we know some things more than we did three days, three
games ago. But it's six games in and there will be all types of challenges.
The one thing I think all of us in the room that have been watching basketball
for a while, you don't, you can't act like you've got anything figured out,
because you don't. At the end of the day we had a chance today to compete for
a championship against a great team. This was about what Kansas did. They did
a great job of being able to come in here and win a championship and we had
opportunities. So we'll go back and we'll learn from this and hopefully it
will make us better for the next game to come and the games after.  
  
Q. A lot of different guys made big plays, but Ryan Mikesell really took
over at times and showed the ability to draw fouls, get to the basket, make
threes. What did you think of his play?  
ANTHONY GRANT: I thought Ryan played really well. I thought we got great
efforts from a lot of different guys tonight. Ryan, at times, he talked about,
someone mentioned Obi having to guard Azubuike in the post and Ryan had to
guard him, Trey had to guard him, different guys had to guard him. We did a
lot in terms of guys making multiple efforts to try to do what we needed to
do. Tonight with the way they elected to defend, a lot of times they put a big
on Ryan, so we tried to exploit the matchup there and I thought we did a good
job of understanding that in the second half. They kind of got away from some
things maybe that we had seen on film. But that's a part of the game. You make
adjustments and there was a lot of adjustments going back and forth throughout
the night I thought on both ends. They threw some zone out there, they
switched matchups out there, just did a lot of different things that our guys
had to adjust to.  
  
Q. You just mentioned the zone. I think it held you scoreless for six
minutes or so in the second half late. You got it to OT but how big was that
zone that they put out?  
ANTHONY GRANT: I think we hit two threes back-to-back against the zone. I
think they did hold us scoreless for six minutes, but I believe that was man-
to-man. I got to look, go back and look. I don't remember the exact segment.
But they're a really good defensive team. I think coming into the game they
may have been No. 1 in the country or Top-5 in the country in defensive
efficiency rating. So we knew that coming in that they could pose some
problems with their speed, with their size, with their athleticism on the
defensive end.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 27, 2019

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Prince Ali](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38293)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Michigan State - 75, UCLA - 62  
  
MICK CRONIN: Obviously a physically tough game today. Proud of the fact our
guys out-rebounded them by one. We took care of the ball. Two areas of
improvement for our team. Tough to win a game like that when you go 2-15 from
three. We had some really good looks at times. Really, that's the difference
in the game. We get outscored 24-6 at the three-point line. That and I thought
there was some really tough calls. I thought Prince got a, trying to get out
of the way, there's three times where they just dove into us and about, it's a
blood bath to try to get a rebound. So I knew that was coming. Been there,
done that. Guys have any questions?  
  
Q. Prince, you played Michigan State last year. It seemed like a
completely different showing from you guys as far as the toughness aspect. How
do you feel you are now as a team in that department compared to a year ago?  
PRINCE ALI: Obviously, I think we're tougher than we were last year. We played
tougher. What I remember last year, the game was over in seven minutes. This
year we played the whole game. I thought we could have given ourselves a
chance to win. We had some self-inflicted errors. But overall I thought we
played hard. We played harder than last year. And I think that moving forward
we need to continue to play with that type of aggression and passion.  
  
Q. It was basically a tie game at halftime. It seemed like the pace
increased in the second half. Did they do something to exert that on you guys?
And how big of a difference did that make in the way the game unfolded?  
PRINCE ALI: It was a big difference. I think at halftime they had 26 points.
We gave up almost 50 in the second half. So I mean, we knew coming in defense
was going to win this game. If we had been able to replicate what we did in
the first half, I think we would have had a better chance of winning this
game. So going forward that's what's going to win us games. Defense, not
offense. So that's what we took from it.  
  
Q. Jaime had another good game. How impressed have you been with him and
what is he bringing to you guys right now?  
PRINCE ALI: Yeah. I've been impressed with Jaime since day one. He was playing
pickups with us before he even got here. So I mean, he cares about winning.
That's all he cares about. He lays it on the line for this team. He's a great
dude. I think he's going to be a great player here.  
  
Q. The three-point shooting, it seems like it 's been kind of a season-
long issue for you guys. I don't know what your percentage is on the season,
but is that something where you guys can just get in the gym and work on that
or --  
MICK CRONIN: No, we're in the 30s there. We're right where everybody else is
in the conference. Today it was bad.  
  
PRINCE ALI: Yeah, I mean, yeah, as long as we keep taking good shots, I'm not
too worried about that. They will eventually fall.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up for questions for coach.  
  
Q. You said you wanted this game to show your guys what a team like
Michigan State was all about. How did you feel that they responded to that
challenge?  
MICK CRONIN: I think we're still learning. We learned a lot today. Guys
learned about playing with their heart. So that's really what we talked about.
You got play with your heart. That's 75 percent of it. Now, you got to think,
you got to play smart, you got to execute, obviously, you can't beat Michigan
State, go 2-15 from the three-point line. We had some really good looks. We
went through some different lineups, we exploited their help a little bit. We
just didn't knock them down. I thought the big key of the game, we should have
been winning at halftime. With the looks we had from the three-point line in
the first half we were 2-10. We had some great looks. But we played a lot of
young guys. Jake Kyman is a young kid. Hasn't had a lot of minutes. I went to
him. I thought we could use him to be able to get some clean looks and we did.
But I've got faith in him.  
  
So that's a building process for us. But we're still learning. It's just, it's
a night-and-day situation for some of the guys on our team. I thought Cody
Riley played with his heart today. You got to care enough to call your
teammate out if he's not physical or if he's not paying attention. So we're
still learning that.  
  
Q. Xavier Tillman is somebody in this tournament, offensively has been
struggling a little bit. What I 'm wondering from an opposing coaching
standpoint what you see in him as he looks like he's in a little new role --  
MICK CRONIN: I can't speak to it because I don't know what role he was in.  
  
Q. I guess what is the opposing --  
MICK CRONIN: He's a good player. He's a big strong kid. What I like about him
is he's not selfish. That's really what I can tell you. I think he's clearly
an unselfish player. Obviously, big strong kid, but I don't really, I'm not
familiar with him.  
  
Q. From the, could you tell scouting report or anything?  
MICK CRONIN: Did he, he can score in the low post. He uses the same move every
time, but we did do a good enough job stopping it. But he's a good passer. His
numbers show it. He's a good passer out of the post. But all their guys, they
pursue the ball, they're physical, then it becomes a blood bath. Three or four
times I felt we could have had offensive rebound put back and there was
collisions and no call. But it is what it is. He's a very good player, though.  
  
Q. Jaime got his first career start, played career-high 35 minutes --  
MICK CRONIN: Hard to take him off the floor right now. Hard to take him off
the floor. We're trying to, we are learning what competitive spirit is and
playing with your heart. He goes after the ball. Funny as that may sound, it's
pretty simplistic. But if you watch the guys in green go after the ball,
whether they run over people or not, they go after the ball. He goes after the
ball. He got eight rebounds. He's our leading rebounder again today. We just
played Michigan State. I think we're not going to play anybody that rebounds
the ball the way they do with the bodies that they have. He's the leading
rebounder in the game, so it's just hard to take him off the floor right now.  
  
Q. Have you seen his spirit kind of rub off on some of the other guys a
little bit?  
MICK CRONIN: He's not afraid to speak up, which I appreciate. I thought Cody
started to speak up a little bit today. You look at the guys that played the
most minutes, those are the two guys I thought played with the most heart
today. It's really not that hard to play for me.  
  
Q. You still are, you said the other day, auditions. Does there ever
come a point where you want to kind of narrow down the lineup a little bit?  
MICK CRONIN: No. I didn't get Shareef in early, I thought the game got real
physical, which is not his strength yet. To be honest with you, I told the
staff last night I wished Kenneth wasn't redshirting, this would have been a
good game for him, he's our most physical guy. No, I would like to expand the
lineup. I think every coach would like would say they would like to expand the
rotation. I'm sure Coach Izzo loves the fact that he's got multiple guys that
can play. Right now I'm searching for five that will play with their heart and
compete. Which today was, I thought we competed at a high level, just hard to
win when you go 2-15 from three against a team of their caliber. Because they
make shots. Which really, when the game comes down to it, the rebounding is
even, the turnovers are about even, they make shots. The problem is it's hard
for us to get -- we had chances at offensive rebounds and there was a lot of
colliding and collisions. We missed more shots than they did. So my big guys
got two offensive rebounds, Riley and Hill. So you got anything else, Ben?  
  
Q. Overall, are you happy with the team these three days do you feel
like you saw some growth that will help you moving forward?  
MICK CRONIN: I thought the only good thing was the way we competed physically
today. And I thought that Jaime's voice -- see, you guys don't know what goes
on behind the scenes -- Jaime is not afraid to step up and say something.
Enough's enough. Somebody's got to step up and say something. I thought Cody
did today. Losing -- as you're trying to build a program, you got to realize
what we're going to go through. So people look at me, people call, hey, don't
go crazy, it's your first year. I get all that, but what I would tell them is,
because I've done this two times, this is my third time, you can never accept
losing, you can never let your players accept losing. Your players cannot
accept it. They got to understand that you can give great effort, which we did
today in a lot of ways, but still it can't be okay. It can never be okay. It
can never be okay. So I don't want to give you some sort of answer that makes
you think that I think, well we grew over here, and kumbaya. It can never be
okay. No matter who you play against, it cannot be okay to lose. You have to
build that within your locker room.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 27, 2019

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Rayshaun Hammonds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34835)

### [Anthony Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38285)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Georgia - 80, Chaminade - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the players.  
  
Q. Anthony, on that last possession they tied it, up real big shot, kind
of the underdog story. What are you thinking in the last nine seconds there?  
ANTHONY EDWARDS: There's no way we're going to lose to these guys. So
obviously my coach is like, get the ball and get down hill. I got the ball
across half court, I looked at the clock, it was like five seconds. I said,
well, I know they're going to pack it in, so I'm just going to pull up for the
three.  
  
Q. Were you worried they were going to send a double at all?  
ANTHONY EDWARDS: Yeah, I was, like, their coach just told me out there he was
hoping I passed the ball, yeah.  
  
Q. For both you guys, if you don 't mind, if you could just talk about
how tough Chaminade played you guys.  
ANTHONY EDWARDS: I mean, they're a great group of guys. They played hard,
scrappy. They never gave up. We went on, like, a 7-0 run, 9-0 run. They fought
back, hit big shots. No. 10 hit a lot of three-pointers they needed in the
clutch. 13. They're all great players, but I feel like they was coached and
they watched great film on us, so they competed really well.  
  
RAYSHAUN HAMMONDS: Basically what Ant said.  
  
Q. How important was it to get this win, after two tough games to begin
here, how important was this win and Rayshaun, can you start with that one?  
RAYSHAUN HAMMONDS: It was big. Going into December? We got a tough slate in
December with Arizona State and SMU and the other teams. So it was kind of
great to get this one and we're trying to get on a roll now.  
  
ANTHONY EDWARDS: I mean, we needed the win. Every other team that played those
guys, they won by a large number of points but we weren't coming in worrying
about that. We were just, like, we need to win. We're 0-2 out here and we're
playing for seventh or eighth place, and we're better than that. So we had to
just come out and will our way to a win.  
  
Q. Anthony, how would you describe the experience of being out here on
Maui for these few days and the tournament setting, the crowds, the lights, I
guess, everything that went into these three games?  
ANTHONY EDWARDS: I mean, at first when I got here and landed, we came to the
gym and had practice, I was like, are you telling me this gym be lit? Like
because it was so small. So first thing I was thinking, like, no way. So when
we got to the first game versus Dayton, it was crazy. They had a crazy crowd.
But I had fun. I feel like the best fun I had here was the win. But we went
jet skiing yesterday and that was the most fun I ever had in my life, man. I
want to do it again. So that was probably the best thing about Maui.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you both.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from coach.  
  
TOM CREAN: We told our team, and I knew they would have a hard time believing
it, that the toughest game of the year would be today. And it didn't matter if
it was going to be Chaminade or UCLA, it was going to be the toughest game of
the year because mentally when have you the comeback that we had yesterday and
then there's the emotion of it, the pageantry of it, the atmosphere of it,
it's very, very, very, very difficult, especially when kids. We have so many
kids, nine freshmen, a summer ago they lost a game at 10 or they won a game at
10, they turned around and played at 6 in an AAU tournament or they played at
6 next morning, they played at 10 they're so used to just turning right back
around. And a lot of times understanding that playing to play is not even
close to what gets it done. It's playing to win. And we had some moments today
where we didn't do a very good job. We had some moments today where we did.
But I think in the case of Anthony Edwards, of all the attention that he had
yesterday, to have the game that he had yesterday, to be a national, probably
international story yesterday with that second half, and to come here today
and to fight through it and not play great but to get better inside of the
game, he found things for us offensively, he wanted big challenges
defensively, and he's wired to take and make that shot that he made. And I
couldn't be prouder of him because what I want to have happen for him is
everybody to see him not only as a great player and as a really good person,
but a pure winner, just like I want it for everybody else.  
  
So we got a lot of contributions from guys. We had some that didn't do as
much. That's part of it. That's part of tournament play. They went small,
which it forced our hand. There's tons of room for us to get better when it
comes to how we defend the ball, when it comes to the activity of our hands,
on shooters, and then we got caught watching the ball, some on the cuts. But
that team is really good and I coached against them now four times, I believe,
Chaminade. With Coach Izzo, my first year with him as an assistant 25 years
ago. We won by two. When I was at Marquette, I think we won by three or four
and turned around and played Duke in the championship later in my first year
at Indiana. We won 72-70. So I'll take a three-point win over Chaminade and
say that we're building the margin of victory for us. They're a really well
coached, outstanding program. He does a phenomenal job. And to have that many
new players play the way he wants is a tribute to who he is as a coach.  
  
Q. That final shot by Anthony, where he went, the way it all developed
for you guys, was that kind of what you were hoping for?  
TOM CREAN: Well we wanted to go to the rim because we had time. And we didn't
know exactly what kind of pressure they would bring. So really we were going
to be comfortable with Anthony or Sahvir bringing it. The other one go
opposite and get a screen in the middle of the floor from Toumani Camora.
Ray's our best inbounder. And we swung Donell Gresham to the other side of the
floor so we opened up the right side once Anthony had it. But he's wired to
take that shot. So we're going to have to continue to, he's very, very
courageous, all right? And wants those shots. We just got to continue to
understand that there might have been a path to the rim too, but we're coming
out of here with a victory so we'll take it.  
  
Last thing I want to add is it, obviously, coming to Maui never gets old,
never will get old. Being a part of this tournament will never get old. It's
one of the greatest sporting venues, okay, for a competition, I should say, in
all of sports. And I think you would find many, many college basketball
coaches past and present that would agree with that. But it's that way for a
reason. It's that way because every year they come in here and they do
everything they can possibly do to make it better than it was the year before.
And Dave Odom deserves a ton of credit for that, as does Steve and all the
different people that are from the organizations that put this on. And every
time you come, you can't think that it could be better, right. You have to
deal with the basketball. The basketball is incredibly intense. It's nerve
wracking. You're playing great competition. All those types of things. But
when it comes to the absolute way that this tournament is run, it is, it is
second to none. And it's just an absolute honor to be invited and it's an even
greater honor to be a part of something that is so first class in every
possible way.  
  
So on behalf of the University of Georgia -- and I've said this before to Dave
-- I want to thank him again personally, I want to thank everybody that's
involved in this tournament, okay. Everybody from Tommy Bahama. Everybody from
Maui Jim. Everybody that makes this what it is. Because from the moment you
touch down to the moment that you leave you know you're in the presence of
incredible first class and you know you're in something that they take very,
very serious being second to none and it's that way for a reason. So very
honored to be here. Thank you.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 27, 2019

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Andre Arissol](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38295)

### [Tyler Cartaino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38280)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Georgia - 80, Chaminade - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach.  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: It was a heck of a game. Really proud of our guys. They competed
for 40 minutes. I know we're disappointed with the outcome, but to say you
went toe-to-toe with an SEC team and a potential, I don't know, top-3, top-2,
whatever draft pick in the NBA, is pretty special. The guys really stepped up
the third day, and we don't have the depth that a lot of teams have and the
guys like these guys, these two here, played a lot of minutes over three days
and I'm really proud that they battled right down to the very end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach. Open it up for questions for the players.  
  
Q. Both of you had such a great game, but just talk about the confidence
that you play with. I think that it 's remarkable. A lot of teams, they come
in here and they think they're just going to whip you folks around, but you
two have proven that you can go toe-to-toe with any of those teams. So talk
about that confidence that the two of you came into this tournament with.  
ANDRE ARISSOL: Yeah, I mean that's like kind of the reason that I came to this
school, because Coach preaches a lot about, and he kind of emphasizes it in
different ways, and it's like, you're only as good as your confidence. Yeah,
we come here as the underdogs and kind of the mentality that we don't have
anything to lose and they do. So if we don't play with confidence then we
don't play to our ability. So that's just something that we live and die for.
We're only as good as our confidence.  
  
TYLER CARTAINO: Yeah, we definitely have confidence. And at the end of the day
we realize these are big-name schools and really good players and really big
players. But they're just people like us, and we got to play the same game
they do. We have the same refs, we're in the same gym, so we're out there to
compete. I mean, if you think you're going to lose before the game starts, you
might as well not even play.  
  
Q. Andre, you had a number of big threes for your team tonight and
obviously none bigger from the corner to tie it up for a little while there.
Can you talk about that play and then the immediate right after of, I think
there was a timeout and then defending their final shot.  
ANDRE ARISSOL: Yeah, I mean that's what I'm here to do, like, knock down
shots. And I have like great facilitators around me, like Tyler and Kendall
and Roman and Eliet, who do a good job of getting in the lane and finding me,
so it makes my job a lot easier, and that was just another one of those
moments. I didn't really think about it in terms of, like, it's just a normal
shot. It's just one of those things. And at the end, yeah, Edwards hit a tough
shot. He is who he is, and we did a great job in trying to stop him, but it's
basketball, it's a game of punches and he hit a big one.  
  
Q. Tyler, your journey, especially being at Chaminade, has been pretty
impressive, especially like Coach said, you didn 't really play much before.
What is it about, what did you do particularly, do you think, to take yourself
to the next level?  
TYLER CARTAINO: What do I do?  
  
Q. What did you do.  
TYLER CARTAINO: Yeah, okay. That's a good question, actually. Yeah, I didn't
play really at all my freshman year. I probably should have redshirted, but
that's all right. Sophomore year, didn't play a lot either. Junior year, got
hurt. But the most important thing I did was just I just stayed in the gym.
Being an 18- to 20-year-old kid, it's really easy to want to go out with your
friends and do what that age kids do, but I just stayed in the gym. I didn't
have a trainer, I didn't, I don't think I need that. I had coach right here
that told me what I needed to do before I left Chaminade to go home for the
summer. And I just did that, I stayed in the gym as much as I could and good
things came from it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let the two of you get back to your team and we'll open
it up to questions for Coach.  
  
Q. I think coming into the tournament you talked about Tyler 's
development over the course of his career, just kind of what he just said,
like, he didn't really play at all his first year with you. What did you see
in this tournament from him and what do you expect from him for the remainder
of his last year based on what he's, how he's progressed?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Yeah, even beginning from last year, when he showed up for his
junior season he was right, he was finally where we wanted him to be. It's a
process. He came in and I saw something in him when he was at Impact Academy
-- I don't think anybody else offered him a scholarship, but I saw his
potential -- and he had some stuff to work on and he really, really worked on
it. And like he said, he was, he was always in the gym. Any time they had any
free time, I know, I know one guy that was there for sure, it was him. Andre
actually being the other. So we expect big things from him this year. He was
preseason All-American, he was first-team all-conference last year. An
incredible stat for him is he led our conference in field goal percentage last
year. For a 6'-5" wing guy, that's pretty unheard of to shoot that kind of
percentage. So he's got an incredibly unique ability of getting to the basket
and they call it euro step or avoiding charges or whatever, but he's got a
very unique talent and he's really worked on his outside shot, we have kind of
started from scratch a couple of years ago and I'm really confident in his
all-around game. I put the ball in his hands a bunch of times toward the end,
sometimes at the point guard position, sometimes posting up, so I got a lot of
confidence in him in a variety of ways.  
  
Q. Two years ago you guys closed the tournament with that win over Cal
and it was going to be a little while before you came back until this year.
And today you guys came very close to doing something similar. So coming that
close but not quite getting that win here, what do you think the intervening
time will be like until you return?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: It's not going to be as good a two years, I know that. For that
two-year time period, even coming back last year it was amazing seeing all the
great teams, Duke and Gonzaga and the rest of them. And I would be able to sit
in the stand and think, wow, I won my last game here. Pretty cool. But I can
imagine sitting here next year thinking, dang, I wish I would have won that
last game. So it will take a little while to get over. As a coach, as soon as
the game was over I was like, dang, I wish I would have done a few things
differently, everybody in the world knew the ball was going to go in No. 5's
hands and he was going to try to make a play. But our game plan was to try to
make him make difficult shots, because you can't prevent him from getting
shots, make him make difficult shots, and he missed a bunch of them earlier
and he made the one that counted though.

### [Mike Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20740)

### [Hunter Cattoor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38290)

### [Wabissa Bede](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37074)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Dayton - 89, Virginia Tech - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
MIKE YOUNG: We tip our cap to a really good Dayton team, exceptionally well-
coached Dayton team. They took us behind the shed and whipped our hind end.
And Coach Grant is -- they're going to have a really good year -- so are we --
they got the better of us today, we'll live to see another day and excited
about coming back over tomorrow and representing Virginia Tech. Y'all go
ahead.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up for questions for the players.  
  
Q. For both of you, what was it about Dayton that surprised you early on
that you didn 't anticipate today?  
WABISSA BEDE: Nothing surprised us. We just came out with bad energy, I kind
of felt it from like the layup line our energy was kind of low, we weren't as
upbeat as yesterday. We knew how good they were and we knew they were a great
team and they came out with fight from the first media timeout. You could tell
the energy was high, the fans were in it, it was like a home game for them and
all congrats to them. Great game.  
  
HUNTER CATTOOR: Like what he said. Great team, came out with more energy than
us and we never matched it from the point of the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, we'll take questions for coach.  
  
MIKE YOUNG: Anything, guys? Happy Thanksgiving.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2019

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [David McCormack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36810)

### [Udoka Azubuike](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35153)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Kansas - 71, BYU - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
BILL SELF: Well that was a hard team to guard. And early in the game they had
us on our heels the first 10 minutes. I really, I told our guys after about
the 10-minute mark I don't know if I can remember us locking in and being any
better defensively until about the probably 8-minute mark of the second half.
That was good, because we didn't make shots and we weren't great offensively,
but we still were able to kind of stretch the lead.  
  
So it was a hard game and, of course, it sets up a harder game tomorrow. But
that was, from a coaching standpoint, that was fun for me to watch from a
defensive standpoint.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. You guys both got to be back out there and start playing in about 18
hours. How tough is that?  
DAVID MCCORMACK: It's definitely tough. It's tough on my body, but I think
it's more of a mental thing. As long as we lock in, we know what we have to
do. So just making sure we get a good rest and recovery and pay attention to
the scouting for tomorrow, we should be good.  
  
UDOKA AZUBUIKE: Just pretty much what Dave said, like, just having a good
night's rest, staying off our feet, and that's about it.  
  
Q. David, what was the key to outscoring them by so much in the paint?  
DAVID MCCORMACK: Just using our size. As you can see, we have two bigs right
here, and just playing to our advantage and playing the height and
athleticism. So that's what we did.  
  
Q. Udoka, second game in a row pretty strong second half. Anything
similar about tonight from last night? Your focus or anything like that?  
UDOKA AZUBUIKE: Not really. It's about just trying to play my game and just
trying to help my team win. And no matter whichever half, in the first half it
was a little rough but in the second half we all got it together and we played
as a team.  
  
Q. Dok, could you describe the steal and dunk? And David, did that spark
the team and how, was that one of the best plays you 've seen?  
UDOKA AZUBUIKE: Yeah, I think I got the steal and then I thought the ref was
going to call a foul or something. But he didn't call the foul so I just took
the ball. We work, every day in practice we work on dribbling the ball and all
that stuff, so that kind of helped me a little bit. And I just saw the front
of the rim and I just dunked it.  
  
DAVID MCCORMACK: I would say anytime we see Dok go coast to coast and dunk it,
that's definitely going to spark our team.  
  
BILL SELF: Anytime? That's the first time.  
  
DAVID MCCORMACK: But, yeah, definitely it was definitely a kickstarter for our
team. We just got energized behind him and we just started playing with a lot
more energy after that happened.  
  
Q. What did you guys think of your defense tonight, start to finish?
Both of you, if you would.  
UDOKA AZUBUIKE: I think that we played really good defense today. I'm proud of
my team and my teammates and everybody. We really locked in today and played
outstanding defense. We listened to Coach's instructions and took care of the
ball. And so we got to do a better job off the rim, but other than that, I
think we did a solid job on the defensive end.  
  
DAVID MCCORMACK: I definitely thought that we did a great job defensively as
well. Like Coach said, I think we just got hit in the mouth first at the start
of the game and then we realized what we need to do. We need to hone in and
just really defend and stick to our principles and that's what we did. And
that's how we forced those turnovers and got steals and things like that to
translate into our offensive game.  
  
Q. What was the emphasis in tonight 's game defensively?  
DAVID MCCORMACK: I would say sticking to the scout and just doing what we need
to do. Making all the hustle plays on the floor, getting our hands on
deflections. It's just those little things are what caused bigger plays to
happen which kickstarts energy and things like that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let you two get back to your team. We'll open
it up for questions for coach.  
  
Q. I want to continue down here. It felt like you were really pushing
them out of their offense and not really allowing them to have as much free
movement as they had in the previous game. How were you able to kind of
contain that group that can really handle it?  
BILL SELF: Well I think that we're pretty athletic on the perimeter and we
wanted to play to our athletic ability. And we thought it was really important
against them to pressure the ball, and then maybe not deny as much just
because they back cut so much. But I think we got beat on one back cut. That
was in the second half, that I can remember. So I thought the guys did a good
job of in a short amount of time of kind of knowing what their end game was
offensively. But they run a lot of great stuff. Mark's terrific. And getting
ball and body movement. But I did, I thought our switches were better and I
thought our ball screen defense was much better.  
  
Q. Over the first two days, what are one or two things you learned about
your team that you didn 't have before you came on this trip?  
BILL SELF: I thought today was one of those games that reminded me of a Big-10
game in that it was a grind it out, bad, no offensive flow, really for both
teams, and you just trying to steal some extra possessions and don't give up
any easy baskets. And a ton of Big-10 games when I was in the league, and I
assume it's similar, were like that. The game was played fast enough that you
could think both teams could score 80 or 90 to start. And then you look at the
score at halftime and it's 29-27. So it's one of those games where you don't
play great and you look up and you're still ahead. And that was, obviously,
very positive for us and that's how you win games consistently is defend and
rebound and take care of the ball.  
  
Q. Along those same lines: Ochai, he seemed to do all of that tonight
--  
BILL SELF: I thought he was better. He gave up our first seven points off of
scouting report stuff. And I took him, I think I took him out pretty soon and
pretty early and I got after him a little bit. But he responded. He's the
best. He responded great. He was also our best post feeder in the second half
too. So that's something that you guys have studied us, we have been on him to
become a better passer, so I thought he did a much better job second half.  
  
Q. When there was about two and a half minutes left and Christian Braun
got an alley-oop dunk and that, it just set off the crowd. Can you talk about
that? It seemed like a play where it kind of put a capper on things.  
BILL SELF: Yeah, it was after the game was probably decided, but anytime you
have guys that can make athletic plays, we, obviously like everybody, we
stress to make them. And we haven't been a very good lob-throwing team. We
were a little bit better tonight and, certainly, I think it was Dot that gave
him the pass. And Christian's a good athlete and hopefully that does something
for his confidence to know that he can make a play in traffic like that. But
that was a very nice play.  
  
Q. I think Anthony Grant was on your staff for the USA basketball. Will
that be fun to play him? And what was it like being with him all summer?  
BILL SELF: Well it wasn't all summer, but we spent about three or three and a
half weeks together. Anthony is one of the classiest guys in our business,
unbelievable human being. And he's got a terrific team. And it will be a fun,
competitive big-boy game tomorrow from a physicality standpoint. I really like
his team and I know he does too and it should be a fun game. I mean, anytime
-- Dave's been doing this for a long time, and any time you win two, you want
to win the third. But the key to these three-game tournaments you got to go
home with two. And so tomorrow I bet that both teams play a little bit more
relaxed knowing that. Because when you play in a tournament like this and you
lose in the semis and you got to flip it and play a third place game with
somebody that's, you know, your equal or possibly better, I mean, that makes
it hard. So I look for both teams to play very well tomorrow.  
  
Q. Did you give any thought to changing up the lineup tonight?  
BILL SELF: I thought about it, yeah. Yeah, I'm glad I didn't. The one thing
that BYU had, they had, they could put a four man out there that could hurt us
from the perimeter. But they also had a four man out there that was much
smaller than David. So we didn't take advantage of it much the first half. But
I think over the course of the game we did throw the ball inside a little bit
more.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2019

  

### [Mark Pope](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16092)

### [Dalton Nixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38291)

### [Kolby Lee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38292)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Kansas - 71, BYU - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
MARK POPE: Proud of our guys for competing and fighting. We were excited about
the opportunity to go compete against Kansas tonight. They're a good team,
they're really physical, they're well coached, they played well. We just
couldn't answer the bell in the second half. But we're excited to get a chance
to play again tomorrow in a great game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the players.  
  
Q. Can you describe what it was like to go against Kansas ' defense?  
KOLBY LEE: Kansas is a really good team. And defensively, they make it really
hard for an offense to run their stuff. They're really good at keeping it on
one side of the floor. And I thought we did a good job trying to work it and
get our players in position to make plays, and unfortunately, there were some
times where we got good looks and just couldn't hit those shots, those shots
that you need to hit to beat a top-5 team like that. But they're really
aggressive, they're really intense defensively, and they're a really good
team.  
  
DALTON NIXON: They're great team, obviously. They're one of the top teams in
the nation for a reason. They are all super athletic, long. We knew that
coming in, that they were a great defensive team. At times we played with
great force and were able to get what we wanted and other times they caused
problems because they did, like you said, they kept it on one side of the
floor. And a lot of times we did get great looks but sometimes the ball
doesn't fall in and that's the way it goes.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let you two get back to your team. Open it up
for questions for coach.  
  
Q. 20 turnovers tonight. That had to be a key to the bad for you guys?  
MARK POPE: Yeah, for sure. They have, I think they have three guys or four
guys that are in the top whatever in steals, and certainly that had an impact
on us. They do a good job. They do a really good job keeping it on one side of
the floor, and they have great length. And they're kind of a ball-first
defense or downs. We actually had a really tough time passing out of it
against their length. And you're sitting there and you have an open roll and
you can't just quite get it to them. So our guys really struggled with that.  
  
I think the frustration for us mounted and we probably didn't handle that as
well as we would like to in the second half, and so the credit Kansas for
that, they're good. They're good. They can guard. I think they are No. 9 in
the country defensively on KenPom's numbers and they've actually played a
pretty challenging schedule, so they're probably actually better than that.  
  
Q. Jake 's been great, obviously, but tonight was a tough matchup with
Agbaji. You talked about the length with Kansas. Was that something that you
saw with him, just having a tough time with the matchup?  
MARK POPE: I did a poor job finding places for our guys to get downhill.
That's what we do is we break down the defense, try to get into a drive and
kick game and that's where we operate, that's where we feel like we have some
juice. And we just had such a hard time getting to the front line whether it
was drag screens or ball screens or stop actions or stagger aways, it was just
really hard for us. We kind of - sometimes we'd get a step down and then that
gap would close pretty quickly. And that's something that, as Jake continues
to progress as an extraordinary basketball player, that's something that we
have to help him be able to do, where he actually feels comfortable committing
to that gap and making plays there. And so I need to do a better job and he
needs to do a better job and we'll grow.  
  
Q. It felt like last night you played a little faster, for some reason
tonight it felt like your tempo wasn 't as fast. Is it just the quick
turnaround or what was it? It just felt like it looked like you weren't, that
they weren't playing as fast.  
MARK POPE: Well I think first it's Kansas, right? So first it's Kansas.
Second, you know, it's my fault my rotation was just too tight. We just, right
now we're just somewhat limited in our depth. So I think I played eight guys
last night and so I think we were, we played the least amount of guys
yesterday and these guys are carrying a big burden and I'm asking them to go a
lot, so that's probably part of it. And also part of it is our learning curve.
Our default personality is to have guys a little bit more analytical and
contemplative about the game and the decision-making process in the game
rather than just going and just trusting the simple play. Yesterday I felt
like we made some real progress trusting the simple play and trusting the next
guy and a pop rule, a .5 second rule like where, if you don't have something,
you're just moving the ball. And today, especially when we got down, we got
stuck with guys probably trying a little bit too hard to make a play to fix
it, rather than just trusting the guy next to them.

## November 26, 2019

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Aaron Henry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37112)

### [Cassius Winston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34730)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Michigan State - 93, Georgia - 85  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
TOM IZZO: Well it was a tale of maybe two thirds of a game and a third of a
game and I'm going to take it as I'm pleased because it's good to get Cash
back on track a little bit here. Aaron was pretty solid until we started
giving up threes. And give Georgia a lot of credit. Give Tom a lot of credit.
He did a better job than I did keeping his team in the game. I think we got to
learn that when a guy gets hot that's a prolific scorer. If somebody let
Cassius do that, he could maybe not make the shots he made, but we got a lot
of guys letting them get into the rhythm and then trying to guard them and
actually doing a hell of a job but it's too little, too late. I thought we
quit running, I thought I did a poor job of substituting. I was going to make
this guy next to me play today, and I did. But Foster Loyer played pretty
well. If I could have got him a couple minutes here and there it probably
would have helped him.  
  
We're still struggling at the four. And yet early in the game Marcus did a lot
of good things. Just disappointing to go back, but I'm happy for Tom and for
Georgia. That's the true colors of a team to be down almost 30 points and find
a way to come back and almost tie it up. So a lot of work to do yet.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Take questions for the players.  
  
Q. Cassius and Aaron: What was the conversation last night leading up to
the game amongst the players trying to give that effort after a disappointing
loss?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: We just focused on a lot of, just focused on within
ourselves. We got all the pieces. We got everything we need to be a really
good team. We just got to figure out what's going to get us going and how
everyone's going to bring their best each and every night. And that's more of
less than focusing on our opponents, less than focusing on the outside noise,
we got to come together as a group within ourselves and make that commitment
to ourselves to be the best that we can be.  
  
AARON HENRY: Everything was more of an internal conversation as far as what we
can do to control the things that we can on the court. Of course, we got other
teams to play and they have great players, but if we don't do the things we're
supposed to do within ourselves then it's going to be hard to even get to that
point where we have to focus on them.  
  
Q. When Edwards started hitting those shots, I guess, how did you rally
to kind of stop them at that point in terms of he 's hitting shots after he
gets into that rhythm there just turning around just throwing it up from way
outside.  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yeah, it's tough once a player like that gets going. It's the
reason why he got all the hype, it's the reason why he got a name like that.
You let a player like that get going it's very difficult to slow him down and
that just feeds into everybody on the team. So you got to focus on getting the
rebounds, you can't let them get second chances, you can't turn the ball over,
things like that that's going to just kind of keep the game in your hands as
much as possible. Those are the types of things that we got to kind of shore
up at the end.  
  
AARON HENRY: We put an emphasis on a scorer like that not to get let him get
going. And once we let him get going it's hard to get a player like that just
to slow him down. So got to do a better job of that and just continue to play
solid defense.  
  
Q. Cassius, your coach mentioned he wanted you to play tonight. Did this
feel like, from the sideline watching you, it looked like, to me, it looked
like watching what we 're used to seeing from Cassius Winston. 10-16 I think.
Only a couple turnovers. Did this feel like the best you've kind of felt, I
guess, on the court in a while?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yeah, definitely. Just, I mean, it just it was a tough day
too. I think I cried before the game and things like that. But once I got out
there, I was able to find my rhythm, find my peace out there on the court and
that was really good for me, getting up-and-down, just having that rhythm that
I usually play with, I feel like this is the first time I kind of had it in a
while.  
  
Q. Aaron, wondered if, what conversations you had with a guy like
Anthony Edwards when he gets that hot. I know he 's smiling at you a little
back and forth. I'm just, I mean, have you dealt with guys who have been that
hot before? And what sort of is the conversation that's happening on the court
when that's happening?  
AARON HENRY: More of like he's just trying to get going, I mean, really wasn't
too much conversation. He was doing more talking than me but I'm just playing
the game. And he hit some tough shots, credit to him. I feel like I was down
some but I got to start earlier and make sure he doesn't even get going. But
that's where I got to improve. And as far as the conversation goes, I mean, I
don't know too much about it. It was loud in there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll take questions for coach.  
  
TOM IZZO: I have something to say once they leave. Guys, especially for our
writers, we have gone through a couple tough years, gone through some things
that I never dreamed I would go through. And when I was going through them
they told me that the fact don't matter. The facts don't matter and sometimes
in some of these things we all went through. Well damn it, I'm here to tell
you the facts do matter. And the fact is I had to get that kid off the bench
up in that locker room because Rocket Watts said to me, Coach, everybody else
left, him and Rocket were left. I look over there was a puddle under his
chair, a puddle. He's been struggling, his mother's been struggling. I
actually enjoyed the way you asked that question, because you did it so
gingerly, and to be honest with you, that's the way I'm coaching him. It makes
what I went through two years ago seem like nothing, because we always try to
make games or events in our life, life and death. This was life and death. And
it's hard. I mean, I know what happened yesterday, but we got beat by a good
team that played well and they really did and they deserve all the credit. But
that even wasn't half my player out there. He didn't even play the half
because of the foul trouble, but when he was back it was just a wicked day.
And I've been told by the people that there's going to be these ups and downs.
So somewhere if one guy says I'm making an excuse, there's going to be a
fistfight, because the facts do matter. They matter. And the fact is the best
friend in his life lost his life, and we're struggling, as a team. But he is
struggling as a human being. And so when I listened to you ask that question,
that's how I've coached him, you know, Cash, you got to play better, but I
know you're giving me your all. You gingerly ask questions. This ain't going
away. We're just going to try to build on it as a family. And I'm going to
listen to Tony Dungy, I'm going to listen to Reggie Winston, and I'm going to
try my hardest to coach him back to normalcy, which means I have to be normal
too. It's the most difficult thing I've done.  
  
So now I'll open it up to any questions that has nothing to do, he played good
today, but there was a lot more that went into him last night mentally than
went into my preparation for the game. And I don't want to take anything away
from Georgia. I thought that was an unbelievable comeback by a good, one of my
best friends in the profession. And Antman, I recruited Antman. He's every bit
as good as Steve Smith told me. So he deserves it. My only negative, I thought
Aaron let him go a couple times early. We had him which way we wanted to force
him, we didn't do a good job. But once a guy like that gets in a zone, so was
Tyrese Maxey, then it was my man from Seton Hall, and now it's this guy. You
know, you tell your players when you're highly ranked people are going to
bring their best. I'm not sure that we're mature enough yet to handle that
with some of the losses we have had of Langford and, really, Winston. So we're
going to grow on that. So now I'll open it up to any questions, thank you.  
  
Q. You talked about Foster and I think that he 's a potential
opportunity for scoring. He's a great scorer coming out of high school. What
can you do to kind of give him more involvement in your offense?  
TOM IZZO: Well, the problem we had with a team like this tonight, Tom started
those big guards and strong guards and to put Cassius and Foster in there
together would have been a way to do it offensively. Defensively, it would
have been a struggle. And yet not everybody has -- you know, the sad part is
we did such a good job of guarding Antman, we did such a good job of running
the ball, we did such a good job of taking care of the ball. And then all of a
sudden, boom, boom, boom, I mean, they go zone and we throw the ball right to
them. I mean, it was -- but I think, you know, this group is a little fragile
still and this group is very young still. The experience we had, some of it is
gone. And the experience that we're going to get, we're going to get better.
But we got an All-American that's probably gone through one of the toughest
things that any human being would go through, and we're just going to have to
keep working him day-to-day through that and see if I can do a better job and
a better job of getting a couple of those other guys. I told Foster -- it's
interesting you asked that. First thing I said in the locker room, Foster, you
got screwed by your coach. You played good enough to play more minutes. And
yet, let's not forget this: When they cut that lead to 10, to eight, to two,
different times, we answered the bell too. That wasn't easy and we had some
guys make some big plays. But, boy, you got to give Antman credit, I mean, he
made some shots that I wouldn't even allow a church league team I used to play
on take. And he made them and he made them well.  
  
Q. Xavier seemed to have a tough night again, but he does hit that shot
late when you talk about answering and stuff like that. What have your
conversations been with him as he 's, I guess, struggled to some degree
offensively? And what do you think of his overall play because his game is not
entirely a scorer?  
TOM IZZO: I got to get my shot at the media so this is a good question. Thank
you. You know, when there gets to be talk about NBA and doing this and doing
that, it really affects different people in different ways. And I think he
started putting too much pressure on himself. He fumbled the ball, I mean, he
dunks and layups in the last two nights, what did he get tonight? 15 and 11. I
mean that's a 21, 22-point night. Last night he should be leaving this
tournament right now with averaging 20-some points and probably 13, 14
rebounds and we don't think he's playing great. So, you know, Xavier has, as I
told him, the things he did last year, you always listen to the outside world
and think you have to do more. The reason he became a household name is what
he did last year. So don't worry about changing those things. And I think, I
think he has a little bit, but I think he'll bounce back.  
  
Q. I did want to ask you about the, you mentioned the 4 's, still
struggling with the 4, you made the switch in the starting lineup. Just kind
of your thought process where you're at with that right now --  
TOM IZZO: I'm going to be really be hard on you guys, both on media and talk
radio, because I'm probably going to change it again and again and again. I'm
not happy with it. There's different guys who bring different things.
Everybody has a serious plus and everybody has a couple of minutes. Even a guy
like Malik had played so well, but a little bit tougher in different positions
kind of -- that high post, he struggled a little bit. Marcus did a great job
in the first half. When he gets tired, it kind of goes down. Julius did some
good things. Thomas Kithier has got, he's just got to play harder and not go
in the game and take a three the first shot he takes. So everybody's got some
issues, coach got some issues. We had a bounce-back game. I mean, that was a
disappointing loss last night. We had a bounce-back game. And like I said,
half of last night was spent on our mental health. That's not good when you
only have 20 hours or 15 hours to prepare for a team. But that's the way we're
going to be for a while, guys. And at the same time I love the way Tom's team
played, came back, they attacked, they got a lot more fast-break points than
us. Didn't rebound quite as good, but for their size -- and he should be on
them about that, because that's one of mine and his staples -- but I thought
the things we wanted to do, not shoot as many threes, get the ball inside, we
did that. Not turn it over, we did that for about two thirds of the game.
Defend, did that for two thirds of the game. One of these days we're going to
put a whole game together. So appreciate it, I'll see you tomorrow.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2019

  

### [Anthony Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19553)

### [Trey Landers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34867)

### [Obi Toppin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38278)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Dayton - 89, Virginia Tech - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the players.  
  
Q. Obi, how much fun are you guys having out there right now? Everything
is clicking.  
OBI TOPPIN: Knowing what we have been through this whole off-season and
summer, it's just, it's a good feeling being in this position right now just
because we know how hard we worked to get here. And so this opportunity to
play in the championship at the Maui Invitational, it's a great feeling.  
  
Q. Trey, they cut it to 14 at one point there and you guys put it in
another gear and really put it away. What happened at that point?  
TREY LANDERS: Coach Grant always preaches to us, like, we know basketball is a
game of runs. Virginia Tech is a really good team so you know they are going
to come back with a punch at the end of the day, we knew that was going to
happen. It was all about us weathering the storm. We've had adversity before
and it was just about us facing that and us staying together, I think was the
biggest thing. So we did that as a team and we went on a run again. And after
that our defense was, like intensity just went through the roof and I think
that's what won us the game.  
  
Q. Obi, when you were on the free-throw line in the first quarter,
someone was yelling something down and you kind of looked to the stands and at
that point you kind of turned it up. Are you getting to a point where people
are trying to find ways to get under your skin. How do you keep maintaining
your composure?  
OBI TOPPIN: It's basketball, so people in the stands is going to do that. I
use it to help me. I use it for energy, like, it pushes me to play harder and
to get the crowd hyped, like, our fans were getting hyper while I was, while
all of us was telling them to get loud. And it was just, it was just an uphill
from then on.  
  
Q. Speaking of your fans, they were chanting with just over a minute to
play there, We want Kansas. Do you guys feel the same way?  
TREY LANDERS: The biggest thing for us, we're just worried about who is
winning the next game. We don't know who is going to win. The fans are going
to be fans, they are going to say what they want. At the end of the day, we
just focus on what we do, whether BYU wins or Kansas wins, we just got to lock
in on what's going on, so we're not really worried about that part of the
game.  
  
Q. Your mom and Victor arrived just before the tip. Did you get to see
them? Did you know they were there?  
OBI TOPPIN: Yeah, I saw them walk in, but I was so focused on the game I
didn't get to say anything to them yet so I'll see them after the game.  
  
Q. Trey, between the way you guys are playing, your style of play, and
your fan 's reactions, it seems like you guys have kind of got like a little
yin-yang kind of going back and forth between the two of you, your fans and
you guys. Is there something, I know you have massive support at home, but is
there something kind of happening here? There's just something in the air?  
TREY LANDERS: No, like, I play with a lot of passion in the game and all my
teammates do as well. So we know when the fans get into the game it just
boosts our energy. So when a big play happens, I look to the crowd and I just
do this (Indicating) and obviously that kind of -- my saying is, like, give
them more, so they kind of get louder. But I think it just pumps us up. And
our fans are like a big part of us when we play and go on runs. So I think the
biggest thing is, like, when we have them, it just helps us even more. So
we're always impacted to the game, even when we're winning or whether we're
losing, so we just thank them a lot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let you two get back to your team.  
  
Coach, would you like to start with an opening comment or go straight into
questions.  
  
ANTHONY GRANT: Well, proud of the effort our guys put out tonight. I thought,
we knew coming in, Virginia Tech is from a, just a coaching standpoint a lot
of respect for Coach Young and the way his teams play. They're a tough guard.
The stuff they run is really difficult to guard, especially on a one-day prep.
So I was really proud of our guys to be able to lock into what we needed to
do. They are a prolific three-point shooting team and we knew that. Just
looking at the stat sheet here, they got, it looks like 21, is that right? 21
three-point attempts today? And made eight. And we knew coming in that that
would be a huge key to the game. So I thought the first half, I thought our
guys' energy and their alertness was really, really good. Like any good team,
they made a run in the second half. And I thought from the eight-minute media
to the close of the game our guys took it to another level defensively and
were able to put the game away.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Looking at the stat breakdown, it 's crediting you guys on here with
20 dunks in this game. Can you speak to you guys getting the ball inside like
that and that interior dominance?  
ANTHONY GRANT: Well, I thought that there were points in the game where we
didn't really understand the advantages that we had in terms of some of the
shot selection, but I thought, really, down the stretch of the game our guys
understood where we had an advantage and we really honed in on that. And I
thought they did a really good job to finish the game. I think all year we
have been one of the more efficient teams in the country when you look at it
from an offensive standpoint. So for us, I think it's just understanding who
we are, identity-wise, and trying to stick to that identity.  
  
Q. Can you talk about your fans? They were obviously excited. Great game
today for them to watch. But can you speak to how boisterous they are?  
ANTHONY GRANT: Well, that's, if you ever get a chance to come to Dayton, Ohio,
you'll know that that's an everyday thing for our fans. We got some of the
greatest fans in the country. You can see by the way they travel, the way they
show up here. And they love the Flyers. So I can't thank them enough for
coming out here and giving us all the love and support that they give us.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you: We keep asking about the fans, the Dayton fans.
You got your family up in the crowd. At one point Obi is pointing up to your
kids, I believe, and just excited and celebrating. What 's it like to have
your family here in such a big moment for the program?  
ANTHONY GRANT: Ask me when the American Express bill comes at the end of the
month I'll probably tell you better (laughing). No, but it's great. Obviously,
my wife and my four kids are here, for my kids their first time in Hawaii, so
getting a chance to enjoy this experience and obviously to come out and
support our team, it's great to have them here and get a chance to experience
this tournament.  
  
Q. Were there telltale signs through pre-season that this was, that you
guys had the potential of being this cohesive and together this early on in
the season?  
ANTHONY GRANT: I said this the other night, our guys, they love each other,
and it sounds like a clich�, but from the summer we got a group of guys that
they enjoy being with each other. When they're not out here on the court
together at practice you'll see them hanging out together, they go to lunch
together, they hang out, they're with each other when we're not doing
basketball stuff. They enjoy each other's company, they enjoy being with each
other. So that's always a good thing. And for us, we're five games into this
thing, you know what I mean, so we'll, we understand that and we understand
that we have room to grow as a team and this is a great tournament for us to
find out about ourselves and we're excited that tomorrow we get a chance to
compete for a championship. So we're taking it one day at a time and just
looking forward to continuing that process.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2019

  

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Cody Riley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38288)

### [Jaime Jaquez Jr.](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38289)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
UCLA - 74, Chaminade - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Once we stopped turning the ball over we were able to score some
baskets. We shot 55 percent from the field. So we still got a lot of growing
to do as a team. Obviously, you see the fact that Jaime started the second
half and played the entire second half. It is my first year obviously at UCLA.
I think I'm six or seven games in, and we're just trying to build our culture
of competitiveness. So these guys are, these two guys are really trying to
embrace it and physically compete, which is what we're going to have to do to
get where we trying to go as individuals and as a team.  
  
But, obviously, we really struggled in the first half. Please don't ask me
questions about the turnaround. Where I'm from, my dad's here he, had four
jobs and never had a day off. If I wanted to spend time with him I had to go
to work with him. That's why I'm a coach because he was a coach. So I don't
believe in that stuff. The turnaround had, before you ask, the turnaround had
nothing to do with our first half. Chaminade's defense and our, our need to
continue to grow up and play with some offensive toughness and take care of
the ball, that was the problem.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the players.  
  
Q. Jaime gave you some nice energy and efficiency in defense and
toughness in the second half that --  
MICK CRONIN: Yeah, that would be an understatement. He did in the first half.
He's not afraid to cross the line and tell his teammates, we need to man up
and play like grownups. I'm trying to build a program, so like I told the
guys, it's tryout time. Everybody's in an audition, the way I see it. And he
plays with a lot of heart. Obviously, Jaime will tell you, he's young, he's
got some things he's got to work on his perimeter defense because he's a
taller perimeter guy playing against smaller guys at times. But right now, I'm
just looking for competitive fight and fire. And then as time goes, we got to
get better at executing, but his competitiveness was a big, big factor today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for the players?  
  
Q. For both of the players: Coach is talking about building a culture.
What are the kinds of things that you two are trying to do with your teammates
to get to the point where Coach wants you to be?  
CODY RILEY: Just coming out and playing hard, competing for 40 minutes
straight. Not for one half, not for 20 minutes, not for 30 minutes, but
competing for a full 40 minutes straight.  
  
JAIME JAQUEZ JR: To add on to that, just toughness, being tough. 40 minutes
out of the game. Not just one half or the second half, but the entire game,
the entire 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Jaime, what did you feel like you wanted to bring in that second half
to the team that you were able to do?  
JAIME JAQUEZ JR: Toughness and competitive fire. Just go out, get rebounds,
get stops. And stops, we got a whole bunch of stops and that's why we won the
game.  
  
Q. Cody, you played against Michigan State last year, so you know what
they 're kind of all about. What do you kind of foresee as the challenge of
facing them again tomorrow?  
CODY RILEY: We know that we're going to have to get back in transition. We
know that we're going to have to be able to sustain 40 minutes of playing hard
in transition. We know they run, so we're going to have to be prepared for
that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let you guys get back to your team. Open it up for
questions for coach.  
  
Q. You held them to 23.3 percent shooting. How much of that do you think
was your defense and how much of that was maybe just them missing some
shots?  
MICK CRONIN: Well, look, in fairness to Chaminade, they have had some, they
have a lot of turnover at their program. I've been watching this tournament,
and they have had some teams that were more offensively there than this team.
They have no low post guy. So although I don't look at what they shot, I'm
looking at the shots we gave up, the defensive rotations we missed. So I don't
know if our defensive performance was as good. There were some times where
they just, our size was, it just is what it is. Our size bothered them, to be
honest with you. Man, not to say we didn't do some good things. I thought
David gave us a big lift. Tyger's got a long way to go as a defender, as a
freshman, as most freshmen do. He's got some challenges with his feet and
maintaining his focus. So I was really happy with David. Not his shooting
either, just being solid on the defensive end. That's what we need.  
  
Q. You say you 're holding auditions, how far would a performance like
this from Jaime and David go toward --  
MICK CRONIN: Huge. But we're all day-to-day. Can you sustain it, like Cody
talked about. Got to play for the name, you got to play for the front of the
jersey. That's what they do in real programs. That's why for us, regardless of
tomorrow, what happens tomorrow, I wanted to get a chance to, when Michigan
State loss to Virginia Tech, I was, we need to beat Chaminade because we need
to play Michigan State. Because I talk a lot about them to our team since I've
got the job, because I don't want to talk -- you know, I don't like talking
too much about Cincinnati and throwing it in our guys' face, because for the
last couple years how we won those games.  
  
So, and I told Dan in my interview that if I could do half of what Tom Izzo's
done at Michigan State, that that's my goal at UCLA. To run a program, run it
the right way, win the right way, graduate players, everything, they're about
the team. Guys still make the NBA. They got guys all over the NBA. And their
guys win in the NBA because they're taught winning in college. And I really
did tell Dan that in the interview. There's a way to run an elite program to
make your university proud, not just to win games. It's the way Coach Izzo has
run his program for 25 years. So the problem is he's 25 years in and I'm six
games in or seven games in, as far as building what we're all about.  
  
But the only way to find out is you play teams like that. You play teams like
that, see where, so your guys see what they're all about. They don't quit on
plays, their physicality is second to none, their commitment to the name on
the front of the jersey is second to none.  
  
Q. I believe you had back-to-back-to-back turnovers early in the second
half --  
MICK CRONIN: That's impressive, isn't it?  
  
Q. At that point it was 15 for the game --  
MICK CRONIN: Sometimes you got to laugh or you'll cry.  
  
Q. At that point it was 15 for the game in 22 minutes and I think you
finished with only three more the rest of the game. So how did your guys kind
of gain the composure at that point going forward?  
MICK CRONIN: Take the guys out that turn the ball over. Put guys in that
don't. They pay me a lot of money for that. You guys, we got anything else? Do
you have Michigan State questions while I'm here? I know that Eric is sitting
out here so I don't want to leave the Chaminade guys out there too long. You
got one more?  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MICK CRONIN: Yeah, I don't talk about -- it's Michigan State. I elaborate on
everything that they're about, which is what I want us to become and we will
become. It's one way or the other. One way or the other, we will become that.
The question is how soon. And the question is with who, with whom. Obviously,
Jaime gives you a young guy that you can build with, the way he displayed his
heart and toughness today. And by the way, he didn't make a jump shot, so,
which is what I explained to the players, he did not make a jump shot. So we
got to learn that jump shooting is not competing. Jaime understands that. So
hence he didn't come out of the game. Thanks, guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, coach.

# [MAUI JIM MAUI
INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2019

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Rayshaun Hammonds](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34835)

### [Anthony Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38285)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Michigan State - 93, Georgia - 85  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
TOM CREAN: We knew we were playing a great basketball team, one of the premier
programs in the country. We finally figured out in the second half what it
takes to compete at the level that they play at. And that's what it was. We
did not, we did not sustain that. We got off to obviously a good start, I
think it was 15-11 somewhere in there. We were right in the game, but then we
let our guard down a little bit. And as impressive as what Anthony did with
the scoring I'm far more impressed with the spirit and the energy, I'm more
impressed with the 14 deflections, I'm more impressed with the way the ball
was pushed. And when our team, when Anthony and Samir, when they figure out
how good we can be, running, throwing the ball ahead, rim running the way that
we did, we'll get a lot more confidence in our game, we'll get a lot more
confidence in our team, and we'll get a lot more confidence that will help us
to build some sustainability.  
  
But to play Dayton yesterday and to play Michigan State thus far, two
tremendous programs, two very, very well coached, tough disciplined groups,
gives us an idea what this has to look like. Now my, our goal is that we
embrace it. And the hardest game for this team probably all season long will
be tomorrow. And we have got to get them to understand that. But if we're
growing in maturity, if we're growing in leadership, if Anthony and Ray are
real leaders, they're going to understand what we have got it to get done to
be able to come in and compete against either one of those teams tomorrow. And
that's the key. Because it's really easy to look at it and say, okay, we did
some good things, but we still didn't win the game. And that's what we got to
make sure that our players understand that as we move forward and get hungry
to get that next game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the players.  
  
Q. Anthony, it seems like, and Tom mentioned it, you and Sahvir have a
great chemistry when you 're out there together. You can play off him because
you don't have handle the ball as much. How much does that play into the
production you had in the second half there?  
ANTHONY EDWARDS: Not just Sahvir, the whole team. The guys were behind me no
matter what. We played hard. We got great players all out there on the floor
and coach is a great coach. So we just play and do what he tells us to do and
let the chips fall where they may.  
  
Q. For both of you: What did you learn in the second half about your
team?  
RAYSHAUN HAMMONDS: We're learning playing great teams like that. They're a
great team. You learn how to play against physicality and things like that and
we learned from it. We just have to get better from it and that's really it.  
  
ANTHONY EDWARDS: I think we learned that we got a great group of guys, tough,
just being tenacious rebounders no matter what, just playing hard. That's all
it's about, just having fun.  
  
Q. For Anthony, you know, coming in with the hype you came in, you
always have a bullseye. And it seemed like the second half, you made sure you
were taking it personal and it really pushed your game. What has it been like
to play through all those kind of expectations?  
ANTHONY EDWARDS: I mean, when I step on the floor I don't really care about
what people think I should do on court. I just play for my team. I always been
a team player. My team's always behind me. Like I said, coach is a great
coach. So we just do what he tells us to do and play ball.  
  
TOM CREAN: I would add to that he doesn't -- he's got an infectious energy
with him with his teammates that is rare. And, obviously, he scored a lot of
points today. But like I said -- and he brings confidence in that -- but the
way he moves the ball and if we build on what he did with pushing the ball up
the court like that today and that's going to make, pay major, major dividends
for us. Because, obviously, he's going to be at the front, as is Ray, of
anybody's scouting report. And when you're moving the ball and when you're
getting lost in the game and when you're attacking and doing those type of
things, it sometimes puts the scouting report on hold, all right? When you're
not playing as quick, when you're in the playing as fast-paced, when you're
not moving as well, then it brings the scouting report to life. And we got to
make sure that we continue to understand that. And for a young guy, he's doing
better and better all the time and learning that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let the two of you get back to your team and
we'll open it up for questions for Coach.  
  
Q. The individual performances that you saw tonight, both Anthony with
his game and then Cassius with everything that he 's going through, I guess,
where does this rank for you in terms of individual performances?  
TOM CREAN: That's a hard question. I've been a part of some great individual
performances but it's really hard for me, as a coach 20 years in, to grade an
individual performance when you don't win the game. That's hard. Because, and
that would have made it a happy story, right? But the bottom line is Anthony's
just scratching the surface. And if he will build on the leadership that he
showed today on and off the court, I mean, on the floor and off the floor
today the way he did, and if he will continue to attack, because we gave him
the challenge of guarding Cassius right off the bat. And I don't know if that
was met with -- there were a few eye rolls, probably, from my staff on that --
but he's got to rise to the challenge. He's a kid that wants that type of
challenge. Well, when you say that, you're going against one of the elite
guards in all of college basketball. Probably, if there was an all-decade team
of point guards, you're going to put Cassius Winston on that. I know he's only
played six or seven games this year, but he beats you so many ways and he
loves the pass. Our whole thing is we did not want to have to over-help on
him. We made some mistakes on screens. We knew that Tillman in the front line
would come out with their hair on fire today. They did. And what Cassius does
is he's become such a better shooter. Like, last year, I think of his threes.
39 of 84 threes he made were off the dribble. Well, now he's able to do even
more off the catch. Like, he can do so many different things. His range has
increased. He loves to pass. You over-help, he's going to find the lob, he's
going to find the dropoff. And when you got a guy like that that doesn't
predetermine what he's going to do, that's what makes him a special, special
guard.  
  
Obviously, Tom has his sets and he has the actions that he wants to run, but
Cassius can do so many things from a predetermined way and -- or without
predetermining, and that's big.  
  
Q. When a guy gets into that zone, that looked like it was out of body
there --  
TOM CREAN: It definitely was.  
  
Q. Do you, what, do you just kind of back off and just let him go?  
TOM CREAN: No, a little bit, a little bit. We keep trying to -- the thing to
me is you got to keep coaching the game to get to the bonus, because you're
not going to beat those guys if you don't get to the foul line, because you
got to be able to set your defense. So the jump shots were good but we needed
to keep attacking the rim, and he was feeling it. And that's the first time
I've been around him when he feels it like that. And really, we're going to
look back at the film. When he misses, there's been, I could spend all day
talking about what we're trying to do to build him fundamentally, but when he
misses it's always pretty clear why. And today he was making, it was pretty
clear why. Because he was stepping into it, he was releasing it quick, he was
holding his followthrough. His, even his step back was straight up, not
falling away. Those things are important things. But to me, the way that he
was, this is the first time he's really understood, I can attack that defense
in the fast-break situation. I mean, that's what Michigan State is. Michigan
State's a fast break, rebounding unit. That's what we have always tried to be
where I've been. We've got to get that built. We're not there yet, but that's
a step in the right direction with that.  
  
The next step for us, and it goes with Sahvir too, is how much better are we
going to get at throwing the ball ahead. And we started to get better at that
in this game. Because he's not going to have those out-of-body experiences
every game, but the ball's got to move that fast and that quickly and that
efficiently for us to take the next step as a team.  
  
Q. When you have a guy who has just so much attention, and always, that
Anthony gets, what 's the biggest challenge in keeping everyone else
engaged?  
TOM CREAN: Oh, they love him. They love him. Oh, that's always -- you're
always going to have a -- especially early in the season -- every team goes
through it, every team has guys that are going to be a little jealous, going
to get a little sullen, get a little quiet. And then that -- I get it, to a
degree, that was a heck of an atmosphere to be in and we didn't go to the
bench much inside of that once we got on that run. So I get that. But every
day with him he moves the ball in an incredibly high rate. He took some
leadership steps today. Now the next big thing is can he maintain it. But he
is, there's times in practice especially he passes the ball too much. And he
will predetermine. And that's part of being a young guard, he will
predetermine what he's going to do, where a guy like Cassius doesn't really
predetermine it - or at least if he does he don't let anybody know, he makes
the play when it's the right time to make it. So that's what we got to learn.
But if he didn't engage himself with his teammates the way that he is and if
he wasn't working -- I mean, we gave him the Cassius Winston matchup today.
And it's important that he feel that challenge and he had to respond to that
challenge. So if -- this is not going to be a situation where a guy's playing
one end of the floor and just shooting the ball. It's never been that, it will
never be that, I'll never coach that. And that's what he's got to thrive to do
other things, that's one of the reasons he came is because he bought into the
fact that we were really, really going to hold him accountable -- he didn't
know what that meant when he signed and it took him about three, four weeks to
figure it out, but he's figuring it out and we're going to continue to do
that.  
  
Q. Since Sunday morning you kind of had the theme about the toughness
and the physicality of this tournament. And even through yesterday 's presser
and then today you're down 26. How important was it to see your team get off
the mat and really fight back?  
TOM CREAN: Extremely, extremely. There's no -- you coach 20 years, you don't
have moral victories, it's not. And I don't want them to feel that, because we
didn't win the game. But the bottom line is identity doesn't always come out
in a win. Our identity, the proper identity started to come out today even
though we lost the game. And you're trying to build an identity. It's early,
early in the season, okay, it's -- you -- we have got to be able to understand
what will cause us to lose, all right, before we really understand how to win.
And the first half caused us to lose and the second half was starting to teach
us how to win. Now how do we put that together over a period of time, with a
young group, that's the trick and that's what we got to continue to work on
every day.  
  
Q. Aaron Henry is a guy that 's sort of scratching the surface for
Michigan State and looked more aggressive today than yesterday. From an
opposing coach's perspective, his ceiling and what sort of matchup issues he
can create for them?  
TOM CREAN: Well Michigan -- Tom's lucky that I wasn't at Indiana any more
because we would have never let him get out. I love him. I loved him when
people didn't really know who he was because he was a blue collar guy. Very
blue collar. Played for a great high school coach. And I'm proud that --
obviously I'm proud that he is at Michigan State. I want, I'll now go back 364
days of wanting Tom to be highly successful. But he's going to be fantastic
because he's making better decisions, he can shoot the ball, he can rebound,
he can post, he's a multi-purpose player. Really, to me, he's a little
stronger than he was at the time. He's going to be on the Morris Peterson
train there. I mean, I see the symbolism there, and I'm not big on
comparisons, but that's one that stands out to me, not just because they're
left-handed, but Morris grew to be a guy that could do a lot of different
things and that's why he's one of the all-time greats there. And Aaron -- it
took Morris a little while to mature, where Aaron looks like he's really
pretty mature for a player and he does a lot of things for them. So he's going
to be one of the premier players in the country from the wing spot because he
can play multiple positions, he can do multiple things, he can guard multiple
people and he's very trustworthy. I would, I haven't asked Tom this, but he
looks very, very trustworthy on the court. And when you're trying to win a
game you got to have trust in your team, trust in the players on the floor,
I'm sorry.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 26, 2019

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Eliet Donley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38286)

### [Kendall Small](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38287)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
UCLA - 74, Chaminade - 48  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening remark from coach.  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: I thought we played well through stretches. I thought we opened
up the game with high intensity and playing good basketball, but it was an
offensive struggle for us tonight, there's no doubt about it. Knocking down
open shots and assist-to-turnover ratio and everything along those lines. But
we competed. We tried. I know that. That's about all I got.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Start with questions for the players.  
  
Q. For either guy: How tough is it when you 're playing up this
competition Division-I, to lose somebody like Davenport, a guy who has some
Division I experience, to not have him out there tonight or today?  
KENDALL SMALL: Well, I just come into the game just thinking like everybody's
the same and we all play high levels of basketball. So I don't really go out
there thinking that, honestly. I think everybody on my team is capable of
playing with these people up here. So we always go into the game thinking
we're winning, even yesterday we thought we would try to come out there and
compete as hard as we can. And I thought we did that the first half and parts
of the second half, but we just got hooked on the mental lapses and we just
need to toughen up when times get tough.  
  
ELIET DONLEY: Losing him is big because he can switch one through four for us,
especially on the defensive end he's a big loss for us.  
  
Q. For both guys: Games like this are so tough. You guys were right
there early second half, obviously tied. Does that kind of thing give you guys
confidence or your regular season, your D-II season coming up, does any of
that kind of carry over into your journey beyond here?  
KENDALL SMALL: Well, of course we feel like coming into games, we really hang
our hat on defense because, obviously, we're having to struggle. We're
struggling with our offense right now but the main points of practice is
coming in playing defense. I feel like we start off the games on a high, high
intensity of defense. And then just, like, when things get tough, other teams
are scoring, they get a couple like breakouts that's when we get a little
stagnant on offense and it feeds in our defense and we can't let that happen.  
  
ELIET DONLEY: I think it definitely helps us in preparing for the regular
season. There a couple of bigs in our conference that are similar, but not as
large, so it helps. I know personally it helps me to learn to guard different
types of players.  
  
Q. Kendall, I 'm going to ask you about that shot at the end and what
you were feeling, is it something you practiced and what did Coach say to you
afterward?  
KENDALL SMALL: Definitely not something I practice. I just try to keep my chin
to the rim whenever I try to go into the basket with contact. And Coach just
told me when I came out, just I liked how you just played hard until the end.
You didn't give up and stuff like that. But I felt like a couple other players
on the team did that as well, but we just got to pick everybody else up and do
the same.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll let the two of you get back to your team and
open it up for questions for coach.  
  
Q. Same question for you that I asked the guys: How does the, you talked
about the spurts, the parts of the game where you guys looked pretty good, the
defense was pretty good. How does that kind of, those flashes of brilliance,
if you will, how does that carry over into the rest of the season? And can it
be a confidence builder for your team?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Yeah, we'll get back after these three games and show them all
the good stuff and all the bad stuff that we can learn from. But to show that
you can do it in stretches versus the really the good teams, you know, it
definitely builds confidence in our guys. There's no doubt about it. We knew
coming in playing these guys that they have got a lot of really good talent. I
saw their starting lineup versus our starting lineup, you know, as far as
size-wise, and it's amazing. But I was proud of our guys competing.  
  
Q. You may have addressed this already, but two minutes into the second
half they had had 15 turnovers. What did they do to change? Was it different
personnel? What did they do to kind of pull it together at that point?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: UCLA?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Yeah, well, I thought they, to match up better with us even,
they went to more of one big and four guards, and they actually put some more
shooting in because we were helping so much on the interior every time the
ball went into the post. They put their better shooters in. Middleton has not
had that good -- or Singleton, sorry, had not had that good a game this year.
I know he was a good player last year. But he's a really good shooter. We knew
that. We just hoped he wouldn't have that type of night tonight. When you play
these guys you have to sacrifice something. You can't guard -- we can't guard
everything. We can't guard the interior. We can't guard the perimeter. You
almost have to relinquish something and try to take away the things they do
the best and hope they have off nights in the other things.  
  
Q. Did you get a chance to see Anthony Edwards for Georgia today, what
he was able to do and how do you guys think you might try to match up with
him?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: I saw, well, I saw the first game and I thought, man, I think we
might be able to guard him if we do end up playing him. I saw the first half
and I thought, oh, well, if we end up playing Georgia, we might be able to
stop those guys. And then I watched a good portion of the second half, and I'm
going to meet with Dave Odom tonight and we're going to come up with a
strategy to, if we do play them, I don't know, they might, you know, that's
who we are playing, correct? Yes. To come up with a strategy to try to stop
him. No, it was pretty phenomenal. I kept going up -- I had to write stuff on
the board to get ready for our game, but I kept coming back down and it seemed
like every time I came down he scored a basket. So we all know he's a special
talent, so I'm anxious to learn more about him and see how he's getting those
shots.

## November 25, 2019

  

### [Mike Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20740)

### [PJ Horne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38102)

### [Landers Nolley II](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38279)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Virginia Tech - 71, Michigan State - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
MIKE YOUNG: Proud of our team. We tried our best here against an exceptional
Michigan State team. Defensively, I thought we kept them out of the paint.
Easier said than done. Such length and size in there with Tillman and a couple
of those other guys. I've got good players. It comes back to good players.
That guy down there made at least two, maybe three first half threes. This
young man is a special basketball player and an old grizzled veteran up there
at the top of the floor that kind of keeps things settled for us, and that
would be Wabissa Bede.  
  
Great win for Virginia Tech, our basketball program, but we got a lot more to
look forward to, as does Michigan State. That's probably enough for me. Y'all
go ahead.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for the players?  
  
Q. Landers, you got a new coach, pretty much new roster, but you guys
played so smoothly, like you 've been together for years. How do you explain
picking it up so fast?  
LANDERS NOLLEY II: When you prepare and play and practice and go hard every
day, guys just start to believe in each other and listening to the coaches, it
just becomes natural and you do what you do in practice and that's how you be
successful.  
  
Q. What did you guys think about that atmosphere out there, playing in
the Lahaina Civic Center?  
PJ HORNE: The atmosphere is pretty cool, something different, something that
our young guys will really appreciate when it comes to other games.  
  
Q. You dropped on defense a lot to takeaway their break. How important
was that do you think of disrupting the flow with what Cassius Winston
normally does for them?  
LANDERS NOLLEY II: For us, I think it was very helpful. That was a part of the
scouting report, so we kind of practiced that all week. And it just kind of
threw off their rhythm and helped us in the end.  
  
Q. Landers, can you talk about that last three, how big was that and how
good did it feel?  
LANDERS NOLLEY II: It was a good play that Coach drew up and I just came off
the screen, executed it, it felt good. So they just believed in me and I took
the shot, I hit it, we celebrated.  
  
Q. For both of you: Michigan State makes a run. What are you guys saying
to each other in the huddle to try to regroup as they start to make that
run?  
PJ HORNE: I feel like the game is based off runs. There's going to be times
where you're going to be down, but you can't stop fighting. You got to keep
defending the whole game. It never ends. You can be up by three with 45
seconds to go and down by six at the end of the game. So it's just a game of
runs.  
  
LANDERS NOLLEY II: It's a game of runs, but we went in the huddle, Coach just
told us stay focused, keep playing defense, next play. That's our motto, next
play. And when you focus on the next play, don't think about it. You get
another stop, you get another basket, it's right back, the momentum back on
your side. So you just got to listen to what the coach is saying and in the
end you're going to be successful.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right thank you, guys. We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. I saw you slap Landers on the back when I asked him about that three
and he said you drew up --  
MIKE YOUNG: I got nothing to do with it, come on. He was being kind. He's a
nice kid. That's a really good player making a big-league play. We thought we
could get him behind something, but really good players make really good
plays. That was a really good play and probably it went a long way in getting
us out of here with a significant win.  
  
Q. Could you expand a little more on how quickly your guys have picked
up the offense? It 's a little bit more than hard work as Landers said.  
MIKE YOUNG: You know, that was probably the best we have executed. It's so new
to them and so, everything is so new. I mean, Wabissa played quite a bit last
year. The others did not. So, I mean, the NCAA rules which allow to you
practice a little bit now in the summer was helpful, but you're trying to get
a number of things in place. But to their credit they have stuck with it and
the Horne kid can handle the ball and catch it and pass it and reverse it,
which is essential. And he was able to get us to some things that helped and,
I mean, and then at the end of the day you got to make some shots. We made
enough to win.  
  
Q. I talked to you yesterday morning about your team last year and how
they moved the ball. That was with a bunch of seniors and guys who had been in
your program. How have you gotten them to take that so quickly both just like
--  
MIKE YOUNG: Well, I don't think, I don't think they know any better. I mean,
really. I mean, we played significant minutes with two true freshmen. One that
I had taken at Wofford, you know, and that kid comes in here against the
Spartans of Michigan State and he chucks in two threes and he scores 10 points
and he had zero turnovers and he guards the likes of Henry and some of those
other guys. We have no choice but to play sound basketball and not turn it
over. We had eight for the game, 16 assists, eight turnovers, nine turnovers.
Shot selection is paramount. I thought we got a little wacky in the last six
minutes of the first half and there were portions of the second half we got
outside of ourselves a little bit. They were a little over exuberant, if you
will. But get the thing to Bede, let's run something, let's see what we can
get up here, get into that clock a little bit. We had to keep the thing in the
60s. I'm a little surprised that, the score was exactly where I thought it
needed to be in the last five minutes and then it gets, they start throwing
them in left and right. We made enough to win. But the pace was -- the only
chance we had, the only chance we had, if the thing's in the 80s, they would
blow our doors off.  
  
Good pace for us and I thought would went a long way in dictating that and not
allowing them to move so fast in transition where they're elite. I mean, they
are really, really good. So hat's off to my boys.  
  
Q. You were in a one place in your coaching career for a long time --  
MIKE YOUNG: Yeah. Nobody else would have me.  
  
Q. Like you said, it 's a very young group you're dealing with. What
were kind of your personal expectations of this opening stretch of the season
including this tournament coming in?  
MIKE YOUNG: Survive. Just get a little bit better and just play the game the
right way, let's see what happens. If we're playing the game the right way and
we're playing hard and we're playing together as a group and we're about the
right stuff and we're sharing and not turning the ball over, you know, I could
have said that last year with that bunch I had. That's what we look for as
coaches. And if you do that, you're going to give yourself a chance to win
every game. And we have done that through six, but, you know, you go over and
dust yourself off and eat a little bit. And you got a heck of a Dayton team. I
just saw just a little bit of them versus Georgia today. Holy smokes, are they
a good looking outfit. And they have a great coach. So a lot of work left to
do.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2019

  

### [Bill Self](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13713)

### [David McCormack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36810)

### [Isaiah Moss](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37081)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Kansas - 93, Chaminade - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
BILL SELF: Well, I don't think we played great, but I don't think we played
poorly either. I thought Chaminade did a good job of getting after us and I
think the game was much closer than the score at halftime. And we were able to
get the ball inside to Dok in the second half which was certainly a bonus for
us. But certainly happy to advance and what an atmosphere for an opening round
game like this. And the games have been obviously great so far. The game this
afternoon was incredible. And we'll look forward to playing whoever we get
because we know either one will be a tough opponent.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Did you guys watch the Michigan State game and what would your
response be to that?  
DAVID MCCORMACK: Actually, I didn't. I was resting up for this game, making
sure I stayed locked in and doing what I needed to do on the court.  
  
ISAIAH MOSS: Same with me. I was pretty locked in and just trying to focus on
our game today.  
  
Q. Dave, can you talk about just the importance of competing, regardless
of what the score said tonight? You guys had, Isaiah ran down the loose ball,
you and Tristan dove after balls, up 30. How important was that to just have
that mindset?  
DAVID MCCORMACK: It's just a part of our culture. It's always competing, like
Coach talks about the difference in trying and competing. And competing is
actually having that production and making sure it just, not thinking about
going for a loose ball but making sure that you try to save it or dive for it
or get that extra possession. And that's just the culture that we have among
our team.  
  
Q. Isaiah, how did the hamstring feel? You looked like you had to open
it up to go get that loose ball?  
ISAIAH MOSS: It's feeling good. I'm still getting treatment, but every day it
feels like I'm getting better. So I'm thankful for that.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
ISAIAH MOSS: No.  
  
Q. Did Chaminade get your attention when they led 5-0? And what was the
key to forcing all those turnovers? They had 27.  
DAVID MCCORMACK: I wouldn't say it was that they got our attention because
Coach had a great scouting report before, we just needed to lock in and do
what we needed to do in order to be successful. But I think just, like how
Coach says, and emphasizing defense and just making them turn over the ball is
what we did. And I actually didn't know they had that many.  
  
Q. Isaiah, any thoughts about starting the second half?  
ISAIAH MOSS: No, it doesn't matter to me. Any time I'm out there I'm just
going to give it a hundred percent. Coming off the bench or starting, I'm just
going to try to give it my all.  
  
Q. When did you find out?  
ISAIAH MOSS: When I was going to? Yeah, at halftime Coach just told me I was
going to start the second half.  
  
Q. What was the key to doing so well with Dok only playing seven minutes
and not getting a shot in the first half? You guys still led by 20 at half
without Dok.  
ISAIAH MOSS: Obviously, having him on the court for us is great. Pretty much
unstoppable. I mean, you can see that in the second half. We just tried to
throw it to him and we know he's going to score it.  
  
BILL SELF: He made shots in the first half. Ochai, Isaiah and Dok, they all
shot the ball pretty well in the first half to compensate for it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Take questions for coach.  
  
Q. What was your impression of Chaminade? How do you think they might be
able to do at the Division-II level this year?  
BILL SELF: We've played them twice since I've been coming here and I'm not
going to, I'm not trying to speak negatively of the prior teams, but this is
the best team that they have had that we have seen. They are actually a very
good passing team and they turned it over quite a bit tonight, which we were
concerned about them being a really good passing team. And they got their
shoulders pass us way, way, way too often. And so I like their team. I like
their bunch. We had a huge size advantage, obviously. But I don't think at the
Division-II level they're going to go against very many teams that have a guy
like Dok that's that big. So I would anticipate them and expect them to have a
good year. I believe last year they had a good year. And I know they played
Arizona extremely tough at, in Tucson, if I'm not mistaken. So capable, I
mean, single-digit game. So if you can do that in Tucson and this team, I
would think, would probably be every bit of last year's team, I would think
they will have a fun year.  
  
Q. What did you think of the crowd tonight? Did it seem like maybe more
than ever Jayhawk fans?  
BILL SELF: Yeah, I don't know. How many does this place seat?  
  
Q. 2400.  
BILL SELF: 2400. So there were probably 2000 Jayhawk fans here, which was
unbelievable for a fan base to travel like that. It may be more difficult
moving forward for everybody to getting tickets. I don't know. But, no, it's
amazing how much support we get wherever we travel, but our fans love coming
over here.  
  
Q. Anything different for Ochai tonight? He knocked that first one in
and that looked like it loosened him up.  
BILL SELF: Yeah, maybe. I thought he played fine. I actually thought he and
Dot and Marcus were all pretty good in the first half. The second half, I
don't think anybody got in any rhythm offensively like they were the first,
like those three were the first half. And Dok got a little bit better second
half. But Ochai is a good player and a good scorer. He made a three and that
dunk he made in transition was pretty impressive too. Those plays obviously
give you confidence and he seemed like to have a lot more tonight.  
  
Q. What did you see from Isaiah tonight?  
BILL SELF: I actually thought he looked quicker. He made shots. If I can make
one recommendation for the tournament, these stat sheet numbers are so small,
I need my readers on to be able to read them. So if anybody has -- I have
gotten old but I'm half your age, but I have gotten really old. But I don't
know. I think Isaiah was, what was he, five of seven and three of four. So,
obviously, if he can make 50 percent of his threes that's a huge bonus for us.
And I actually thought he looked the quickest he's looked since he's pulled
his hamstring. And to me, the best play was when he ran down the loose ball
because that, he kind of had to stretch out to do that. So I think that should
give him some confidence as well. And I'm joking about this. It's fine. I just
need to go to something else.

## November 25, 2019

  

### [Mark Pope](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16092)

### [Jake Toolson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38282)

### [TJ Haws](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38283)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
BYU - 78, UCLA - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
MARK POPE: Guys, I couldn't be more proud of my guys. That UCLA team is a
really good team and I know Coach. And Mick is a big time coach. I've known
him for a long time. We knew that they were going to come in here on fire
after starting the season great and having a little setback against who
Hofstra at home. And we knew we were going to have our handful and I'm just
proud of our guys. They knew the agenda items that had to be taken care of and
they did it. They did it as team with a couple really important fundamental
things that we took care of. So I'm super proud of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the players.  
  
Q. For both guys: How do you guys go out there and shoot 62 percent? It
was pretty impressive.  
TJ HAWS: I think we were trying to take great shots. And I thought tonight we
moved the ball really well, we made them guard us, we moved the ball from side
to side, and we kept our dribble alive a little bit, which helped space out
the floor and guys stepped up and made big shots tonight. It was great.  
  
JAKE TOOLSON: This is a fun gym to play in. These rims are soft and it feels
like a high school gym, so we feel like we can get great shots and the best
shot's the open shot. So we wanted to just step up and take those shots
tonight and they're going to fall for us.  
  
Q. I 'm sure you saw the film on Havstra. They had trouble at times
staying in front of their man and guarding the three-point line. Were those
things you thought you could exploit because you had a lot of success in both
of those areas with beating them off the dribble and at the three-point
line.  
MARK POPE: Well, I know Coach and one of the things that he's going to make
this team great at is they're going to really protect the rim. That's what
they do. They really protect and they have guys that can do that. And so, and
it's an important part of what they do. They get the flex and they protect the
rim. So our guys actually did an unbelievable job starting with TJ about just
extending the play and being really judicious about the decisions he made at
the rim, right? He was spectacular and it was contagious on our team. So we
knew coming in what makes, what makes now and is going to make UCLA great,
because they are going to be really good. And our guys did a really good job
of responding to it and being really smart about the decision they made in the
key.  
  
Q. In the last 10 minutes what was the difference where you guys were
able to pull away and TJ, you really kind of asserted yourself. You had a
tough year shooting, a little bit, but coming on strong. What was that
difference in the last 10 minutes of the game?  
TJ HAWS: I thought we just stayed aggressive and I think something we did
really well was we trusted in our game plan. We knew that if we kept moving
the ball, if we stayed aggressive, that we were going to get good looks. And
for me, I'm just trying to shoot good shots and trying to stay aggressive. And
if I can get to the basket, which I did a few times, that helps me get into a
rhythm a little bit and that was great for me tonight.  
  
Q. For both guys: How much are you guys looking forward to Kansas
tomorrow?  
TJ HAWS: That's going to be a blast. That's an incredible program. They have
so much history. It's going to be so much fun. The environment's going to be
great tomorrow and we're really looking forward to it. It's going to be a fun
night.  
  
JAKE TOOLSON: Yeah, I mean, I'm just, I just want to keep doing this. It was a
great feel out there tonight. This is one of the best tournaments out there,
so, if not the best. So we got another challenge ahead of us tomorrow but all
of us are really excited about it and we're going to have another chance at it
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think about playing the No. 4 team tomorrow in the
semi-finals?  
MARK POPE: Well, listen, Kansas is a great program. They have unbelievable
size. Today their perimeter was really, really good, really effective getting
to the rim and really effective getting shots and sharing the ball and playing
with space. They're long and physical and capable of guarding. So they got a
great coach and a great coaching staff. So that's why you come to this
tournament. Like, if we didn't want a chance at Kansas we would have gone to
some Mid Major tournament somewhere. But this is where we want to be and we
are learning things about ourselves every day. And this team, we're not
backing our way into this season. We are chasing the toughest challenges we
can get and we're going to get nicked up along the way. We already have gotten
nicked up a little bit in terms of being exposed and learning. But you know
what's really amazing? You talk about the last 10 minutes of this game, okay,
we had last 10 minutes against San Diego State, against Houston and against
Boise State. They were pretty similar in situations in terms of it being a
close game. And in those three games we won one and loss two and we didn't
have the trust in each other that we had tonight down the stretch. Tonight,
and it mostly was my fault, but tonight these guys had trust in each other
down the stretch knowing that they could continue to extend the play to their
next teammate and it was beautiful. It was the best close we have had to a
game. So this difficult schedule is beautiful for us to learn who we are.
We're a better team now than we were a week ago and hopefully after we play
Kansas we'll be a better team tomorrow than we are tonight. And that's the
whole point of playing. We want to be the best team we can at the end of this
season. That's our whole goal. That's all we have talked about since we
started.  
  
Q. It might be different perspectives, Coach Self said the other day
that in these types of situations effort and passion maybe win out over
scouting report because you just don 't have so much time to prepare. What is
the key for you guys to preparing on such short notice for a new opponent and
especially an opponent like Kansas, player perspective and coach also.  
JAKE TOOLSON: I think first and foremost we have to take care of our bodies,
get rest, recover, watch the film, see what the game's going to be like. But
like you said, it's, here it's three games in three days so it's a fight. And
this is a great opportunity to play three games in three days because
eventually in the conference tournament that's what it's going to come down
to. So we're going to just, we're going to attack this opportunity of three
games in three days to really prepare us for what's going to pay off for us
this season.  
  
TJ HAWS: Yeah, I think that this team when we have great energy on both ends
of the floor we're really good and that helps us block out, it helps us to get
rebounds, when we have great energy on offense we're moving fast and we're
playing with pace and force and that really helps us. So it can be a challenge
to play three games in three days, especially against great opponents, but I
feel like if we can come out and have great energy to start this game and play
for 40 minutes we're going to have a great chance tomorrow.  
  
Q. It 's clear you have great balance on your team but it's clear when
the two of you assert yourself it's a difference-maker. When do you both know
when it's time to take over? You both made winning plays down the stretch.  
JAKE TOOLSON: I think our mindset or at least I'll speak for myself, my
mindset is always to try and make a play and try and help this team win,
whether that's grab a rebound or making the extra pass or at times getting
shots up and I think the way we played tonight it was we set ourselves up to
make plays for each other and then down the stretch especially TJ had the ball
in his hands a lot and he was making plays for us and I feel like our mindset
was to make a play for our teammate and when you can live there, then things
just come back around to you and you're able to help this team win by whatever
it is.  
  
TJ HAWS: Yeah, I agree with that completely. I feel like for me I'm trying to
make the right basketball play and we have great shooters on this team and so
attacking, being aggressive, and if the right play is getting someone else
open or if the right play is to shoot, trying to make the right basketball
play and I feel like good things are going to happen if I do that.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2019

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Aaron Henry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37112)

### [Cassius Winston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34730)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Virginia Tech - 71, Michigan State - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
TOM IZZO: Well, I've said this for 20 years. Upsets happen. And that's no
insult to them, but it is an upset. Upsets happen. The three-point shot and
foul trouble, and we had both, along with a bunch of missed layups. I give a
lot of credit to Mike and his team. I thought they played harder than us and
better than us. Cassius got into foul trouble. I'm not sure he ever got back
in the rhythm. He tried. We struggled in the post. Both of our post guys early
just did not guard. I thought Aaron played very well in a lot of ways and but
we just didn't play well enough to win.  
  
So they shot 48 percent from the three. That shouldn't happen to us, but it
did. Give them the credit. They deserve it. And a number of turnovers, yeah,
it was 16 and the number of people in foul trouble, especially when it's
Cassius for us, we're not the same team. So hat's off to Mike and his team. I
thought they played extremely hard, extremely well and I guess we're going to
find out a little bit about our team. But I publicly want to apologize to
maybe the greatest fan group that was here. We feel like I let them down and
it's been an interesting couple of weeks and we just weren't as sharp today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Open it up for questions for the players.  
  
Q. Cassius, I wanted to ask you about how tough that was early having to
sit so long in the first half and then just Tom mentioned just trying to get
in that flow in the second half. There was a lot of shots normally you would
make. How tough was that?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yeah, it was difficult to sit that long. Just got to be
smarter than that and make better decisions for my team, and then to try to
come back out and to try to play to that high level and stuff like that. It's
kind of hard to get back in your rhythm, get back in the flow of the game.  
  
Q. For both you guys: The shift to have Aaron bring up the ball at the
end of the game and kind of run that point, how do you feel that that worked
in terms of getting you guys back in it? What allowed, how did that allow you
to find some rhythm there, Cassius?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: It was huge. Just wherever I'm at there's a lot of attention
on me. They, a lot of teams assume the ball is coming back into my hands one
way or another. So to free him up a little bit and let him get down hill and
let him play to his strengths a little bit, count my man out a little bit
because he focuses me so much, it gives him a little bit of open lane to work
with.  
  
AARON HENRY: Same thing he said. I knew it was just one of those things where
not many teams are going to leave him at any point on the court. So just
knowing that they need to put him in that position and Coach put me in a great
spot to be effective and that was it.  
  
Q. For both you: How important are these next two days right here on
Maui?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Huge. You can't let one loss kind of ruin your trip down
here. It's still a business trip. We're still here to get better as a team. We
took a step back today but we got to find a way to rally and come up with two
big wins to keep pushing us forward in the season.  
  
AARON HENRY: It's going to be huge. We're going to find out a lot about
ourselves individually and more importantly as a team. We got some adversity
to face and we're going to see if we can overcome it and, obviously, we're
going to just keep playing.  
  
Q. Your coach talks about the value of these tournaments, when you won
the PK80 in Portland in the early season. Is there value in a game where
things don 't go right in these tournaments and a team gets hot from three,
foul trouble in terms of what to avoid later when there is no tomorrow, that
sort of thing?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yeah, definitely. It's all about learning how to win. That's
what it comes down to. Not every game's going to go perfect. Not everything's
going to work in your favor. But at the end of the day you still got to figure
out a way to win and that's what these tournaments do. Today we didn't do
that. We made some crucial mistakes and things like that, that we got to
change going down the road. But these tournaments like that just teach you how
to win as a team, back-to-back to back.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Well take any questions for coach.  
  
Q. Yesterday you talked a lot about one of the things you wanted to look
at is improving shooting and just a little bit more. I was surprised with the
way in which folks were offensively handling things in the paint. You talk
about your bigs struggling a little bit. What are some of the things you can
do in these next couple days to get them to be more effective down in the
paint. I think we had, Tillman had like four or five turnovers in the paint.
What do you want to see them improve there?  
TOM IZZO: Catch the ball, make a layup, not turn the ball over. It's not that
difficult. I do. I give them a lot of credit, but I probably should have
played Cassius. I didn't have a lot of faith. I thought it was -- you know,
right now, coaches are learning, officials are learning, players are learning.
And I'm going to have to start playing my guys. I can't let them sit out. I
just had no faith. I thought one of them was a ghost call and so I panicked.
That's my fault, not theirs. But the play of our two starting big guys has to
improve. And I think when you look at it and you say it has to improve and, I
don't know what, Xavier probably got 14 rebounds, and that looks good. It
didn't look very good to me. We out-rebounded them bad and we didn't score. We
out-rebounded on the offensive end bad and we didn't make layups. The number
of layups we missed.  
  
But the whole game came down to, as we said, three-point shooting and foul
trouble. That's two ways that upsets happen and we had both of them. And we
had some guys that didn't play well. Cassius, you know, it's sad because for
me, because at a tournament like this, I would like all the people in Hawaii
and everybody else to see, he was a shell of himself today. I think it's been
a lot on him. I told you that. No excuses for me. I did the poor job. But I
couldn't do what that kid has done, no way. And he just looked tired the whole
time. I think the mental stress that he's going through. And, because he
doesn't practice as much right now, physically I don't think he's in the shape
he needs to be in. And I asked him at halftime and he said, You better keep
grinding on me, coach, don't change one thing. Well, I got to tell you, that's
hard for me and it's hard for him. So he's the straw that stirs the drink and
the only reason we put Aaron there is they were doing a good job just trapping
him and we thought we could get him off some pin downs. And when they stayed
so glued to him, played screening with him, it left Aaron open for those
shots. But as good as we did, we cut it to one or whatever, and we have our
best defender on their best offensive player and he just come off a double
screen and nailed it. And I just didn't think we did a very good job in the
things that we normally do. And so maybe it is my fault. I'm talking about
offense to you and I said defense wins and today our defense wasn't good
enough, at least defending the three.  
  
Q. Their strategy to drop back and not let you guys run, how much do you
feel like, not just with Cassius out, but with those other point guards in
there that it wasn 't allowing them to get into any rhythm.  
TOM IZZO: You know, I don't know I'll have to watch the film to see it that
way. I just didn't think we ran -- Xavier looked slow all day and so did
Cassius and then he wasn't in there and we're not the same running team
without him in there. I mean, so, I don't know, I would have to watch the
film. I didn't think that was the determining factor in the game. I thought
the determining factor in the game started in the first couple minutes when
plays we had gone over our bigs just did not execute and we gave up some
threes and wide open shots right off the bat and it happens. And somehow, some
way -- we didn't spend a lot of time on the beach. I promise you, we will
spend no time on the beach tonight, tomorrow or tomorrow night. So we're going
to spend some time in that walkthrough room and we won't make those mistakes
again.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2019

  

### [Anthony Grant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19553)

### [Jalen Crutcher](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36837)

### [Obi Toppin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38278)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Dayton - 80, Georgia - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement by coach.  
  
ANTHONY GRANT: Well, we're obviously excited to be able to open the tournament
up first game of the tournament. I know our guys are excited to be able to
compete today. Fortunate to be able to come out. I thought we did a really
good job setting the tone from the beginning, we were able to build a little
bit of a lead. Guys did a really good job in terms of understanding scouting
reports. Defensively, I thought we were really in tune to what we needed to
do, shared the ball today. So overall it's a good win. It's a great way to
start the tournament. And looking forward to continuing to try to compete for
a championship.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Obi, what got into you in those first four minutes? How important was
that stretch?  
OBI TOPPIN: Oh, it was important. Very important. The team was just finding me
in the post. Before the game we talked about throwing the ball in the post and
working out of there because our offense is based off that. And when we got
the ball in the post a lot of things got opened up and I was able to get
buckets off of there.  
  
Q. For either player. It seems like very early on you both were very
aware of the crowd and how there was a very pro-Dayton feel to it. You 're
both kind of pumping early as you had the early run. How much of that
atmosphere helped you guys get going?  
JALEN CRUTCHER: Yeah, before the game we knew, like, our crowd would come out
and support us. So, like, before the game we kind of tried to get the crowd
into the game just to help us with the momentum in the beginning and towards
the end.  
  
Q. For both of you: How important or what was the key to the defensive
effort against Georgia, especially early on you guys had a lot of success?  
JALEN CRUTCHER: The most important thing was to just try to stop No. 5. He is
one of their best players so we were trying to stop him. And just play our
overall defense and help each other out on the defensive end.  
  
OBI TOPPIN: And getting defensive rebounds off of that too.  
  
Q. For both of you guys: First game on Maui for you guys. What would you
guys say about the setting, the gym, the soft rims, friendly bounces, just the
overall atmosphere today for the first game?  
OBI TOPPIN: It's a great gym to play in. A lot of our fans came out and
supported us, filled the whole gym up, like, I'm sure you all heard them
throughout the whole game. So, like, it wasn't a big gym like what we're used
to playing in every single day, but it's a great gym and we just did what we
had to do today.  
  
JALEN CRUTCHER: For me, like, playing in this gym, it's a dream come true.
It's a blessing for me because I've been growing up watching this tournament
and I'm sure same for Obi, so it's just a dream come true.  
  
Q. Can you guys just speak a little bit on those same lines. In a gym
like this, what is the new three-point line? Is it, how is that for you just
in the game and is it any different with, in a gym like this, is there any
depth perception difference or anything like that?  
JALEN CRUTCHER: I want to say it's a difference. I, for me, I just speak for
myself, I've been struggling from the three-point line, so my coaches and my
teammates just encouraged me to just keep shooting and I've been keep
shooting, so that's it.  
  
OBI TOPPIN: For me, it's different a little bit playing in this gym, shooting
from the three-point line, because in our gym it's, like, the backboard, the
backboard is, like, you could see the whole stands, and it feels like the
basket is further. But in here it's like going back to high school. It's like
a good feeling.  
  
Q. You win pretty big today. What are you going to try to say to your
teammates to stay focused?  
JALEN CRUTCHER: We just got to lock in. Coach Grant, he always tells us we got
to be mature. So we can't go out in this game and just try to go out and just
do our own thing. We just got to keep doing what we were doing this game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. What did you see out of Obi in those first four minutes just how
aggressive he was and getting the team off to a good start?  
ANTHONY GRANT: Like Obi said, I thought the flow of the game, we knew it was
going to be an up-and-down game going back and forth, and so we wanted to try
to establish a post presence early. Obi did a good job of making himself
available, his teammates did a good job of finding him, and he was able to get
come conversions going and we kind of got in a rhythm there. And so it was
great to see our guys understanding where we had an advantage early, we were
able to take advantage of that.  
  
Q. You turned them over early in the first half. What are some of the
things you were trying to do defensively to create those kind of turnovers?  
ANTHONY GRANT: Yeah, just try to be solid. They're a very explosive offensive
team. They can score quickly in transition on you. They really pushed the pace
of the game. So we wanted to make sure that we did a good job of converting on
the defensive end and trying to limit some of those opportunities. And when
you're in the right position sometimes good things happen for you and I think
that was the case today.  
  
Q. The other thing, there 's a lot of conversation around Blue Bloods,
but the A-10 is a tough place. It builds teams in a different way that I think
people don't -- what is it about the conference that prepares teams to prepare
to perform well in a space like this?  
ANTHONY GRANT: I think right now we're four games in, so I think right now
we're, everybody in the country's trying to figure out who they are and what
they have, and we're no different. I think we'll be able to take some things
away from today that we did well and hopefully we'll learn from it. We have
got a quick turnaround for whoever we play tomorrow. So it's just trying to
focus on the task at hand right now for us and getting ready for whoever is in
front of us. And as we go through it, by the time we get to conference play, I
think we'll have a pretty good idea of who we are and what works for us and
what we need to do. But in the meantime, it's about trying to get prepared one
game at a time.  
  
Q. How good was it to see Jordy get some action today and what did he do
to get back on the court in the last couple weeks?  
ANTHONY GRANT: Jordy's been out for probably a good eight weeks where he
hasn't had a chance to really practice in any shape or fashion. I think he
went to, he got his first practice where he was able to kind of go for a full
practice on Saturday. So it was just a matter of seeing how he reacted to
that, that he was able to come back yesterday and had a decent day yesterday
as well. We didn't do a whole lot yesterday, but he was able to get out there
and he felt good. So it was just a matter of before the game seeing where he
was at and if he felt good enough to get out there, we felt like we could put
him out there today. So it was great. It's been a long journey for him, so I
was just happy for him, that he's worked extremely hard, our medical staff's
done a great job, just to be able to get him some minutes today and try to get
his rhythm back and get a flow into it. And I know he was really excited to be
out there.  
  
Q. Only six turnovers today. What kind of balance and calmness does
Jalen Crutcher bring at the point guard position and everybody else in the
ability to take care of the ball on a team that seems like they were really
getting after it defensively?  
ANTHONY GRANT: 15 turnovers.  
  
Q. I 'm looking at the wrong stat. Apologies.  
ANTHONY GRANT: No, no, you're good. No, but it's always good when you have
Jalen as an experienced point guard, having him out there with Rodney Chatman
gives us two guys I think that can initiate offense for us, two guys that can
help make the game easier for their teammates and then just being able to, our
guys understanding in terms of the spacing that we need to play with and how
we can be connected. I didn't think today was one of our better offensive
performances overall, but I thought we enough to be able to sustain a lead or
build the lead and be able to sustain it.

### [Mick Cronin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18116)

### [Jules Bernard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38284)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
BYU - 78, UCLA - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement by coach.  
  
MICK CRONIN: Well, I give BYU credit. We couldn't get, we couldn't finish the
game. We're a young team, still figuring out, finding our way. But they made
it hard on us, so I think you got to always give the other team credit.
Obviously not happy with our defensive effort, but they have a lot to do with
that. Last nine minutes they did a tremendous job of putting us on defense for
30 seconds, a couple times we didn't get crucial rebounds that broke our back.
So they're a, when they went to their small lineup it really hurt us. But give
them credit. We're still growing as a team, trying to figure out how hard we
have to play to be a good basketball team. We're a work in progress.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for Jules.  
  
Q. They made half their 3-pointers just like Hofstra did, but they added
the component of being really good in the paint. How hard was that to kind of
matchup with both of those things, of having to guard them on the perimeter
and also their dribble drives and getting into the paint?  
JULES BERNARD: I think they, BYU, did a good job of moving the ball a lot and
also, like, dribbling and kicking out to the three. I think that once they
established their paint presence we started keying in on the paint presence
and they just kicked it out for threes. We knew they were going to be good on
offense, but we just got to stay strong for 40 minutes. We played for about 30
minutes strong on defense and then we let off the gas. So it's just about
sustaining our effort on defense and focusing on what teams do, especially
like a team like BYU who runs their offense really well.  
  
Q. Prince went down and I think it was about a one point game. What did
it mean to lose him for a stretch?  
JULES BERNARD: He's one of the leaders on the team, so it was kind of scary.
It looked like he was hurt pretty bad. But in times like that collectively as
group we have to come together and make sure we don't give up runs, especially
when one of our leaders are out. I think that we're a young team and we have
to learn that throughout this year, but we're glad that he's okay.  
  
Q. You, obviously you want to win games but is it hard to focus on the
process when you 're not getting the results that you want As a young team
trying to grow early in the season?  
JULES BERNARD: I think as basketball players we all know that you're going to
have wins and losses. We fight every day in practice and in games and losses
are going to come. We're going to make mistakes, but that's part of the
process. We have to grow and as the season goes on, hopefully those mistakes
are to fix themselves. But losses come. We have to learn from them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. We'll open it up for questions for coach.  
  
Q. Kind of the same question I asked Jules. Was there ability to hurt
you inside and outside, was that a challenge that was really hard to
overcome?  
MICK CRONIN: Oh, yeah. I thought they made a couple of really hard shots. One
that was a desperation shot that hurt us. I thought the -- but overall our,
the nine freshmen and sophomore factor hurts us. Because I've coached veteran
teams and when you know when you got a young team you can just, can you see
the other team taking their level of intensity up and your guys struggle. You
can see your team. And we alluded to it, Prince is the one veteran out there
for us. When he went down it had an effect on the game. But, hey, I'm a big
believer. Yes, they're really hard to defend, okay. Once we started taking
away the three, what really hurt us was we were getting beat off the dribble.
But a mark of a young team is we, when you hit a point in the game, seven,
eight minutes left, where we missed a dunk, we had a bad turnover. And in a
game like this you can't do that against them because they're going to go put
you on defense for 30 seconds and wear you down. It wears you down. When you
play teams that play BYU style you have to really take care of the ball. So
what I would tell you is our 13 turnovers, in my mind, in a game where they
were running the shot clock, when you play a team that's going to run the shot
clock as long as they are, you can never turn the ball over. Like I told our
guys before, we cannot win this game. We have to have eight turnovers or less
to win this game, which would have given us a chance to get fouled more and
get more second-chance points. We had 13, so.  
  
Q. David didn 't have any minutes in particular tonight. Any reason for
that?  
MICK CRONIN: No, just strategy. He missed a blockout. But you're trying to
find five, right now I'm trying to find, I'm just trying to find five guys
that can get a stop. That competition changes everything, but hopefully our
guys, make it real simple, our guys, we were giving up about 62 a game and we
were 4-0. Last two games we have given up 83 a game, you know, on average.
Can't win that way. So and nothing against, it wasn't David. He didn't do
anything in particular. Just searching for five guys who can get a stop
together. And it's a struggle right now and until it's not a struggle we're
going to continue to struggle to beat that word to debt.  
  
Q. I wasn 't here yesterday but you seemed to say that you have to focus
on maybe the process more than the results right now for you in evaluating
this team and kind of shepherding it through this season.  
MICK CRONIN: Yeah, I mean, hey, look, we're 17 of 15, we lost our best three
players. So it's going to be a process with the whole building. I knew it. So
there's going to be ups and downs with it. It's like I told the guys, have you
two choices: You can quit and go home, make excuses. It seems to be popular in
today's society with young people. Or you can stand and fight and learn how to
be a guy that can defend, learn how to be a guy that never gets beat, learn
how to be a guy that never turns the ball over, learn how to be a guy that
remembers that the offense and can execute. You got to stay in the ring and
fight. The second thing I would tell you is, for us, until we learn how to
respond, it seems that there's a, when they hit a couple of baskets, I got to
teach these guys how to respond. You cannot turn the ball over. We had a
crucial, Tyger had a crucial turnover. And then Chris cut on top of Jalen and
it was just two really crucial turnovers. Again, you can't, you got to get --
they're hard enough to defend, like, you got to be able to get shots off. What
did we shoot for the game? I don't have a stat sheet. Nobody gave me a stat
sheet. Yeah, 45 percent? In the last five years of my career you would
struggle to find a loss where we shot 45 percent. We're just not there yet
defensively and rebounding. So our shooting percentage isn't the issue. On
offense our turnovers are our problem. Now, you can't go, in a game like that,
again, you're going to have to make free throws. Because they're so hard to
defend tonight we went 5-11 in the second half. You give yourself no chance.  
  
Q. Curious about quick turnaround, no prep time between games like this.
What 's your strategy? What's your input --  
MICK CRONIN: Same thing for Chaminade.  
  
Q. Sure. Just in general overall, though?  
MICK CRONIN: Don't know. Never done it. Never been in the loser's bracket. Get
some rest and play. At some point you got to have some pride and character and
it's about fortitude.  
  
Q. A lot of folks are going to focus on defense, but so much of that is
about communication, and you guys have a young team like. How do you teach
that?  
MICK CRONIN: Well I think the sad part is you can think you're good at it
based on your competition. Then when you play guys that can expose you and it
puts -- it's just like anything else, it's like you turn up the pressure gets
turned up on the pipes and you find out how strong they are. The team that
takes care of the ball and keeps you on defense forever, you're going to find
out how well you communicate. You're going to find out how well you stay in
front of the ball. They, so, again, they did a great job. I can sit here and
be upset with my guys. They do a tremendous job with what they do. But I think
offense is, our offense really hurt us. I mean, there were times I was upset
with our defense there was a few crucial block outs, but they're a team,
because of their lack of size and strength, that we should have been able to,
like early in the game we should have been able to score inside. Cody missed a
bunch of chippies that he normally makes. I think that obviously hurt us. You
got to score on them. And then the second thing is the turnovers killed our
offensive rebounding, they just killed us, killed our offensive rebounding. So
you, against them, you have to really be efficient on offense when you play
any team that runs this spread Princeton stuff, because if you run, you throw
one pass and turn it over they're going to go down and throw 17 passes and
make you chase them around. So we didn't get the job done with that.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2019

  

### [Tom Crean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13756)

### [Sahvir Wheeler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38276)

### [Tye Fagan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38277)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Dayton - 80, Georgia - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from coach.  
  
TOM CREAN: Biggest thing, and I've felt this for a long time after my
experience of being here, but especially with this team coming in here, we
knew we were going to be coming, at least I knew we were going to be coming in
against a whole different level of intensity, physicality, the way guys play,
the way they play together. And that's where we're at. And we got exposed by
that. And we did not come out with the right, we did not come out
understanding what we needed to do from the very beginning with the game plan,
which was to not play behind Obi Toppin, which was to be more physical, but
especially use our length more. When he caught it, get down on the dribble,
and be able to come and attack.  
  
The other big part of it on the offensive end, which is so disappointing to me
because we have been having more success with it, we want to be to play
through the paint. And we at one point, we were 1-19 at halftime, I believe. I
think we ended up, before we made a couple of threes at the end, we sat one in
the 20s of not going through the paint. And we were 25 of 42 when we did go
through the paint. And that's what we got to understand. And I've got to find
the guys -- this is not about coming in here and developing inside of the Maui
Invitational. This is about guys that are going to come in and understand that
it has all moved up. The level of intensity, the level of play has moved up,
and we have got to be able to answer that bell. And we get a chance to turn
around and go right again or right away again tomorrow. But the formula that
we have has to be the formula that we travel with. And it doesn't mean the
shots are going to go. It doesn't mean that we're going to be successful. But
it does mean we're going to be aggressive. It does mean that we're going to
follow, especially when you're playing a player like Obi Toppin. But it does
mean offensively that we're going to get through that paint. And to me, that's
just as disappointing as anything we didn't do on the defensive end, because
there were far too many times the ball didn't get reversed. When we were able
to cut, we were able to get really good things done. When we were able to move
it from side to side, we were able to get things done even if the shot didn't
go. And we had too many guys play like they hadn't been in a high level game
like this. And really with all honesty, I looked out at one point in time, we
had five freshmen in. We haven't. So we'll learn from it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. First half, turned the ball over. What were they doing to you guys
that made it difficult to get into your offense? For both the players.  
TYE FAGAN: I believe that, like Coach said, on offense we were very stagnant
in the first half. There wasn't enough cut in the ball movement. The ball was
staying in one place a lot of times. We didn't get to the rim and kick out, we
didn't play from inside out, like we should, and that's the plan and we failed
to do that.  
  
SAHRIV WHEELER: Like Coach said, which is no excuse, but just playing at this
level, this intensity, the amount of fans that are into it, the pressure
that's on to us, it's not really any pressure, but just what's at stake at
this level, especially in this Maui Invitational, it's a first for all of us.
Maybe we weren't used to that as, when we played some decent basketball we had
turnovers down, we were sharing the ball, we were cutting and that's just
stuff we're going to look back on film and get better from and continue to
move forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you. We'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about getting prepared for the tough play. I
know part of it is your trying to build a culture here. The dust settles
tonight, what -- you talked about playing through the paint, but what are some
of the things, other things you want to work on to kind of be ready tomorrow
to kind of get a different result?  
TOM CREAN: Well it has to be a mentality, it really does. It has to be inside
of you that you got to really turn around and respond. Like I said to the team
after the game, for every minute that you spend pouting or worrying or
rationalizing, that's a minute you waste on getting yourself ready for the
next day and that's really what it comes down to. We got really good kids, you
got, you have to learn how to win and part of the winning is the mentality
that you bring into it and what you learn from it. So the bottom line to me is
the stagnant -- we knew they were very, very good in the middle of the floor
defensively and that's not how we wanted to attack. We wanted to get the ball
reversed, get our cutting going, get it to the side and then get it back to
the middle once we would get them moving around. And so that's what we're
going to have to do. We can play anybody in the country and we're not going to
be successful if we come down and we try to play right through the middle
right off the beginning of the clock. And then we have to continue to be
aggressive. It was a one-point differential in the second half. I'm sure I'll
watch the film and I'll see some good things, but the bottom line is we knew
we were going against a really, really good team and they were, they were
every bit as good as I thought they were on film and we did not respond the
way that we need to respond to it as wholly as we need to. So we have to turn
around and have a much better response tomorrow.

INVITATIONAL](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MAUI+JIM+MAUI+INVITATIONAL)

  

## November 25, 2019

  

### [Eric Bovaird](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22849)

### [Tyler Cartaino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38280)

### [Roman Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38281)

  
_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
Kansas - 93, Chaminade - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take an opening statement from coach.  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: We knew they were a really good team. We have been,
unfortunately, we have had two weeks to sit and prepare for them and watch
them way, way too much and we knew how good they were. And I thought through
stretches, the first media segment, I thought we executed our game plan really
well. And then the second and third one got us where we weren't locked into
what we were supposed to be doing offensively and defensively and that's the
moment it kind of got away.  
  
But hey, the last time I played these guys I lost by 51 points, so 30 is not
quite as bad as 51. But I think they've got a chance to be a really good team
this year, whether it be a national title or whatever. So our guys came out
and competed and they could have easily just laid over and quit when we were
down 20 something, but they didn't and they kept battling and at least we had
stretches where we played really well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Take questions for the players, please.  
  
Q. For both you guys: You talk about Azubuike and the big McCormack and
the big guys inside, how tough were they to handle?  
ROMAN YOUNG: They're definitely tough. You don't realize how big they are
until you're down there really banging with them. Azubuike, he's really elite.
Whenever he gets the ball down low, just getting it up high and our tallest
guy is about 6'6", 6'7". So it's definitely hard.  
  
TYLER CARTAINO: Yeah, we tried to double them a lot and we knew even with
doubles it would be hard to do, so we kind of went to make plays and get
strips and that didn't happen a lot and we paid for it. But, yeah, they're
really good, obviously, that's why they're on Kansas, so.  
  
Q. Being back in the tournament this year, what does it mean, even after
tonight with two more opportunities to do something in this event coming up
here?  
ROMAN YOUNG: Being in the tournament is definitely memorable. It's something
you'll be able to tell, like, your kids one day, even your kids back home or
your family back home can watch. But it's definitely special, especially
coming out, playing against Kansas, a team that I grew up watching, just being
from there, so it's definitely special.  
  
TYLER CARTAINO: Yeah, it's a lot of fun coming out here even on Saturday and
Sunday. All the events they have for us and the banquets and whatnot, it's a
lot of fun. And then obviously the games and I think our returners and older
guys know that these next two days we really do have a shot to pull out an
upset. We have done it before, so it's nothing new to us and we're just going
to keep our eyes set on that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, we'll take questions for coach.  
  
Q. You talked to me at the press conference about Udoka Azubuike. He 's
the real deal, isn't he, and how tough were they inside?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Well, we knew they were going to be really tough inside. I told
several guys that, and Coach Odom has probably seen a lot more than me, but
he's the best that I've seen in all my time period of being in the Maui
Invitational. It's sealing guys on the inside, catching the ball in traffic
and going up and dunking it before you even have a chance to send your double
team over. So he's got some, obviously I think he shoots 70 percent from the
field or something like that, something ridiculous. He's pretty special inside
of 3 and 4 feet, and the other two big guys are pretty tough too. So I noticed
that they went to playing a lot just one big guy for a good stretch of the
game and that kind of changes the dimensions of everything as far as -- the
game plan we had. We thought they were going to play two bigs a lot of the
time to really try to take advantage of us and double team from different
areas. But I think that they went and matched up with us a little bit better
when they had four basically wing guards out there and we had trouble scoring
on them.  
  
Q. How do you guys kind of move on from this one and try and get that
maybe that shocker in the next day or two? What 's the mindset to do that?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Well as soon as I walk out of the room, you don't have time to
sulk about this. Obviously, you wish it was a closer game and you had a chance
to win going down the stretch, but I've been here too many times to know that
if I spend another hour thinking about what happened tonight, then I'm not
going to be ready for tomorrow. We play at noon tomorrow, so as soon as I walk
out this door I'm shifting focus to learning about UCLA and BYU and seeing who
we're going to play and trying to figure out a way to beat them. When you play
really good teams like this it takes a miracle. The miracle wasn't tonight.
Maybe it will be a little bit later.  
  
Q. Playing in this tournament as a D-II team with, obviously, big D-I
schools, what 's the most valuable lesson you think your players get out of
this event and do you think you're going to do better than 23-8?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Well, I hope so, I hope so. But sometimes we have gone, we have
come over here and we have taken three losses. And last year I was able to
schedule three wins. So the record kind of shifts along those lines. But we
love playing in this tournament in the fact that our previous two games
against D-II teams, everything went smooth and everything was great. We had 28
assists, 30 assists, we hardly turned the ball over, we got the ball
everywhere we wanted to. And then you play these teams and they have the
ability to expose weaknesses. And for me, as a coach, you don't always see
that in practice and I didn't see it in the game. But now after these three
games, we have the ability to look at this and say, hey, this is what we need
to, this is the direction we need to go, these are the things we need to work
on, which you don't usually get that opportunity in Division II, so it's so
special that we have that opportunity.  
  
Q. You talked about them going small early, you guys were up at the
time, I think. What dimension did that bring to them when they bring in,
especially Moss, their outside shooter and that four-guard lineup?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Well throwing him in -- they have had some rough games outside
shooting. So we knew that, especially if he wasn't in the game, we could help
more and more on the interior, whether it be in zone or whether it be in man.
But as soon as they throw four guards out there, you got to be more aware of
where all four of those guys are, rather than just finding three. And Moss is
a special player, he's a knock-down shooter. So we weren't that -- we knew
that Dotson can make shots and Garrett and all them, and Ochai, but we were
going to make them at least prove it. And I think defensively against us it
helps them tremendously because they can match up with more size-wise.  
  
Q. You said in the past that last year when you guys weren 't here you
were watching these games like back-to-back-to-back. Was it in person?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Yeah.  
  
Q. Were you here for the games?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Yeah.  
  
Q. What was that moment like for you patrolling the sideline, being in
front of your bench out here again with a crowd like Kansas had and just this
atmosphere being in this?  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Well, last year I had the opportunity to watch 12 high-level
games in row. So I was able to -- when you're playing in it you're always
worried about the next opponent, the next meal, the next practice, and you
don't really concentrate on what's going on. But last year was pretty special
in the fact that I got to like just sit and analyze it. I didn't have to worry
about where I'm taking the team to get a meal tonight or whatever. But, yeah,
I mean it was a lot of fun being out there again coaching and having a chance.
We were feeling pretty good the first 10 minutes of the game, you're still in
striking distance and got a chance. But this tournament's the best in the
world, I've been to a lot of tournaments and this one's the best in the world,
everybody wants to be a part of this one.

_Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii_  
  
DAVE ODOM: Good morning, everyone. There we go. All right. We have gotten
these coaches up awfully early here, so they're all fired up and ready to go.
And look forward to hearing all from them in just a moment or two.  
  
My name is Dave Odom. I am the chairman of the tournament. This is starting my
second decade, so it's an exciting time for me and I've seen everything change
as we go along. I want to welcome you to the head coaches' press conference
and our charity free throw contest. We're going to do that in an orderly
fashion here. Here's a quick run down of what you can expect this morning.  
  
First, we're going to hear from all of the eight coaches that are going to be
participating in our tournament today. We're going to have them sign some
surfboards and take pictures as we go along. We'll have our charity free throw
contest as we always do and, of course, we're going to have some of the local
Maui Middle School students here to pair up with the coaches and we'll see
which one can shoot. Coach Bovaird usually is the premier shooter for the
group. We'll -- Bill Self, you got to watch him, the guy shoots well, he
really does. So we look forward to seeing that.  
  
Finally, we'll have a 15-minute roundtable Q&A session with the coaches.
You'll have a chance to speak to the coaches one-on-one. They'll be assigned
an area. You go find them and they will spend about 15 minutes with you at the
conclusion of this. We'll ask that you hold all of your questions until the
very end of the session. We plan to be wrapped up here by 9:00, if at all
possible. We have got two of our schools, two of our teams, Coach Crean and I
believe Coach Grant, both have to be at practice, so we want to try to get
that moved along as best we can.  
  
Now without further adieu, I would like to introduce our moderator for this
morning's press conference. I call him the hardest working man in sports
because he's everywhere and literally all over the globe. His voice has become
synonymous with the memorable moments, both on the court and on the field,
since he's been with ESPN since 1995. He was the voice of Sunday Night
Baseball for many years and now calls Toronto Blue Jay games in his hometown
of Toronto, Canada. In addition, he has called the World Series on ESPN Radio
for the last nine years. Amazing. He is in his 25th year calling college
basketball for ESPN, has won awards for his work, both in Canada and in the
United States. We're excited to welcome him back to Maui once again. Ladies
and gentlemen, please give a warm and very well-deserved welcome to our friend
Dan Shulman. Dan.  
  
(Applause.)  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Thank you, Coach. Thrilled to be back here again. And on behalf
of everybody at ESPN we're so fortunate to do this great tournament year after
year and we can't wait to get the games going. I also see that all the
coaches, you all have your Maui Jims on. You're ready to roll. I'm not allowed
to proceed until we all have our Maui Jims on. We want to thank Maui Jim for
being the sponsor of this great event. And as Coach Odom said, the coaches
have to get to practice, so we're going to keep this moving quite a bit.  
  
Just a couple of treetop things. We have got iconic programs, we have got a
couple of Hall of Fame coaches here, we have got a National Player of the Year
candidate in Cassius Winston, we got one of the great freshman in the country
in Anthony Edwards, we've got Obi Toppin, a breakout candidate, who is going,
if he's not already, will be a household name very soon. We got a lot of
exciting things to look forward to over the next few days here in Maui.  
  
We're going to hear from each of the coaches, just a couple of quick comments,
and we'll go in order of the games as they are going to start tomorrow. So
Coach Crean, I think you're my leadoff man here today. Your second year in
Athens with Georgia. You've been here in this tournament before. You were here
with Marquette, you were here with Indiana. What does it mean for you to bring
a program here to the islands?  
  
TOM CREAN: Well, it means an awful lot. Actually, 25 years ago I came with Tom
Izzo for our first games. Tom, being the head coach at Michigan State and I
was his assistant. And we got indoctrinated into what Maui was all about back
then. So it's a tremendous honor any time you can bring your team and
represent your university, but it's a little more special when you're in a
place like Maui.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Did Izzo shoot free throws 25 years ago? Did they have that
contest?  
  
TOM CREAN: Before practice. I don't remember that part. I was too busy in the
film room. But he's got an advantage over everybody here because he shoots at
least a hundred free throws a day before practice starts for 25 years. So he's
got the 10,000-hour rule working in good effect for him.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Tell us about Anthony Edwards, the highest-rated recruit
Georgia's ever brought in.  
  
TOM CREAN: Well, he's a very humble and driven young guy who should be a
senior in high school and he decided to come out a year early. Works extremely
hard, wants to learn. He's got a real energy about him with the way that he
plays. He loves to move the ball, which I think endears him to his teammates.
And he's learning a lot. The good news about him is while he's learning, most
importantly he knows he has to learn, and I think that's what, that's where
the humility comes in. Because he's very talented, very athletic, but really,
really wants to be great and he's learning a lot about that.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: So you talked about learning. What do you hope to learn about
your team? A lot of young kids a lot of new faces this year. What do you hope
to learn in the next few days?  
  
TOM CREAN: Well, I think the thing that stands out to me so much, and this is
why I'm not sure we're ready for this yet, is the physicality of the teams in
this tournament. There's experience here, there's physicality. We play Dayton.
Dayton is not only deep, physical, but they're so active, and just tremendous
activity and movement. And their offense and their defense, the way they
support each other. We're in a big-time learning stage with 10 new players. We
have seven scholarship freshmen, two walk-on freshmen, and a grad transfer. So
we're trying to indoctrinate 10 new guys into this. But I think we'll learn a
ton about what we have got to get better at. I'll never forget 25 years ago we
came in, we went 1-2 in the tournament at Michigan State, and we learned an
awful lot about where we had to go. And a week later we turned around and we
beat Arkansas who was the defending national champion. So, to me, it's unreal
learning that you get from coming out of this if you'll apply it the right
way.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Thank you. And good luck out there. Georgia will take on Dayton.
Anthony Grant is the head coach at Dayton. And I think one of the coolest
things in college basketball is when a guy goes back and coaches at his alma
mater and you're doing that, Coach Grant. What's it like to be coaching at
Dayton?  
  
ANTHONY GRANT: Well, it's an honor, obviously, for me having played there 30
years ago. The thing that attracted me as a player was the atmosphere, the
support, everything that Dayton encompasses in terms of both academically and
athletically. So to have a chance to come back as the head coach is really one
of the honors of my life.  
  
Q. For people who don 't know as much as they should maybe about your
program, the passion around your program is great. 12,000 plus every game.
What sense do you get of how well your fans have traveled out here for this
tournament?  
ANTHONY GRANT: I think really well. I think there's a history with the
University of Dayton of traveling really well. So I think we got a nice group
that's out here and should be a great atmosphere there with all the teams. I
think everybody's excited to be here.  
  
Q. I mentioned Obi Toppin. Tell us what we need to know about him.  
ANTHONY GRANT: Well, he's a guy, I think the first thing that you notice about
him is that he plays with great passion. He really enjoys playing the game. I
think he really enjoys competing. 6'9", really athletic, and has a diverse
skill set. So I think he's a guy that is an engine for us and we're excited to
have him.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: And we're excited to watch him play tomorrow. Good luck in the
tournament. Thank you.  
  
Our next coach, Mike Young of Virginia Tech, his first year in Blacksburg
after 17 years as the head coach at Wofford, 13 years as an assistant before
then, and a tremendous amount of success there.  
  
Coach Young, what's it like for you this early in your tenure at Virginia Tech
to be in this kind of a field out here in Maui?  
  
MIKE YOUNG: It's incredible, Dan. I wish the organizing committee would go
back and find another first round opponent for the Hokies rather than Coach
Izzo's team. But a tremendous tournament and a great opportunity for our
program. We're excited to be here.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: I'm not giving away any secrets. Michigan State has obviously
watched the tape, but you guys made 21 threes last game, you're small --  
  
MIKE YOUNG: Great coaching, Dan.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Great coaching. You got them great looks.  
  
MIKE YOUNG: You got it. Absolutely.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: How important is the three ball? And you have a small team, so
how do you try to compensate for that?  
  
MIKE YOUNG: That's just where we are at this point in our development. I would
like to be able to throw the thing in the post and get fouled more often. I
can't. But we do have a number of guys that can shoot the basketball and I
think we pass the ball pretty well, very good point guard that has been good
for us through five games, Wabissa Bede, that, his assist/turnovers 32 to 7,
something like that. So our turnovers have been down and our kids are willing
to share the ball and we, again, we do have a number of guys that can shoot
it.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: We wish you the best of luck.  
  
Our next coach, as Coach Young mentioned, is one of the two Hall of Fame
coaches we have here, Tom Izzo. His 25th season at Michigan State. And, Tom,
you played Kentucky in your first game, you're here, you got Duke next week.
When are you going to start scheduling up a little bit and stop taking it easy
in the non-conference play?  
  
TOM IZZO: Yeah, it's been interesting, but like Tom Crean said, you know, it
was 25 years. It's hard to believe. That means he's already established
himself as a great coach and it means we're getting old, Bill, as we get older
here in this whole deal.  
  
BILL SELF: Speak for yourself.  
  
TOM IZZO: Good point. But I've been here many times. But my first one, you
know, I'll never forget it, it was against Chaminade and we blew you guys out
by two and Jud Heathcote and Magic Johnson were sitting right behind me and
you talk about pressure. That was pressure.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: The expectations around your team are large this year, as they
often are. Do you welcome that?  
  
TOM IZZO: You know, I do. I mean, it's been an interesting year for us so far,
losing what I consider maybe our best two-way player, Josh Langford. And then
with the tragedy that happened to Cassius, we're kind of trying to figure out
where we are, trying to figure out when we can practice. But I do have a hell
of a point guard. He's different than most. I've never seen him touch the rim,
never ever seen him dunk, so him and I have something in common, maybe that's
why we have a good relationship. But he's an interesting player. I've got
another guy named Xavier Tillman, who is just kind of a solid. He's Draymond
Green-ish. He just does all the dirty work, does a lot of things. So we got a
good team but we're still trying to find ourselves, like a lot of these teams
are.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Your team, your players won the cornhole contest last night.  
  
TOM IZZO: That's the first shot they made in three weeks.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: We had ESPN research look into it. Nobody's ever won the cornhole
and the coach free throw shooting contest in the same year. And like Coach
Odom said, like Coach Bovaird's a ringer, so are you up for this?  
  
TOM IZZO: That's why you guys from ESPN get paid all the big bucks, man. You
come up with some incredible stats. I mean, incredible. And who won the
tournament when they won the cornhole?  
  
DAN SHULMAN: We didn't delve that deep into it. Would you rather the
tournament over the free throw contest?  
  
TOM IZZO: Yes.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Good. That's why he's a Hall of Fame coach. Thanks, Tom.  
  
Another Hall of Famer, Bill Self, the head coach at Kansas. And Bill, like
Tom's team, big, big expectations. Tell us what kind of a start you guys are
off to this year.  
  
BILL SELF: Well, we played well in New York and had 28 turnovers, so we
weren't, we didn't get off to a great start. We have been a little better
since then. But I like our guys. We have a good blend of experience and some
young youthful exuberance, so to speak. And we do make mistakes but we usually
make mistakes trying. So I do think we have a chance to be a pretty good team
in time. We're not close to being a team yet. But this tournament usually
lends itself to allow teams to become much closer, getting away and having a
chance to experience threes three games over here, so we're excited to be
here.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: You have something that isn't very common in college basketball
anymore. You've got a 7-foot big man, plays with his back to the basket. How
is Udoka Azubuike doing so far?  
  
BILL SELF: Well, he's doing great inside three feet. You get him to 15-foot,
he's not quite as good right now, which would be a free throw. But I love him.
I love him. He's bouncy, he's in the best shape of his life. He's lost 40
pounds since the start of the summer, so he's taking this very, very serious.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: We appreciate the time. Good luck over the course of the week.  
  
Next up is Eric Bovaird, the head coach at Chaminade entering his ninth season
with Chaminade. He's guided the Silverswords to three NCAA West Regional
appearances. And Coach Bovaird, you're back in the main draw on the islands
this year. What does it mean for your program to be part of this?  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: This event is so special to us. It's something we talk about, we
plan for a long period of time. It's what we're known worldwide, especially in
the basketball world. So it's an incredible event. I don't take it for
granted. I woke up this morning, looked outside and just thankful to be in an
incredible place like this.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: What do you tell your kids this week or pregame, whether you're
playing Kansas as you will tomorrow or whoever else you'll meet over the next
few days, what do you tell them going into these games about the opportunity
they have got?  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: Yeah, to stay locked in on the court. They hopefully don't have
the tendency to pay attention to the fans and everything like that. As long as
they're in tune with what we're trying to do and what defense we're in, what
offense we're in, I think they got a chance to be successful.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Give us something to look for, a player or something about your
team that fans should look for.  
  
ERIC BOVAIRD: My first six guys have a lot of college basketball experience,
some of them, fourth and fifth-year players and have been at Division I
schools. But a guy I'm really proud of is Tyler Cartaino, that's been in my
program for five years now. He was the Male Scholar-Athlete of the Year of our
conference. Not only a great student but a great basketball player. Four years
ago he didn't even see the floor for us, but continued to work really, really
hard and now he's a preseason All-American and first-team All-Conference
player. So I love to see a guy develop like that.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Good luck this week.  
  
Next up Mark Pope, first year as the head coach at BYU. Was an assistant there
for several years. He's now come back as the head coach and, well, we have got
three head coaches in their first year with their new team. So what's it like,
Coach Pope, two weeks into the job, once the games have started, to be out
here in a field like this?  
  
MARK POPE: It's awesome. It's an unbelievable opportunity for us. The
legendary Coach Rose left us with an extraordinary program and unbelievable
tradition and ridiculously difficult schedule. So I'm so grateful for that.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Well, two out of three ain't bad. Tell us about your team, the
style of play you like, and then how it's going so far.  
  
MARK POPE: Well, we have a veteran team with some really talented players.
Jake Toolson is a special offensive talent. He can score at all three levels,
is an unbelievable finisher around the rim. T.J. Haws is a proven veteran
point guard. We have to play a little bit different. We're pretty small and
we're not very deep right now, but we have some veteran guys that know how to
play this game and are excited about playing it a different way and trying to
figure out how we can win that way.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: And without giving away any secrets about the challenge of facing
UCLA in game one.  
  
MARK POPE: Yeah, UCLA is pretty good. They're long and big and athletic and
they have an unbelievable coach. Not the prettiest dude in the world, but he's
a big-time coach and we have been friends for a long time. And it was an
unbelievable hire, we actually had a chance to talk about it this morning,
what an unbelievable hire for UCLA to maybe take that program to really,
really the most elite level.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: You know, insulting a guy when he gets a chance to speak after
you is generally not the way you're supposed to play this.  
  
MARK POPE: Watch your back. Let's throw down right now, boys.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Thanks, coach. Good luck this week. And Mick Cronin, first year
at UCLA, after a tremendous run at Cincinnati. Playing a little bit hurt
today, got a sore arm shoulder?  
  
MICK CRONIN: I'll live.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: You'll live. He'll tough it out, just like he'll ask of his
player. Talk about what the first few weeks few months have been really like
at UCLA.  
  
MICK CRONIN: It's been a very smooth transition, just -- Mark took a job,
didn't have to get a new house, I moved across the country. But it's been
great. I keep trying to remind myself is that these guys, they didn't play for
you. So I go home every night, I think the pressure's on me, not my players.
Because when you take a job and guys, you're speaking Greek to guys, and
you're not speaking Greek to yourself, so you have to try to invoke what we're
all so good at up here which is patience. Coaches, we have a plethora of it,
we really display it all the time with officials. But, yeah, that's just the
biggest challenge is just trying to have patience and focus on the journey,
not the result sometimes and making sure that you're doing the right things
every day, because that's what you can control. And really trying to help my
players through the transition is my focus.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: You were out here I think it was 2009 with Cincinnati, took
Gonzaga to overtime in the championship game. What do you remember about the
experience and what do you hope to learn about your team this week?  
  
MICK CRONIN: You're really putting the pressure on me with that. What I
remember about the experience is we got fouled at the buzzer and there was no
call (laughing).  
  
Dave Odom and the Kemper guys came in, they were praying that I wouldn't say
anything about it in the press conference. I promised them that I would thank
you for inviting us, I won't say a word, please invite us back. I held up my
end. They did too, they just waited for me to get to UCLA and take that job.
No, it's just a great, when you're younger -- and I was a great high school
player, my dad held me back. Mark was a great player for our guy, Coach
Pitino. When you're back then, everybody watches Maui and everybody's tried to
replicate this, but whether it's ESPN or the multitude of tournaments and
other tournaments, there's nothing like the Maui Invitational. So when you're
a young kid, you coach, whatever, you're always sitting there, this is the
tournament that you want to be in. So I'm looking forward to four years from
now.  
  
DAN SHULMAN: Well put. Thank you for the time. Good luck to all the coaches,
thank you for joining us. There will be some breakout interviews going on in
just a few minutes, but good luck to all of you, we look forward watching you
play this week, and I will hand it back over to Coach O.  
  
DAVE ODOM: Thanks, Dan, we appreciate that.  
  
(Applause.)  
  
I want to go off script for just 30 seconds. Bill Villa, stand up. Bill Villa
is a long-time athletics director at Chaminade who does so many things to help
the tournament. He's really on island, actually Oahu, all year long and there
are so many things that we as a staff can't do because we're not on island. We
call Bill, he gets it done. Bill, I just want to thank you for all that you
do, but also for being a great friend. Let's give him a big hand.  
  
(Applause.)  
  
Okay. Next thing and we want to try to stay right on schedule here as best we
can. We are going to usher the coaches right over to the boards and have them,
have a, get a picture with the surfboards and what a great backdrop we have
got for pictures. And from there they will go to the free throw contest, which
is going to be held to my immediate left. So lets everybody join them and
we'll keep this thing moving right along.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 64, San Diego State - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State head coach Craig Smith and student-
athletes Sam Merrill and Neemias Queta. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH SMITH: Well, what a fantastic game. Obviously San Diego State is -- I
mean, they're very, very good, first of all. They're incredibly talented.
They're strong, physical, athletic. They're well-coached and they have
experience in these types of games.  
  
They've won the most Mountain West men's conference championships in the
history of the Mountain West. Obviously they're the defending conference
tournament champions.  
  
And so it was a heck of a game. I'm so proud of our team. Obviously just the
camaraderie, the chemistry that we have. I've been coaching 23 years. And I've
been very fortunate to be on some very good teams, coached an NAIA school that
played in the national championship.  
  
These guys, I've never seen a group just bond together and just come as far as
we have over the last 10, 11 months or so. And you have to have a great
catalyst in your program and these are our two catalysts in Sam Merrill and
Neemias Queta.  
  
And Sam's accolades speaks for themselves and Neemias being the Freshman of
the Year and Defensive Player of the Year. They played like warriors tonight.
What doesn't get talked about enough is the rest of our guys, they're stars in
their role. I think that's the key ingredient to being really good. You better
have a couple dudes like these two guys, but you better have guys that are
stars in their roles.  
  
I can't say enough about the rest of the guys on our team, how we just kept
accelerating and getting better game in, game out and week in, week out. And
that was the theme of our year, let's just keep getting better. Let's just
keep getting better.  
  
We're playing our best basketball. I don't know, we won 17 or 18, or 18 out of
19, whatever it is. But this game, to be able to hold a team like this -- this
has been our calling card all year -- we're pretty good on offense. I think
we're fifth or sixth in the country in assists on the year, but it's been our
defense.  
  
To hold a team like that to 33 percent for the game and 27 percent in the
second half, that's how you're able to close out games and that's how you're
able to close out championships.  
  
So want to thank the Mountain West Conference. This league is incredible. The
leadership at the top with Craig Thompson, Dan Butterly and the whole
administration is just remarkable. They're always there to help a guy out and
help our programs out.  
  
And to win this and make history, it's Utah State's first ever Mountain West
Tournament championship and obviously regular season as well. And we're proud
of that and we're going to carry that and represent the Mountain West in a
great fashion in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sam, the last couple of nights all you've talked about is wanting to
cut down a net. Could you tell us what it was like to finally be able to do
that?  
SAM MERRILL: I still -- I don't really know. You know, for those of us that
have been here for the last few years, it hasn't been easy. I don't really
know what to say. Eleven months ago, almost a year ago, Coach Smith was hired,
and we felt right away that we were going to have an opportunity to be pretty
good.  
  
And as someone who grew up a Utah State fan and grew up watching Utah State go
to the tournament and win conference championships, it means the world to me.
And it means the world to us as a team.  
  
We've put in so much work. And like everything Coach said, we've worked so
hard and we've come together as a team. And I'm still sitting here thinking
from where we were, I just -- I don't know. I still can't believe it. It's an
incredible feeling.  
  
Q. Queta, a year ago you were in Portugal and you had this decision to
come to Utah State. Were you expecting to have this kind of success when you
made that decision?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: Before I came here I didn't know what I was getting into. But
as soon as I practiced, I knew we were going to be this good. And we just kept
on working the whole year and it felt awesome just to get win after win after
win.  
  
And that doesn't happen like that. You have to work for it. And we did. I'm
pretty sure we did and it shows.  
  
Q. Sam or Queta, in that first half you guys struggled. You were up by
two at halftime. Then you open up the second half with a 13-0 run. What were
you talking about at halftime and how did you implement that to go on the big
run, kind of decided the game in the end?  
SAM MERRILL: We felt pretty similar to the New Mexico game in the
quarterfinals. We didn't feel like we played all that well in the first half.
And yet we were still up by two. So we were pretty confident coming out of the
half.  
  
But Coach gave us a couple of adjustments we needed to make that were
obviously very helpful and stressed the importance of those first five minutes
of the second half. And that's when we went on that big run.  
  
So, it's something we've been doing all year. We close halves well, start
halves well for the most part. Fortunately we were able to hang on from there.  
  
Q. When will you get to talk to your family about this? And how much
does it mean that you get to share this news with them?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: Right now it's probably midnight around Portugal. They're
probably asleep. So tomorrow. But it's going to be really good to talk to them
and share my happiness with them.  
  
Q. Sam, I was curious your thoughts in the first half. Jeremy Hemsley
for San Diego State had the reputation of being maybe the best defender in
that program's history or certainly in that discussion. What was he like in
that first half as you were trying to find some offensive rhythm? And what
does he do on a night-to-night basis that's unique defensively if anything?  
SAM MERRILL: He's a great defender. The last two games he's made it real tough
on me. He does a really good job of mixing things up. When I'm coming off of
hand-offs or screens, he kind of keeps me off balance by sometimes going over
the top and sometimes going underneath. And obviously he's long and athletic.  
  
So he did a very good job, and give him credit. Fortunately as a team we were
able to open things up a little bit there in the second half and we were able
to knock down some shots.  
  
Q. Sam, with about four minutes to go in the first half, you had four
points. You stepped up. You missed a free throw. You walked away. You kind of
said something to yourself. Was that kind of like your, I need to do this now
or never moment for you?  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, I feel that way every time I miss a free throw. But, yeah,
I had gotten a couple good looks. And I missed them. But I don't know for some
reason I missed that free throw and just felt like, hey, like you said, it's
time to go, time to get things going. And fortunately I was for the most part
able to make some shots there in the second half.  
  
Q. Sam, do you have any distinct memory in particular of that 2011
championship game that you attended?  
SAM MERRILL: Just remember they won. I just remember that was an incredible
year for that team. I think they finished the season 30-3 or something like
that. And I do remember the next day being really upset that they only got a
12 seed.  
  
But it's been a while for Utah State. Obviously eight years since we've been
to the NCAA Tournament. It's been probably five or six years since we've been
to any postseason. So to be a part of this with this team as a team to kind of
help the resurgence of this program, it's been a pretty fun ride.  
  
Q. Sam, Coach mentioned that you held the Aztecs to 27 percent shooting.
Could you talk about the adjustments you made in the second half compared to
the first half?  
SAM MERRILL: We didn't do a great job on Watson in the first half. We fouled
him on a 3. Obviously he's great on pump faking, we fouled him there. Fouled
him on two 3s. But he had 12 or 13.  
  
So we stressed keeping him off of his right hand and trying to limit his
space. And then just Coach stressed to us the toughest team is going to win
this game. And that was a game of two very, very tough and physical teams.
Obviously San Diego State, that's what they're known for, that's what they do
so well.  
  
But we were able to control Watson a little bit better in the second half and
didn't rebound as well. But got the rebounds that we needed. And that's part
of the reason why we held them to such a low percentage.  
  
Q. Sam and Queta, in that first half, Abel Porter was really integral to
you guys keeping pace with San Diego State. He went 4 for 4 and 2 for 2 from
3-point range. How big was he to help you guys get your footing in this game
before San Diego State might have built a large lead there?  
SAM MERRILL: Abel is a gamer. I've been playing with Abel since eighth grade.
And I know exactly what kind of player he is. He's hit a lot of big, big shots
for us this year. The New Mexico game, hit a ton of big shots at Boise. Hit a
big shot against San Diego State.  
  
So I could -- pregame I could feel that he was locked in and ready. And
obviously he's made such great progress throughout the season and his
confidence has gone up so much. And to be honest, it wasn't a surprise to us,
because we know that Abel's that type of player.  
  
NEEMIAS QUETA: We know Abel's a really good player for us. He's just always
with a smile. He's always trying to calm us down whenever we're nervous or
anything like that.  
  
We weren't surprised about that. We just kept on playing and he hit some big
shots and did whatever he needed to and helped us a lot.  
  
Q. Sam, you mentioned a couple of times throughout this season that your
biggest goal in college basketball is to make it to the tournament. Was this
kind of a dream come true to you that you're in the NCAA Tournament and you
know it's a guarantee at this point?  
SAM MERRILL: Actually my goal is to win an NCAA Tournament game. It's been,
what, 2002, 2001, something like that, almost 17 years since Utah State's won
a tournament game. So this was obviously -- this is incredible. But I feel
like we have a lot more left in the tank and we're going to definitely try and
show that wherever we end up this next weekend.  
  
Q. Queta, what was your expectations for the season when you made the
decision to go to Utah State? What were you hoping for? Follow-up, Sam, the
first time you got to step on a court and play with him, what did you think?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: I just wanted to get better and improve every day. Coach told
me that when he was recruiting me. And I think I did, every day I stepped on
the court and tried to be the best player I could be. And I think my teammates
helped me a lot improve, to improve and grow, grow a lot from this year.  
  
SAM MERRILL: Practicing with Neemi is great when he's on your team. (Laughter)
but you guys have seen it all year. He's a monster inside. And to be honest,
we've been on the same team a lot in practices. But every time I'm not, it's
like you don't even want to drive to the rim because you know it's going to
get blocked or you're going to have to put up a tough shot. Not only that, but
--  
  
COACH SMITH: He might foul, too.  
  
NEEMIAS QUETA: Nah. Nah. I never foul. (Laughter).  
  
SAM MERRILL: Before he got here, I wasn't fully sold because there were a lot
of guys -- not as long as him but guys in our league 6'11", athletic, pretty
long. And they don't quite have the motor or whatever. But as soon as he got
here the first couple of practices you could tell this dude has an absolute
motor and he's probably the second-most competitive guy on our team behind me.  
  
But it makes life so much easier playing with him. And we're grateful that the
coaches were able to make that late find with him for sure.  
  
COACH SMITH: Tell you one story. First practice, Neemi gets here. We throw him
in the first practice. He wasn't here over the summer. And I just told him
before practice, "Neemi, we're just going to throw you out. Figure it out."
It's five on five, some of our local guys have heard this. And so we're going
and we kind of just want to see what he could do, too.  
  
And Sam's right. He's like a Greyhound going from rim to rim. And he just
moves so well, defending screen and roll. And then there was a play. I think
Sam got beat off the bounce. And -- I'm just kidding, it wasn't Sam; it was
someone else. But Sam goes to rotate and Neemi is, "stop, stop. Don't worry
about the paint. I got the paint."  
  
I was like, whoa, I like that swagger. And he does have the paint. So he was a
prophet and he knew exactly what he was talking about. I've got more stories
if you guys want.  
  
NEEMIAS QUETA: I want to go home. (Laughter).  
  
COACH SMITH: We kept Sam way past his bedtime last night. I was a little
worried because the afternoon game Neemi likes the afternoon nap, but Sam
likes the afternoon game. I was like how are we going to be? But we're good to
go.  
  
Q. Queta, obviously you've had a lot of success before coming to Utah
State, playing internationally and Europe. Where does this accomplishment and
going to the tournament rank amongst your accomplishments so far in your
basketball career?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: I mean, it's probably the biggest accomplishment in my career.
I hope it's not the biggest of my overall career. I will work to get even more
of these and improve as a player and get as best as I can be.  
  
Q. Sam, last year after the Boise State game in the tournament you had a
really great quote. You said you're not out here to win quarterfinal games;
you're out here to win championships. You win a championship tonight. I want
to know how it feels sitting next to that trophy compared to what you thought
it would feel like? And is it every bit what you thought?  
SAM MERRILL: Like I said, I don't really know what to think right now to be
honest. I'm still in disbelief. Not disbelief, but like I still can't believe
that we actually did it. But at the same time we as a team, we all bought into
our system and we didn't have one guy that was trying to do his own thing or
was focusing on getting his own numbers or whatever. We all bought in and
that's what helped us get here.  
  
Compared to how I felt after the New Mexico game last year in the semifinals,
I would say sitting right here feels definitely much better for sure.  
  
Q. Queta, not a lot of players from Portugal have come through the
Mountain West Conference. But you're lucky in you get to play with another
teammate from Portugal. You grabbed and hugged him, lifted him about five feet
in the air. You went up on the stage with the Portuguese flag. How special is
it to be able to share this moment with a guy from your home country?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: It's very special. Before I came here I didn't know Diogo. But
having a Portuguese player and Portuguese-speaking guy here it's really nice.
And he knows everything -- he knows a lot of things around here. He teaches me
a lot of things around here. He's basically my dad. He takes care of me.  
  
SAM MERRILL: [Inaudible].  
  
NEEMIAS QUETA: No, he's basically my dad. Not you, Sam. But he just takes care
of me. And I really love him and we're just going to keep on working to get
better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Last season, with South Dakota, the past couple of seasons, you've
had goals and dreams of winning the Summit League Tournament. The last season
you guys lost in the conference championship to also a rival as well. Does it
make it a little bit sweeter having been through those experiences, those
hardships, does it make it sweeter to now be on top of the mountain?  
COACH SMITH: That's really amazing you just asked that question. When we were
on the podium taking pictures with our family, with the team and then our
coaching staff and family and I said to our coaching staff, I get a little
choked up here, that group at South Dakota was a really, really good group.  
  
And I mean we flipped that thing in two years, and win the regular season
title in our third year. And we won 26 games last year. We lost on a last-
second shot two years ago.  
  
And then just kind ran into a buzzsaw in the championship game. And those guys
believed in us. And I said to the staff I wish these guys -- I wish those guys
could feel what we're feeling right now.  
  
You just, as a coach, everyone operates their program differently. We truly
operate like being a family. And these guys have been unbelievable. Our team
at Mayville, the year before we got there, they won one game. We make the
national tournament the first year, get to the Elite Eight the next year, play
in the national championship game our third year.  
  
And year before we got there they won one game. And we got three guys that
played on that Mayville team at this game tonight. Flew in to be at the game.
That means so much. But our guys, God, you just can't stop talking about our
players. They're just -- sorry.  
  
It's just an amazing group. When you look at the growth that these guys had
and we've talked about our youth and all that kind of stuff. You really think
back to the year and not one time did we lose back-to-back games this year.
Not one.  
  
You play -- what's our record, 28-6. You play 34 games in the schedule that we
had and all the travel, to not lose back-to-back games is like incredibly
difficult to do. And I think that just tells you like just the mantra, the
toughness, the togetherness, because if you're not connected -- from day one
somebody said to me today pregame how are you going to handle it?  
  
We played playoff games all year, literally in terms of being a bubble team.
The first time the -- what do you call it, the bracketology started or
whatever, we were on the bubble or just outside the bubble.  
  
So every game truly matters and you can't afford slip ups. So quite frankly
today -- maybe you can ask the guys -- but today didn't feel any different
than any game all year until you come out and see the fireworks. I said to one
of the refs, the "Pomp and Circumstance" and the spirit and atmosphere,
fireworks, we've got to get those in Logan, was incredible and that had a big-
time feel.  
  
And San Diego State had a good crowd. And every day our fans got better and
better. We had a good crowd against New Mexico and an even better crowd day
two against Fresno. And obviously tonight, like, I was worried it was going to
feel a little more like a road game. Felt like a home game to me. Our fans are
incredible.  
  
And from the start of the year our guys really wanted to bring the spectrum
magic back. No doubt we did that. And to get to this point is really, I mean
it's almost a Cinderella story. And certainly it's been beyond the magical
ride for this year. And our journey is not done yet. And that's the whole
thing.  
  
We talk about winning and finding a way to win and how do you need to win. But
at the same time it's a balancing act of it's the process. And you just gotta
keep getting better every day out.  
  
And I can't -- I bet it hasn't been five -- maybe five, I don't know, less
than ten for sure, where I just kind of lost it on our team. Not lost it like
crazy lost it. But it's just very rare. Our leadership is so good and they
know when to pick each other up. And good programs are coached by the coach.
Great programs are coached by the players.  
  
And that's what we have. And that goes into the leadership of our
upperclassmen and Sam -- and Quinn Taylor I've said it many times to the local
media, he's like the godfather, or like EF Hutton -- when Quinn talks people
listen.  
  
He's been such a rock. Never too high. Never too low. He's been an amazing
mentor for Neemias, just to teach him the ins and outs and some tricks of the
trade. He's a veteran of the league. So he knows all the players.  
  
And Quinn is so smart. Every time we put in a new play -- I'm not very bright.
I always gotta come up with these quirky names or something. I'll say what do
we need to call that. Quinn like on point will just figure something out with
a hand signal.  
  
So he's got that talent for him. But to be able to do what we've been able to
do has just been really remarkable.  
  
Q. Obviously in talking about the whole bubble and playoff game, you
know obviously what was written about the league all year in terms of where it
was ranked. But do you think today, as we asked Coach Dutcher, the deserving
two teams are going? And are you proud of that the teams who have set
themselves apart will now be representing this conference next week?  
COACH SMITH: Nevada obviously had a fantastic season. And for both of us to be
tied and the way we came down -- we lost a tough game at San Diego State. And
now to -- today was our tenth win in a row, to be able to do that, we knew we
had to make a big-time push. But it's not something really talked about. But I
mean the two best teams all year have been Nevada and us, certainly.  
  
And so you always want more. I truly believe our league is a league that's on
the rise. I really believe that. And so now you get in a field of 68 and we
want nothing more than to represent the Mountain West Conference. And a first-
class fashion the right way. And obviously Utah State that way and the Aggies.  
  
So we'll be pulling for Nevada like crazy. I would assume they would be
pulling for us. And hopefully we can make some noise. But coming into tonight,
the tournament, people kept talking about the NCAA Tournament. All we were
worried about was this tournament.  
  
And let's validate, let's leave no doubt. Let's validate what we did in the
regular season, because it's incredibly difficult. I don't care if you're
Mountain West, Big Ten, to go 15-3, that's incredibly difficult to do in
conference play. And so to be able to do that and follow it up playing three
games in three days.  
  
And you hear teams, Utah State is a good matchup for us. And I think I said
this yesterday or the day before. But you look at our team sometimes and maybe
in the warm-up line you look at us like, really, these guys are -- you know?
But we have so many things that you cannot teach that are difficult to have or
find, and it's courage, it's heart, it's passion, and it's just an internal
pride to represent our program, themselves and their teammates in a first-
class fashion.  
  
And to do some of the things that we've done this year, truly is remarkable
and such a credit to our team.  
  
Q. Despite all the favorable projections, your team battled today as if
winning depending on going to the NCAA. Was that the mindset?  
COACH SMITH: Like Sam said, like our guys said, we were here to win a
conference tournament championship. And we weren't -- I never heard --
obviously like people have asked do you think you're in, do you think you're
in? Not worried about it.  
  
That stuff doesn't matter. Like we can't control any of that stuff. All we can
control is the schedules that's in front of us and let's go play our best.  
  
And this is as good of a team -- you coach for 20 -- I think this is 23 years.
You get a little bit -- some years you've got to really coach effort. And we
still coach effort.  
  
But you go into the games and you're, like, gosh, are we going to overlook
these guys? Are we going to be ready to play? And then I'm just, like, I think
back I take a step back I'm like when haven't we been ready to play? It's been
very far and few. Not that our guys are perfect.  
  
And sometimes you've got to call timeout and get them back straight. And
sometimes they'll take a few plays off. There's a couple instances yesterday,
we're up by 25 and we step in the lane on a violation. Miss a free throw, box
out. Those are concentration plays.  
  
But it's been very far and few between. But it wasn't just lip service for our
players. When they say something, they mean it. And so to be able to come here
and validate and leave no doubt was really what we were looking for.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about sharing the net with your family. Some
people were like, Coach, you're doing it wrong. They're telling you to cut it
down but you took the time to cut off individual pieces for your kids. Why and
what did that mean to you?  
COACH SMITH: You're trying to get me emotional again. Well, we all know I've
been so lucky to be married for 23 years, I think, 24. Don't tell my wife. We
have four amazing children. And we leave South Dakota. And I always said it
was going to take a special place to leave there because we loved it there.
And this is a special place.  
  
And my oldest son is a senior in high school. So you're moving your kids going
into their senior year.  
  
And a lot of the public, they don't think about all this stuff. It's always
this or that and the other. And your oldest is a senior. I went to Landon, his
name is Landon. He's 18 going on 35. And I mean that. Like he's so much
smarter than his dad. And a little bit smarter than his mom.  
  
But he's got an unbelievable perspective. And he's like, dad, you've worked so
hard for so long and this is something that, if this is something that you
really want, like let's do it, let's make it happen. He goes, I'll just
pretend like my senior in high school is a freshman year in college. I'm like
how many 17 years old -- he's 18 now, he was 17 at the time -- how many
17-year-olds think like that?  
  
I move my eighth grader is now a ninth grader and he was kind of the guy. He
was so tight with his friends and now you're moving to ninth grade and you're
dealing with all that. And now a seventh grader. My daughter doesn't matter
she's running the show anyway. She's a third grader.  
  
They're a huge part of it. When mom is not happy, nobody's happy. When mom is
happy, the kids are happy and so is her husband. So I can't -- the lives of
coaches' families -- and we do really well and beyond blessed to coach and
chase, be passionate and get to make a living doing what I truly love to do.
But there's sacrifice that goes along with it. I missed so much of my kids'
stuff that's part of the deal. But my wife doing this and doing that and
nights at home when you're gone recruiting and your team is gone, to be able
to celebrate it together as a family. My parents are here and like I said with
the former players, it's just incredible.  
  
So if that little memento, just cutting it down, that's something the kids
will remember the rest of their life. I told my daughter -- I told her I was
going to teach her how the NCAA Tournament, she thinks she knows. She's
researching. Now she's got the word "bracket" in her vocabulary.  
  
She keeps talking about -- she went to her first Final Four last year. She was
like dad if we win this game can we make it to the Final Four. Yep, we can. A
chip and a chair, like we say, like a poker player. Fitting in Vegas.  
  
That's what we believed: A chip and a chair. The other night against Boise
we're down five with 21 seconds to go. And we found a way to get that game
into overtime and win that game, and kept our mojo going.  
  
And so anyway, for our kids to be able to have that little piece of memento
and they'll keep it in their nightstand or whatever, that will just always be
a memory that we'll have forever. And that's what's so amazing about
basketball. Not to get a tyrant here or a soap box, but you look at basketball
or football, a lot of people say it's just the game. It's so much more than a
game.  
  
It's something that unites people. It doesn't matter who you are, where you're
from, if you're rich or poor, whatever your ethnicity or background. It
doesn't matter. You all come together and you're just people.  
  
Sean (phonetic) and I met because of the game of basketball. It's just amazing
how you meet so many incredible people from all walks of life because of a
game and you have a platform to use it however you want to hopefully make a
huge difference in the world.  
  
Q. How much more difficult is this journey if Queta doesn't make the
decision he makes in August and what has he meant to the team?  
COACH SMITH: I love the country of Portugal. Certainly Neemias is just -- you
see his enthusiasm and his spirit. He just has that -- and like Sam alluded to
and every guy on the team there's not one guy that doesn't love Neemi.
Obviously a game-changer on both ends of the floor.  
  
If you look at we jump on that 13-0 run to start the second half. And what did
we do the first two or three possessions? He was getting the ball. That first
half, even when Quinn got the ball down low early, good things were happening
for us.  
  
So our guys we made a concerted effort to get it to them. Made it pretty easy.
I say easy. It was a still of degree of difficulty. Right shoulder left hook
shot that he's really developed the course of the year but the second shot he
hit was ridiculous.  
  
And he had that look in his eye. And but then at the end of the day
defensively he's just such a game-changer. You forget that he's a freshman.
And so but he just has this courage, this charisma, this toughness.  
  
When he gets that look in his eye, look out.  
  
Q. You mentioned you've been feeling like you've been playing on the
playoff games all season long. Knowing that you're in the tournament give you
some time to celebrate this win and celebrate some of the accomplishments
you've had throughout the season?  
COACH SMITH: Up until the Selection Show tomorrow. So we've got about, I don't
know, 18 hours, I guess. We'll probably give the guys two -- we'll see. We
don't know if we'll play Thursday or Friday, but we'll give the guys for sure
a day off and probably two days off. But then we've got to get back at it.  
  
It just never ends. We have an unbelievable staff up and down our lineup. Eric
Peterson and Austin Hansen and Dave Ragland and all our administrative staff
have been absolutely incredible. When the announcement comes tomorrow night,
we will immediately find out who are our next opponent is and then we'll see
if we survive and advance.  
  
We win that game and then our next two opponents, the one assistant will be in
charge of the one game. And then we'll divvy up the other two. And I'll start
watching film on those and we'll get rolling right away because it's a quick
turnaround.  
  
That's what's been great. These guys will enjoy it for a little bit but we
will be on to the next thing really, really quick. And that's where these guys
can really -- they're as good as any team that way of not beating their own
chest but enjoy it with their teammates and then move on to the next thing.  
  
It's been a great journey. We'll enjoy this for a little bit and hopefully we
can survive and advance and make some noise in March Madness.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 64, San Diego State - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State head coach Brian Dutcher and
student-athletes Jeremy Hemsley, Jalen McDaniels and Devin Watson. Coach, an
opening statement.  
  
COACH DUTCHER: Well, congratulations to Craig Smith and Utah State. Got a
really good basketball team, obviously. That's an understatement, having won
17 of the last 18 games. The only blemish was the Aztecs, seems like a month
ago. They have a good basketball team.  
  
With that being said, I love my team. I love my seniors. Jeremy and Devin,
they know what it's like to cut nets down. But it's not always cutting nets
down. It's the hard losses too, and lessons to be learned in everything. And I
know they're disappointed because they wanted to cut them down again. They
wanted to hang another banner.  
  
But when they come back to Viejas some day. And I know they're not thinking
about it. When they have kids of their own they can come back look in the
rafters and show their kids the banners they hung. So I'm proud of both of
them.  
  
Jalen, obviously, has been a key player for us all year. And he couldn't get
any to fall tonight, but it doesn't mean that he doesn't compete at a high
level every time he's out there. So proud of how hard he competed.  
  
And, you know, we them sneak out on us in the second half, and I took an early
timeout. I just felt they had a little momentum going right away. And we
couldn't stem it early. They got out ahead of us -- I don't know what it was.
But to our credit, these guys' credit, they never gave in. They fought to the
bitter end. Had we had a 3 maybe fall and make it a two-possession game. But
to Utah State's credit they didn't let that happen.  
  
And I'm disappointed. I love this team. I love how hard they play and I love
how hard they play for San Diego tonight, not for themselves but for their
university. So thank you, guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jeremy, I noticed in the first half the kind of defense you played on
Merrill. You forced him into that front-court timeout and chased him sideline
to sideline. And he was really struggling and working to try to score early
on. Could you just talk about that first half, what you were trying to do. And
I know when you forced that timeout you were pretty emotional and knew you
were being effective on that end?  
JEREMY HEMSLEY: I was just trying to use my length to my advantage. He's a
player that doesn't stop moving. So you've got to frustrate him when he has
the ball in his hands. And that's what I tried to do. I just tried to
frustrate him.  
  
Q. Jeremy, at the end when you fouled out, it seemed a few minutes
before you were frustrated with the call -- I saw almost like pull up your
jersey on a call on Sam Merrill towards the end. But it seems like at the end
you walked over a little bit more calm, and just I saw you hug a bunch of your
teammates, coaches. What were those last moments like just knowing this was
the final game?  
JEREMY HEMSLEY: It just -- it's just crazy to think how fast it goes by. But,
yeah, I hugged my teammates because I knew I won't be on the court with them
again. And I have my family here. I have my mom, my dad, my little sister and
little brother. And this is the first time they got to see me play in a
conference tournament.  
  
So of course I was emotional. I wanted to win that game really bad. Going to
the tournament is something you dream about as a kid. That's something that
I've dreamt about since I've picked up a basketball. So sometimes it doesn't
always go your way. There's worse things that can happen in life than losing a
basketball game.  
  
So emotions are just me realizing that it's over with; I'm not playing with
these guys that I love anymore. And that's just what it is. And that's okay.  
  
Q. Devin, in those last five minutes with Jalen out they really put
their defensive focus on you. I know you were grinding it out to try to get a
good look, and you were able to hit a couple of big 3s late. Just take us
through the last five minutes, what was going in your head, how you were
trying to get a shot and will your team back.  
DEVIN WATSON: I don't know. Just five minutes left. I was seeing if we could
keep chipping it down. I was trying to pick and choose my moments where I
could get my shot off or my teammate could get a shot off. But, really, it was
just trying to keep the game close, make shots.  
  
Q. I know you guys set a very high standard of reaching the NCAA
Tournament. The program's been there seven of the previous nine years. How do
you look at this season? Obviously you're not going to the NCAA Tournament but
you played great basketball down the stretch. And you got to the championship
game. You're 20 minutes away from getting there. Do you look at this as a
positive season? Is it a disappointing season? How do you balance that?  
DEVIN WATSON: I mean, during the season there were a lot of ups and downs, but
I felt we overcame a lot. A lot of young guys, new guys, guys who have been
here before. And we made it to the championship. And we just -- we wanted to
win that game so bad and it got away from us a little bit. But I'm proud of my
teammates and how far we came and getting to the last game.  
  
JALEN MCDANIELS: To go off of what Dev said, we had ups and downs. Proud of
the young guys for stepping up, AG and Nate, our freshman. First time playing
college basketball at this stage. I respect them for stepping up. And my two
seniors right here, they've been playing their heart out every game. And it's
just disappointing.  
  
Q. Devin, could you just kind of explain to people who don't see him as
much as you saw him every single day what kind of a defender Jeremy has been
during this time at San Diego go state?  
DEVIN WATSON: Jeremy has been doing that ever since I've known him even in
practice, that's what he takes pride in defense if it's locking me up in
practice, anybody. So I knew every time we went out there I knew Jeremy was
going to be the best player and he was going to give the dude a run for his
money that's what he does. And his defense gets the offense going I'm proud of
what Jeremy has done all year, guarding the best players, how many games we've
played and he does it with a smile on his face and a chip on his shoulder.  
  
COACH DUTCHER: I remember Jeremy, first scrimmage at UCLA. We finished and he
said, I don't know what just happened. It seems like it was just yesterday;
four years later. Here we sit and he knows everything that's going on on the
floor. Such a great teammate, such a great captain. And such a great young
man.  
  
Q. Jalen, when you fouled out with I think it was five minutes left,
what did you see from the team? It seemed like Matt Mitchell had a bunch of
open looks. AG had wide-open 3s, where you guys had an opportunity to come
back, what did you see those five minutes from the bench?  
JALEN MCDANIELS: Thought we were trying to compete at the highest level
possible. We had some opportunities. Obviously we didn't convert. I mean,
that's the game of basketball. You're not going to make them all.  
  
Q. What were your thoughts when you walked to the bench after fouling
out not knowing this might be your final game at San Diego State? And what's
the process going to be for you going forward I know it's early what's the
process going to be?  
JALEN MCDANIELS: I just had belief in my teammates that they were going to get
it done. I was on the bench cheering, doing whatever I could, being in the
huddle, being there for them even though I was out. Not really focused on that
right now. Just have to see what happened.  
  
Q. What does Queta mean to Utah State and what do you see of his
development?  
COACH DUTCHER: He's a high level big man. Protects the rim so you can make
mistakes on the perimeter. You can extend your defense and pressure knowing
he's protecting the rim. He's a gifted passer for a young big.  
  
Nobody doubles him because if you do you're giving up a three instead of a
tough two. So I think the first time we played him we kind of wrote the script
on that -- stay extended, don't double Queta; make him earn what he gets. He's
gotten better since then. He's used to that coverage now and he takes his
time. He's an elite big man. So they're very fortunate to have him and we're
fortunate in the Mountain West to have a quality big man in our league.  
  
Q. A lot was made this year where the conference is nationally ranked
and the lowest ever and yet. And as disappointed as you are you'll have two
teams in it that appeared to at least prove themselves the best teams in the
league this year. Is it right these are the two that will represent?  
COACH DUTCHER: No question. You know, they tied for the conference title. Both
of them were red hot. Nevada lost four games all year. Two of them to us. Utah
State hasn't lost since we beat them seems like two months ago. There's, what,
16 of the last 17 or 17 of 18. They're playing incredible basketball. So two
really good teams.  
  
If we could have found a little magic at the end maybe we would have been a
three-bid league again and everybody wouldn't be talking about it. But that
didn't happen and I think anybody who sees these two teams in the tournament
should be very concerned.  
  
Q. Jeremy's defense in the first half, I don't know how much you were
keyed in doing all the things defensively as you were monitoring the whole
game, but he really did frustrate Merrill for long stretches and made him
work. For a pure scorer what did you notice about what he did in that first
half and what does it say about the kind of defender he's always been at San
Diego State?  
COACH DUTCHER: Jeremy has always stepped up to the task, no matter who it is.
He guards the best player on the other team -- every night, every night. He
knows that. We take comfort in that, saying this guy may score but it's going
to be the hardest points he's ever earned.  
  
And our defensive game plan was very good. I think they averaging close to 80
a game. And we extended our pressure -- everybody with the ball we pressured,
so we could maybe disrupt their timing a little bit. And they're such good
passers, we want to be up on them so the passes would be as easy.  
  
And we didn't give Jeremy much help. He had to really defend them on his own.
Down the stretch I wished we maybe helped him a little more, maybe from the
perimeter. We knew Queta rolling to the basket was always dangerous. But we
leave Jeremy on an island and we just say, get it done. It's a tough job, and
he does it as well as anybody in the country.  
  
Q. Utah State had the last bye in the conference season, went nine days
in the tournament without playing. Your last bye was mid January and played 14
straight games without a break. You would expect tired legs to show up in the
second half. Your team fell behind in the second half. How much do you think
that might have been a factor? And they look pretty fresh out there, didn't
they?  
COACH DUTCHER: Fresh and good. Yeah, the time off they obviously took
advantage of. They put a couple wrinkles into set plays they run all year, so
they had some counters. We saw them ahead of time; they didn't just spring
them on us. Obviously the first couple opponents in the Mountain West saw
them. But they put that time to good use. They added some stuff offensively.
They have been solid defensively all year. And they're hard to score on. And
we found that out.  
  
And that's by and large because Queta's back there. They don't have to help on
the perimeter. They just stay extended on the perimeter and say if it gets
inside, Queta, you take care of it, and we'll stay extended everywhere else.  
  
So having Skylar Spencer at Ohio State, the all-time leading shot blocker in
conference history, we know what that is. I think Nathan has a chance to get
there some day. He's not there as a young freshman. Queta is a better shot
blocker right now. He makes all the difference in the world.  
  
I think they used the time off wisely. We played banged up. Devin is banged
up. Nathan is banged up. Adam Seiko played today on a wrist where he said, I
can't take a shot but I'll play, just so he could guard and give us a couple
of minutes. But we knew he couldn't shoot because of his wrist. So it's --
that's this time of the year and most teams are dealing with it and we're one
of them.  
  
Q. You guys had 15 offensive rebounds against a team that's one of the
best in the country of keeping the offensive glass clean. I was wondering if
that was a focus coming in and is it frustrating when you get those many
offensive boards but you can't turn them into second-chance points?  
COACH DUTCHER: Obviously rebounding was the number one key to the. They
outrebound their opponents eight in the conference by eight a game. Last five
games they've been outrebounded by 10 a game.  
  
Even though we didn't win the rebound battle, it was 39-37. We kept it
respectable. We got a lot of offensive rebounds. And I think obviously the
biggest one, we have a steal and we had a couple looks inside. Devin, a couple
of layups late in the game, that could have maybe kept a little more heat on
them.  
  
But to their credit they didn't let us score on a lot of the second-chance
opportunities, it didn't appear. I'd have to look back to see exactly. But
even we got the rebounds, they did a good job of getting back on shooters and
not letting us score on putbacks.  
  
Q. During the five minutes when he fouled out, what did you see from the
court? Did you see missed opportunities, just open shots not falling in?  
COACH DUTCHER: Obviously, you know, we went small down the stretch. We were
playing Nate and Nolan, and we just said we're down eight, nine, ten points.
Let's go small. Let's pick and pop. Let's give Matt some 3s. Let's give AG a
couple looks at open 3 because we knew they weren't switching.  
  
So we got those looks and we didn't make them. Matt got I don't know how many
open looks in the last three or four minutes. And all by design. We were
screening stepping him out. And maybe that's tired legs as much as anything.
Three games in three days. Matt's a pretty good shooter. He got looks we
wanted but we didn't make enough of those down the stretch. We felt we had to
go small in order to get back in the game. Press, go small. Try to spread them
out a little bit more. Move Queta away from the basket.  
  
You can't play that way all game because he's so big and strong in there. It's
hard for Matt or anybody that size to guard him. But we thought to try to get
back in the game we'd try go small, try to spread them out a little bit more.
We gave ourselves an opportunity; we didn't take advantage of it.  
  
Q. Could you talk about how Devin, when Jalen went out, just how he kind
of seemed like he willed your team to stay alive in this game with his 3-point
shooting?  
COACH DUTCHER: Devin? He's a warrior. Devin was -- I mean we came in the
locker room, and I'm trying to basically put the wrap on a season, and he was
still mad as a hornet. He's mad.  
  
If we told him he could play five more minutes, he would go play five more
minutes. He's a hard competitor. We took the loss very hard and he was
extremely frustrated. But good players are supposed to be frustrated. So Devin
is a high-level competitor.  
  
And I think you saw him blossom. I mean, Devin's always been a scoring point
guard. But, my goodness, some of the plays he made in these last two or three
games and the leadership he showed, it just shows you stay with it, you stay
with it and you can get better from season to season. You can get better
during the season.  
  
You can get better game to game. And I thought Devin was just -- he was the
best I've ever seen him these last two or three games, as far as leading the
team, playing the right way, making really hard shots and obviously you'd like
to cap that off with a conference title. But it didn't happen. But it doesn't
take away for how hard and how well he played down the stretch for us.  
  
Q. You yourself set a very high bar for a mid-major, which is make the
NCAA Tournament every single year. You've come close but you don't; how do you
look at this season? Do you consider it a success? Do you consider it a
disappointment because you didn't make the tournament?  
COACH DUTCHER: It's always a fine line, because our goal is to make the
tournament. So if we don't make the tournament, then we're disappointed and
it's not a success. But it's a success at other levels because the team
worked, got better all year. Competed at a high level. They played together.
They played the right way. So at the end of the day when you go to the
tournament seven of nine years and you don't go this year then it's a
disappointing season because that's what we wanted to do.  
  
But it doesn't take away from the work they put in so they shouldn't be
disappointed in their effort. They shouldn't be disappointed in how hard they
played. They shouldn't be disappointed in their teammates or what they put
into this year.  
  
But obviously if you don't make the ultimate step and there will be teams next
at the end of this month talking about. Was it disappointing you didn't make
the Final Four. Yes. Was it disappointing you lost in the national
championship game?  
  
So everybody is going to be disappointed at some level. And you have to take
whatever satisfaction you can with the work you put into it. And I always tell
them hard work's always rewarded.  
  
Maybe not at the time but in the long run for the rest of your life, for our
season from now or whatever it is, hard work will be rewarded. So were we
rewarded with a trip to the tournament? No. But they were rewarded with being
the right people that played the right way and hung together with a bunch of
young kids.  
  
I mean, I know no one wants to hear but when you're playing with eight of top
11 are freshmen and sophomores, there's a lot of work that goes into it. I
thought we got better and I think it bodes well for the future of San Diego
State.  
  
Q. Two years at the helm since Coach Fisher retired. Your thoughts of
the program and the general direction you guys are going into.  
COACH DUTCHER: That's what Coach Fisher always said we're not a one-hit
wonder. We have a program at San Diego State. So we're disappointed we didn't
go this year. But we'll be back here fighting and trying to put ourselves in a
position to be back in the tournament next year.  
  
I mean, I think everybody knows -- I'm not trying to Bragg -- we have more
conference titles than anybody in the Mountain West. More conference
tournament titles. So we have a high standard for our performance.  
  
So when we fall short of that, we fall short of our standard. And so am I
disappointed? Yes. But do I think the future is bright and will continue to be
bright at San Diego State, yes, because we're about the right things.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Craig Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13780)

### [Sam Merrill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34901)

### [Diogo Brito](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36850)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 85, Fresno State - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State head coach Craig Smith and student-
athletes Diogo Brito and Sam Merrill. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH SMITH: On the record, I want everyone to know it's past Sam's bedtime.  
  
SAM MERRILL: Way past my bedtime.  
  
COACH SMITH: Like my parents would say, it's midnight in Central Time.  
  
DIOGO BRITO: It's 5:30 in Portugal.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State head coach Craig Smith and student-
athletes Diogo Brito and Sam Merrill. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH SMITH: Fresno State is a very, very good team. You win 22 games on a
season in the Mountain West Conference, we have so much respect for them. And
Justin's a really, really good coach. And they're a really, really good team.
They have so many weapons and they just space you out.  
  
They're so prolific on the offensive end where they just put a lot of pressure
on you. And our guys played -- we played a great game tonight.  
  
We played a very good team. And we played a great game on both ends of the
floor. And we played well on offense but I thought we were even better
defensively. To hold a team like that -- I don't have the final -- anybody
have stats here?  
  
Five-for-26 from the 3, and this is a team in the Mountain West that averages
11.5 3s a game at 39.5 percent. Those are big-time numbers. They only had six
offensive rebounds, and we hold them to 35 percent in the first half. It kind
of got away. They went on a 10-0 run there at the end of the game.  
  
We had 23 assists. We're a top-10 team in the country in assists. You could
see the way we move the ball, the ball had great energy and only nine
turnovers. We handled their press very, very well all game long.  
  
And so give our guys credit. We have five guys in double digits and it was
just a great team effort by the Aggies.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. Sam, from 24 turnovers a night ago to just nine, coupled with the
defensive effort and the assists and what was at stake, would you say this was
maybe your best all-around performance as a team?  
SAM MERRILL: I think you could definitely make an argument for that. Obviously
we turned the ball over a lot last night, but we weren't overly concerned
about that. We felt it was more an aberration. But we played really well.  
  
Like Coach said, it started on the defensive end. They're obviously so good
offensively, and they have so many guys that can shoot and can create their
own shot.  
  
And when we're rolling like that defensively that ignites our offense. And I
thought we did a great job moving the ball. We hit shots. We finished at the
rim. Got a little sloppy there in the second half. But, yeah, you could
definitely make a case for that being our best overall game this year.  
  
Q. Diogo had a great game, but what did you think of his dunk attempt?  
SAM MERRILL: He did have one dunk. That's more than I have in my career. So I
had that same thing happen to me my freshman year. So I know how he feels.
Hopefully they put that on "Not Top 10" or something.  
  
DIOGO BRITO: Hopefully they don't put it anywhere, that would be better.  
  
Q. You made 12 of your first 22 shots, (lost audio) from the 3. How much
energy did that give you when you saw shots fall early on?  
DIOGO BRITO: Definitely a lot of energy. But it's something that we work a lot
in practice, which is stop and score. And today that was huge for us, getting
stops and just being able to convert almost every single time. Coach telling
us, three straight stops and getting a lot of open shots and creating a lot of
shots for each other through just ball movement.  
  
So, yeah, the ball energy and those shots falling all the time, or most of the
time, definitely kept us with a good confidence.  
  
SAM MERRILL: When we're guarding like we did from the beginning of the game,
like I said, that ignites our offense. And vice versa, when we're making shots
like that, that gets our defense going.  
  
And our bench, especially in the first half, defensively, when our bench --
when we're defending by our bench, they really help us out and give us energy
on the defensive end and that gets our offense going.  
  
We were able to get stops and get out in transition and we felt like we had
opportunities to do well in transition and we definitely did that tonight.  
  
Q. Diogo, your first half against New Mexico was not up to your usual
standards. But since then you've been on fire, basically -- 34 points, eight
rebounds. You got four assists tonight as well. What's been the key to you
kind of finding your groove again after that first half?  
DIOGO BRITO: I've got to give some credit to the bald guy over there, our
coach. Yesterday I was having a terrible first half.  
  
COACH SMITH: You said handsome?  
  
DIOGO BRITO: Handsome, yeah. (Laughter).  
  
And I was struggling. And he came to me and we had a little talk and that
really made me, like, just look forward, forget what's behind you. And ever
since then I think just things kind of slowed down and that really opened my
game a lot.  
  
Q. You've both been here at Utah State for a couple of years. You know
the history. You know everything, what basketball means to the fans. Now
you've put USU back in a conference title game for the first time since 2011,
first time in a Mountain West title game. What does it mean to you guys
personally to be able to be a part of that resurgence of Utah State
basketball?  
SAM MERRILL: I was at that game in 2011. I'm pretty sure it was at the Orleans
Arena. We've both been here the same amount of time. The last couple of years
were tough for us, obviously not playing up to the standards of Utah State
basketball.  
  
But it's been such a fun ride this year being able to finally get back to
where, almost to where Utah State belongs. And we're so excited and grateful
for our fans who were awesome again tonight. We're hoping to have a lot more
tomorrow. So it's not that long of a drive, it's only six hours. Coach will
pay for your gas if you need to.  
  
COACH SMITH: And your speeding tickets. Well, let's not get too carried away.  
  
SAM MERRILL: We're so excited for the opportunity to play for a championship
tomorrow and try to cut down some nets. And hopefully we have a huge crowd
like we did tonight.  
  
Q. Sam, you guys are obviously going to be playing San Diego State
tomorrow. You had 35 points in that first matchup in San Diego. What do you
think you did well there and that you could hopefully translate, or repeat
that tomorrow?  
SAM MERRILL: They guarded me differently in the first game than they did in
the second game. And I was able to get a few open shots early on. And that
kind of got my momentum going. I don't remember scoring as much in the second
game, but obviously we won. So that was more important. But our defense was
really, really good in the second game.  
  
But our entire offensive system is predicated on just taking what comes and
not forcing things and moving the ball and sharing the ball.  
  
Me personally and as a team, we're just going to play our way. And if that
leads to me having open shots and making shots, great. If not, then we'll
focus on getting other guys shots.  
  
Q. What do you anticipate most in this rubber match, just playing them
for the third time?  
SAM MERRILL: We know they're very physical. They've been here before. They
played in this game last year and won it. So they're very talented. They
defend well. We have obviously all the respect in the world for San Diego
State. So we expect it will be a battle for sure.  
  
Q. Are you already anticipating who will be guarding you, stuff like
that?  
SAM MERRILL: They've had the same guy on me for the last two games. I'm sure
it will be Hemsley again. But we'll see.  
  
Q. Sam, can you tell me what some of the thoughts were going through
your mind in that first half when you were -- you started within the first 15
seconds, you made that 3, and then the last two seconds you made that 3 as
well. Tell me what thoughts are going through your head when you're having
that good of a game?  
SAM MERRILL: To be honest, we don't take a lot of time to celebrate. We are --
I think that's part of what makes us a good team is when we hit a 3, we're
immediately yelling at each other, hey, we've got to get a stop, we've got to
get a stop. Or when we have a dunk, we're celebrating but we're just trying to
focus on the next play.  
  
To be honest, I didn't even know we'd scored 50 points until we were in the
locker room. I just knew we were up by 20-something. That's our goal is to
continue to focus on the next play and that will be how we try to do things
tomorrow.  
  
Q. You guys had not beat San Diego State since joining the Mountain West
until you did it a couple of weeks ago. How much of a mental hurdle was that?
Does it give you more of an advantage tomorrow?  
DIOGO BRITO: It's something we've been told that every single game we play San
Diego State we've never beaten them. We've never beaten them. You do have that
in your mind that you've got to beat them sometime. When we did, it felt good.  
  
But I thought the main difference was that when we beat them, we just believed
-- we went into the game knowing that we could beat them. We studied them
really hard and just that mindset that we can beat these guys and when we did,
you know, it just felt good, I guess.  
  
Q. Sam, we've been hearing for the last couple of weeks that Mountain
West is a two-bid league. Do you guys feel like you have to win tomorrow to
get into the NCAA Tournament? And San Diego State really doesn't have any
pressure on them. So how difficult is it to prepare for a team in this game of
this magnitude when you're playing a team that doesn't really have any
pressure on them?  
SAM MERRILL: I feel that we want to cut down the nets tomorrow. And I'm sure
San Diego State feels the same way. So I know technically they have nothing to
lose or whatever, but if I were them, I'd feel the same way. We want to win a
championship.  
  
We don't know what's going to happen on Sunday. But fortunately we have a day
in between. So we'll just focus on tomorrow. And, like I said, our main goal
is to cut down some nets tomorrow. That the would be pretty fun. So we're
going to play like it.  
  
Q. Diogo, you've really excelled these last two games in the tournament
coming off the bench. What is your approach when you're coming into the game
off the bench in terms of your contributions and what you're looking to do for
the team?  
DIOGO BRITO: That's something that it started all the way in Montana State,
just embracing your role. Of course, before the year starts you're fighting
for the starting role, for that starting spot. But you know, things just
happened the way they happened.  
  
And if Coach wants me to come off the bench, bring energy, just do things
right, do things the right way and I'll just try to follow that lead. And it's
been a long year. It's been -- I can say -- sorry, you know like it's been a
long year but once I embraced that role that really opened my mind, just do
your thing. And it doesn't matter who starts the game. It's about who finishes
it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. How do you get a team or how do you go about getting a team that
shoots 39 percent from 3 to go whatever it is, 5-of-26 tonight?  
COACH SMITH: I thought we defended really well. No secrets at this time. We
played them twice. They played us twice. They know us inside and out and
backwards. We know them inside out and backwards. And so you have that.  
  
You go back to that experience of playing them twice. And you have a good feel
for their personnel. And you know their scheme. And they know our calls and
how to defend it. We know most of their calls and how to defend it. And
shooting is contagious. And obviously they missed some wide-open shots, too.  
  
We defended well, but they also missed some open looks. And sometimes that
happens. And that's the beauty of sport. You just don't know -- you have an
idea what to expect. You game plan like crazy. You go through the whole
routine. It's a quick turnaround. They played last night at this time and they
were up here at this time. We played obviously the one game earlier.  
  
So it's a quick turnaround. You're throwing your guys a lot of information.
But shooting's contagious. And we were fortunate tonight to be able to hold
them to that percentage. And we didn't let them get out in transition.  
  
They are fast and electric in transition. And I thought we did a really good
job getting back and eliminating, for the most, part easy baskets in
transition.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked late in the season about being exhausted
emotionally and physically. You got that bye at the end of the season, a nine-
day break. You seemed to be the fresher team tonight. Justin Hutson said you
were quicker to the ball, how much did that help you having the break?  
COACH SMITH: It didn't help us last night but it probably did help us tonight.
It's a hard thing. You've all been around the game a long time. When you don't
play a game for nine days, that is a -- that is -- that's like three weeks in
football, honestly. And so we needed it at the time. I think we had 12 or 13
straight games.  
  
So we were tired -- and both physically and mentally. And so we needed that.
But you could tell last night, we weren't -- and a lot of credit to New
Mexico, like I said last night. But I didn't think we were as on point and as
sharp with some stuff that we normally are.  
  
But obviously that second half we were clearly better than the first half last
night. And then we carried that momentum into tonight. But our guys have had a
great focus, great concentration. And it's a determined, hungry group that
really wants to represent Utah State in a great fashion and, of course, the
Mountain West Conference in a great fashion.  
  
Q. About to play your third game in three days. You probably haven't had
time to reflect at all. But have you had a moment to kind of pinch yourself
and say this is really happening in my first year at Utah State, this kind of
success, this kind of speed?  
COACH SMITH: Not really. It's been obviously incredibly exciting because from
day one -- I mean, I can think back to our practices in April. If I would have
had any hair it wouldn't have been left. And in the summer -- but you just
remember, it's the journey.  
  
And I vividly remember where we were. I'm a history major. So where we were,
where we are, where we're going. And our motto, because we're so young -- I
know I've talked about this some. It's almost helped us in the process kind of
in a distorted or weird kind of way, that we've really, what, seven, eight
months ago we were like the toddler. Then we were kind of -- or the infant.
Then we became the toddler and we were just kind of crawling.  
  
You just go through all -- then we started walking. And then we started
running. And I said about three weeks ago, I think we were up to ninth grade.
And now we might be a senior. I don't know.  
  
But it's been really fun to see the progression with the team, first and
foremost, but with individual guys. You can just see the progression guys have
made.  
  
And you have kind of an unsung hero with Abel Porter and Justin Bean. Those
two guys earned a scholarship shortly after Christmas. And just seeing their
progression, and how they -- Justin, we were playing 10 guys regularly in
November and December -- 10 of our 12 guys that we dressed.  
  
Alek Johnson wasn't even on our team for a while. We did walk-on tryouts, sent
a mass email to students. And Alek shows up and Alek is a good player. But
Bean wasn't even in the top 10 rotation. But we leave practice every day and
I'm, like, I tell the staff, why aren't we playing Abel Porter more? Why
aren't we playing Justin Bean more? Because practice has got to mean
something. And it does.  
  
And you've got to give those guys credit for staying the course, just showing
up every single day when they weren't getting a lot. Now they're playing
fantastic basketball for us.  
  
So we'll reflect after the season. But every day for us has been about let's
keep getting better. Let's get better today in practice. Let's get better over
the next two weeks. And that's what's exciting. We can still keep getting
better. That's what's been exciting. I think we've gotten better now than we
were three weeks ago.  
  
And so sometimes when you have a five-and-a-half-month season, you just, some
teams will just kind of flatline. And these guys have just showed this energy
and this enthusiasm to come to the gym every day and let's keep getting
better. And that's what's been exciting.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Eric Musselman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30554)

### [Tre'Shawn Thurman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36766)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 65, Nevada - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nevada head coach Eric Musselman and student-
athlete Tre'Shawn Thurman. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Give San Diego State a ton of credit. I thought they played
really well. Devin Watson had a really good game for them offensively. Having
said all that, really, really proud of our team's effort. I thought we played
as hard as we played all season long.  
  
Difficult, obviously, when Caleb gets into foul trouble in the first half. But
having said that, I thought we battled. I thought we played hard. So we just
get ready for the next step and see what happens on Sunday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. What was going on with Jordan Caroline?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Jordan Caroline was held out tonight for precautionary
reasons. It's been a long season. He's got a lingering injury and that's what
it is.  
  
Q. What do you attribute to San Diego State defensively to hold you only
to 56 points and 6-of-24 from 3?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: I had two all-league players not play in the first half. So I
think if you took any team in this league and took two all-league players off
the floor. I don't think the game have as close as it was. I thought or effort
was phenomenal.  
  
Q. Selection Sunday, what would be your message to committee room after
what you guys have accomplished this season, 29-4, as to why you guys deserve
a solid seating, I guess?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: I think our record speaks for itself, the body of work in
non-conference, conference play. Unfortunately, we weren't fully healthy
tonight and we will be going forward. And so, you know, that's it.  
  
Q. Was Caroline able to play tonight, or if this was an NCAA Tournament
game, would he have played? What was the thinking behind holding him out?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: I can't really answer that. I told you guys what the
situation is. And so he's day to day.  
  
Q. Tre'Shawn, you guys were able to bounce back. Last year you weren't
on that team, but you were in the same situation where you lost in the
semifinals of the Mountain West, and they were able to come back and win two
games in the NCAA Tournament. I guess what's the focus of the team now? I know
it's hard to answer this right now, but trying to regroup and making another
run in the NCAA Tournament?  
TRE'SHAWN THURMAN: Like Coach said, we'll just wait for Sunday. But right now
our goal was to come down here and cut down nets. So I'm not really thinking
about Sunday right now. We lost. And we didn't plan on losing a game coming
down here.  
  
Q. You guys come back from 13 down. You take the lead. They're kind of a
mess. They're turning the ball over. They're not getting good shots. What
changed there in the last five minutes? What were they able to do? What did
you guys stop doing?  
TRE'SHAWN THURMAN: It's really just a blur. I thought both teams were
fighting. A shot went in for them, one or two, and one or two didn't for us.
And that was part of the game right there.  
  
Came down to the last minute. Both teams were fighting hard. They just
happened to make a couple more shots than us at the last minute.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 15, 2019

  

### [Justin Hutson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36811)

### [Nate Grimes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36813)

### [Noah Blackwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36849)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 85, Fresno State - 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State head coach Justin Hutson and
student-athletes Noah Blackwell and Nate Grimes. Coach, let's start with an
opening statement.  
  
COACH HUTSON: Buzzsaw in the first half. You know, we didn't play anything
like we played the previous two times where we played them, where we had to
really move the ball. They're a very good defensive team. So you've got to
make multiple penetrations and multiple kickouts and go inside out.  
  
And I think we rushed it a little bit tonight and they made us pay. And when
we actually did get a stop, they got the rebound in the first half. They're a
very good rebounding team we didn't box out. It steamrolled from there. Gotta
credit Utah State, a very good team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Nate, in your opinion, we heard what Coach said, what do you think,
being out there on the floor, what was the difference tonight, getting down so
big and because you guys were right there nip and tuck with them during the
regular season?  
NATE GRIMES: Just didn't come to play. Like he said, we didn't follow the game
plan. We didn't rebound. I know I didn't rebound, really, at all. And they
just outplayed us. This is a good team, too.  
  
Q. What were you most surprised about tonight?  
NATE GRIMES: Losing by 30.  
  
Q. Can you go a little further on --  
NATE GRIMES: Because that's not how we get down and we don't go out like that.
If we're going to go out, we're going to go out hard.  
  
Q. Noah, on this stage, to kind of have a performance like that,
probably you guys are probably disappointed as can be. Does it hurt even a
little bit more tonight?  
NOAH BLACKWELL: Yeah, it hurts. I mean, we lost by 30. I mean, losing hurts
anyways. But we just didn't come out to play how we know how to play.  
  
Q. NIT bid is likely for you guys. Do you think you deserve an NIT
bid?  
NOAH BLACKWELL: Absolutely.  
  
NATE GRIMES: I do. But we've got to stay focused. We've got to stay focused in
for the whole thing.  
  
Q. What would it mean for you to get a chance to play on and maybe get a
chance to erase this memory of this game?  
NATE GRIMES: It would mean a lot to me, especially to the seniors. Like going
-- letting them go out big. So trying to do whatever it takes.  
  
Q. Noah, what were they doing -- what were their guards doing
defensively that was seemingly pushing you and your fellow guards out of your
rhythm tonight?  
NOAH BLACKWELL: I don't know. We just didn't show up to play. That's it.  
  
Q. Nate, there was a rebounding disparity, obviously. A lot of those
rebounds were long rebounds. How does a team go and counter that kind of a
situation? Even when you did have guys boxed out, balls going out seven, eight
feet, how do you counter that?  
NATE GRIMES: Honestly, we've just got to continue to play hard. We've got to
play hard. Next effort, another effort. Give another effort.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. They had the bye at the end of the conference season. Didn't play for
nine days. Could you tell? They seemed the fresher team. This time of year
it's tough to play all the back-to-back games. Do you think that was a factor.
They seemed to have fresher legs?  
COACH HUTSON: I don't know. They had a tough one last night. New Mexico
pressed them all over the floor and they turned it over. But they ended up
scoring 90-something points. But I thought they looked great tonight. They ran
up and down the floor. They were quicker to the ball and very well-coached.
Hats off to them.  
  
Q. I know this loss hurts for you, but your good friend, Marvin Menzies,
was fired today. Wondering what your thoughts were on that. He got fired after
really two years, three, technically, but two considering when he took over?  
COACH HUTSON: Tough for Coach. I've known Marvin for a long time. He's
actually a mentor of mine. I spoke to him today. It's tough. He really had two
years. He took over and had two guys left on his roster in April. And it's
tough.  
  
And coaches talk about that all the time, how you put in the paper it was
three years and you put his record, but they forgot what happened in the first
year. He really had two years, and I thought he did a good job this year
finishing 11-7 in conference with a lot of freshmen and losing his best
player. Marvin will be fine, though. He's marvelous. That's what he calls
himself. So he'll bounce back.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 65, Nevada - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State head coach Brian Dutcher and
student-athletes Devin Watson, Jalen McDaniels and Jeremy Hemsley. Coach, an
opening statement.  
  
COACH DUTCHER: Well, obviously we were a bit surprised when Caroline wasn't in
the lineup. But it's like anything else, it's a wounded animal. We knew they
were dangerous anyway. They play hard. The greatest quality in Nevada
basketball is their toughness. And they showed it again tonight.  
  
But I've got a tough team, too, and the two best defensive teams in the
conference played tonight. It was a low-scoring affair. It was like old-school
Aztec basketball. And we got a nice lead in the second half. And then they
gave us a good gut punch, came back, and we were able to regroup at the end,
have a nice spurt.  
  
Devin did a good job, Jeremy did a good job controlling the pace of the game,
and Jalen made some timely baskets down the stretch and we were fortunate to
come out with the win today.  
  
Q. When did you guys find out that Caroline -- when did you realize that
Caroline wasn't going to play? Was it right at the tip? Was it a little bit
before? How did that change your mindset?  
JALEN MCDANIELS: I didn't even know until -- I was wondering why he wasn't
going in the game. That's when I found out. Other than that, yeah.  
  
COACH DUTCHER: When they came back in for final matchups, there was a
different matchup and no one was on Caroline. So I didn't realize until that
point that he wasn't dressed. I don't know what happened, but we'll take it.  
  
Q. Devin, you led the team with 20 points. You had that nice little
spin-move drive to the basket. Is the back feeling a little bit better?  
DEVIN WATSON: Yes, it's feeling a little bit better. I just continue to get my
treatments in. I'll be ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jeremy, I saw you kind of laugh after that question. What was funny
just about that situation, when it was asked about Caroline?  
JEREMY HEMSLEY: No, no. It just caught us off guard. Nothing was really funny
about it; I was laughing at something else. Like Coach said, I didn't know
Caroline wasn't playing until we got out on the court and I seen he wasn't
dressed, in uniform.  
  
Q. Jeremy, you've been talking about how you've been making it public
that it's NCAA Tournament or bust. What's it like knowing you're one game away
from that? Do you think about that?  
JEREMY HEMSLEY: Yeah, of course you think about it. And it's everything we
want. All you can ask for is the opportunity. And we have the opportunity to
get there. We just gotta play hard for another 40 more minutes. So this is
everything we wanted. And now we're in position to do so and it's on us to
take care of it.  
  
Q. Jalen, you kind of got into foul trouble towards the end of the
second half. What's going through your mind when you're sitting on the bench
and just knowing that you can't be out on that floor at that moment?  
JALEN MCDANIELS: Just being confident in my teammates knowing they're going to
get the job done, and just being -- just being a part of my teammates as much
as I can, just keeping their confidence up and just trying to be a great
teammate on and off the court.  
  
Q. Devin, the offense really started to sputter there. There was a
stretch when they came back. Guys weren't getting great shots or no shots at
all. What in your mind changed? What did you change out there? What sets were
you guys calling down the stretch that allowed you guys to score?  
DEVIN WATSON: I myself was just trying to keep my cool. I knew we were still
in the game. It's not like we were down six or seven and the game was getting
away from us. So we were just waiting to see what our coaches was calling, and
if the play didn't work, with 10, 11 seconds left we were going to have to
make a play.  
  
And I feel like Jeremy made a big play. Bumped him. Made the mid-range. And I
had the big 3 in the corner. And, yeah, and the tables turned.  
  
So we knew -- we just played with a lot of confidence. We didn't lose it. We
didn't lose control. We were always in control, we felt like.  
  
Q. What is it about this tournament that makes you take it to the next
level like you guys seem to do year after year?  
JEREMY HEMSLEY: It's win or go home. Me personally, I still feel like I have a
lot to show and my teammates still have a lot to show. If we are playing the
right basketball around this time you can keep just going, you can keep going
further into March.  
  
And so that's what I want to do. And that's what my teammates and coaches want
to do. So if that's the task at hand, you have to up your game and you have to
play at that elite level if you want to go further in March and play the best
teams. So it's sort of a requirement. It's just what you're asked to do and
that's what we have to do.  
  
Q. Nevada obviously beat you guys up pretty good in Reno. Was there any
sort of revenge factor coming into this game?  
DEVIN WATSON: No, it wasn't revenge. I feel like every time we match up with
Nevada it's going to be a great game and the fans love it. So, no, we love
Nevada. They play hard. And they're a competitive team. We actually like
playing them.  
  
Q. What lessons did you learn from that game six days ago when you lost
by 28?  
JALEN MCDANIELS: We learned just that we've got to play harder, play with more
toughness because they're a tough team. And I felt like we capitalized on that
this game.  
  
JEREMY HEMSLEY: Just being under control like Dev said. I think if you do
that, you always have a chance at winning. And I think we did a good job at
that. When we got the lead this time, we stayed under control compared to last
game when we had to fight from, like, 15 down or something like that.  
  
So I think if you just come out with that intensity and like I've told you
before, just make it to where the opposing team has to match your effort and
intensity, then you always have a good chance at winning.  
  
Q. Jalen, could you talk about Jeremy and Devin, their senior leadership
and what they bring to the table?  
JALEN MCDANIELS: They bring a lot of experience to the table. Down the
stretch, they both made big plays that we needed. That's what you expect out
of your senior guards. And I mean they're showcasing it every game what they
can do. Especially in those situations, they're capitalizing just like
yesterday Jeremy hit a 3. So I feel like they're leading the way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Who was supposed to guard Caroline and they walked out on the floor
and he wasn't there; what did you guys do?  
COACH DUTCHER: I think Matt Mitchell celebrated. It was going to be Matt.
Matt's had great matchups with him. He played well at our place. Caroline
played really well at their place.  
  
Like I say, all we can control is what we can control. So when he wasn't out
there, we switched a few matchups up and off we went. And they got in early
foul trouble, too. Caleb got in early foul trouble. He missed a lot of the
first half.  
  
I thought Cody did a great job keeping him in the game. Porter was good.
They're good. They're a tournament team. They're going to be in the NCAA
Tournament. And their path is different than ours. They're already in it.
They've been in it.  
  
We have one chance to go and that's by winning tomorrow. If we don't win
tomorrow our season will be over. We know what's at stake, and there's a
controlled desperation to that. Devin, you know, he reminded me of Winston
Shepard one year we played at Nevada. They stormed back on us and Winston told
the team during a timeout what, did you think it was going to be easy?  
  
Devin basically said the same thing today: They're good. You didn't think they
were going to roll over; they're good. We knew it was going to be a game.  
  
It's that kind of comments that come from the players rather than the coaches
that make a difference -- when you've got a senior leader that's calm and
collected in pressure situations. And that doesn't mean you always make the
right play, but if your temperament is right and your attitude is right,
you've got a chance to make the right play. And Devin was just a wonderful
leader today both on the floor and in the timeouts.  
  
Q. Devin hit those two 3s in the second half. They called timeout and
then it was like a buzzsaw the other way. They just came storming back. How
did your team switch it again and was able to hold them, I think, more than
seven minutes without a field goal?  
COACH DUTCHER: We just hung in there. You know, they stormed back. They're a
good team. And so every time we play them it's a back-and-forth affair.
There's a lot of toughness that goes on.  
  
They got ahead of us 15 at their place. We cut it back to three or four at
halftime. We know both teams are capable of making a run, and it's how you
respond to the run that kind of determines how good a team you're going to be.
We didn't panic. We kind of hung in there.  
  
No matter what kind of run they were on we kept looking at the scoreboard, it
was a two-point game. So it wasn't that they ran out on us by 11 points. They
cut back and caught up with us. But we were able to hang in there long enough.
And then we made timely plays.  
  
Jalen got in the low post and hit a pull-up jump shot. I thought Devin made a
great play where he got in the paint late and kind of was stuck in there, and
Jalen kind of snuck underneath and got a little foul on a layup. And we just
made timely plays at the right time.  
  
And that's players making plays. That's -- a coach, you call a play but in the
end the players have to make the plays. And so they made their coach look good
today because they made enough of them where we came out with a victory.  
  
Q. Is that a game that maybe you wouldn't have won earlier in the
season? Did you see some growth maybe today that you hadn't seen before and
just toughness and resilience?  
COACH DUTCHER: Yeah, I think everybody knows the back half of the conference
season we've been a pretty good basketball team.  
  
And it doesn't mean we've won all the games. But we played pretty good
basketball. And I think a big factor to this game -- I don't know what Nathan
played. I think Nathan only averaged like nine minutes in the game in the
first two Nevada games because of foul trouble and maybe his bad back.  
  
But he was out there 25 minutes. And maybe it's not reflected in a lot of the
numbers, but his presence in there made a difference, though.  
  
I liked the fact that we could keep Nathan out there a lot in this game.
That's something he didn't do earlier in the season. We're playing good
basketball right now. What that will mean tomorrow, I don't know. Other than
the fact we will compete at a high level. And if we do enough right things,
we'll give ourselves a chance to make it back to the NCAA Tournament again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Dane Kuiper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36800)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 91, New Mexico - 83  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico head coach Paul Weir and student-
athletes Anthony Mathis and Corey Manigault. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
Q. It's been a heck of a ride a part of the coaching change. I know
you've been asked this a lot in Albuquerque, it's come to an end. It's been a
wild ride with the coaching change, new coach, all that kind of stuff. I'm
curious, did that game have the feel like it was going to be the end?  
ANTHONY MATHIS: Not at one point in the game did I think we weren't going to
win that game. It's just how confident I am in my team, my coaches and my
teammates. I truly thought we had what it took to pull that game out.
Unfortunately the cards did not fall in our favor. And it hurts for that to be
it.  
  
Q. Dane, any thoughts about that being it?  
DANE KUIPER: No thoughts at all. Utah State played a hell of a game. They hit
their shots at the end. And we couldn't execute at the end. They deserved it
tonight. But I had no doubt in my mind that we could pull out that game.  
  
Q. If you both had that feeling then that was the type of game that you
could win, I'm curious throughout the course of this season how often you had
that feeling. There were a lot of games that ended up being blowouts and bad
losses. Why couldn't you do what happened tonight when it all came together,
why wasn't that this season for you?  
DANE KUIPER: We never at one point went into a game and thought we were going
to lose it. We just had troubles connecting as a team throughout the season
and it all came together at the end for the last two games we played and
that's about it.  
  
ANTHONY MATHIS: Yeah, I just feel like this tournament we were really
connected. You could really tell that everybody was playing for one another,
because if you didn't play for one another it was going to be the end of the
road.  
  
And at times during the season I felt like when we ran into our bumps in the
road we were just playing selfish, trying to be stat-sheet stuffers and doing
our own thing. That obviously doesn't work as we learn the hard way. But I
truly feel like this tournament we bought in for one another.  
  
Q. Do you then take this tournament, a run against a co-champion like
that, a game that's been the best game of the tournament so far, do you take
something from that? Is it almost more frustration that's what the season
could have been? Or what are you walking away here tonight feeling?  
ANTHONY MATHIS: Just that I have a lot of work as an individual basketball
player. And there's so many more things that I could have done for this team
to make it a successful season that I didn't do. And it's just a learning
experience that I'll take for the rest of my life.  
  
DANE KUIPER: I have a lot of work to do, too, but I think it's more for the
guys that are staying. They just saw over two games what you need to do to win
with the way Coach wants to coach the team, and so I think that will help them
next year a lot.  
  
Q. Both of you guys I know have hopes to play somewhere beyond this. The
guys that are coming back next year, there are guys sitting out. Lobo fans
heard it last year going into this year. If you had one message to Lobo fans
that again turned out sub-.500 season, again showed up to Pit west in Las
Vegas, again led the league in attendance -- the fans are still showing up; if
you had one message to the Lobo fans who kept showing up for you guys even
during a bad year, what would it be about what next year's team can be?  
DANE KUIPER: Just never give up on anybody no matter how things are going. We
love the fans. They came out to every game. And we can't really thank them
enough for what they did. And if I could just say one thing is just never give
up on a team that you're supporting, because once you lose faith in them, they
lose faith in you. And it's all bad from there. So just keep supporting.  
  
ANTHONY MATHIS: The only thing I would say is it's a process. I mean everybody
-- we heard last year how great this team was going to be this year. It's
truly a process you're going to learn.  
  
It's just -- you just gotta keep believing. Obviously this year was not what
it was supposed to be. Like Coach said in the locker room, we had a big piece
of humble pie this year as individual players and as a team. And everybody has
a lot of work to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about the technical and the role it played
in the turn-about in the second half there?  
COACH WEIR: Yeah, from my vantage point I thought it went off Queta. I thought
Bob could have maybe, being beside me saw what I saw and kind of reversed the
call.  
  
There was a timeout in play. So the play was over. So I kept going on the
court. And he gave me a T for being outside of my box. I didn't think because
the game wasn't going on that the box still existed. But I guess it does. I
don't know the exact rule on that. Maybe he's right. I wasn't trying to get
one. I was just voicing my displeasure on a play. I think coaches get that way
a lot.  
  
Do I think that was the right time and place for that call to be made?
Probably not. But, hey, it's the call and I have to live with it. How much it
impacted the game, I don't know. We were obviously up at the time. I'd like to
say six, maybe eight, something like that.  
  
It could have had one, I guess. But I think those plays down the stretch in
the last two, three minutes to me were much more kind of pivotal.  
  
Q. You've forced them into 24 turnovers in the game, a season high. What
were you doing with the press in the first half that you might not have done
in the second half when they looked like they countered you a little bit?  
COACH WEIR: I think, to be honest with you, I kept telling the guys I think
they almost started to feel the gravity of the game. And I think we just got a
little bit more like lenient in it. And as the game went on, I wanted to do it
even more. And I just felt like -- and a lot of those possessions in the last
three, four minutes they were starting to feed the ball inside to Queta. They
were starting to run some offense. And that was never what we wanted to do.
But I think the gravity of the moment on the guys just kind of got to them a
little bit and we weren't continuing to try to pressure the way we were for
the first 36, 37 minutes.  
  
I thought Utah State, obviously they kept maneuvering around their press
offenses. Like, they kept adapting things. They started moving around
inbounders, getting guys on the run. Like they kept probing different areas to
get something. And they found a few here and there.  
  
So I thought they did a good job of constantly evolving. But I thought we put
our foot off the gas at the time when you put the pedal to the metal, so to
speak.  
  
Q. First and foremost, I wanted to give you an opportunity to talk about
the two men that just left. Can you say a couple things about the seniors?  
COACH WEIR: I just told the guys I think we all went into the year wanting
Dane and Anthony to be a part of this rebuilding process, turning the corner
and being a part of something really fun. I think the expectations we all
probably bought into a little bit.  
  
The unfortunate part now is I hope they're going to look back 24 months from
now, 48, however many years from now, and say, hey, like I was a part of that.
I was a part of this thing getting started and this thing growing into what we
want this program to be.  
  
And the class with which they handled themselves in the midst of that is
beyond admirable. They are two exceptionally talented young men way outside of
basketball. They're talented people who are going to be successful at no
matter what they do. And I look very forward to the friendships I'm going to
have with them for hopefully the rest of my life.  
  
Q. Question about the fouls, Carlton Bragg, who sat out with foul
trouble in the first half -- the foul disparity continued to grow in the
second half. Once you got the fourth foul on Sam Merrill, just a question, did
you have any thought of attacking him to try to get him out of the game?  
COACH WEIR: We've looked at that a little bit this year. We've done some
things here and there. Sometimes when we try and do too much of that, we turn
it over. And we did a pretty good job of taking care of the ball tonight and
doing that in the flow of the game as opposed to, like, let's go do this, and
everyone stand around while we try and get a foul.  
  
And I thought we were doing a pretty good job of just picking them up on the
right guys at times. We went at guys at certain times. But sometimes when we
do too much of that, it just really ruins our offensive flow.  
  
Q. What did you learn this year? You had a season of expectations and
you thought pretty highly of this year's potential, too. And I'm curious
either what went wrong or what you learned along the way that maybe next year
we might see differently?  
COACH WEIR: I just told the guys -- I mean, I'm a younger guy to a lot of
people, but I'm probably an older guy to them. Everything that's happened
poorly in my life I would never take back, because it allowed me to get to
where I am today. And I told the guys we can sit here and look at this season
as a disappointment or this game as a disappointment or individual players
being disappointing, or you're going to look back at it one day and say, man,
that's what was made me great or what made me do this.  
  
And I said that's the only thing hopefully we can take from this of. The only
two that have to pay this price are Dane and Anthony because they wanted to
feel us turning the corner in their senior years. But unfortunately they
didn't quite get it. And hopefully they'll be able to look back with
satisfaction and say I was there on the ground floor as something that turned
out to be pretty special.  
  
Q. And maybe more specific to on the court as opposed to those big
picture things, you built a culture a year ago, third-place finish, picked
ninth, third-place finish, go to the championship high, on high-pressure
defense, full court press, man, man defense, firing up a bunch of 3s. This
year you changed that three, four different times man. You went from man to
stop pressing. You went to zone, did a lot of changes. Do you regret not
sticking with what the culture seemed to be built as one year ago?  
COACH WEIR: I've gone back and forth on that since we went to it. To beat the
No. 6 team in the country playing zone and doing what we did there, it's hard
to look back and say, damn, Paul, you really made the wrong decision here.  
  
At the end of the day, it was Chuck Daly, shooting makes up for a multitude of
sins; if you really look at our year, the reality is we just didn't shoot the
ball well. And last year I think we had six guys, 35 percent or above from
three. And this year we had two. And I didn't anticipate that. I don't think
those players anticipated that.  
  
We brought in and brought back a lot of guys that could shoot, and quite
frankly we just didn't shoot the ball well this year. And I think that ended
up exacerbating the rest of our issues with maybe foot speed or style or
whatever. And if we had made more shots, I think a lot of things would be
better.  
  
So that's on me obviously as a coach. That's something about evaluation, about
recruiting, about training, about development; for it to have that many guys
kind of fall off percentage-wise in a single year is something I have to like
really reevaluate and make sure going forward either, A, we're robust enough
to be able to withstand that; and then, B, not actually have that happen.  
  
Q. Did these last two games reaffirm for you that you can play your
style with this group and the additions that will come in that this is the way
we're going to play?  
COACH WEIR: I told the guys before the tournament I thought we were the
luckiest team in the tournament because of the two teams we were going to
play. I've never talked about the next game after the game were playing, but
it's the one time I said, guys, here's the two teams we're playing, and here's
how we're going to go beat them. I thought for these two particular teams we
could definitely have done that.  
  
I don't necessarily feel that way about the entire conference. There's some
other teams in this conference -- if we played Fresno, if we played Vegas, if
we played some other teams -- I don't know if I necessarily would have felt
that way. But eventually I'd like to get to a way that we feel that way no
matter who we play.  
  
Unfortunately I would have liked that to happen this year but it didn't quite
happen unfortunately.  
  
Q. And the way Vance played the last two games, I mean, is this
something that he can carry over with confidence and go I can really do
this?  
COACH WEIR: I hope so. I think the great thing about it was Vance was playing
the 4 pretty much the entire tournament. And I think coming in and him and
people around him, where he's going to play and what he's going to do, the
great thing about it from me was that he had a lot of good things happening
from that 4 spot and hopefully that's a position he'll be able to grow in and
develop in and thrive in as well.  
  
Q. What do you think brought that out from Vance Jackson during the last
two games? And how do you coach it so he can have that type of energy for the
regular season?  
COACH WEIR: I thought he had great matchups at the 4. I thought Thompson was a
really good matchup for him against Wyoming. They played a bigger lineup to
kind of match our rebounding. I thought he had a really good matchup. And I
thought he had some good matchups again tonight as well at times. When he gets
into trouble is when he's on the perimeter trying to be a perimeter player
against smaller perimeter guys.  
  
So with Vance it's all about the matchups. It's been something I've been
trying to stress to him all year and we've been stressing over all, not just
to him to Makuach and to Anthony and to Corey, you name it, just reading your
matchup and knowing what that skill set is.  
  
When he gets a good matchup he's a good player. When he gets a bad matchup
he's like a lot of players; it's not always going to work out great.  
  
Q. How much do you talk to your team about officiating calls and
especially when it's clear the fans don't agree with a lot of them and you
don't agree with them either?  
COACH WEIR: I didn't bring them up once to the guys. I don't. I'd be lying if
I said I wasn't just crushed. It was 6-0 and I was mesmerized by what I was
watching. But it's never something I would take to the guys. That's something
they don't need to concern themselves with.  
  
I wasn't trying to get a technical foul, quite honestly. There were times when
I maybe felt like it but I didn't. It is what it is. Queta has earned the
right for those calls. Merrill has earned the right for those calls. They're
great players on a great team and they earn the right to kind of get the calls
they do. Carlton, I love him to death. Our guys, I love them to death; they
just haven't earned that credibility yet to get those 50/50 breaks with
officials.  
  
Q. Utah State had a lot of turnovers tonight. What can you say about
your team's defense?  
COACH WEIR: We had 30 deflections at half. I think we had 50 for the game.
That was what we wanted to do. I thought it was a really good matchup for us.
I really thought we could win this game. I felt that all week going into it. I
felt like these two teams playing this style I genuinely felt like we could
come away with them.  
  
But Utah State played like a champion. They were terrific. They were terrific
down the stretch. They made free throws, made big shots. They made enough
stops when it counted late. That's what great teams do that we could not do.  
  
Q. Just in retrospect, looking back when JaQuan Lyle got hurt, could
have been one of the best players in the league, how did that throw you off
kilter, or did that throw you off course before the season?  
COACH WEIR: Yeah, I think I said it when it happened. At the time I thought
the biggest place we were going to feel it was offensively. He was our
emergency point guard. He was our best passer. He was going to be a guy that
could really glue us together offensively. And I didn't think defensively it
would make a huge impact.  
  
And I think early on we were still okay offensively. But as the season went on
and people figured our guys out, figured out individually who could do what
and scouting kind of improved, it really exposed our passing, our guard play,
the depth at point guard, things like that.  
  
So I think unfortunately it ended up having a bigger impact than I ever would
have wanted. But, hey, like I told the guys, everything happens for a reason.
No matter what that happens to be, we learn from it. We grow from it. And
hopefully it will just make us stronger next season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Craig Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13780)

### [Sam Merrill](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34901)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 91, New Mexico - 83  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State head coach Craig Smith and student-
athletes Justin Bean and Sam Merrill.  
  
COACH SMITH: First, give credit to New Mexico. I thought they played a heck of
a game. They made a lot of plays and they made it very, very difficult for us.
They're incredibly talented. They're long. They're athletic. There's not much
they don't have.  
  
And so obviously they've kind of changed their style of play throughout the
course of the year. And certainly seeing them against Wyoming last night, we
figured they would pick us up full court like they did the first half at their
place. And we really handled their press well there.  
  
Obviously it wasn't so well tonight. But that was a big credit to them. They
really sped us up. We hadn't played in nine days. Our break was longer than
our Christmas break. And I thought we showed a little rust with that.  
  
Then the other part of it, I didn't help our guys enough with our press break.
We made a couple of adjustments at halftime that I thought really, really
helped. We had 15 turnovers in the first half and nine the second half, two in
the last eight minutes. And that's normally -- we really handled the ball well
and take good shots.  
  
But they got up by eight and our guys just were in the huddle. We've got to
find a way to win; we've got to find a way to win. And give our guys credit.
We stayed in attack mode. We had foul issues all night long. We had four guys,
three guys with two fouls in the first half, and Sam picked up his third with
about a minute to go, picked up his fourth with about eight to go. We just
kind of had to keep negotiating that whole thing.  
  
So at the end of the day you find a way to win. This is March Madness. You'll
get everybody's best shot because nobody wants to go home and everybody kind
of resets their record and resets their mindset and so forth. So we're
fortunate to pull out that victory.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Sam, seems whether it's the NCAA Tournament or conference
tournaments, a high seed tends to get a scare early from a school, like,
that's seeded lower than them, then goes on to make a deep run into the
tournament. Do you feel like that this was that game for you and you'll make a
deep run into the finals or even further?  
SAM MERRILL: We sure hope so. Like Coach said, obviously we showed a little
bit of rust and felt like we only had 24 turnovers compared to how we felt. I
felt like we had 35, 40 turnovers. But like Coach said, New Mexico is a good
team. They've obviously had their ups and downs this year.  
  
But at their best, they're a really tough team to beat. And we saw that
tonight. I thought our crowd was awesome. I thought New Mexico's crowd was
incredible. Give them credit -- 7 seed, they didn't have the year they wanted
and they still show out and had three, 4,000 fans.  
  
They deserve a lot of credit and our fans do as well for how much they helped
us.  
  
But you know, we're grateful that we were able to come out with a win tonight
and we'll focus on whoever is next, whether it be Fresno or Air Force.  
  
Q. Bean, might have been your best game of the season, 14 points, 15
rebounds, both career highs. How are you able to bring the energy throughout
the entire game when you were facing like a really difficult press that New
Mexico is giving you guys?  
JUSTIN BEAN: I think what speaks wonders, not just to my performance tonight
but this team is that we weren't very smart today, obviously, in the first
half.  
  
We didn't play our basketball, turning the ball over more than we usually do.
But things that usually don't show up in the stat sheet are toughness and
grit. And this team has that. So I think we collectively as a team did a great
job just not giving up.  
  
Credit to my teammates, they did a great job -- I tried to make good cuts to
the basket and try and fly around the rim and they were able to give me some
good passes so I could go up and finish.  
  
Q. Merrill, 23 points, nine assists. Coach mentioned the four fouls you
had to play with the last part of the game. How have you balanced your
aggressiveness, your ability to get your teammates involved with knowing you
had to be careful with the foul situation?  
SAM MERRILL: That's the first time in a while that I've been in foul trouble.
But our coaches do a great job no matter who is on the court, no matter who is
guarding who of putting us in positions to succeed. To be honest, it felt like
we were on defense almost the entire game. This was a football game, they
would have completely dominated time of possession.  
  
Coach told us to stay on attack, stay on attack. And even though we had 24
turnovers, we got a lot of really good looks and got a lot of shots at the rim
and obviously shot a ton of free throws. And that's partially because of the
way they played and partially because the attack mode we were in. So thought
it was, aside from the turnovers, I thought we got a lot of good shots and
that helped us.  
  
COACH SMITH: On a side note, I'm proud that Sam used the football reference.  
  
JUSTIN BEAN: I'm a football guy, too.  
  
COACH SMITH: The Saints, how did they do?  
  
SAM MERRILL: They did better the Vikings.  
  
COACH SMITH: I know.  
  
Q. What did you guys do in the second half to really exploit that press
a little bit better? New Mexico's coach said you switched some things a little
bit in the second half to do some things a little bit better offensively?  
JUSTIN BEAN: Coach Smith at halftime, like you said, he drew up some good
plays for us to have more -- we needed more urgency, that was the first thing.
We couldn't be scared. That's what he told us. Don't hide from the ball. Make
sure you flash. Help our guys out, especially Abel Porter, who had most of the
weight on his shoulders bringing the ball up. He had a couple of good plays
that he drew for us that we practiced and worked on, and we were able to
execute them and really attack the middle.  
  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, Coach just reminded us who we are as a team, and obviously
we didn't play like that in the first half. But he just continually reminds us
to play with poise and confidence. Aside from the X and Os adjustment he made,
more so it was a mentality, like Justin said, of coming to the ball, being
aggressive, being on attack mode, and that's what helped us out the most.  
  
Q. Sam, I know it could be either Air Force or Fresno State. I'm curious
-- I'll ask you about the games you played during the regular season with the
Bulldogs. Why do you think those games were so intense, so nip and tuck and
they both came down to the wire? What made those such good games between you
guys?  
SAM MERRILL: I think both teams are really good. Fresno poses a lot of
challenges to us. And they obviously have really good guard play with Braxton
and Deshon. But they really do a good job of spreading teams out and we
struggled at times with that. Did better at it at other times. But they can
really shoot it. They've got a lot of guys that can shoot it. They play with
good pace. They're really well-coached offensively. They get a lot of good
shots. If it does come to be them, I anticipate another fun game.  
  
Q. Sam, you said before that you want to erase any doubt and win this
thing, so Selection Sunday is easier. What do you think a win like this does
to your chances? Do you like your chances regardless what happens from here on
out?  
SAM MERRILL: Like I said last week, you never know what's going to happen. So
we have one goal for this weekend and that's to win the whole thing. And it
wasn't pretty. But we're one step closer.  
  
So every win, I think, will help our resumé. So we're going to go try to win
tomorrow and not only will that help our resumé, but that will get us one step
closer to winning the tournament. That's our main goal right now.  
  
Q. Coach, I think it was around the 15:08 mark you called a timeout. It
was on that run they made back-to-back 3-pointers. What did you talk to the
guys about in the huddle to get them to rally and make the run they eventually
did?  
COACH SMITH: Well, two things, we talked about NBA, and NBA a lot of people
think is National Basketball Association. And for us NBA means next best
action. When you get to tournament play and March Madness and this and that,
it's always about the next best play.  
  
And then the second thing, and we've been saying this from day one, is you've
got to earn it. You've got to earn respect. You've got to earn victory. You've
got to earn everything in life.  
  
And they got up eight and they made their run and now it's our time to fight
back. And it's a 15-round heavyweight fight. And so they won round, what,
eight, nine, and 10 so let's win 11 through 15. And let's be the last man
standing.  
  
Q. Sam and Coach, we talked before the season about how excited you
were, how everybody was just bought in. How good does it feel now to be where
you are and be able to kind of tell people we weren't just saying words, that
we knew what we were talking about?  
SAM MERRILL: It feels good internally as a team. We've obviously made a lot of
progress throughout the year. And for good reason expectations weren't super
high, like I've said before, before the season from the outside. But we felt
like our culture and our identity would win us a lot of games. And I think it
really has.  
  
We're not the most athletic team in the world. To be honest, we're not the
most skilled team in the world, but we have things you can't measure, like
Justin said, like toughness grit, heart. We really played well together as a
team. It's been a really fun run so far and we are hoping it keeps going.  
  
Q. With the foul trouble you got into today, I noticed a lot of
frustration from you. Is that frustration about the calls or were you
frustrated with yourself?  
SAM MERRILL: Just I'm trying to be on the court as long as I can.  
  
COACH SMITH: He didn't play five minutes tonight. That's five times as much as
last four games. He should be well-rested tomorrow.  
  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, just every game has calls that go your way and calls that
don't. But, like Coach said, we just try and focus on the next best action and
move forward from there.  
  
Q. Knowing that you have the depth that you do so that even when there
is foul trouble you can have someone on the court that you trust. How much
does that mean to you as the MVP, as the fans were calling you?  
SAM MERRILL: I mean, there's been multiple times this year where I've been out
of the game and we've gone on runs. So personally I'd like to be out there.
But I have all the confidence in the world. And we as a team, like I said, we
play as a team and we're not focused on one guy. So whoever is on the court,
we're going to stick together and try and do things the right way.  
  
Q. Justin, can you talk a little bit about the free throws at the end?
You haven't been -- at the end of games you haven't been there?  
SAM MERRILL: Almost airballed one.  
  
JUSTIN BEAN: There wasn't any pressure. That's why I missed that one. Yeah,
I've always felt like I was a confident free throw shooter. Like you said,
there hasn't been many opportunities. I can think of maybe Nevada late in the
fourth quarter a couple minutes left, I was able to hit a couple that pushed
us up again by four. But it was a similar situation.  
  
So I think that mentally really prepared me for that. And so, yeah, I was able
to just be poised. I saw my family just sitting in the right section of the
bleachers. And so that always helped, too, having them here from Oklahoma. And
my teammates as well. They just kept telling me knock these in. So their
confidence as well as Coach's meant the world to me and so I was able to get
it done.  
  
Q. Diogo Brito in the second half was amazing, 14 points. He had a
really important steal there at the end on a 3-point attempt. His first half
performance was nowhere near that level. What happened at halftime? Did you
guys say something to him? What was he like at halftime that kind of maybe
changed his attitude a little bit?  
SAM MERRILL: He would be the first to admit he didn't play well in the first
half. But I think this -- that's the identity of our team. No one's yelling at
Diogo for his turnovers, besides maybe Coach. But as a team we're just
constantly trying to focus on the next play, the next play. And Diogo has been
so big for us all year. But especially throughout this stretch run.  
  
So we have all the confidence in the world in him and in the rest of the team,
and he was like I said he was awesome and huge for us in the second. Hit a
couple of big 3s, couple big steals and that was big for us.  
  
JUSTIN BEAN: I agree with what Sam said. Real quick, Diogo he's the next best
action guy. He's not too worried with -- when he makes mistakes. He's always
looking to the next play. What I love about him he's always trying to help the
team collectively and tell the next guy you've got this, if we make a mistake.
He's always comforting or trying to motivate them to do better. So it's a
great thing about Diogo.  
  
Q. Coach, New Mexico opens up an eight-point lead in the second half.
And then Coach Weir picks up a technical foul, you score four straight. Seems
like that was a little bit of a turning point in the game. How do you feel
like that specifically impacted the second half and impacted the game?  
COACH SMITH: Anytime you can go on a 4-0 run, anytime you can put a string
together of stop and score, stop and score, that's huge. I'm not sure exactly
what happened. But obviously he got the T. Sam made both free throws. We ran a
baseline out-of-bounds play. Sam had a clean look at it, missed it. I don't
know who got the offensive rebound but I know we scored off of that.  
  
So it's such a fine line. Division I men's basketball, it's amazing with the
3-point line how quick things can change. We experienced that in a major way
both ways, against Colorado State at the end, but we flipped the script at
Boise in winning a game like that.  
  
It's just a fine line of winning and losing, but I think you said it was eight
and we cut it to four in a matter of whatever, ten seconds. So those are big
momentum plays. But obviously New Mexico played really, really well and we
kept coming back and they would answer the bell. And they would come back and
answer the bell.  
  
And then we were just able to make just one more play. We were up one -- I
think we were up three and then they score, and then we were up one, and we
run a play. And it was kind of -- Abel made a good decision and got it to Sam
and it was a play where Sam just had to make the right decision.  
  
And depending on if they stunted at him, Sam would get a clean look. If they
didn't -- they rotate to him and he goes one more. That's the story of our
team.  
  
Sam is such -- eight assists tonight, nine assists. Sorry, Sam. And 23 points.
And just makes the right play and goes one more. And like you said with Diogo,
drills that 3 in the right corner, and that was a big dagger, most definitely.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little, what is your assessment of how you guys
responded to New Mexico's defensive pressure? Because you had about 19
turnovers in the first half, I think. And also could you talk a little bit
about your center defensive play? There seemed to be a lot of defensive
tussling going on between your center and New Mexico's big men?  
COACH SMITH: The first part, we had 15 turnovers in the first half. And like
Sam said, it felt like 25. And, first of all, they did a great job. They
really sped us up.  
  
We were on our heels, clearly. And in the second part with that, like I said
earlier, I didn't have our guys in the right positions. So we made some
adjustments at halftime and changed -- we have a bunch of different press
breakers, but we started utilizing a couple other ones that we should have
been in earlier, quite frankly.  
  
So we weren't -- as a coaching staff, I didn't think we set our guys up to
have success. And it's a player's game. Players got to make plays. At the same
time coaches have got to put guys into positions to make plays.  
  
So we had nine in the second half, I think two in -- nine turnovers -- two in
the last I think last eight minutes including the one with 12 seconds to go.
So they did a good job.  
  
And the other part of that, I don't want to make it a bigger deal -- but when
you don't play for nine days in basketball, like that's a long -- that's a
long break. And on the flip side, New Mexico played three games.  
  
So as we all know basketball is a rhythm game. And they sped us up. Second
part, Neemias Queta is a big time player. It's hard to believe that he's still
a true freshman at 19 years old. So obviously he was named the Freshman of the
Year in the Mountain West Conference and the Defensive Player of the Year in
the Mountain West Conference. He's a force to me. Six blocked shots tonight,
played 35 minutes.  
  
He had that look in his eye. He really wanted it. And he was a very, very
determined individual that wants to be coached. And a lot of guys say they
want to be coached but then you get critical of them and then they don't want
to be coached. And Neemias, he wants to be coached and he wants to be special.  
  
All three games when we played these guys, including tonight, it's been a
fistfight. Literally that first game in New Mexico, Bragg was big time down
there. He made I think four 17-foot jumpers. When he gets in a groove --
there's a reason he was at Kansas to start.  
  
And they do, like I said at the top, they're so athletic. They have great
size. And they sub one big guy out and here comes the next one. And here's the
next one.  
  
And they're all 6'10" and sturdy and athletic. But it's been a physical
battle. And you know in March it's always going to be physical.  
  
Q. Despite the 24 turnovers, you held them under 40 percent shooting.
You shot 53 percent. How are you able to settle into your style of play as the
game went on?  
COACH SMITH: We just kept chopping wood. I know it's an analogy that our local
guys have heard us say, but you can't knock down a tree with one big swoop of
an axe. You've got to keep on chopping and chopping and chopping and
eventually it should fall down. And at the end of the game we got six of eight
stops to finish the game. Yes, six of eight stops to finish the game. Bean
ending possessions.  
  
It was a difficult -- do we play big for us, meaning like Quinn at the 4,
Neemi at the 5, Bean at the 4. We went a little bit where we had the four
guards in there but not very much. But then Bean, we were ending possessions.  
  
This is a team, New Mexico, that was averaging 17 offensive boards a game over
the last five games. So just we had to have some level of physicality. And
Justin Bean is just a magnet to the ball.  
  
So fortunately as a coaching staff our guys have really bought into the
defensive side of it. Last year our program was at -- we were at the bottom or
very near the bottom in basically every defensive stat, statistical category
you can imagine.  
  
So for us to end the game with six out of eight stops and have a plus-18
rebounding margin, 46 rebounds to their 28, I think really speaks volumes to
the buy-in that our guys have had. And what we've done all year.  
  
We're the number one defensive rebounding team in the country this year. We
finished the regular season as the number one defensive rebounding percentage
defense and number four in two-point field goal percentage defense. So we're
top five in both of those categories. It's only been done four times since
2002. So the proof is in the pudding.  
  
Q. Was there any point in this game that you thought maybe the team had
gone into it too confident or overly confident?  
COACH SMITH: Listen, New Mexico, we've had -- I mean, that game down in the
pit was crazy. We knew this was going to be a dogfight. We've had very good
practices coming into this, like I felt good. Our guys have been locked in.  
  
This is a prideful team. They're not prideful in a bad way. I mean, this is a
team that has a bit of a chip on their shoulder. And there's been very, very
few games or even halves where we've had to kind of like rip them for this or
that or the other. And our constant is we show up ready to play. We have good
effort. We're really unselfish.  
  
So there was no figment of overlooking or anything. They had our respect,
without question. We knew -- we felt this could be this type of game.  
  
Q. You've said throughout the season that the goal for this team is to
win the Mountain West title. But you know that tournament play is far
different than just regular season.  
COACH SMITH: Absolutely.  
  
Q. What did you see tonight that helps you to believe that this team can
actually go and win the next two games and the Mountain West title?  
COACH SMITH: We found a way to win. I thought New Mexico was really, really
good tonight. And I've watched so many of their games, as obviously our staff
and our players. And they're incredibly talented. And like Sam said, our fans
traveled well and they had -- I mean, last night you're hearing the roars when
they were down 13 to Wyoming, and all of a sudden Jackson just kind of puts
them on their back.  
  
And I was up in the lobby, because our practice time was basically right after
their game. But it started early because the game went a little bit longer
than we anticipated. And all you could hear was the deafening roars up in the
corridor, or whatever you call, out by the concession stands.  
  
And so you could feel that tonight without a question. So tonight we obviously
found a way to win when things were not going great and things didn't look --
they looked a little bleak for us there for a stretch.  
  
But at the end of the day, our guys have great resolve. They have great pride.
They want to represent Utah State in the right fashion. They want to represent
the Mountain West Conference in a great fashion. And, listen, like after we
clinched the regular season title, or at least a share at Colorado State, when
you win a conference championship in the regular season, you go 15-3 -- we
started out conference play 1-2.  
  
So I think we've won 15 out of 16 now, eight in a row. You've got to battle
everything. You're battling sickness. You're battling travel. You're battling
your body not feeling well. You're battling six of our 12 guys that dressed
being true freshmen so they've never been here before. You battle all kinds of
things.  
  
So for us to be able to do that, it's given us incredible amount of confidence
that we can play with anybody in the country on any given night.  
  
Q. You mentioned the buy-in and some of those defensive statistics, how
they've flipped. How hard is that to do in one year with a coaching change?
And I guess how impressed are you with the guys of doing it so quickly?  
COACH SMITH: Literally -- I don't want to sound like a cliché, I literally
cannot give our guys enough credit. This is a team that returned four guys
that had ever averaged more than seven minutes a game in Division I
basketball: Dwayne Brown Jr., Sam Merrill, Quinn Taylor and Diogo Brito. And
Crew Ainge and Abel Porter were the two guys that averaged seven minutes a
game but they didn't play every game.  
  
So, like, that's a challenge. And those four guys have been tremendous leaders
for our guys. Quinn Taylor is like the Mr. Unsung Hero. The guy is like a
rock. He's the godfather or the grandfather, but his stable leadership for our
whole team, but especially Neemias Queta, when you have a freshman that can
literally -- I don't want to say look up to him, because Neemias doesn't look
up to a whole lot of people physically -- but he's been unbelievable for
Neemias with his mentorship and leadership and communicating and all that kind
of stuff, as have all our upper classmen.  
  
And our guys just kept chipping away. And you have a guy -- Sam's obviously
the player of the year and well-earned. But Sam is just so competitive.  
  
And what I was told when I first got hired is all that guy cares about is
winning, doesn't care about his stats, doesn't care about his numbers. He
likes to play, like he said, but the guy just wants to win.  
  
So when your most accredited -- he's a returning third-team all-league guy
from last year. He was the only guy on our team that's ever had anything like
that at this level. When you have a guy like that that's your hardest worker
and he's so selfless, so many times he could have forced tough shots or
whatever, but he just makes the right play, how contagious that is for your
program.  
  
And not only that, he wants to guard the other team's best player every night,
best perimeter player. So the buy-in has been incredible and the leadership
has been incredible. And so I can't just speak highly enough to those guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 77, Boise State - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State head coach Leon Rice and student-
athletes Derrick Alston and Justinian Jessup. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH RICE: It was a good battle. I was proud of the way our guys competed.
It's been a rough year. And they never ever, ever wavered in how they
competed. And I told them I was really proud about that because that didn't
look like a team that had the record that we had.  
  
It looked like a high-level basketball team against a really good basketball
-- high-level basketball team against a really good basketball team. We didn't
get the results we wanted, but it doesn't mean I'm any less proud of them.  
  
Q. When you see the way you're up 15 in the first half and playing like
that against them, just knowing how talented you guys are, and then you
mention the record you have, I don't want to say this to make you think,
"where did it go wrong," but when you look at how good they could have played
and obviously did tonight, what does that make you think about where the
season could have gone if you did something different here or there?  
COACH RICE: You can't do that. You just -- every game is its own entity. And
the season's a long season. The thing I'm proud of is the progress we've made.
We're a lot better team than we were in November. We were a bad basketball
team, to be honest.  
  
And at the end, I think we played a lot of good minutes. We didn't get near
the results we wanted, not even close for this program. But I knew that you
weren't going to knock Nevada out in the -- it's going to take five punches,
five times putting them to the canvas not -- I think Evan asked me at halftime
about their comeback. Of course they're going to -- you're not going to beat
them in the first half.  
  
They're a really, really good team, and they're a team of historically big
runs. That's what they do because of the way they play offense because they
can make a bunch of hoops in a row and they can stop you.  
  
So credit Nevada. They didn't fold. But, again, that's something I've ever
seen them do. They'll compete right to the whistle or the final buzzer. And we
knew we had to and these guys certainly did that.  
  
Q. I was going to say you didn't fold either. There were a couple times
in the second half they'd go up by seven or eight and every time you guys came
back would take the lead. To see the fight, like you said, in a season that
has gone like this, to see them literally going toe to toe with them with
three, four minutes left in the game, what were your thoughts on that?  
COACH RICE: That's the character of these guys. And the three of us were just
talking, I don't think I've ever -- usually you get done with the season just
exhausted and worn out and been through the battles. But I don't think I've
ever been more excited for -- let's start tomorrow. Let's go.  
  
Broncos are going to be back because of the character of guys we have and the
guys we have redshirting and the guys we have coming in. The Broncos are going
to be back. Like I said, I don't remember when I've been more excited for a
season to start. Usually it's like, okay, let me catch my breath and move on.  
  
But, no, I want to go play with these guys again right now and I want to get
those redshirts off redshirt, and I want to get the new guys that are coming
in here, and I want to go get this team back where it belongs and this program
back where it belongs because I know we're going to get there because the
backbone of these guys, how good they played in the last month of the season
-- I mean, if you watched us, you know what I have here are two really, really
special players. And then I've got like I said I've got a lot of them waiting
in the wings. And the Broncos are going to be back. We're excited to go.  
  
Q. Derrick, earlier in the year a lot of us were wondering who would
take over the role of Chandler Hutchinson. He took a lot of final shots for
you guys, and Nevada had a lot of runs tonight, and you kept firing back. And
you hit a couple of big momentum-type shots. How much do you feel you've grown
in that capacity? And, Leon, after Derrick answers would you mind following up
your thoughts.  
DERRICK ALSTON: The year has been kind of crazy just taking it all in. I love
this game and I love my teammates. I love this program for giving me the
confidence to go out there do what I can do. So for me, I'm just out there
competing trying to win, just having fun.  
  
COACH RICE: I told Derrick, he's got special, special days ahead of him in the
game of basketball because he's hungry. Look at how much -- first time we
played him, he was a non-factor a little bit, or the second time. And look at
how much he's grown in the last month. And he's going to continue to grow.  
  
He's got the taste now. He knows what it takes. He knows why we're pushing
him. And he's matured over this year and become -- he's going to be -- like I
want these two to be two of the best players in the league. And I know they'll
push for it and I know they'll work for it. They're gym rats. They love the
game. They play for the right reasons. They've got great days ahead of them.  
  
And, again, that's what gets me so excited about it because I know these two.
I've had them for a long time. And they're going to be -- that's a heck of a
cornerstone for our program going forward.  
  
Q. To lose Zach Haney with 4:44 to go in the fourth quarter, how much do
you think that impacted the finish for your guys?  
COACH RICE: I don't know. I'd have to watch the film to figure that out. But
the shot Caleb hit with the contested 3, I think they were up 3, that's
vintage Nevada right there. That probably jumps out at me more than that.  
  
But it obviously didn't help because Zach's been scoring so well. So it takes
one of our weapons away and shortens the choices we had that we can make.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you wish you could just get started right away
right now. What positives would you say you take away from today's game?  
COACH RICE: Maybe not just today's game, but the positives are, hey, we had, I
think, most teams if they went through what we went through wouldn't have been
able to compete the way we did night in night out. I think we had maybe one
game where I would say, like, maybe one-half where I said we didn't just
compete at the highest level, and that wasn't the problem.  
  
And that takes character and that takes some toughness, because, hey, we got
our hearts ripped out many, many times. And we're going to be better because
of it.  
  
We had a team a few years back that had about the same record that we had and
then the next year went to the NCAA Tournament, and because of what we had to
go through together as a team. And I've seen this maybe even more growth out
of these guys than even that young team that we had back then.  
  
So I think that's my cause for excitement. Because when you got guys with
character and guys with toughness, you can hang -- that's what I always say
about Nevada. That's what they have. They have some guys that have big-time
toughness, big-time character. That's what Muss has hung his hat on. And
that's what I get to hang my hat on next year.  
  
Q. Derrick and Justinian, I asked Coach, but the way you battled back in
the second half and never really caved when there were chances where you could
have. What did you guys see from your team in the second half and not giving
up, despite how things had gone this year?  
DERRICK ALSTON: I just feel like the same all year. Like I said, we're going
to compete until the end no matter what. If we're up 10 or down 10 there's no
quitting in our group. And that's just something we've always had.  
  
Q. Justinian, how bright is this team's future?  
JUSTINIAN JESSUP: Very bright. I'm excited for next year. It's tough to have a
year like this, and lose so many close games. But I hate to, like, look ahead
right away after just coming off a loss like this, but, yeah, next year is
going to be big time. That's how I feel.  
  
Q. Justinian, how much do you feel that you kind of grew this year? I
know you're kind of known as being a quiet guy, but you played almost every
single minute over like the last month of the season. How much do you feel
like you maybe grew in some of your intangibles?  
JUSTINIAN JESSUP: Appreciate the coaches, like, giving the trust in me to go
make plays down the stretch. This year, honestly, it was kind of a trial by
error sort of thing, especially late in games.  
  
I failed a lot earlier in the season in those situations and as the season
progressed, I'd say I got better. I mean, there's still so much work to do.
I'm going to go back, evaluate what I've got to get better at.  
  
But in terms of growing and stuff, I think me and D.A. and Hobbs, a lot of
guys took big jumps this year. And we just gotta go back, evaluate what we can
get better at even more. And continue to get better.  
  
COACH RICE: I gave him a rest tonight. Remember I got him out.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Dave Pilipovich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23377)

### [Caleb Morris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36815)

### [Lavelle Scottie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34821)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 76, Air Force - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force head coach Dave Pilipovich and
student-athletes Lavelle Scottie and Caleb Morris. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH PILIPOVICH: First of all, a lot of credit to Fresno State. They were
really, really, really good defensively tonight. Their pressure was extremely
on point. They changed the game with their extended pressure from the full
court to the half court, forced us into turnovers and took us out of rhythm.  
  
And Deshon Taylor was really good. He's a redshirt senior guard. He really led
them, and so give them a lot of credit.  
  
On the other hand, proud of our group for what we've done, where we've been,
where we got to. And we talked at the four-minute media timeout, we talked to
our guys and we took Lavelle out and Ryan and our starters and talked about
where we've been, where we're at and now getting to that next step. And so
proud of us, what we've done, and give them credit as they move on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. What do you think happened to the energy after that quick start,
where you guys got up by 13-6? Obviously what made that so hard to sustain?  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: I believe the pressure kind of riled us up and they kind of
took us out of what we was doing initially. They showed up defensively and
that's why they was able to win the ballgame.  
  
Q. What did he talk to you about at that point and then what are you
guys already reflecting on from this season?  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: To reflect back, like he said, that's a good ball team. They
came defensively. We just have to grow from this, take out the positives as we
can. And a big emphasis, (indiscernible) timeout we've got to get stops and we
wasn't able to shut down Deshon Taylor.  
  
He's a good basketball player. He's been there before. He did a great job
leading his team and keeping them poised and stuff like that so you can learn
from that, I can learn from that.  
  
Q. I think in November or early December you said it doesn't just
happen; you don't just become a good team. No matter what you had coming back.
How do you spin this forward and prevent a step back and build from what you
guys did and do it at the start?  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: Positivity. I mean, you gotta fail to succeed. And this is
definitely one of the times we failed. And we're going to take the positives
out of it, grow and become better basketball players, come back next year with
a passion to -- we've got everybody returning besides one player. And that's a
lot of hope for us right there.  
  
So we're going to take all the negatives from this year and (indiscernible) of
it and come back and be a better ball team next year.  
  
Q. Caleb, obviously an up and down year until the last couple of weeks
and you finally found consistency. How do you take that forward now?  
CALEB MORRIS: I mean, just keep getting better every day, us as a team, me
individually, just another day, just keep -- another opportunity, just keep
getting better.  
  
Q. Does the summer after your junior year look a little different than
after your sophomore year? Will you see each other a little more, be able to
play and keep some of this continuity?  
LAVELLE SCOTTIE: We'll be able to see each other a lot during this upcoming
summer because we should all have the same summer schedule. At least we all
have to take two leadership positions over the summer. So that's going to
intertwine with each other. So we'll be able to play a lot of pick up stuff
like that, get a lot of workouts and lifts in. So this summer is the summer to
build and grow.  
  
Q. Dave, how important is it to you this summer? Because obviously
there's been a couple times where you've had a lot of guys coming back.  
COACH PILIPOVICH: This is a really good group. This group has done some things
with the wins we've had in the conference play, moving up to a 6 seed in the
tournament. The growth and development of these two along with the others in
the locker room, with the addition of some young men we have coming in from
our prep school. We've got some length, some athleticism. We've got some young
Lavelles and Calebs down there that are coming up. So we're excited about
that.  
  
We've got some really good pieces. Now, San Diego State has two guards who are
sitting out who are really good. Nevada probably just added a transfer today.
I mean, everyone's getting better. So -- Geoff Grammer's tweeting something.  
  
We love our group. We're going to make a commitment in the weight room. We'll
get a little bigger and stronger. We're going to do some workouts here,
hopefully our schedule will allow us to this summer, with our incoming players
as well as our returning players.  
  
And we've challenged our schedule, too, a little bit next year. We've got some
opportunities to play some different people, different places. It's going to
be a lot in our growth and our development. So we're excited about it.  
  
Q. A loss like this, is it easier to take because you know this season
was basically a stepping stone to next year?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: No, it's never -- you never want to end the season on a
loss, obviously. You want to play and keep playing and surviving and
advancing, but we played a really good team. I mean, a really good team. And
we beat this team at their place.  
  
I give a lot of credit to them. I told Justin as we shook hands, if they
defend like this they have an opportunity to win two more games. They were
really good defensively. I'm not saying we were really bad offensively. They
had a lot to do with it. Their length and their size and their quickness. They
were there.  
  
And if they can guard like that, that will be good for them in the next day
and next two days. So it's never a good loss when you lose, but we have really
grown. We have really grown. Look at where we were. We weren't ready to win
early, November, December. We grew and matured through that. We won at some
places.  
  
We beat the third-, the fourth-, the fifth-place teams in this league during
the regular season. We've won some games on the road that we haven't done. And
now it's now to take that next step and get to another day when we get here.  
  
Q. You touched on Fresno State maybe having the capability to win this.
In his first year at the helm, what's impressed you with the way that Justin
Hutson has handled the Bulldogs?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Let's talk about Justin. He's a good coach. When we talk
about first-year, it's not like he just decided to coach this year, right?  
  
He learned from one of the best in coach Steve Fisher in that San Diego State
program. And he was a big part of their success.  
  
I think he's an unbelievable coach. I think he's an outstanding person. And I
think he's done a great job with an experienced team and taken them to another
level.  
  
And it's been defense. Our room was next door to their room, our meeting
rooms, and one of their travel bags was sitting out. And on their Nike travel
bag the slogan on there said "defense travels." And it sure does when they
play and they play on the road.  
  
So let's give him a lot of credit and his staff and their players for
adjusting to a new coach and having the success they have this year.  
  
Q. If they happen to beat Utah State tomorrow and maybe fall to Nevada
in the championship game, do you think they're deserving of an NCAA bid?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: You know, I always think teams from our league are deserving
of postseason play. When we beat them at their place, their next game was at
Nevada and it was a one-possession game. I think they lost by six. But they
played extremely well. A bounce here or there, they could have won that game.  
  
If they get to that point, are they deserving? Yes. Will they get it? I'm not
so sure. There's so many things going on right now with teams winning and
losing and on the bubble. Gosh, we talk about the bubble in December anymore.
We haven't even put our Christmas tree up and we're talking about teams on the
bubble. I just hope they can continue to play well and have success in their
next two games.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 14, 2019

  

### [Eric Musselman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30554)

### [Jazz Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36765)

### [Tre'Shawn Thurman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36766)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 77, Boise State - 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nevada coach Eric Mussleman and student-
athletes Jazz Johnson and Tre'Shawn Thurman. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH MUSSELMAN: First, I'd like to compliment Boise State. I thought Coach
Rice did a phenomenal job. He had his team overly prepared with the short
turnaround. They played good on both sides of the basketball. I thought they
were really, really physical. They didn't back down from us at all. So just
want to compliment them. I thought they played as physical and as tough
against us as anybody during the year.  
  
But the thing with our ball club is down 15, no panic. It seems that we've
kind of been in those situations where we've gotten down and figured out a way
to come from behind on a big stage. And today was no different.  
  
I think the biggest thing for us is the two guys sitting next to me were not
part of last year's postseason success. And I think you're always, as a coach,
you're concerned/worried who's going to be able to produce in big moments. We
all know that Cody and Caleb Martin and Jordan will produce in big moments.  
  
And these two guys -- they did it at the end of the year against San Diego
State in the game that we had to win to get the No. 1 seed. And I thought
today, we don't even come close to winning today's game without Jazz and
Tre'Shawn not playing good but they played great. And we don't win today
without those two guys playing great.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Jazz, what was it about your play today? You were just on fire
defensively, offensively. Everything was clicking for you today.  
JAZZ JOHNSON: It comes down to Cody and Caleb. Everybody keys on them. So that
kind of leaves me as the X factor, me and Tre. They do a really good job of
trying to find me. I just stay prepared and I was shooting open shots. That's
what it comes down to is the big three did a really good job making sure they
were sharing the ball as well.  
  
Q. Down 15 at one point in the game. What do you feel you did
differently defensively to slow down Boise State and to kind of change the
momentum that first half?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: First of all, we stunk for 12 minutes. It was hard to watch.
I would have rather gone to the dentist and gotten some teeth pulled than
watch us on both sides of the ball.  
  
I thought halftime we were able to regroup a little bit. The guys were able to
get their minds clear. And I thought to shoot the ball 62 percent in the
second half, we just -- that's kind of last year, this year -- it's kind of
like when are we going to get hot?  
  
And in the three games that we've lost this year, we really haven't found that
spurt. And so the other 29 games we found a spurt at some point during the
game. And today in the second half I thought offensively we were phenomenal.
We did a much better job in the second half in our zone offense.  
  
I thought Tre'Shawn did a phenomenal job in the middle of the zone catching it
right at the sweet spot, right where that Mountain West logo was, and making
decisions either for himself or for teammates.  
  
Q. When you remember what happened in this last year's tournament is
that something you want your players to forget, or something you want in the
back of their minds to maybe even use as extra motivation this year?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Kind of a little bit of both. If you want to come talk to our
team tomorrow pregame you can because it sounds like you have some good
thoughts on motivation.  
  
I think both, though, in all seriousness. I think we want to remember that
last year we did not cut a net down here. The year before we won the regular
season championship and then followed it up with a tournament championship.  
  
And we certainly -- anytime they have a scoreboard you want to compete, you
want to play, you are here to win. Having said that the two teams about to tip
off right now are both really talented teams and they're well-coached and
there's not going to be anything easy about anything in this tournament. And
we knew that when we got on the plane from Reno to come here that every game
would be a big-time challenge.  
  
Q. Jazz, you played 37 minutes off the bench. You came in, you guys were
down early. You hit a couple big shots early to get you guys going. What's
your mindset coming off the bench when your team's down? Do you have a sense
of urgency to get things going or do you let the game come to you?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: It's definitely my job to get come of off the bench and give
our team a little spark.  
  
COACH MUSSELMAN: I don't know if 37 minutes is what a normal bench plays.  
  
JAZZ JOHNSON: Coach does a good job playing me.  
  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Now you get 38 tomorrow.  
  
JAZZ JOHNSON: If I play defense. It's really just I take pride in that being
my job, to give us a little spark because over the years we've had a lot of
slow starts. And so I've kind of taken on that role to come in and give us a
spark.  
  
Q. Tre'Shawn, what was it like to get your first taste of this
tournament and obviously have a big game?  
TRE'SHAWN THURMAN: It was fun because everyone's competing and a lot of
people, their lives are on the line. And a lot of teams, it could be the last
-- a lot of players, it could be the last time they put on that jersey. So we
have to come with the same mindset and mentality, and I think we did in the
second half today.  
  
But it was fun. And it's going to be a good one tomorrow. Like coach said,
both teams are well-coached you want to go against teams that are ready to
play and give their heart out.  
  
Q. Early on, they had a rebounding edge, and it turns out you guys win
the battle of the boards by eight. Was there an adjustment there? Was it
anything you could point to or positioning, anything you want to point out on
that?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: No, I just thought we were soft going to the backboards early
in the game. And they were physical. And, again, I think that I was really
impressed with how Boise came out from the beginning of the game trying to
take the game to us. And they got us on our heels a little bit. And certainly
the physicality on the glass was what we felt was a major issue for us.  
  
Q. How do you deal with the short turnaround? Is it more just focusing
on you guys as opposed to the opponent?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: I think we've done it in the past. And we'll watch some of
this game and go back and start our preparation as soon as we know who we
play. And everybody's going through the same thing at this time. So it's just
a matter of getting yourself mentally and physically ready.  
  
Q. Boise State came out; they hit their first four 3s. They went
4-for-13 after that. What were the adjustments you made to stop the 3-ball
from falling?  
COACH MUSSELMAN: Just no air space. Try to make them floor it, make them put a
ball on the deck. And we backed off too much, worried about the dribble drive
and we should have been worried about taking away the 3-point line.  
  
And I thought we did -- obviously we did a much better job as the game wore
on. And also, during one of the timeouts, we talked about they're not going to
keep shooting at this clip because the Golden State Warriors can't shoot at
that clip. So eventually those type of things start to even out as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Marvin Menzies](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20785)

### [Amauri Hardy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36780)

### [Joel Ntambwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36781)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 63, UNLV - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV head coach Marvin Menzies and student-
athletes Amauri Hardy and Joel Ntambwe. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH MENZIES: Let's begin with congratulations to Brian and his staff and the
players over in San Diego. I thought those guys played a gritty game and made
some runs, and they did the right things to keep the scoreboard in their
favor.  
  
Their defense was really good, as evidenced by our shooting percentage of only
32 percent. However, I thought our defense was really good as well. We held
them -- I don't think I've ever had a game where we held a team to under 30%
from the field and lost. So, this is unchartered waters for me. That's
amazing.  
  
But obviously the fouls were what they were. And getting to the free-throw
line made a significant difference, especially late in the game. And we're
just very disappointed as a team, as a staff, and as a men's basketball
program that we didn't come out successful. Thought we had enough weapons to
do it but they had a few more bullets tonight.  
  
So, we will open it up for questions at this point.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. When you're struggling to shoot like that, do you start pressing
after a while when they're just not going?  
AMAURI HARDY: For me personally I don't press after a while, being we was
getting stops. In a game like that, you just hope they fall and continue to
play hard and hopefully the shots fall in your favor.  
  
JOEL NTAMBWE: I think we played hard but they just made some big plays, and
they got the lead and won the game honestly. But at the end of the day we did
what we're supposed to do; we held them to shoot 29, or under 30 percent. We
did a good job, but they made big plays.  
  
Q. Amauri, what's it like to be in a game where you know the shots
aren't falling but you're one possession off in the entire game up to the
final bell. You were in the game, but the shots weren't falling. What was that
like?  
AMAURI HARDY: Stay the course, gotta stick together. Make sure we keep our
communication high for the most part. The game was fairly close. So I wasn't
really worried about my shots and I don't think my teammates was either. So in
a game like that you just gotta keep grinding until the clock go down.  
  
Q. Coming down the stretch there was a lot of emotion from Kris and
Noah. Once Coach addressed the team in the locker room, what was the message
from the seniors?  
COACH MENZIES: The seniors didn't talk in the locker room.  
  
Q. Devin Watson gets that three-point foul and you obviously know it on
film, seen it, played them twice on the pump fake that he does. How hard is it
as a player in that situation -- it's easy for us to sit there and go, why are
you fouling him with one second left? How hard is it and how good is that pump
fake because everybody seems to go for it?  
COACH MENZIES: Is that to me or who is that to? Joel had one where you caught
him. Can you answer that?  
  
JOEL NTAMBWE: I think we had a great scout on him. But he's such a good
player. He pump faked and I went for it. And they called a foul even if I
didn't foul. At the end of the day he's a great player, and he went on the
line and made his free throw.  
  
COACH MENZIES: We'll take a look at them. And I think the officials called a
good game. I thought they did a good job. I'd like to review those just for my
own professional edification, and then we're always trying to get better, both
the officials and the staff and the players.  
  
So that's a tough call because the guy, if he's come down and he's landed,
then he has the right to his verticality, the defender. If he's still in the
air and the offensive player creates the contact going forward, then he still
has his verticality. But he's not in legal guarding position until he lands,
which makes it a tricky call.  
  
We lost a conference championship on that same exact play against Utah Valley
one year when I was in the WAC. And it's a tough call. It's a tough call to
get on a player and it's a tough call to call as an official. So we all are
trying to do our best to do the right things, both sides of the coin.  
  
So there's nobody's fault and I think Joel nailed it. He's a good player and
he got guys up. Kept his butt down, got the ball above his shoulder and really
sold the shot. That's what makes it a good shot fake.  
  
Q. Coach had said he felt disappointed in today's game. Wondering what
your overall thoughts are on today's game and then what you're thinking about
next season, what's possible?  
AMAURI HARDY: We played a great game, like I said before. For the most part I
haven't really thought about really next year, trying to get over the loss
right now. But the future is bright for all of us. The future is bright for
Coach. Future is bright for me.  
  
Once again, we played this team again. We played them down to the nail and
unfortunately we couldn't get the win, but it is what it is.  
  
JOEL NTAMBWE: Actually, I haven't thought about nothing right now. So I'm just
going to let it be the way it is. We lost. I just gotta go back home and get
my mind right. And that's all about it and talk to the coaches and that's
pretty much it.  
  
Q. Is the most frustrating part for you just a basket here, a basket
there you probably win the game -- just all those missed opportunities?  
COACH MENZIES: Pretty much. Pretty much. Just a collective set of emotions,
you know, from seeing Noah and Kris leaving to just feeling bad for the guys,
you know, not playing well offensively. We just didn't put it all together. We
did some really good things.  
  
Man, these last games of the season are always tough. There's a lot of people
already eliminated. And we're one of those teams now. And it's a lot of
lessons and a lot of opportunity to grow and learn from, not just your season
but how to handle defeat when you lose too.  
  
We just want to make sure that the guys stay together and stay a brotherhood
and pick each other up and do the right things going forward. A great bunch of
kids. Class acts, you know?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 76, Air Force - 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State head coach Justin Hutson and
student-athletes Deshon Taylor, Nate Grimes and Aguir Agau. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH HUTSON: I thought our defensive intensity was another level tonight. We
picked up and we wanted to pressure them a little bit. And hats off to them.
They came in to Save Mart Center in Fresno and kicked our butt. And I think we
had our guys' attention.  
  
They're a great staff over there. What they run is very hard to guard. But I
was very proud of our guys paying attention to detail, what we were doing on
the defensive end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. How much do you think that performance on Saturday, seeing the ball
go through the hoop against San Jose State, and just kind of carried over
maybe to tonight?  
COACH HUTSON: You know, you guys ask me those things, and I don't know if they
really carry over or not to tell you the truth. I just know we try to practice
hard every day. And we come out and want to be confident every day.  
  
Braxton made 10 3s in that game and he didn't make many tonight. I don't know
about the carry-over. I just think we have a good team that likes to share the
ball. Deshon had 10 assists tonight and one turnover. When you do that and the
ball's moving I think we have a chance to make some shots.  
  
Q. You said you saw that the team ready to avenge that Air Force loss,
you had their attention with regards to that. When did you notice that, and
were you seeing different things in practice in the lead-up?  
COACH HUTSON: We've been practicing very well actually. But I do know there
was a little extra edge with it being the postseason and also with playing Air
Force who beat us at home.  
  
Q. Deshon, this being your last go-around here in the Mountain West
Tournament, just how dialed in or how focused in are you with regard to this
tournament?  
DESHON TAYLOR: I'm just taking one game at a time, but I feel that everybody
is really dialed in right now. And just trying to play as hard as we can every
night.  
  
Q. What was different about tonight as opposed to the Save Mart Center
when Air Force beat you?  
DESHON TAYLOR: Better defensive and I'd say better ball movement. We had 23
assists, nine turnovers. Last time at our place we didn't move our ball well
we had a lot of turnovers. That's what helped them get the win.  
  
Q. Aguir, you've been working on your shot?  
AGUIR AGAU: I have, yeah.  
  
Q. What happened tonight?  
AGUIR AGAU: Me and Coach Shelton, our assistant, we get in the gym every
single day and we work on pace and rhythm. That's what I focused on today when
I was shooting.  
  
Q. How good does it feel to see the ball go through the hoop like
that?  
AGUIR AGAU: It feels great. It feels great.  
  
Q. Deshon, one comment on Aguir. What could he mean to your team when
he's playing like that?  
DESHON TAYLOR: He means everything to us. When Sam got in foul trouble, he
come in and just played his game. I tell him to be confident in the game,
shoot the shots you shoot and everything will fall into place.  
  
Q. So, Utah State, you've won, both those games decided by two points
total this year. Why have those matchups been so competitive?  
DESHON TAYLOR: Two great teams. Just two great teams. Two well-coached teams
that try to go out there and win and it shows.  
  
Q. Aguir, you're long and you're lean, but when you go out to the arc
and you're draining 3s, you are giving space to Deshon, to Braxton. Deshon,
how big of a help is it when you have a guy like Aguir with his size being
able to draw the defense out to the arc?  
DESHON TAYLOR: That's kind of our whole team, everybody can shoot. Me getting
my guy involved as much as I can, opening the lanes for me and opening the
lanes for our other point guards as well.  
  
Q. Nate, big challenge going up to Queta tomorrow. What is the key for
you going up against a player that has that kind of size and mobility?  
NATE GRIMES: Go hard, just got to go hard. That's all it is.  
  
Q. Watching this game tonight and seeing Braxton Huggins having a tough
night, but it seemed more because of his defensive intensity was so deep, did
you guys find a different level going back to those last few minutes of the
San Diego State game where it looked like it was a loss and suddenly magic in
a bottle?  
DESHON TAYLOR: What do you mean?  
  
Q. What I mean is it seems like this team has taken the defensive
intensity that you have to a different level. And it seemed to go to that
level in those last couple of minutes in that San Diego State game.  
DESHON TAYLOR: I'd say scouting report, we've seen teams, when they press Air
Force, they kind of turn the ball a little bit. So we try to do the same thing
and it help us.  
  
Q. You're one of three coaches in the -- eight head coaches that coached
under Fish. What does that say about the impact he's had on this game?  
COACH HUTSON: For Coach Fish? He's a great man. He's a better than he is a
coach. And he's a really good coach. So I was happy I had a chance to work for
him and learn from him.  
  
Q. Could we see more of the press tomorrow? I know you don't want to
give away the game plan. But Utah State turned the ball over 24 times tonight
against the New Mexico press. Let me ask you this, how effective and how
different does your team play when it's pressing, getting out and running and
bringing that kind of intensity defensively?  
COACH HUTSON: It jump starts us a little bit more. Makes us play a little
harder at the start. We've had problems with bad starts before. We wanted to
put some pressure on Air Force and not be on our heels. We wanted to try to
put them on their heels. If we were a little deeper, we could do it a little
bit more. But we'll see tomorrow.  
  
Q. Just talk a little bit about that Utah State matchup. It's Friday
night; it's the Mountain West Tournament and you two guys have been nip and
tuck this year. What is it about these two teams that you guys seem to match
up with each other really well?  
COACH HUTSON: A lot of good players out on the floor. So it's a tough matchup
for both teams. And hats off to them. They've had a great season. Hats off to
our guys. We've had a good season. So it's going to be an exciting game
tomorrow.

### [Jalen McDaniels](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34927)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 63, UNLV - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State head coach Brian Dutcher and
student-athletes Jalen McDaniels, Devin Watson and Jeremy Hemsley. Coach, an
opening statement.  
  
COACH DUTCHER: First of all, I'd like to thank our Aztec fans. We travel well
and it makes a difference in a close game to feel like you have that kind of
support, that kind of enthusiasm behind you. And we have a great fan base and
it's great they were here, and I'm sure they'll be doubled by tomorrow. So
we're looking forward to getting more Aztec fans in this building for our next
game.  
  
The game was hard fought. When two opponents know each other this well then
it's going to be hard fought. Nothing came easy. Marvin had his team prepared.
They defended us as well as anybody defended us all year. We shot 29 percent
for the game, still managed to win.  
  
At halftime I was concerned that anybody other than the name McDaniels or
Watson was going to score a point. They scored every point but one for us in
the first half. And Jeremy Hemsley, who got to his spot all game long and
couldn't get anything to fall, maybe hit the biggest shot in the game when he
made that 3 when it was a tie game. He rolls up at the end of a shot clock and
made a huge 3, and that's what senior guards do. They step up when it's most
important. That's what Jeremy did. He was great all game at the defensive end
and stepped up with a timely 3.  
  
The biggest stat to me of the game, and I made a point of it at halftime. We
were down 11 rebounds at halftime. They had 10 offensive rebounds. We
outrebounded them by one for the game and they only had one offensive rebound
in the second half. So rebounding was the critical stat to the game in a hard-
fought game.  
  
Even though we didn't make baskets we found a way to fight our way to the foul
line. We shot great from the foul line. And rebounding the free throws was the
difference in the game for us. Excited to move on and an opportunity to play
Nevada for a third time this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. You guys have, I think, 15 out of 16 times, you've got so many wins
in this building not, only against them but in the conference tournament.
First of all, do you think you have a mental edge against UNLV? And also do
you think, is there something about this building that you just feel
comfortable?  
JALEN MCDANIELS: I feel like we've just got to play like this every game, just
playing hard and just executing and playing good defense and rebounding. I
feel that won the game. We're familiar with playing in here, and shout out to
our fans for traveling. And coming to feel like a home atmosphere here. So we
respect them for that.  
  
DEVIN WATSON: I definitely like playing in this gym. It's a great atmosphere
especially at this time. Yeah, it's just fun out there.  
  
COACH DUTCHER: We have a lot of good memories in here -- winning the
conference tournament last year. And the extra games in here obviously as much
as everybody complains about Vegas' home game, we're playing a lot of games in
this building, and we're getting familiar with it and we're feeling
comfortable in it.  
  
So the extra games in here obviously make it nicer for us when we come in.
We're familiar with the locker rooms because we're playing in here twice a
year. And the familiarity has helped us.  
  
Q. Devin, your shot fake, by now everyone should know it's coming, yet
you still get people up in the air. Just talk us through what happened; you
got the switch on Nick Blair and you're able to get them up in the air. Are
you surprised people still go for it?  
DEVIN WATSON: The one in the second half?  
  
Q. Two minutes left.  
DEVIN WATSON: No, I'm not surprised that they still go for it, because they
know I'm a good shooter. And if they don't go for it they know I'm going to
shoot it.  
  
So I just got him on a headsy (phonetic) and then I pump-faked, and normally
they jump straight up, but he jumped forward. So, I knew I was going to get
him. And it was a big play.  
  
Q. Jeremy, you have to defend that sometimes in practice over the years.
Why is that shot fake so good? Even after watching it on film people still go
for it?  
JEREMY HEMSLEY: The trick to a good shot fake, you gotta have your eyes on the
rim and you gotta really look like you're shooting it and that's just how it
looks. If you're defending and you're in the flow of the game and you think
he's going to shoot it, you're just going to jump. That's just how it goes.  
  
But he's obviously good at it. And it's something that he's practiced a lot
and something that comes natural for him. It's hard for any defender to guard
that, especially if you think he's about ready to shoot the ball, sure.  
  
Q. Jeremy, the game is tied, under four minutes to play, you haven't
made a shot. Talk about taking and making that 3-point shot there to give
yourself the lead?  
JEREMY HEMSLEY: I know my teammates and my coaches believe in me. Even with me
missing the shots, not one time did I hear to stop shooting or to stop being
aggressive. So the clock was winding down, and I've been here, this is my
fourth year here. I'm comfortable taking that shot if the clock is winding
down. And I know my teammates believe in me too. So it's just really believing
in yourself at that point.  
  
Q. Jalen, you had your lowest scoring game of the season against Nevada.
You talked about how you needed to step up. What mentally switched in the last
four days for you?  
JALEN MCDANIELS: You know, just staying in the gym, you know, working on my
game. I know that translates to on the court. So just doing that I feel like
it really helped me. And just gotta keep it up.  
  
COACH DUTCHER: Against Nevada, Jalen had quality looks. He maybe had one bad
shot against Nevada. Every other shot I'd let him take every time and
encourage it. And he just couldn't get one to go. So hopefully he's seen a
couple go in now he's back in his rhythm and he'll get the same looks tomorrow
when we play them.  
  
Q. Jalen, the first half seemed like the entire team was struggling. Did
you ever feel like when the team was struggling you need to shoot the ball
more and be more aggressive than you normally are?  
JALEN MCDANIELS: I felt my teammates just put me in the right position for me
to score. If I'm at my spot I'm going to take it and make it most of the time.
So I feel like my teammates just getting me open and recognizing that.  
  
Q. What was different in this game, because you were in a similar
situation last week against Fresno? You had the lead with about a minute left.
How were you able to close this one?  
DEVIN WATSON: Just from experience. Like, you bring up that game, just from
experience knowing what to do, how to do it. I felt like we were locked in
focused. We knew everything was going to happen because we've been through it
before. I think we did well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Knowing now that you guys play Nevada tomorrow, did you watch the
game earlier today? And if so, what did you take from that game that you can
work on to be ready for tomorrow?  
COACH DUTCHER: I didn't get a chance to watch much of it, just a little on the
TV in the locker room. I had my assistant coaches here watching them. We
played them a week ago. Not a lot we have to prepare for, just do a better job
executing our game plan than we did the first game.  
  
Obviously Nevada's greatest quality is they play hard. They're one of the
hardest-playing teams in the country. So they never give in. They never give
up. They believe in themselves and they're grown men. They play like it. It
will be a great challenge tomorrow, but one we're excited for and look forward
to it.  
  
Q. There's a lot of talk in Las Vegas about the job status of Marvin
Menzies. I know you guys are close. You just beat him. You've been pretty
outspoken this season about the job he's done. Do you think it would be unfair
to fire him now?  
COACH DUTCHER: I think Marvin's done a great job. They finished even with us
in the standings. He's built the program every year. They're better off this
year than they were the year before and the year before that. And they're
trending up. They have the majority of their team back.  
  
And so I'm not here to try to lecture and say Marvin should be the coach or
shouldn't be the coach. I'm just here to say he did a great job. And they
guarded us well. They ran a great game plan and we hit a couple timely shots.  
  
Jeremy's 3, if that doesn't go in, what happens? Nathan Mensah on a rebound
gets fouled, throws it up and it goes in. Basketball is sometimes a game of a
bounce or two. And I would hate to think that Marvin, because he lost a tough
game at home, should even be worried about his job status.  
  
Q. You mentioned it before, but can you talk a little bit more about
Jalen and Devin's performance, especially in the first half?  
COACH DUTCHER: I was most worried about Devin because Devin hasn't practiced
since Nevada. He missed all three days of practice, and usually I'm a guy that
wants to see reps in practice so I'm comfortable. We called the first play of
the game, a new one we put in. We haven't even gone for the jump ball and
Devin said, what am I supposed to do on that?  
  
That kind of gets a coach a little apprehensive. But Devin is Devin. He's a
fifth-year senior. You rely on experience, even though he didn't practice. You
rely on his ability to make game-time decisions which he did.  
  
And Nathan Mensah, obviously, he practiced one day leading to the game and I
thought he was great. Nathan made some timely blocks and big rebounds. It was
good to see him play well somewhere other than Viejas Arena. So hopefully that
will trend well into tomorrow's game for us.  
  
Q. This week you were mentioning how Devin and Nathan were banged up.
What's their status looking like for tomorrow's game against Nevada?  
COACH DUTCHER: I think Devin is still banged up. So we have our medical staff
here. I like this 2:30 game. And I wanted a third seed. But this 4-5 game
playing at 2:30 in the afternoon is great, instead of playing at 8:30 at
night. It gives us time to get in for treatment and prep for the next game.  
  
And so even though I wanted the third seed, I think sitting here in the 4-5
game was better for us. At least it was today. So we'll see if that holds true
tomorrow when we're playing the No. 1 seed tomorrow. But I like the chances of
getting treatment, having recovery time leading into tomorrow's game.  
  
Q. Is there a correlation between Jalen's performance and your guys'
performance? Because you guys lost by 28 when he had a poor game. He puts up a
show today, you guys win. Is there a correlation?  
COACH DUTCHER: At first, at Nevada, the only thing I was concerned about
Nevada was I thought Jalen got a little down on himself and quit defending
hard at Nevada because he couldn't get a shot to go in. I took a look at every
shot he took in that game and he shot great.  
  
But he's played his best all year against UNLV. I think he had a career-high
30, and followed it up with 17 or 18 here. And then he had 25 tonight and 14
rebounds. And so for whatever reason this is a good matchup for Jalen. We've
got to see if he can translate some of this positive into a good game tomorrow
against Nevada where he struggled. And I think he's ready for that moment. I
think he'll be ready to step up and play a really good game tomorrow.  
  
Q. The student-athletes talked about it a little bit, but what's it like
having the Aztec fans come out and make it feel like Viejas?  
COACH DUTCHER: We have great fan support. They travel and I knew it wasn't --
it was great today; don't get me wrong. But when I think about what it's going
to be like tomorrow, I just smile and shake my head because I've been coming
here for maybe -- what is it, 17 of the 20 years of this event. And the Aztec
fans travel and they travel well.  
  
So I'm excited to see how many find their way to Vegas tomorrow for our tip-
off. And I think that will be a huge advantage for us.  
  
Q. What's the biggest adjustment just so a 28-point loss won't happen
again tomorrow?  
COACH DUTCHER: A 28-point loss is a 28-point loss. I can say what I want.
Honestly with a eight-minute time to go in the game at Nevada, I told the team
if we could just get two stops and get the next two baskets and cut it to
single digits, we'll play ourselves back in the game.  
  
Well, they hit a couple more 3s and got rolling. And that was it. I thought we
were in the game. Even though it didn't feel like it to a lot of people that
watched it, I thought with eight minutes to go, in a 13-point game, we were in
the game. So we have to try to keep it close tomorrow, so it's a close game
down the stretch and give ourselves an opportunity to win the game late.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
New Mexico - 78, Wyoming - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico head coach Paul Weir and student-
athletes Vance Jackson and Makuach Maluach. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH WEIR: Wyoming is a terrific basketball team. I thought they showed it
tonight. Had a terrific start to the game. Coach and obviously their seniors
were really engaged and ready for the matchup.  
  
I thought they gave us a tremendous blow early and pushed us really to the
point of elimination. And thankfully we were able to kind of bounce back,
finish the game we wanted and get a victory and move on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Vance, 13-0 run there in the first half, personal run, as part of a
team run of 15-0. You haven't had that long of a stretch this season and I
don't think you had that at UConn. When was the last time you did something
like that, and what was it, why was it going on like that?  
VANCE JACKSON: Actually our season is on the line, and, me, personally, and
I'm pretty sure the rest of the team and our staff, we just don't want to
lose. So we've got to do whatever it takes for us to get it done and that's
what happened.  
  
Q. The way you guys looked in the first half, you guys have looked that
bad in other games this year; you guys have had those lows this season where
nothing was going right, foul trouble, the other team's just dominating the
game. You're down 16 in the first half. Within the same game, to go from that
moment to a double-digit victory and the run you had, like, what is it in your
guys' minds or in those huddles that changes from one moment of being down 16
to what you guys did in the second half? And you've done it so consistently
this year, the ups and downs within games?  
VANCE JACKSON: It's a good test for us. Our coach has been telling us to stay
positive. We always just dwell on when we, like, we get down and things like
that. Just staying positive and just playing our hearts out just to keep the
season going. I feel like that was the most important for us, just coming
together.  
  
Q. Makuach, a lot of big buckets in the second half with that baseline
dunk. That was something I saw earlier in the year in a couple of practices
and I saw you do one in the game, but haven't seen you really take that
baseline like you did for that dunk. What is it that maybe has held you back
from doing that a little bit more, because you often have that lane to drive?
And why did you go ahead and do it today?  
MAKUACH MALUACH: Nothing was really falling. I was taking a lot of 3s, and
they weren't going down. So I just thought coming back in, and Vance was on a
role, so I needed to keep up the energy and not settle, take it to the rim and
put the pressure on the officials.  
  
Q. Vance, back to that run, is that something that can carry over to
another game, that will light a spark going forward?  
VANCE JACKSON: Yeah, I feel most definitely, I feel like it can. It's like a
little start to the engine and we've got to keep it going and bring the same
energy for Utah State.  
  
Q. What kind of speech did Coach Weir give you during halftime, because
you looked totally different from the first half to the second?  
VANCE JACKSON: It was kind of simple. Just stay positive. The game's not over.
It's a long game. We've got another 20 minutes. And we've just got to come out
with energy. Wyoming, they're a good team, and they came out and punched us
first. We was down 16. But gotta keep our heads up and keep playing hard and
execute the game plan.  
  
Q. That sounds like something you've been doing all season because
you've obviously struggled. How do you as a team talk to each other to remain
positive?  
VANCE JACKSON: Just body language. Keeping our heads up, like, not dwelling
off our turnovers or if someone missed them, things like that; just saying,
okay, next play, just gotta keep it going, things like that.  
  
Q. Vance, I had a question for you and one for Makuach as well. Before
you had the run, I saw you, you were asking for the ball. And when you didn't
get the ball you actually crashed to the boards. So you were doing little
things; it wasn't just the scoring. Was there something that precipitated the
run prior to it actually taking place?  
VANCE JACKSON: That's what the coaching staff has been telling me at halftime,
just personally crash the glass, give us second-chance points and things like
that. And that was basically it. Just keep playing, playing hard, showing an
effort because little things is what makes the team win.  
  
Q. Along those lines, the little things, as you just mentioned, question
for Makuach, you guys have had some issues closing games out. Less so
recently. So talk about you mentioned that baseline drive, but you also had a
couple other shots down the stretch as well. What does this mean to be able to
find time to close games at this point in the season?  
MAKUACH MALUACH: I mean, it's huge. We've been struggling with all the games,
like closing games out. But today we just wanted to come in, be aggressive.
Once we got back in the game, we knew we just need to close it out. And just
did it, closing out and we just needed to hit free throws and we did that
tonight.  
  
Q. Makuach, so your confidence looked like it was struggling a little.
How much confidence have you gained on that steal that Vance had that led to
your first dunk?  
MAKUACH MALUACH: I never dwell -- I'm not the one to ever dwell on a shot or
missed shot or anything like that. I don't feel like I'm low on confidence.
But I just gotta go out there and compete hard and give everything to the
team. And I feel like everything would take care of itself.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. From the first half to second half, I want to start with the first
half, you guys looked for -- down 16, you looked as bad as I've seen you guys
look this year. Couple shot clock violations and I think back-to-back
possessions. They didn't seem to be listening to you guys on the bench. I want
to start there and ask what was going on in that first half that was so, I
guess, just disjointed in general?  
COACH WEIR: Yeah. I just told the guys after the game I thought the best
teaching we can kind of get from this is just how -- we didn't come out in a
great emotional state individually. And I can go from Anthony all the way down
to guys down the bench. I just thought we just looked -- nervous is probably
the wrong word -- anxious. I thought we were pressing and just didn't really
look comfortable to start.  
  
But that all being said, we had 23 deflections at half. The game was at the
pace I wanted. I told the guys like this part of playing this pace and this
style, it's a second-half, end-of-game kind of thing. And we had the game
where we wanted it.  
  
I thought, again, like usual, we missed a lot of layups. We missed some easy
stuff around the rim. We missed some good looks. So the offensive stuff can
come and go. But I thought defensively we had the game where we wanted it. It
was just going to take some more time to get there. And it just took that time
to kind of get there.  
  
Q. Fast forward to the second half, Vance in particular, I know that's
sort of the expectations he's had on his shoulders all year, to be that guy a
little bit more. I guess it came at a good time, but what got into Vance on
the 13-0 personal run to basically save the season?  
COACH WEIR: No, I think all season long I've been really trying to teach him,
and actually Kuach as well about just matchups, and understanding who is
guarding them, the strengths and weakness of the player, where the ball is on
the floor and just attacking it.  
  
I thought with Hunter Thompson guarding him, it was a great matchup for him.
And it's been my frustration at times with Vance, there are times when he
wants to maybe go make a play and drive on a smaller, athletic guy, or just do
things that aren't necessarily in coordination with who's guarding him. But I
thought tonight with Thompson guarding him was a great matchup. He was able to
take him off the bounce and once he started doing that, it opened himself up
from 3. So he really took advantage of the matchup, which was great on his
part and helpful to us as well.  
  
Q. You were pressing again. Looked like last year's Lobos; you hadn't
really done that this year. The decision that went into pressing, was it based
on the second half trapping success you had Saturday, or did you know all
along you might press this whole game?  
COACH WEIR: I would be lying if I said it hadn't crossed my mind. Definitely
the last few minutes opened my mind, and those are the clips I showed the
guys. Like, hey, look at these, these are the clips; let's look at those
clips. And I felt from the matchup perspective it was something we could do,
so we've been working on it for a couple of days, kind of getting back to all
the drills we did through the fall and other things like that.  
  
We weren't great at it tonight, but I felt the overall tempo and flow of the
game was actually in our favor. Even though Wyoming had some terrific runs and
played exceptional, I still liked the flow. I thought it was in our favor and
thankfully it did come around.  
  
Q. The expectations were pretty high for Vance Jackson coming into this
season. How big is it that as a sophomore he's showing so much potential
during postseason, and not just him but someone like Keith McGee?  
COACH WEIR: Double question. I like all those guys. I like Vance. I like
Makuach. I like Keith. Those are three sophomores that are exceptionally
talented. I've tried to tell all of them -- not just Vance, Keith or Makuach
-- that these guys they're trying to catch -- the Justin Jameses, the Deshon
Taylors, the Martin brothers; I can go on and on with the great players.
They're fourth- and fifth-year players. They just are.  
  
And these are tremendously talented sophomores that I think are going to
matriculate into being those kinds of names and players. But that process to
get there is ugly sometimes. It's not pretty. It's not every night is going to
be sexy. There's some ugly nights along the way.  
  
And these great players I just mentioned, they had ugly nights along the way
too. We just have to endure those, learn from them and grow from them, and
just allow their careers to kind of grow from there.  
  
Q. You were talking about the ugliness. How do you keep your team from
feeling all the negative comments that people are saying, just so they can
stay positive and keep going?  
COACH WEIR: Honestly, I think if anybody contributed to the negativity,
particularly early in the season, it was probably myself. I didn't do a good
job of handling probably how our non-conference season was unfolding, and I
perpetuated a lot of that, particularly internally.  
  
And as I've reflected back on that, I don't think I handled that the right
way. And all I've really tried to do since is just be as positive and
enthusiastic about them and their opportunities as I can, drown a lot of that
other stuff out, because -- I don't know if I necessarily let it get to me,
but is I was actually creating some of that energy.  
  
And really over the last month or two, come win, come loss, whatever, it's
just been about trying to grow and keep these guys in a really good state of
mind. And I think the style of play today lends itself to that as well -- more
of an aggressive, enthusiastic, energetic style of play as opposed to kind of
a playing-not-to-win, let's-prevent-losing kind of attitude that I don't know
if we necessarily took on but I know that was maybe permeating around, even
just the periphery of our program.  
  
Q. Looking forward to tomorrow, you did a lot of things well against
Utah State this season even though you lost both games. What are you looking
forward to do differently if anything tomorrow night?  
COACH WEIR: Unfortunately, I haven't spent one second thinking about that.
Utah State is an amazing basketball team. I could go on and on about what I
think about them, their team, their program. They play basketball the way I
love to watch.  
  
They're great. We're going to have to kind of work on that between now and
tomorrow and give ourselves the best chance to win.  
  
Q. You're talking about your mental state. Do you feel pretty good about
where your team is right now mentally going forward?  
COACH WEIR: You know, I think I said before we came out here, I don't go
into-- we've beaten everybody in the league that you would probably need to
beat or be in the game or whatever. So I don't come to this tournament -- I
don't think we come to this tournament -- thinking anyone here is just
distinctly better than us.  
  
I think they're more consistent than us. I think they're more mature than us.
I think there's teams with a lot of other maybe profiles that we don't
necessarily embody, but I don't know if any of us really in that locker room
feel as though there's anyone in this tournament that's just flat out better
than we are.  
  
We control kind of our own destiny in that way. So provided we can kind of do
what we need to do, then we'll have a chance to win games. But I don't think
any of us have really walked away from a lot of games going, man, that team is
just, they were better than us in this game. We walk back and said, geez, we
turned the ball over this amount of times or we didn't go to the offensive
glass or we missed a lot of layups or missed a lot of 3s.  
  
And that's a good feeling to have, as weird as it sounds. Our season might
have gone great overall, but I think overall as a unit we still feel like we
can win games. So this, obviously, is a nice one for us.  
  
And hopefully our team, again, was challenged today mentally in a lot of ways.
We'll be able to grow from it and give Utah State a good shot tomorrow.  
  
Q. Not to be overshadowed by Vance's outstanding play in the second
half, can you talk about the huge winning plays that Vlad and Drue had in the
second half?  
COACH WEIR: I told all the guys yesterday everyone was going to play. So get
ready. We're all going into this and we're all going to play. You need to be
ready because we're going to play fast and we're going to trap and we're going
to need more bodies out there. That's the only way we're going to be able to
potentially win games and games in multiple days. We can't wear guys down.  
  
So it really became -- is still now -- a very team-oriented philosophy. And we
need contributions from everybody. And even down to whoever you want to go
down to, Vlad, you can name a lot of different guys, everyone's contribution
is important.  
  
Vlad has -- I think we've all been aware that Vlad has been a guy that's
gotten picked on at times here and there. But he still, defense points per
possession, is one of the top three guys on our team. We know we want him out
there defensively. He's smart. He talks. He rebounds. And he's very valuable
for us there.  
  
I thought in addition to the defense that he helped he had some great
inside/out passes. We were able to play through him. He was able to pass out
for some really good shots. I thought that was critical. Drue is probably the
only point guard/point guard we have on our roster. So we need that as well.
We need a guy that can pass, that can distribute and manage the game a little
bit.  
  
The issue is defensively, unfortunately at times he gets caught on some bigger
guys or fouls, but he has a role for us as well. So everybody all the way up
and down the line has a role. They're all going to have to play them and
obviously play them well tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know you said you like the pace of the play even in the first half.
Be that as it may be, as ugly as it was, at times you dug yourselves into a
hole. Could you talk maybe about some of the younger guys on the team
experiencing that now to hopefully limit the possibility of having something
like that happen against a Utah State, having this be their first experience
instead of that?  
COACH WEIR: Part of it you can control. Part of it you can't. We shot 27
percent. And I would say part of that might have been some shot selection,
might have been some nervous, might have been some things we can control. But
some of it wasn't. Some of it was a missed layup. Some of it was stepping out
of bounds. Some of it was in the flow of the games we made mistakes. I think
if anything we took from today, I hope, because that was my only lesson I
talked about after the game, and probably the only one I'm going to talk about
tonight, is just the mental approach.  
  
And I didn't think -- today, I think as you could see by the beginning of the
game, I thought our physical -- I thought our physical output was good. It was
our mental state that we just looked a little anxious. We looked a little on
edge. We were a little jumpy. We were a little emotional. We were just kind of
out of it a little bit, which is understandable with basically, gosh, 60, 70
percent of these guys have never been here before. So it's a new feeling for
them. And hopefully that's what we're going to learn from this game more than
anything, is just having a better mental approach and just being more stable
through the course of the game tomorrow night.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Leon Rice](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23356)

### [Zach Haney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36707)

### [Derrick Alston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36708)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 66, Colorado State - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State head coach Leon Rice and student-
athletes Zach Haney and Derrick Alston. Coach, an opening comment.  
  
COACH RICE: I love the way our guys approached this game. We came out with a
really good defensive intensity and held a team that's been really, really
scoring well, Colorado State, to 57 points. And did a pretty good job overall
on one of the best rebounders, one of the best consistent scorers in the
league with Carvacho.  
  
And I think the big guys did a great job of banging around in there, and Zach
really went to work early and kind of got us good momentum like we did
Saturday. But I just really like the way we defended and rebounded.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. To get the monkey off your back and win a tournament for the first
time in four years and live to fight another day, what are your thoughts right
now?  
COACH RICE: Again, like I said, I was really proud of our guys. We really
battled and I think we kind of had some really, really good moments where we
played good on offense and defense. But I just liked our approach.  
  
And we had a good mojo to us and made simple plays. And we competed. And in a
game like that that's what you've got to do to come down get the win.  
  
Q. Largest deficit one point the whole game. Pretty much led the start
to finish. Even when you're up 14 in the last few minutes, it's never easy for
you guys. Did the seconds feel like hours?  
COACH RICE: I'm getting a little more comfortable with it. But you're right.
But that's -- these guys got to keep an edge to them and they did. And they
did a good job managing down the stretch to the end. And a couple of
possessions they banged in a 3, and then there's a foul with two seconds to go
on the shot clock. That kind of keeps things alive. If we don't foul there, he
misses it, we rebound, they probably stop fouling. And that's usually it.
You've just to learn from that and move forward.  
  
Q. Colorado State's 57 points was the fewest they've scored all season.
What were the adjustments you made to have such a strong defensive
performance?  
COACH RICE: It was their mindset. These guys have that mindset to come down
here and guard. That's who's going to win the tournament -- the team that
guards the best. I think these guys had a good approach to it.  
  
Q. Zach, you've had four straight games in double figures. Almost led
the team in scoring tonight. What's kind of been the edge for you these last
few games?  
ZACH HANEY: I just know that my time here is kind of winding down, just trying
to give it all I got. It's my last ride, it's my last time in the tournament
and I just want to give everything that I've got left in my tank for my
teammates and just win as many games as we can and win this tournament.  
  
Q. Building off that, Zach, you've been assertive early in the last two
games. I'm just curious, is it more than just determination for your last
couple of games? It just seems like you're making a really conscious effort to
get involved pretty early in the last two games?  
ZACH HANEY: I'm just playing with confidence, taking my time, just going out
there, like I said, and giving it all for my teammates. But we stress a lot,
no slow start. If I have to be that guy that gets the team going at first, I'm
just going to do what ever I can.  
  
Q. Leon, you were preaching about your team's defensive effort today.
And there was a point in the game in the second half where it was a two-point
game and it could have slipped to the oh-no mode again. I think you hit them
with a 17-3 run and really put the game away. Given all you've been through
this season, at this point in time how encouraging is it to see the seniors do
that?  
COACH RICE: It was a great response. You knew that Colorado State wasn't going
to just go in at the half and roll over. They were going to come out and
compete. And they did. And they made a run at us and these guys responded.  
  
I thought D.A.'s kickout to Marcus was a great play, and we read everything
right. And we just made the right plays at the right time and got the lead
back to seven, eight, nine again, and that's where it kind of stayed.  
  
Q. D.A., you led the way with 17 today. What was the key to your success
out there?  
DERRICK ALSTON: Just sticking with it. I felt like I didn't have a great first
half, but that's kind of something that I've worked on and just staying with
it. And getting to the free-throw line was big. And teammates kept confidence
in me and coaches just, keep playing within the offense and it was going to
come.  
  
Q. You talked after the last game kind of had nothing to lose going into
this tournament, no pressure on you guys, nobody expecting you to do anything.
For the players, did it feel like that, were you able to come out there, just
relax and play basketball? Or how did it feel out there in this one?  
ZACH HANEY: I mean, I wouldn't necessarily say we were relaxed. But our backs
are kind of against the wall right now. We know anything's possible in this
tournament.  
  
Like I've stressed over and over again, this team has a lot of fight left in
us. And we're going to give that until the clock hits zero.  
  
Q. Leon, you started both big guys again. Obviously, like you said, you
held Carvacho to five rebounds. Something must have worked. What were your
thought I guess in rolling with that again? And defensively you did play a lot
of zone, which was also part of your success.  
COACH RICE: Both of those. But in the zone, those guys gotta be accountable
for blocking out and for keeping a body on him, because he's relentless.  
  
And, I mean, that's probably got to be his season-low rebounding, I guess. He
didn't get one offensive rebound. That's a credit to these guys. That's
attention to detail that they do blocking out every time, because that's a
weapon.  
  
Usually he gets six to eight to 10 to 12 points just off putbacks. And to take
that out of their offense, you know, really hurts them. We played so good, I
wanted to keep running it.  
  
Q. Derrick, once again, once it got to the two-point game at 42-40, I
think it was just (indiscernible) loose ball and he found you in the corner.
You've been in those moments where you see those leads maybe slip away from
you so many times this year, are you almost comfortable in these situations
now? Because it just seems like you guys were able to respond at that
moment.  
DERRICK ALSTON: Yeah, we've been through it all year. You have to figure it
out eventually. We knew that when that happens, we just have to stay together
and get closer. That was a great find by Jay to hit me in the corner, and to
spark that run and kind of finish the game off that.  
  
COACH RICE: That was a big shot, no doubt about it, at a time where we needed
it. And that's what you have to do in a tournament. Like I said, nobody is
going to roll over. Everybody's playing for their lives. And you have to be
able to respond to those challenges. And they did it. These guys did.  
  
Q. Leon, there's a number of times where we've seen a team play on day
one, go and get a team on day two of this tournament. And a little bit of a
unique circumstance. You know who you're playing tomorrow. Most of the time
the Mountain West Tournament, you kind of have to wait and see?  
COACH RICE: We haven't been playing on day one. We finished in the top three
four straight years, and so this was new for us. So far I like it. Not going
to try to do it again but I like it. And we like playing -- it's great playing
the first game. It's 11:00, boom, you don't have to get up and wait around the
hotel. You wake up and eat breakfast and come play. That's great. And I think
that tomorrow it's kind of the same thing.  
  
Q. For all three of you off of that, getting another chance at Nevada,
and obviously you proved you could play right with them when you played with
them in Boise, what are your thoughts on playing the early game again, and you
guys have the game under your belt here and the win and going into the game
against the Wolf Pack tomorrow?  
COACH RICE: We know how good they are. We know they've got all the pieces. You
heard me say that after the last time we played them. There's a reason why
they're ranked what they are and we got all the respect in the world for them.
We're just going to come out and let the fur fly and see where it ends up.  
  
DERRICK ALSTON: Yeah, great team and getting up again, like I think we play at
noon, so just getting up and just getting to play like back when we were kids.
It's always fun.  
  
ZACH HANEY: Yep, we know they're a great team. Just come out tomorrow and see
what happens. Battle.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Zach Chappell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36731)

### [Seneca Knight](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36732)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Air Force - 87, San Jose State - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Jose State head coach Jean Prioleau and
student-athletes Seneca Knight and Zach Chappell. Coach, an opening comment.  
  
COACH PRIOLEAU: Thoughts on tonight's game. I think tonight was -- or today --
really was the epitome of our team. We are an inconsistent team.  
  
We started off really well. We started off like gangbusters. Shot well. A
large part of that was we didn't turn the ball over. Then we had a turnover
spree going on for about maybe five or six minutes, maybe even longer. I know
we turned it over probably about eight or nine times in the first half.  
  
And then when that happens, you know, it gives the other team just too many
chances to make shots. And Air Force can make shots.  
  
Now we went zone. We tried to switch up our zone, 2 zone. We have a 1-1-3
zone. So we switched it up. But the turnovers really killed our momentum. And
then we could never find it back after that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes?  
  
Q. During that 13-0 run, what's going through your mind when you guys
jump out like that, because obviously you've played Air Force tight, taking
them double OT in the first meeting. Was confidence pretty high at that
point?  
SENECA KNIGHT: Yeah, confidence was sky high at that point. But we had to make
sure we stayed level throughout the game just how quick the game could change.  
  
Q. What do you guys think led to the turnovers and the other issues that
allowed Air Force to storm back like that?  
SENECA KNIGHT: I'd say that was a big factor in the game. We started out high,
but once you started turning the ball over it killed the momentum we had.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously kind of getting off to that quick start, right, your
confidence must be really, really high right there. What do you tell your team
when Air Force does go on that 25-2 run and kind of takes the wind out of your
sails? What do you tell your team at that point?  
COACH PRIOLEAU: I used a couple of timeouts. But before that, when we were
high, we came back in the huddle. We were all juiced up, high fiving, yeah,
hey, hey, here we go.  
  
I've done this a long time. I've tried to tell our guys just be calm because
it's a long game and let's just continue to do the things that we do,
primarily up to that point.  
  
And I'm not saying right after that, like, it went downhill. But probably,
maybe a media timeout after that, that's when it all started. We were just
turning it over. They started scoring. And we just couldn't stop the bleeding.  
  
I took another timeout to try and maybe slow us down or just break their
momentum and that didn't work as well.  
  
Q. You guys kind of got killed on the offensive boards tonight. I
believe Air Force had 11. You guys only had two. What was going wrong for you
guys as far as securing the glass?  
COACH PRIOLEAU: In terms of rebounding -- and we're not really a zone team all
the time -- but zone has worked against them because they're really good
offensively man-to-man. And when you zone, that's the hardest thing to do in
zone is to rebound out of the zone.  
  
And they were able to crash the boards. They were able to get their hands on
balls when the ball went up in the air. And we weren't able to track down any
balls that they shot. And it was just the energy factor and along with playing
zone. It's just really hard to rebound out of zone, unless you're a zone team.  
  
Like, Syracuse, they're a zone team. Baylor, they're a zone team. They do that
all the time, every single day. So they understand how to rebound out of that.  
  
We don't. But we wanted to change it up and give them a different look because
they like to go against man-to-man all the time. And it just didn't work.  
  
Q. You bring up the zone. Air Force took advantage of the open shots
they took from the zone. In the second half they shot 55 percent, 46 percent
from 3. What went into the decision to stay in the zone in the second half?  
COACH PRIOLEAU: Well, we stayed with it because we've been in games where
teams have cooled off. And then, obviously, we went man maybe a little late. I
should have gone zone -- I mean, I should have gone man earlier.  
  
But, again, it's a decision that you have to make, because if you go man, and
they start back dooring and they start -- they're still going to get the ball
where they want to get it to because they're really good in their man-to-man
offense. It was just a decision I had to make.  
  
Yeah, if I had to do it all over again -- it's easy to sit up here and it's
easy for the average fan to look at the game from afar and after the game is
over say, hey, you should have done this. Well, it's after the fact. You've
got to make those decisions right then and right there. And I did. Sometimes
it's worked. Today it didn't.  
  
Q. Seneca and Zach, both freshmen, both stood out in this game for the
Spartans. Does this kind of performance, does it help your confidence, even
though the team didn't play well as a whole? But you guys played well
individually. Does it help your confidence going into your sophomore seasons
or does this hurt?  
SENECA KNIGHT: I would say it helped our confidence just to know that we can
compete, go out there and compete in the Mountain West Conference because this
is the first time playing in it. So I feel pretty confident about next season.  
  
Q. You guys are freshmen, so this is the first time you've done this.
What was your mental state coming here? How did you mentally prepare for a
game like this?  
ZACH CHAPPELL: Mentally, it's just, we're trying to stay ready and we play
basketball every day. So it's just the fact that we have to make sure that we
know what we're looking for, don't let the big crowds and all this just affect
us and we've just got to play our game. I think we'll be ready next year. I
think we'll come back stronger, just ready and we'll change this around.  
  
Q. You mentioned inconsistency in how this game was kind of a microcosm
of your season.  
COACH PRIOLEAU: Basically.  
  
Q. Heading into your third season as the head coach of the Spartans next
year, how do you fix that? Because your first season consistency played a role
in that as well, and this year. How do you fix that problem?  
COACH PRIOLEAU: You fix it through time. That's the only way you fix it and we
have a young group. We have everyone back. And you have to keep working.
That's the only way you fix it. We're not going to change what we are and who
we are offensively or defensively.  
  
And with that being said, like, what you saw for the first ten minutes of the
game, we can extrapolate that out for 40 minutes. And that's the mantra,
that's the theme. That's what we're going to take from this with a young team
and a young team that's coming back. And that's how you fix it and that's how
it changes.  
  
To change drastically and to change a bunch of things, no, that's not how you
do it. You've got to stick with it and believe in what you're doing. And our
players believe in what we're doing. I believe in my players. I believe in
what we're trying to do. So that's how it changes.  
  
Q. What did you think made Ryan Swan so effective defensively against
Michael Steadman after what Steadman had done in the first two matchups
against Air Force?  
COACH PRIOLEAU: There's a lot of credit to Ryan Swan because he's a really
good player. But it wasn't him. It was the double team. So he didn't really
play him one-on-one. Not a lot of people can play Mike one-on-one. As a matter
of fact, there's a lot of post players in our league you can't play one-on-
one. So there's a lot of double teams that come with that.  
  
So, yes, Ryan Swan is a really good player. I love him. I was at Colorado for
seven years. He's a Colorado kid so I've known him a long time. He's a great
competitor. He's great for their team. But, again, they were double-teaming
him.  
  
Q. And with Sid Tomes regarding the 3, what does a scouting report say
on a guy like that? He was shooting 12 percent from 3-point range coming in,
and he had eight points, hit two 3s. Is that a guy you keep in mind because
he'd done this in the past?  
COACH PRIOLEAU: No, not necessarily because in zone it doesn't matter if
you're a really, really good shooter and you're shooting 40 percent. It's hard
to track a guy when you're in zone. If you're in a 2-3 zone or 1-3-1 zone, you
can pick whatever zone you want, players can find the free spot in the zone.  
  
So, hats off to that young man. He came in, made some shots. This is Division
I basketball. So whether you're a guy like Michael Steadman, who gets almost
double-doubles every single game, or a guy like Ryan Swan or Lavelle Scottie,
guys that are night in, night out, there are players in this league, there are
players all around the country that can make shots and make plays. It's the
reason why it's Division I basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Dave Pilipovich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23377)

### [Ryan Swan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36727)

### [Chris Joyce](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36728)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Air Force - 87, San Jose State - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Air Force head coach Dave Pilipovich and
student-athletes Chris Joyce and Ryan Swan. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH PILIPOVICH: We got off to a little slow start. 13-0, I believe, the
start by San Jose State. They did a great job. And I want to say this about
them. That team has fought all year. Obviously haven't had the win totals
expected or wanted. But their kids are tough. They play hard. They're a hard
match. And we knew they would come out, and they did, they came out and got
the lead on us.  
  
But a credit to our players. They stayed within themselves. They didn't panic.
They didn't point fingers. But they never do that. We just said, one
possession at a time. We had to get some stops to get us back into the game.
And we did and we made some shots. And eventually the tide turned and we were
able to manage it from there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Ryan, how much pride do you take in Michael Steadman's stat line?  
RYAN SWAN: To be honest with you, I just really take pride in the team stat
line, and if that's what I have to do to help us win, that's what I'm going to
do. I don't really pay attention to individual stats like that.  
  
Q. Their coach talked a lot about how the double teams helped that. How
much do you think you impacted the way he played today?  
RYAN SWAN: I think I was more active on him. He's a very good player and so
big, skilled around the basket. But I was able to move my feet and really just
try --  
  
COACH PILIPOVICH: You did what?  
  
RYAN SWAN: Comedian over here. I just moved my feet and I was able to kind of
stay a step ahead of him for most of the night. I think that was what got to
him the most.  
  
Q. And you were here for the Wyoming Game two years ago when you guys
started on a 25-0 run. Did you have memories of that from the other side?  
RYAN SWAN: That's one of my favorite memories at the academy. Got me out of
recognition for another day. (Laughter).  
  
COACH PILIPOVICH: He didn't mean that, sir.  
  
Q. Did you have fears of that, though, from the other side, having seen
that happen?  
RYAN SWAN: No, we know they're a good team. I think they're one of the tallest
teams in America, something like that. But we know they're a good team, but we
know what we can do. If there's one thing I've learned about this game, it's a
game of runs. And you just gotta make yours when you make yours and storm
theirs when they make theirs.  
  
Q. How much would it mean to make the semifinals?  
RYAN SWAN: It would mean a lot. But I'm not trying to just go to the
semifinals. We didn't come out here just to say we played in the semifinals.  
  
Q. Chris, your first bucket ended that 13-0 run. Did you sense that kind
of put a needle in the balloon a little bit?  
CHRIS JOYCE: Yeah, we started out super flat and I was just trying to be
aggressive, kick start us a little bit. I mean, if it was me scoring, me
passing, rebounding, defending, whatever, I just wanted to do something to get
us going.  
  
Q. Is this the best game you've played this year?  
CHRIS JOYCE: Could have been. Hopefully my best game is tomorrow. That would
be better. Or on Saturday. I just want to keep playing better from here on
out.  
  
We talked about, earlier in the year, consistency. And I'd have a good game,
have a bad game. So having a good game first game of the tournament, just keep
it going would be good.  
  
Q. How do you think you guys fought off nerves when they did start 13-0
to keep it from compounding from there?  
CHRIS JOYCE: I think we just stayed positive, just positive talk to each
other. We have good leaders on this team -- Lavelle Scottie, Ryan. They just
told us to calm down, we're good we've been in this situation before. And we
just stayed positive.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What did you think about neutralizing Steadman, because you mentioned
him as a huge factor coming into this?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: He was playing well against us, averaging 24 points, maybe
16 rebounds. He was a force inside. And he's really strong. Ran into Coach
Musselman in the lobby yesterday, and that's what he mentioned, too, how good
a player he is in the low post.  
  
So we worked on that for a couple days. And we did a good job -- I thought
Ryan did a good job moving his feet and pushing him further away from the
basket. And then we sent another player down on his, as we say, his lap to
take the ball out of his hands or to make it little bit more uncomfortable for
him. It was a credit to our team. It was not just Ryan, but it was everybody
realizing their assignment and responding to the play.  
  
Q. How much of a relief was it for you when Joyce got to the rim?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Yeah, and I tell you, this team has grown all year. I think
when we came into this season, they talked about "everybody back," and then
we'll talk about it again next year, whenever that comes. But I don't know if
we were ready to win early in the season, because we still weren't in those
moments.  
  
We missed Trevor Lyons and Frank Toohey and Jacob Van and C.J. Siples and Ryan
Manning. They were the older players, the voice of the locker room. I don't
know, if we play this game in November early December, if we come back from
13-0. But we've grown as the year has come through. We've gotten better. We
have gotten ownership of this team. We've had some leaders step up. And we've
responded pretty well. And I like how the season has come about and where
we've gone.  
  
You hear different things and I know I try to keep it away, but we've never
won as a higher seed in this tournament. And this was the first time. We've
never beaten a team three times in one year. We've had a 1 seed, the only
regular season champ, and they came and lost to the last place team, the
eighth seed and a second lost to a 7, a 3 to a 6, a 4 to a 5, so they hear
that.  
  
I was trying to keep it away but everything is available. I was proud of them
to come in, wear the white uniforms. Many years we never packed a light
jersey. It's good for this team. We've taken another step.  
  
Q. We've mentioned a couple times, is this going to be the shot that
gets Sid going. He made two of them today.  
COACH PILIPOVICH: He did.  
  
Q. You're in the conference tournament; it's not too late, is it, for
him?  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Sid's picture has been on a milk carton for a lot this year.
Wonder where he's been. Sid, where have you been? But he's such a great kid.
He keeps working, working. He was missing for us through the year.  
  
We talked as a staff, he was our best player in preseason practice. What a
tremendous young man. His sister obviously a member of the women's program.
They're great cadets we knew he was going to come. And today was good for him.
And he's done a good job in our games against San Jose defensively. He's
really taken pride about guarding Baumann. Baumann can really shoot the
basketball, No. 20. He's a good player.  
  
Q. You talk about the growth of the team. But for Lavelle to really not
have a good game today and win by 30 in the tournament --  
COACH PILIPOVICH: Right. And they have changed how they played against us
because of Lavelle's success. They play a 2-3 zone. They've gone, like, a
1-1-3 to take the player put it in the middle where Lavelle is usually
occupied. And we adjusted to that.  
  
So for them to do that -- Lavelle got in a little bit of foul trouble. He was
leading on the bench. He was talking to guys. He shared the ball. Encouraging
to see some other people step up and come in and score and do some things,
yes.  
  
I'd like to say one thing, I'm going to get choked up here, when you get to
the Academy, there's great people at the Academy. And we had a gentleman by
the name of Floyd Withrow Farmer, a lot of people know Farmer. Farmer loved
the Academy, worked at the prep school and was a great gentleman, and he
passed on Thursday. And he loved this team. And I know he's watching today.
Great guy. Great guy.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [J.D. Paige](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36709)

### [Nico Carvacho](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34831)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 66, Colorado State - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colorado State head coach Niko Medved and
student-athletes J.D. Paige and Nico Carvacho. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH MEDVED: Obviously, these things are never easy when it ends up being the
last game of a season and the young man left to me being the last game of his
career. There's nothing I can say, unfortunately, that's going to make him or
us feel better about the result.  
  
But I could go on and talk about this game today, and I'm sure you guys may
ask me questions. Obviously I give a lot of credit to Boise. I thought they
came out and played really, really physical, really aggressive.  
  
And we definitely didn't play our best in a lot of areas. But I thought we
fought. It was a frustrating game. We had a lot of opportunities to maybe even
take the lead or seize it. We just couldn't kind of get over that hump. But I
thought the guys kept battling and fought through some adversity. Boise was
just the better team today.  
  
Q. What's the difference between emotions from last year's tournament to
this year's tournament? Obviously same result, but is there a different of
emotion between the two years?  
NICO CARVACHO: Last year we went through a little different situation than we
are now. We came out this year, we fought every single game, had a lot of
close games, thought we could have finished a little better. One or two plays
that determined the games that we lost. We came in here confident knowing that
we were going to have to battle for every single thing, and we left it out
there.  
  
Q. I saw some kind of sloppy play on offense from you guys. Was that
difficult when you have those sloppy turnovers to get something going
offensively?  
NICO CARVACHO: Flow a little bit. Messes up the flow, hard to get in a rhythm.  
  
Q. What do you feel was the biggest key for Boise? Obviously they did
really well in the paint today. What were you seeing that maybe they were
doing that maybe you hadn't seen before this year?  
J.D. PAIGE: I would just say they were the more physical team from the start
to the finish. And credit to them. They battled hard, but our guys didn't stop
battling. But I would just say that they were the more physical team.  
  
Q. You guys have credited Kendle and Adam all season for being able to
step up in the tough moments. Kind of seems like maybe for the first time
since Reno they were a little in the moment and just kind of struggling. Adam
had a rough day obviously. What are you telling your younger teammates after
today?  
NICO CARVACHO: Yeah, I was in that situation as a freshman, and he was in that
situation, so we know how tough it is to come out here. You play 30-some
games, heavy minutes all year, started a lot of games. They did the best they
could. And they're going to keep on getting better in the offseason and grow.
This is just going to help them out and give them more motivation to get
better in the offseason.  
  
Q. J.D., what are the emotions for you right now?  
J.D. PAIGE: I'm just proud of the way that I've grown this whole season. I
know that we lost and things like that. But I'm really just ecstatic the way
I've grown as a player.  
  
Q. Did it mean a lot to you to kind of, I guess, help the transition
with this team, that, yeah, you're not going to be there next year, but it
seems to be kind of going in the right direction and to help out with that?  
J.D. PAIGE: Like I said, this year I was just telling everybody to buy in.
Once you buy in and that's when you start winning and things start going your
way and things like that. We had ups and downs this season, but these are my
brothers. And I love them.  
  
Q. When you mentioned kind of buying in, obviously culture change was
one of the things that you guys focused on at the beginning of this year. Do
you think that kind of changed this year; you guys accomplished what you
wanted to with that?  
J.D. PAIGE: Most definitely, buying in. Me and Nico were the leaders on the
team. So if we showed that we had bought in then other guys would follow.  
  
Q. Coach, how did you notice your guys buy into that?  
COACH MEDVED: First thing, I'd say something about these two guys. You look at
the improvement and obviously this is a bottom-line thing, you want to win
every game, but I look at Nico -- and I was saying this, in 20-some years of
coaching, as an assistant and head coach, I think he's improved as much as any
player I've seen throughout the season from where he was in November and
December until now. That takes a tremendous amount of commitment and buy-in
and maturity level.  
  
And this guy, too, I mean, J.D., I think he's right. I think he's grown like
crazy and was playing his best basketball here at the end of the season. It's
not just the way he was playing; it's the other things.  
  
Sometimes as a coach, when you're close to it and you get to be around these
guys every day, you get to see the growth. They may not even see it because,
hey, they're frustrated because they didn't win and they're competitors and
they should be. But these guys have grown like crazy and I'm really proud of
them. And we're in a much better position now as a program than we were
because of these two.  
  
Q. Hyron Edwards was a guy, was sort of questionable how much he could
go and he really provided a spark. What can you say about what Hyron provided
today?  
J.D. PAIGE: I thought he was good today. Like you said, he provided that spark
off the bench. He's been injured the past couple of weeks and he just came in
and fought through and gave us some energy.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Obviously as you mentioned it's a bottom-line business. But when you
look back at your first season being back at Colorado State, what's going to
stand out to you the most?  
COACH MEDVED: That's a great question. I don't know. You're kind of in the
emotions of it right now and you're obviously disappointed. And looked like
two weeks ago we were kind of starting to turn a little bit of a corner. I
felt like after we had beaten this team on the road, and obviously we didn't
finish the way we wanted, so there's a lot of emotions coming with that.  
  
I think what you try to build on is you try to build on the positives, and you
try to build on some of these guys who I think have really grown, trying to
buy into our system of the way we want to do things. And I think that stands
out to me the most.  
  
And it stands out to me on a personal level, how excited I am to be here, and
just how much radical belief that I still have and we still have of what I
believe we can do here and build. And, so, I'm going to try to focus on the
positives from this season and obviously there's a lot of things we need to
get better at and grow. We've got a long ways to go to get to where we want,
but I think it's starting to build with the positives. And I think that's what
you always do.  
  
Q. With both Adam and Kendle struggling, how difficult is it to juggle
your rotation, because it's already small? How difficult is it making
adjustments with that?  
COACH MEDVED: Yeah, those are the guys that have been playing and you just
keep fighting through with them. And you know what? I think oftentimes you
learn the most in the most difficult situations. Adam is in there crying his
eyes out. He knows he didn't play well. Nobody cares more. Nobody cares more
than Kendle.  
  
But I think they're going to learn as much from the feeling that you have
right now in these situations, moving into the spring in the offseason. And
you're going to remember the success, too. But those guys care so much.  
  
And we've rolled with them all year and they've played so well in so many
critical situations. So, hey, it wasn't their day today. Give the opponent
credit. But trust me, those two guys will be back.  
  
Q. With those emotions after the game does that kind of speak to the
character of both those two, but kind of the way this program's moving?  
COACH MEDVED: Yeah, again, you just see how hurt Adam was in there. But if you
know Adam, it has nothing to do with that. He's mad that he missed shots. He
feels like he let people down because for him it is bigger than that. He wants
to win. He wants to play well for the team and for the program because he
cares. And Kendle is the same. And the other guys are the same way.  
  
But I don't ever like to see a player hurting, but I love to see that because
I love to see the passion and somebody caring so much about what we're doing.  
  
When you get people that are invested like that and we continue to do that,
that's when great things happen.  
  
Q. Given how the season went, if you had been told before the season,
hey, this is exactly what's going to happen, you guys are going to have ups
and downs losing the first round, where would you find your team?  
COACH MEDVED: It's so hard to say. I came in here. I didn't know what to
expect. I really didn't have any goals as far as wins or whatever. I just
wanted to come in, get to know these guys, try to establish the way we wanted
to do things on and off the court, the way we wanted to conduct ourselves.  
  
And I know we've made a lot of progress there. Yeah, of course you're
disappointed right now. I thought we left some games out there that we could
have won. There's no question about that. But if I just focus on that, I think
I'm missing something bigger. I think I'm missing something else because
there's more to it than just how many games we won this season. So there's a
level of disappointment where we finished. But again I do think that there is
a lot to build on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST MEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+MEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Allen Edwards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14543)

### [Justin James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32801)

### [Jordan Naughton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36719)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
New Mexico - 78, Wyoming - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming head coach Allen Edwards and student-
athletes Justin James and Jordan Naughton. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH EDWARDS: Well, good game. I thought obviously in the first half we
played some of our best basketball, defending, also rebounding the basketball,
even within their pressure. I thought they tried to speed us up, which I
thought, at times, I thought they were successful.  
  
But the second half I thought, again, some self-inflicted wounds. I thought we
got a little bit careless with the basketball and wasn't assertive, in a sense
of trying to attack their pressure but also being smart on the other end after
taking it and getting it across half court.  
  
And then I thought they kind of wore us down a little bit in the sense of guys
probably getting a little tired. But love the fight from this group from what
they've been through all year. They've always come out with the right energy
in practice, also in games; tonight it wasn't any different. We just happened
to come out on the wrong end of it. But proud of the guys and just what they
just tried to continue to do as the season went on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Justin, about the pressure, it looked like in the first half you
handled it well. Second half they tried to speed you up. Did you get kind of
caught in that, wear you down or a combination, or how would you assess
that?  
JUSTIN JAMES: There were a few times they did speed us up -- me, A.J., Jake,
all the guards. Yeah, we did a really good job in the first half just
continuing to play our pace, get the right shots we wanted.  
  
But I feel like in the second half it was kind of like a panic because they
were making shots. So that's on me, just having the ball in my hands dictating
the pace and just making the right shots. But they did a good job. All credit
to them. That's a hell of a basketball team.  
  
Q. You mentioned they were making shots but you weren't making as many
shots in the second half. Was that part of the panic or maybe the pressure,
too, when you guys weren't making shots?  
JUSTIN JAMES: No, not really. We usually don't stress about missing shots
because all of us are confident that those shots will eventually go in. It was
mostly on the defensive side. We had a lot of turnovers that led to transition
buckets. And then we didn't rebound the ball well in that second half either.  
  
So it wasn't the offense. Coach always preaches it's not the offense; the
offense is going to be fine. But that second half on the defense is where we
lost it.  
  
Q. You guys were up 13 with about 15 to go. They had the lead five
minutes later. Have you ever been a part of just a momentum swing like that?
And I guess what other than panic do you think contributed to that in that
specific spurt?  
JUSTIN JAMES: It wasn't really like -- I played a lot of basketball in my
career. I've been a lot, a part of a lot of swings on our side and their side.  
  
But I was just trying to have my team focus in on just relaxing and playing
our game. But all credit to them. They did their job. They followed the game
plan. They won the game.  
  
Q. Vance Jackson had a personal 13-0 run, scored 17 of 20 for them at
one point. What was he doing to be so effective?  
JUSTIN JAMES: Nothing, just being aggressive. He was making tough shots, shots
that I've never seen him make before. But he's a good player. He stepped up on
the big stage and they won the game.  
  
Q. Jordan, Carlton Bragg had 22 and 20 the last game. I know foul
trouble was a big part, but what did you do to get him in foul trouble or did
you just slow Carlton down from what he did on Saturday?  
JORDAN NAUGHTON: We had a mentality going inside a little more in this game,
trying to attack him especially from the jump. I felt we did a good job on
that. Felt like on defense we slowed him down, had a lot of help from the
other four players on the court. It was a team effort.  
  
If I was in there fronting the post, we have to have backside help, or
backside guards helping us. So, really it's just a team effort, bringing the
energy, the aggression, and the physicality to the game. It's just a full team
effort.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You talked about Jackson. How big of an impact did he have? And did
he surprise you with what he was able to do or did you guys just let him get
loose? What were your thoughts on his run in the second half?  
COACH EDWARDS: Well, I mean, I thought we lost him a few times in transition.
And he got a couple looks, I want to say, at the top of the key.  
  
And no different than any basketball player, once you see the ball go in a
couple times your confidence goes up a little bit more. And then I thought he
just made some good individual moves that allowed them to gain some momentum
as a group.  
  
I thought he caught it off the block a few times made some moves. I thought he
attacked our guys off the dribble because -- that's one of the things I told
our guys after the game -- I said, when you're talking about the first half
compared to the second half was, we did a great job defending and rebounding
and taking -- for the most part taking care of the basketball in the first
half.  
  
And I thought those three areas hurt us in the second half. The rebound swing
changed. I want to say we were either up rebounding one or two, and then we
gave up some turnovers that led to easy buckets. And then I thought we didn't
do a good job of pressuring the basketball also containing it.  
  
Q. You mentioned their pressure. They pressured you guys some late in
the game over the weekend but today pretty much from the jump they extended
full court. Did that surprise you at all?  
COACH EDWARDS: I told our guys we had to be ready for anything. I thought he
had changed up just quite a bit on the year, whether it be pressure man-to-
man, 2-3 zone, 1-3-1, matchup. And I told our guys even from our first game at
their place we would have to be ready for pressure.  
  
And, like I said, I thought we did a great job handling it in the first half.
I thought the second half we got careless. Not only even in the full court. I
thought we got careless in the half court after we broke the press and tried
to make what I would call pretty passes rather than simple passes that led to
turnovers and allowed them to get back out in transition.  
  
But it wasn't like that wasn't something we covered in the sense of our press
break offense or things of that nature. But, I mean, again, I thought for the
most part, actually I thought they kind of weared us down a little bit.  
  
J.J. was on his knees a little tired. I thought Banks made some careless ones
as well. And I thought after that you're dealing with guys that are not
naturally basketball handlers. I think those are the two in our program. T.J.
is a skilled (indiscernible) 4. Trace can handle it a little bit in BP, but
they're not pure ball handlers.  
  
Q. You bring your four freshmen into this kind of setting, this kind of
atmosphere. Their only postseason experience this season. What kind of
experience do you think that will give them going forward?  
COACH EDWARDS: Well, again, I mean just on the year, they had been thrown into
the fire. And actually I thought they stepped up and they've gotten better.
Even just looking at them. T.J. -- in both games he didn't score at our place
and didn't score tonight. But I thought he actually had a good defensive game
for us.  
  
BP and Trace obviously have ability, but I thought they got in, did some good
things too, maybe got rushed a few times. And Thompson, I think he has a
bright future within the sense of what he'll be able to do as he gets stronger
and more reps of playing. I think he's going to be terrific.  
  
But just the atmosphere. Obviously the Lobos travel pretty well in the sense
of their crowd. So actually all that was talked to our guys as well. It
wasn't, like, we came in here and said, oh, man, Lobos got a lot of people.
No. We knew that they traveled well. But we had to be able to sustain
something for 40 minutes and I just didn't think we sustained it.  
  
Q. Other than staying relatively healthy, what strides does this program
need to make to get this thing back turned around?  
COACH EDWARDS: At the end of the day, even if we were healthy this year, I'm
not saying we go from four wins to top of the conference, but I think we're in
the middle of the pack. But what I thought J.J. did this year, not even from
carrying this team for so long, what he did from a leadership standpoint is
going to be well impacted with these young men.  
  
And I think the kid -- I want to say the kid, but Hunter Maldonado might be
one of the best leaders I've ever been around or potential leaders I've ever
been around from a character standpoint -- what he does on the floor, what he
does off the floor, what he does in the classroom.  
  
Not having him physically on the floor hurt. But he was just as much of a
voice to these young guys as any. So when you look at what these young kids
had to go through this year, and you're adding pieces back in -- again, it's
not like I'm sitting up here saying we go, even with next year, go from four
to where we're winning the championship.  
  
I think what's wrong, I guess, sometimes with society nobody likes to process.
And this is a part of the process. And these young men worked hard this year,
got better and they went through something that I couldn't simulate in
practice. So that can only help them going forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## April 4, 2019

  

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Texas 81, Lipscomb 66  
  
COACH SHAKA SMART: It's great to see them so happy. Our team has gone through
a lot of twists and turns this year, and those guys were extremely
disappointed with the way that we ended the regular season. So to see those
guys so happy and excited and connected with each other, really throughout
this whole tournament, it says a lot about them and a lot about their
character.  
  
Lipscomb is a really, really good team. We played them last year, and we knew
how dangerous they were coming into this game. They did a great job battling
back and fighting in the second half, but I thought Courtney Ramey was
probably the biggest difference in this game, even though he didn't score a
lot, but he did a phenomenal job on Garrison Mathews, who is one of the best
scorers in the country. You know, to hold him without a field goal for the
first three quarters of the game was huge, and that was Courtney being locked
in on the game plan.  
  
And then our seniors stepped up and played like you want seniors to play down
the stretch. Those guys had their ups and downs this year, and again, it's
great to see them finish the season, finish their careers on such a high note,
win the Championship, winning their last five games.  
  
I told the team afterwards, that's not something to take for granted because
it's not too often you get to win your last game.  
  
Q. Were you able to use the game against Lipscomb last year; were you
able to hold Garrison down for a lot of the game, as well?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: We use the tape as coaches. It's such a quick turnaround,
we didn't use a lot of it with our guys. We were selective with what we showed
them. We knew he's a guy that's constantly moving off the ball and so we
wanted to Tay attached to them.  
  
It's the first time all year we ever guarded a player and said you have
absolutely no helper responsibilities. We just said, "Courtney, stay attached
to him. You don't have to help your teammates any time you can drive or a
post-up."  
  
And they scored on the post on us early a lot, but we just felt like if we
could keep them from making threes and keep him from getting going, we'd have
a great chance to win the game.  
  
Q. Just does winning the NIT mean and what does it do for the program?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Well, first of all, it's great to win a Championship, any
time you get in any type of tournament. There's 32 really good teams in the
NIT to start this tournament.' So to be the last team standing, and to be able
to win a Championship is big.  
  
But to be honest with you, the meaning of winning here tonight is something
that's going to be determined over the next several months by our team. There
has been teams that have come and won the NIT and they have been able to use
that as an unbelievable spring board into a more successful season next year
and an NCAA Tournament tournament run. There's been teams that haven't.  
  
So we've got to make sure that we are one of those teams that -- I told Matt
and Courtney when they came off the court, I said, "You guys have experience
here in this tournament, what goes into winning, what goes into winning a
championship. Now it's something that we need to bring to bare consistently in
order to win more championships."  
  
Q. Piggyback a little bit on that, the development here on your young
players during this run, kind of elaborate on how they have grown?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Yeah, I think our young guys, freshmen and sophomores, have
really made a lot of progress. Gerald Liddell, specifically, he played more
minutes in the NIT than he played the whole rest of the year, and the problem
he had when he first got to campus was he couldn't breathe on the court. So it
was hard for him to play; he's always tired.  
  
He's gotten in better shape over time, and he's still a ways from a from being
the player we think he will be, but he came in tonight and gave us a big
contribution. All of our young guys stepped forward. And those two young
guards, Matt and Courtney, I'm biased, but I believe those guys can become
elite college basketball guards.  
  
They have got a long way to go. They have to get even more connected and help
each other, be the best players they can be, but I believe in those guys.  
  
Q. Talk about the last two games, you came out with a sense of urgency,
especially the perimeter --  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Yeah, we just wanted to defend them with great attention to
detail and effort. It's amazing what happens when you try really, really,
really hard, because there's got to be a why. There's always got to be a why.  
  
I thought the great thing about coming up here is our guys' why was each
other. They wanted to play for each other. They wanted to win together. And to
me, that's the most powerful why for any team. You know, it can be elusive
because there's so many other things that get in the way sometimes in guys'
minds, but it's pretty simple and it's pretty awesome when you get to that
point. And that's why our guys defended so hard these last couple games.  
  
Q. What did you think about the experimental rules? Do you think it
helped? Hurt? Do you like them?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: I like the rules. I was pointing out to the officials, the
foul count at one point, but I like experimenting with rules. I think it gives
a little bit more flow of the game when the team fouls start over halfway
through the half.  
  
I like the fact that there's no one-on-one, because us, sometimes that's been
an adventure.  
  
I think the wider lane and the deeper three-point wide provides better spacing
for the offense, but then again, you have to make the shots, too. We started
the game, we missed I don't know how many threes that we had taken, but it was
nice in the second half to see some of those go down.  
  
Q. You and Kerwin shared a moment when he came out in the fourth, can
you describe what was said?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: It's been -- you know, we've been through a lot together.
We came in about the same time. We didn't recruit snoop but I remember my
first week on the job, going to his house and sitting down with him and about
15 family members and just starting to get to know him.  
  
You know, he's always wanted to come to Texas. He's a kid that feels really,
really strongly about the University of Texas. He's had some phenomenal
moments. I don't think he thought he would be in college this fall. None of
them really do. But it's been four years where he's done a lot of good things
and if you look at the all-time books and steals and points and assists, he's
up there. He's in there.  
  
You know, part of that is because he's hung in there and he's played four
years. You know, helped his team in a lot of ways. But my biggest hope for him
is that he can use this experience, these last five games, to continue to grow
and continue to understand that the connection between his inner character as
a person and the strides that he makes as a basketball player, because he's
obviously really talented and I think he's got a bright future.  
  
Thank you, guys.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## April 4, 2019

  

### [Casey Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35041)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Texas 81, Lipscomb 66  
  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Obvious, credit to Texas. They were the better team
tonight. Better team usually wins. Felt like they missed some good looks early
in the game that allowed us to get some momentum and then they made some
tougher shots for the last 35 minutes or so, and they executed really well.
They had 23 assists from 28 makes. Highly efficient offense that executed what
they wanted to do. So we never really put the stops together to get enough
momentum back in the second half. We had a couple of spurts, but not enough of
it.  
  
Then, really, the game was decided on our offensive end. They did an excellent
job guarding us. Garrison, for a large part, took him out of the game,
especially until he got to the free throw line the second half, and that's
what they do the best. They showed that against TCU, and so we just really
struggled getting any offensive rhythm and not getting stops, bad formula, so
they win the game.  
  
Disappointed for our team, obviously.  
  
Q. Seems like the approach was a lot different from Tuesday it, the
three-pointers, more of an effort to get the ball --  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Not at all -- they took our threes away. They let us
make those -- we had a lot of success being close early on if we were -- gosh,
if we were seven or eight feet and about 14 points maxed out to start the
game, and a little dry after that.  
  
But even in the end, the results we got inside were good. That's really our
best option. They did a great job of just running screens and being there on
the catch and taking shots away. So we had to take what they would give us.
We're not the kind of team that can create the offense ourselves. We have to
take what they give us, and that's what they gave us.  
  
Q. Seemed like you are together -- had a little different --  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Well, first of all, thanks, Channel 5, for being here.  
  
You know, every game's different, you know, but obviously our message was the
same. We were down 14, I guess, at that last media time-out -- the momentum in
the game, there wasn't anything different about that, but you just have to go
out and play pretty well. You have a 14-point deficit at the eight-minute
timeout, you don't have a very large margin for error and that's really where
Texas deserves a lot of credit.  
  
I thought we had some good possessions and they made seemingly every three. We
just didn't put enough together to make it close or get them on their heels to
really get ourselves into the game and that's just the way it goes.  
  
But I give them a lot more credit than I do our players.  
  
Q. You've got a lot of questions this week, obvious ones -- how much do
you think this group of seniors did in this two-year stretch to answer the
questions --  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: The results speak for themselves. We can't really do
anything about them, anything that's happened in the first 125-year history of
our school. But the last three years we've played in the NCAA Tournament and
the Finals of the NIT. The more often we do that, the less people will ask,
and that's about all we can control.  
  
Q. Is it harder losing tonight, or harder knowing that you don't have a
practice?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: I told them, my real message to them was the absolute
only thing to be sad about is that it's over. That's it.  
  
We had an expectation to win the game. We thought we could win the game. We're
disappointed we didn't win the game. We're disappointed we didn't play better
but the only thing to be sad about is this team doesn't have any more days
together, and you know, but we have to finish it up -- because we maxed out
pretty well.  
  
Q. The accomplishments for Gary and Robert, how do you encapsulate their
careers?  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Yeah, those two guys, those are all offensive numbers
and that's typically the strength of our team. Garrison leaves our program on
the way to the all-time leading Division I era scorer, and Rob, two-time all-
conference player that scored well over a thousand points in his three seasons
with us, and a really nice one-, two-punch. We're not going to be as good
without those two guys on that end of the floor.  
  
What they did is they elevated the rest of them. It wasn't a two-man show. Our
team collectively did a lot of really nice things. That was the strength of
our team, even though we had some real highlight players as far as numbers
goes, the strengths of our team was the quality of depth and a lot of guys
that played their role great, and that's what makes teams -- ultimately that's
what makes teams the most successful. We couldn't have been as we were and our
bodies would not look like it does if it wasn't for Garrison and Rob; it took
a lot of guys doing a lot of things real well.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## April 2, 2019

  

### [Shaka Smart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21504)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Texas 58, TCU 44  
  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Played with great energy, continued to have a commitment to
defense. I told the guys before the game, you know, with don't want to stop
playing. We want to play one more after tonight, TCU, really gotten the better
of us the last two times we played. Our guys were really motivated to beat
them and it started on the defensive end. That was huge.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH SHAKA SMART: I thought our guys did a good job. I told them before the
game, just shake it out. Loosen up. First time playing in the Garden for a
vast majority of those guys, and then coming out of halftime, we knew that TCU
was going to make a run, make some shots.  
  
They have a really good team,, and when we called time-out and I told the
guys, you've got to change the look on your face. You've got to get back to
being the aggressors, and they did. Again, started on the defensive end. Any
time that you can hold a team to 17 points in a half is huge, and follow that
up with a pretty good second half.  
  
Q. What adjustments did you make?  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Biggest adjustment mentally was just the aggressiveness,
the mind-set we wanted to have.  
  
In terms of basketball, the biggest adjustment for us was transition defense.
The last game against them on March 9 -- got way too many points in transition
and I thought for the most part our guys did a really good job of getting back
and taking that away and making them play the halfcourt.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Yeah, you know, he's played pretty well coming off the
bench, and I thought tonight he played a really good, efficient game, other
than the free throws. He gets so mad at himself -- other than that, he played
very, very efficient. Got in the paint, was able to find some teammates and
get the other team in a little bit of foul trouble and that's what we need
from him, whether he's starting or coming off the bench. He's obviously our
leading scorer and he's a guy that has a level of athleticism to get by his
man and get the defense, and he did a good job tonight.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH SHAKA SMART: It was actually the exact same coverage that we talked
about coming into the last game. The guys executed it way better. It's amazing
what happens when the guys just take the level of ownership and pride and
doing exactly what they have to do with the patrol. Part of it was last time,
Jaxson got a little confused, he's a little overwhelmed with the pick-and-
roll, and tonight it was mostly Jericho and Dylan and those guys did a good
job of giving as much help as they could but not allow as much -- creating
baskets.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Well, the biggest thing for Courtney is his competitive
spirit and he really gives our team an unbelievable jolt with the way that he
approaches the game and the fact that he's just about winning. You know, you
wouldn't really be able to tell that he had not scored a basket the way that
he was fighting and playing. He threw the ball -- something we've got to keep
working to get better at but I thought he did do a really good job of bringing
aggressiveness on the defensive end and really finding his teammates with open
shots.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH SHAKA SMART: We ran a lot of plays for him just because we could tell
early on that he had a burst that he sometimes has to him, but we definitely
wanted him to be aggressive. He was unusually, or unusually nervous last night
and today. He kept hounding us in the gym to go and get extra shots, in
addition to the shoot around that we had. I told him, just drive the ball,
man, it's what you do well, and he did a good job of that tonight.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Yeah, he's terrific. We played them last year, actually, at
our place and they have all their guys back from that team. You know, there's
a reason that they won 29 games. Casey has done a phenomenal job with the team
but Mathews, he can really, really score the basketball. We're going to have
to do a better job on him not letting him get open looks. They do a terrific
job running offense and moving as a team, a lot of backdoors, a lot of
movement, a lot of screen action off the ball.  
  
So quick turnaround; guys need to get a lot of rest tonight, and then tomorrow
we dive into that preparation.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH SHAKA SMART: Yeah, it was tough for our team when he went out. It was
certainly tough for him. He was really, really down and disappointed in
himself. But I told him, I said, you're going to get to play again, so it's
all about how you respond when you get back out there on the floor.  
  
I thought my first game in this tournament, and in our conference tournament
games, he was a little bit sluggish. He wasn't all the way back to being
himself but our last three games, he's been terrific and very, very aggressive
and defended at a good level, which is what you want from a senior at the end
OF the year.  
  
But it's certainly not a given and you don't take it for granted, and it says
a lot about how he responded after being out.  
  
Thank you, guys.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## April 2, 2019

  

### [Gregg Marshall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17087)

### [Samajae Haynes-Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36860)

### [Markis McDuffie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30785)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Lipscomb 71, Wichita State 64  
  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: That was a tough way to end the season. We went stone
called and we got some decent looks. We got some so-so looks. We couldn't make
it or we missed, the harder it seemed to put the ball in the basket.  
  
But you've got to give Lipscomb credit. I tell you what, that's a gritty club.
Five seniors in their top nine, two juniors, and they made the play that is
they needed to make. They got the ball in the post and kicked it out for
threes. They didn't have the same issue that we had.  
  
So they come away with a victory. I thought we defended them pretty well, but
our problem was in the last eight minutes on the offensive end. So we'll have
to break the film down and figure out how we can get some better looks and
hopefully make a couple.  
  
Q. What was the biggest difference --  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Biggest difference? I don't know if there was a
difference.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: You know, I talked to him about that. I don't like
negative body language but that did show. Two of the finest gentlemen that
I've ever coached and I think Jaime thought he should have gotten the ball.
Dexter, for whatever reason, didn't throw him the ball.  
  
So their emotions spilled out there, and so we addressed it. Two tremendous
young men and I hate that that actually showed; that I saw it, too. That's why
I walked out there and said, "We're not going to have that. If you guys want
to do that, go somewhere else. We're not going to have bad body language and
show our frustration physically like that."  
  
Again, just frustration from not being able to score the basketball. And he
should have thrown it in. I don't know why he didn't but I'll have to look at
the film.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Well, it was 21-3 the last eight minutes.  
  
I don't think so. I don't know.  
  
Q. How disappointing is this --  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: You know, it's hard to be disappointed with this group.
It's disappointing that we're not playing for a championship. That's what we
came here to do. The better team won tonight, the guys that made the plays
down the stretch. It was a great basketball until the very, end but we just
couldn't put the ball in the basket.  
  
And I don't have an explanation. I'll have to watch the film.  
  
But it was dark; it was tough; it was not good, late January, early February,
and these kids just continued to work. Those two seniors continued to lead.
And the freshmen started to believe that, you know, we shoot tonight --
overall, we shoot 35 percent and 22 percent, and if we make a couple of
baskets, we win the game. We're going on. We weren't beautiful offensively but
we haven't been beautiful offensively for the whole stretch. I mean, I'm not
sure how many times we shoot over 50 percent but it's not very often.  
  
So they learned that they can win, with the defense and rebounding. Tonight we
have one more field goal, five more rebounds and we hold a tremendous team,
Lipscomb, to 71 points. You would think that would be enough.  
  
But the more we miss down the stretch, the smaller that basket came. I don't
know how many were bad decisions but a lot of them were just lack of being
able to put the ball in the basket.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Some of it was private in our locker room, but I told
them I was proud of them, I told them I loved them, I told them I loved I
would be there for them the rest of their life. I told them that they were a
bridge for what was a very, very bright fast and what I hope will be a very,
very bright future.  
  
And this was a year where we could have taken a big deep, I mean, a big dip.
We didn't make the NCAA Tournament, but the last eight, nine weeks, playing
the likes of Cincinnati twice and at Clemson and at Indiana, Lipscomb on the
road, Furman, Temple, amongst others, we went 14 out of the last 18, and we're
in Madison Square Garden playing in April.  
  
So all I can do is be thankful that I've got these guys as soldiers, and just
want to see them be successful. I think what they accomplished this year, just
simply by learning how to lead and be positive with a young group that looked
like they didn't know which end was what; they just continued to be positive.
They continued to show them that this is how Shockers play. This is how we are
going to be successful. And listen, they got a lot out of that group that's in
that locker room.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Well, I think we did it ourselves on that board, and I
can't recall guys, I think the pre conference what did we give ourselves, B,
B-, something -- it was a B.  
  
Then in the conference, finishing 10-8 after being 1-6, I think that was in
the range of a B. And then we haven't done the postseason yet. So it's got to
be somewhere in that ballpark. Obviously not an A, but it's not a failure,
either. I would put it somewhere, a B, B-, B+. I'm going to let the players
judge.  
  
But we do have pre conference and regular season conference already on our
white board in our locker room. So I think it would be hard to give us
anything lower than a B.  
  
Q. (What will you tell scouts about Markis.)  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: I'm going to tell them, first of all, he's great to be
around. He's got a joie de vivre that is like no other player that I've really
coached. I mean, he never has a bad day. He is always up. He's laughing. He's
joking. He's fun to be around, and I look forward to seeing, you know, what
life has in store for him. I know it's going to be positive and going to be
good. He's a tremendous player. Can really score the basketball. He rebounds
it. He's a really good defender, and some team will be lucky to have a guy
like him on their roster.  
  
So he's going to get some good looks. He's going to go to some camps, and it
just takes one team to fall in love with him and I think that there's a very
good possibility that that could happen.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH GREGG MARSHALL: Who is that for? You know, we have a hard road, just as
Lipscomb had a hard road. They go through the State of North Carolina like
Sherman limped through Georgia. We did -- we had our own little deal. We had
South Carolina and then Indiana, all on the road. The two teams that played
the first semifinal won six games combined on the road in some pretty tough
places. I knew it was going to be a tough game, and we certainly wanted to
win, but they made the plays down the stretch. I don't think the final score
is very indicative of that game.  
  
But in the end, I hope they do well and we wish them luck. I love their style.
I love how tough those kids are, and I think he does a marvelous job with his
team. But this group, what they accomplished down the stretch, I couldn't be
more proud. You know, it's a bunch of freshmen, really. Maybe one JuCo guy and
a sophomore that they just willed towards Madison Square Garden and New York
City, and it was fun. It was just the whole thing was fun to be a coach and
just watch them develop and mature, and enjoy the process.  
  
Q. For the players, first time in Madison Square Garden, put yourself in
contention --  
MARKIS McDUFFIE: Like you said, it started to shrink a little bit. They didn't
want to go inside because you know, we're really good inside. We had a
difficult time trying to get it in there because they didn't want to get it in
there, and like when it goes inside, everybody is trying to crash and stuff
like that. I think they made a little adjustments, but also we just didn't
make shots at the right time, and they end up getting over the hump.  
  
SAMAJAE HAYNES-JONES: They were defending us very well. When we passed it in,
they was going to dig very hard on us, and I think it's like he said, we just
wasn't really making shots, so it was easier.  
  
MARKIS McDUFFIE: I just can't believe it's over. I feel like I have another
year, you know, and it hasn't really hit me yet until I go on to my next phase
of my life. But oh, man, it's been an amazing full ride. When I wanted to
commit here, I wanted to commit so I had no regrets. I committed here, no
thoughts about transferring, no thoughts about -- because people transfer
every year.  
  
You know, I wanted to make sure, I'm loyal to their school and loyal to this
community and I have been and it's been nothing but amazing. The fans have
been unbelievable. They are like family forever now and these guys I've been
around, these are my family forever. Whenever I need, they are going to
answer. Whenever they need me, I'm going to answer. I just appreciate the
brotherhood that's been here the last four years, and especially this year,
really grown me as a man and as a basketball player, for me and Samajae, and I
just appreciate it.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
SAMAJAE HAYNES-JONES: Yes, it's just been a blessing, and just getting this
opportunity to come back and play at home, I just love playing for a coach
like this and this staff. This year was just a lot of adversity and something
I can piggyback when I get older in my life, knowing that I've been through a
lot of adversity in my life and I'm just very thankful for all of it.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## April 2, 2019

  

### [Jamie Dixon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13742)

### [JD Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37127)

### [Alex Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32825)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Texas 58, TCU 44  
  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: As I told our guys afterwards, I wanted them to focus on
our 23 wins this year and how they battled through a lot of adversity and
played through most of the conference with seven guys, sometimes six guys, and
came up with 23 wins. So I want them to remember that.  
  
This obviously was not our best performance. Disappointed in how we played and
this one is going to hurt because of the loss to Texas and how we performed.  
  
It's going to be hard. I said that, I don't know how that's going to play as
far as today, but I wanted to make sure they got that message. The game did
not go our way.  
  
Give Texas credit. They were more physical than they were and more active, and
they really good a good job guarding our penetration to keep us out of the
paint. Simply put; I thought we played defensively pretty good and
outrebounded them by a pretty good number, six, so that's a good sign you're
playing hard and doing things on offense but we were never in a rhythm. We
said that early in the game, tried some adjustments and tried some different
things and never got into it.  
  
I told them during the game, I thought there was times where we passed up open
shots and then took tough shots, and usually that's not -- those two things
don't occur but that was how we were playing and just never got into our
rhythm. Congratulations to Texas.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
JD MILLER: (Indiscernible) just executed on our offensive end.  
  
ALEX ROBINSON: Yeah, the loss -- it really hurt, obviously. I'm just proud of
our guys. We fought hard all season. I thought we fought hard this game. It's
just one of those things, unfortunately -- we fought hard.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
ALEX ROBINSON: Yeah, for sure. Washburn and Grant, they all said a little
prayer for us, and for the sacrifice and hard work everybody put in and
everybody just kind of followed. I remember before he got here, we were a
really separated bunch and he made sure we came together and we played
together.  
  
JD MILLER: You know, going back to my sophomore year when we first got in the
NIT and we had great players like Alex said, we had Brandon Parrish, standout
players, Washburn, those type deals, they held us together and coaches came in
and good things happen leading up to now.  
  
Q. What memories will you cherish most from your time at TCU?  
JD MILLER: Just the memories, my teammates, how much fun we had, the
conferences we made and the records we broke, playing in the staples centre,
we had great opportunities and I'll cherish those moments or the rest of my
life.  
  
ALEX ROBINSON: Getting to play at the Garden two out of my four years here and
getting to the NCAA Tournament and being with a winning coach.  
  
Just told them to keep their heads up, stay positive, keep up what they are
doing for next year.  
  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I just wanted to add about the seniors, those two guys,
that I was doing the radio on about them and different conversations and
different interviews, but the thing that really stands out to me is just their
toughness and their competitiveness. I don't think ear guy missed a practice
this year and over the last three years.  
  
Just iron men, just out there every single day, and whether it be games,
whether it be practices, I think that's the thing that they really brought to
the team, and believe it. Obviously I don't have an exact number, but it's
about 60, 68 wins, 69 wins in their three years, their last three years, which
obviously is a significant enough number compared to where it happened.  
  
Every day they were out there, they practiced hard and they worked hard, and
they brought energy. I just think of it as the iron men aspect they brought to
our team.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: The last couple times -- I really don't talk about it. Done
a great job -- -- the opportunity I was given at TCU. Doesn't feel good right
now as far as this loss, and that's what's so disappointing because it's just
that we've been playing so good, and we just never got in that rhythm
offensively today. That's the only thing that fuels me now.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: We thought they were more physical today in how they
played. We had one assist in the first half, so things were not going well as
far as offensive execution. We ended up with seven for the game, so I thought
we did a better job and in the second half, we seemed to have more open shots
that we didn't make.  
  
First half, I think poor excuse and great defense by then, and patience -- I
mean, we didn't reverse the ball. We didn't move the ball. We kept it on one
side of the floor, and we've been so good offensively in the last, six, seven
games, and so that's why it's troubling and hard to understand. It seemed that
it was better in the second half but yet we didn't hit the open shots.  
  
You know, it's something that's -- and I was encouraged. I was encouraged in
the second half. We came out, obviously made the run to get to five, and I
think we did -- and then we missed some open shots and encouraging the guys,
we're good, we're in good shape here, just keep doing what you're doing and
then we got into a situation where we thought we had to score quicker and
that's where it got away from us again.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Well, I don't know how many times -- you do it in the
tournament, the Big 12 Tournament. Kansas State was able to get us. I don't
know, we really wanted to make it the focus about one game, this game, not
about the last two, but I don't know if that was the right approach.  
  
I mean, we'd rather build off the confidence of beating them in the two games,
but I really wanted to look at just this one. They were a different team and
as far as watching them play, they had been shooting the ball better and more
threes, and you know, one of their guys was out. Roach (ph) didn't play in the
first game -- the second game against us. Obviously had 22, so that's a big
dip.  
  
Offensively, I did not see this coming offensively. I just don't know why we
just looked so out of rhythm, is the phrase I use, because at times we
overpassed and then at times we didn't pass, and it just was a bad
combination. If you pass up open shots, that's bad offense, too, and that's
where I thought we found ourselves a lot of times.  
  
We got -- they were scrambling. They were rotating very well, so they had
something to do with it but we just didn't have the ability to knock down the
shots in rhythm or make the right pass in rhythm that we had been doing and
been doing a pretty good job of it.  
  
Also got our stats in the last five games, six games, we're shooting a high
percentage of three. We've cut down our turnovers, but tonight, we didn't.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: I mean, been aggressive all year long. Just talk to him
about it. I don't know why we played like we did, but it's disappointing.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: Well, I mean, obviously you can look at the numbers, it's a
significant improvement. Doesn't feel like it right now but as I told our
players, you know, look at the 23 wins. Look what you did this year. Look what
you've done over the last three years, especially those two guys, JD, Desmond,
you can put in there, as well, and Alex.  
  
So they are big. Obviously the team's been a significant jump in wins and
obviously playing in a league that was a much higher level than it had been
the previous year, so there's been a significant -- I mean, the word I've
heard used now, is we're relevant now as a program.  
  
People know that we're an NCAA-calibre team, and we proved that we were but
tonight, we didn't. But obviously the progress has been substantial in a short
period of time, but again, this game is sticking with me.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH JAMIE DIXON: The job -- just don't talk about that, no point, rumors out
there. I'm just trying to get over this loss right now.

# [NATIONAL INVITATION
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NATIONAL+INVITATION+TOURNAMENT)

  

## April 2, 2019

  

### [Casey Alexander](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35041)

### [Rob Marberry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35038)

### [Garrison Mathews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35039)

  
_New York, New York_  
  
Lipscomb 71, Wichita State 64  
  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: I just tell you, all I'll say in the opening statement
is what I told our team there in the locker room there, it was really brief.  
  
I said, if there's one thing somebody asked me about our team is that we've
got tough kids. Nathan Moran had a really bad night, and I put him in to shoot
a big shot and he shot it and made it, got a hand off to Garrison, got to have
it and he tied and he makes it. He makes all his free throws down the stretch,
and our team gets seven straight stops to finish the game, and that's a tough
team, so really proud of them.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
ROB MARBERRY: To be honest with you we've been in this position a good amount
so we've seen it before. We know we can come back and when the pressure gets
on, we've been pulling through lately and we try to settle down and do what we
do and get some stops and it worked out for us.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
GARRISON MATHEWS: I went cold there for a little while, so it was good to
finally knock one down for my team and help them kind of get over the hump. We
got some key stops and big rebounds -- we had 15 rebounds which was huge for
us. So it was good to do it for the team and kind of give us a lift.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
GARRISON MATTHEWS: Yeah, it's pretty awesome having all those people here. We
had like a sea of purple come in all at once and I was pretty shocked about
it, seeing all those people come.  
  
We're really fortunate for the fan base that we have this year and last year,
too. But yeah, it was kind of disappointing after the Liberty loss, but they
are as resilient as we are coming back and cheering us on for these last
games.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
GARRISON MATHEWS: I think people should know about us now, wining conference
last year, playing UNC, pretty close to the end. And then this year, we're
still playing, we're one of four teams still playing after the first two games
of the Final Four from March Madness.  
  
So any time that a team is playing in late March and early April, it's a
pretty big deal. They are a great team and I think people can finally see that
Lipscomb is a basketball school now.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
ROB MARBERRY: I mean, like I said before, we've been there before and it's
huge to be able to trust your guys and know that they are not going to get
rattled. We didn't get down, like Coach said, we tried to be a tough team and
not worry about that kind of stuff. We play our game and hopefully usually the
outcome is in our favor.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
Garrison MATTHEWS: It's pretty awesome. North Carolina was good to us.
Honestly I think our team knows we play better on the road so been pretty fun,
trip to North Carolina here and obviously here, New York is always an
incredible place to play and Madison Square Garden is magical, so it's always
fun to play here.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: We did very little different, honestly. I actually felt
like the quality of shots in the second half was better than the first. They
just didn't go in. So that 12-minute time-out, that eight-minute time-out when
things were not going our way, two things. One, they got in a rhythm
offensively, and that's atypical of us defensively, so we just tried to gather
ourselves there and try to get a little bit more solid on the defensive end.  
  
Then I just challenged the guys to perform. You know, you can't win a game
like this against a good team without guys performing when their number is
called, and so they responded.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Well, it says a lot about our program and the current
state of it. We've got some guys with three straight 20-win seasons and an
NCAA Tournament last year AND three road wins in the NIT before we came here,
so they have accomplished a lot. Not to put ourselves on the same platform as
wish that state and what they have done, especially in the postseason, but in
the last ten years, but it's a building block for us obviously.  
  
We're going to live in the moment and enjoy every minute that we have now with
this team, but we want to be able to look back five, ten years from now and
say where it all started 2018 tournament, and 2019, great NIT run, and
hopefully they will be talking about us in that vein. I don't know if the
budget will ever get there, though.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: It's just tougher in the second half, every game you
play. Fatigue sets in. Guys tend to lose focus a little easier. Defense is on
the other end of the floor instead of right in front of you in the college
game, and so you know, and we didn't handle that part very well.  
  
They got the momentum, and they are physically strong, tough, big physical
kids. That's how they play. That's what's made their program so good for a
long time, and so they won that battle during that stretch. There's a stretch
in the first half they scored eight out of nine times and a stretch in the
second, half maybe eight out of 11 times when we weren't scoring and that's
where the score flipped.  
  
Again I told them at the 12-minute mark, I told them, we can win by ten. I
told them at the eight-minute, just keep playing. We're barely off. We just
got to be a little better on that end, a little better on that end, and just
keep playing, trust yourselves.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: All I said to them at that time-out was, what more
could you ask for. I think it was maybe a four-point game at the time, and you
know, so there's a lot of possessions left for both teams. It's real easy to
start squeezing a little bit when you get down to that time of the game, but
the team that wins close games, last media time-out games is usually, the one,
again, executes, for one; doesn't make mistakes.  
  
I thought defensively, we made no mistakes and we forced tough shots and got
first-shot rebounds and offensively we capitalized and guys made big shots. I
won't say we got great shots but we didn't have turnovers. We got ourselves a
shot and guys made big ones.  
  
Q. (No mic.)  
COACH CASEY ALEXANDER: Yeah, real hard to do for me. You know, but again, you
know, it's easy to say up here after you win a game like that, but I really do
trust our players. I never doubt where they are mentally. I never doubt their
want-to. And so it's a little easier to stay composed and it's a little easier
just to keep coaching the game. They are the ones that have to perform and
make the plays, but we try to put them in good positions to do that, and when
you've got good players and a good team that plays together, then, you know,
they are going to perform.

## March 24, 2019

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [R.J. Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36968)

### [Zion Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36804)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 77, UCF - 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Duke University head coach Mike Krzyzewski with student-
athletes Zion Williamson and R.J. Barrett.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Obviously, Johnny's team was magnificent. They were so well
prepared. That's as high a level of any team that we've played against all
year. They were men. Aubrey wasn't outstanding; he was magnificent. Our guys
hung in there. We got that seven-point lead. We missed a shot, made a
turnover, and they went on that barrage of shooting.  
  
These kids, my guys, hung in there. They hung in there because just the
momentum of the tournament, what's going on, you could be defeated right
there, and instead, they hung in there. We waited forever about the call for
the shot clock violation, and during that -- it was 2:09 left, and we talked
about these kids are made for these two minutes. They fought, and Cam hit a
huge three.  
  
The will to win of Zion and R.J., you can't measure it. It's just there, and
it's -- they're young -- we're a young group, but what they did right at the
end of that game in willing us to win was just absolutely sensational.  
  
But, again, congratulations to Johnny and his group. They certainly were
deserving of winning, also.  
  
Q. Zion, what was your thoughts on the final drive looking down at a guy
who was almost a foot taller than you when you took it to the basket?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: You know, it's March Madness. A lot's going through my mind,
but like Coach said, at that 2:09 mark when they were reviewing the play --
you know, I consider him the greatest coach of all time. When he looks at you
and tells you that you're made for this moment, it's like the most confidence
you can be given. So when I went to the basket, I knew it was going in.  
  
Q. R.J., what was going through your mind when you hit that shot at the
end off the Zion missed free throw?  
R.J. BARRETT: I was just thinking what can we do to win this game? I remember
watching March Madness and watching a whole bunch of games and seeing missed
free throws, somebody gets a rebound and a putback. So I thought, I'm just
going to try to do whatever I can to get this rebound.  
  
Q. This is for Zion and R.J. At what point in the game did you guys see
that this guy, Tacko, was going to be a different challenge than you have met
offensively and defensively?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Before the game, obviously.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We didn't overlook him.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yeah, he's 7'6".  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Or underlook him.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Like Coach said, he's 7'6". He's a big man down there, so you
just have to run the right offense for it. You know, he played great. Like,
hat's off to him. He played an amazing game, but I think we just hit some big
shots, and we were able to get the win.  
  
R.J. BARRETT: It was definitely a different challenge. Never really played
against something like that before. Definitely, it was challenging, but we
definitely hung in there. So that was great.  
  
Q. R.J., did the way Aubrey Dawkins played today, did that surprise you
at all? 32 and looked like he had that last tip.  
R.J. BARRETT: No, it didn't surprise me. I knew he was going to come out and
try to be aggressive. He really grew up with Duke, so to play against us is
probably a dream come true for him. He played his butt off, and he was tough
to stop for us tonight.  
  
Q. Zion, when the big man was on you, number 35, it looked like he did
not want to come out of the paint to cover you. Did you feel pretty
comfortable in your three-point game today?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yes, sir, and I always feel comfortable with my three-point
game because my teammates and the coaches are always telling me shoot a strong
shot, and they trust me to shoot it. So when I saw he was playing off, I was
just shooting it with confidence.  
  
Q. Can you talk about their last possession, what Coach told you in the
huddle, and kind of how that went down? It looked like they were going to hit
that tip. What did it feel like on those last microseconds?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Go out there and play like defense. You've got to play like
there's no tomorrow. Tre played great defense and got -- shoot like an off-
balance shot. Dawkins came flying in. I mean, when he tipped it, you talk
about microseconds, when that ball rolled around the rim, it looked like it
was going in, but as Coach K talks a lot about the basketball gods, they had
our back tonight.  
  
Q. When you're playing in the backyard, these situations are ones that
you really think about and want to really emulate. Now that you've been able
to do that, how does it kind of feel in hindsight?  
THE MODERATOR: R.J.?  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Did you have a backyard?  
  
R.J. BARRETT: Yeah, I used to play with the older guys. I mean, it's a surreal
feeling. I can't really describe it at all, but just to be out there on the
court, the fans and watching all the games. It's been amazing. So to be in
that situation, it's like we know it's win or go home. So we're trying to give
everything out there because, if we lose, that's it for us for the season. So
just a surreal feeling, and it's great to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys. Questions for Coach Krzyzewski?  
  
Q. Coach, you said obviously you don't like playing your guys in games.
I guess this is one of the reasons why. A long embrace with Coach Dawkins
after the game. If you could share a little bit of what you said.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I love Johnny. I'm going to start crying. That's what I told
him. I love Johnny Dawkins, and the moments, the times that we've spent
together building the program, ten years on our staff, and the connections
that we've had while he was at Stanford and Central Florida. He's a member of
-- we're family. I feel bad that they lost. I'm happy -- it's like a yin and a
yang here because they were deserving of winning. They were so good, and I'm
so proud that those kids played at the level of their coach.  
  
It's hard to describe. That's why I hate -- obviously, we're happy we won
because unless you're an idiot (laughter). Although some of you might say I
fill that description. It's a tough moment, and it will take me a little while
to get through it, to be quite frank with you.  
  
Same thing with Aubrey. You see him grow up from a little guy. You know, even
on our staff, Johnny was kind of like Nolan's father. Nolan's dad died early,
and when Johnny was the assistant for us, Nolan really looked to Johnny as a
father figure. So Aubrey for him, too, is like a brother. All these
connections, they're just hard to explain, but they're all true. That's what
makes it very difficult. And especially Aubrey, Aubrey was the best player on
the court today. He was magnificent.  
  
So there were so many good things, great things, and it was a great game
because both teams played hard. I mean, really, we haven't had a team play any
better against us than they did. They were fantastic.  
  
Q. It seemed like, when you made that time-out run at three minutes,
when you guys came out, there was more of an emphasis on getting to the
basket. It seemed like you guys were trying to get that fifth foul on Fall.
Could you just go through that scenario?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It wasn't so much trying to get the fifth foul because you
don't know how the game, the way the game was called, was very physical for
both teams around the bucket. So you really -- I think that's over analyzing a
moment. If that's what you're going to do, you're going to lose.  
  
Basically, I just tried to get the ball into the hands of my two best players,
guys that -- these two guys. And then when Cam came back in and transitioned,
Tre found him for the three. Basically, you just try to -- it's not as much
coaching as allowing your players to make you look good, and if they don't do
it, you have their backs, and our guys know that.  
  
Q. Just curious, with such a talented but young group of freshmen in the
biggest moment of their athletic career at this point with two minutes left
after the shot clock violation being reviewed, like what did you tell them to
try to keep them calm and keep them focused?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We had a lot of time, one. It was a long time to do that. And
on the court, I said, look, no matter what the decision will be made, there's
going to be eight to ten, maybe more possessions in this game. And you guys
were made for these two minutes and just be yourselves. And they are.  
  
You know, we had a lot of foul trouble, and we are young, and we're not deep,
but we're good. But we had a lot of stuff go on today that was difficult for
us, and they were still able -- and the most difficult was the other team, and
we were able to find a way to win. These kids are that -- they have it. They
have it. Hopefully, we can continue to advance, but I love who they are, and I
have confidence in them. If they didn't come through, then I got their backs,
but they did come through.  
  
By the way, just thank you for the City of Columbia; wow. What a beautiful
city. Everything about it, the arena and especially the state troopers. The
state troopers are the best. I know some of you probably don't like them
(laughter). They're really a classy -- so classy in everything that was going
on. So a thank you to all those people. Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
COLUMBIA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+COLUMBIA)

  

## March 24, 2019

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [Kristian Doolittle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34843)

### [Brady Manek](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36938)

### [Christian James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30613)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Virginia - 63, Oklahoma - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: Oklahoma head coach Lon Kruger with student-athletes Christian
James, Brady Manek, and Kristian Doolittle. Coach, a brief opening statement.  
  
LON KRUGER: Virginia dictated there early, got off to a great start. Thought
we got our feet under us a little bit after that. Virginia is good. They're
really good. I thought we had a rhythm on our offensive end. I thought they
did what they wanted to on their offensive end. As they do, they dictate to
you, and we didn't fight that quite well enough.  
  
But proud of our guys. Our guys fought like crazy throughout the year.
Opportunity to qualify for the tournament and get a good win on Friday and
didn't get the result we wanted tonight, but proud of them. These guys have
represented well, and happy for them.  
  
Q. Kristian Doolittle, they made a change in the starting lineup, put
Mamadi in the starting lineup covering you. How much did you think that
affected your ability to get to the rim and make plays?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: It changed a lot. Him being 6'10" and being very athletic,
he was able to alter my shot and block a few of them there at the beginning of
the game. Credit to him for playing really good defense. He made it really
tough on me to get the shots that I wanted, and even when I was open, just
kind of wasn't in a rhythm, just being inconsistent on my part. So credit to
them for that.  
  
Q. Brady, you had 13 in the first half. Christian James, you had 13 in
the second half. But you didn't score in the other halves. What was happening
that each of you had a really good half but struggled in the other half?  
BRADY MANEK: I just think they got us out of rhythm. They played really good
defense, solid defense. They're a good team. I had some open looks, but it
wasn't really the shot I wanted. They just played really good, and I just
think that the second half I got a little flustered, and it showed in that I
was missing shots.  
  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: As Brady said, they're a great team. They did a great job of
dictating on offense and defense. First half, I missed a couple open looks,
kind of felt good, but they didn't go in. The second half, I seen one go, and
from there, they all felt good. Credit to them. They definitely took me out of
my rhythm a little bit. They're a great team.  
  
Q. Christian James, was there any thought when you all were able to
absorb that 7-0 blow, have that run where you took the lead, did you think
that maybe you could get that punch in that might psychologically wound them
enough where you could just knock them out?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: I wouldn't say knock them out. We knew they were going to
fight. We knew it was going to be a battle from the beginning. We did go on
that run. We thought we could be able to go on another run after that, but it
didn't go like that. They did a great job on defense. Like Brady said, they
kind of took us out of our rhythm.  
  
Q. Christian James, you've played on a Final Four team. Did that look
like a Final Four team to you, that Virginia team you were playing?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Yeah. They're a great team, and they're going to the Sweet
16. Anything can happen from there. It's March, and it's all about who wants
it more. But they slowed the pace down on offense, and they run their sets
well. They do a great job on defense, helping, getting back recovering. They
doubled us on the post. They did a great job of that. They're an all around
good basketball team. That's why they're the Number 1 seed.  
  
Q. Kristian Doolittle and Brady, you're going to lose a bunch of
seniors, including the guy on your left. What do you like about what's coming
back and the core of the team that will be here next year?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: This will be a starting point, taken from this game. We
know what it takes to get here. So it will be up to me and Brady to kind of
lead the pack this next year for the new guys coming in, freshmen and
whoever's coming in. We have to tell them what it takes to get here, hold
ourselves accountable as well as holding them accountable whenever we're doing
our off-season workouts, starting from day one. You can't take anything for
granted because there's probably some things we wish we could take back to
change the outcome of the game, but you can't do that. So you have to start
from day one starting good habits.  
  
BRADY MANEK: Yeah, what he said about just we're losing a lot of good guys, a
lot of good players, guys like Christian that shoot it, guys like that can
take it to the rim. Jamuni, Miles, Aaron, they're all very good. And we have
very few of us coming back. We're going to have to have some young guys, some
JuCo guys, guys like Austin Reaves and Kerr, they're coming.  
  
Next year, we'll just have to start over, like Doo said, and just work from
the beginning.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. It looked like you played with them most of the game, but they're
clearly just a superior team. What do you need to get back to that level you
once were at? What do you need?  
LON KRUGER: Again, this group fought and did a good job, but I think you're
always looking to -- Virginia's a club, using them as a standard, that they
can score in a lot of different ways. A lot of different individuals can make
plays. They're so sound defensively. Communication-wise, they're great. Coach
Bennett does a fantastic job. So the group we got coming back and the group we
got coming in, it will be exciting to see where they go. We have to challenge
them to take this as a base and take it a step forward.  
  
Q. You had Trae Young and he went off to the NBA. You're picked 8th in
the Big 12, if I'm not mistaken, preseason. What do you think about this team
and what they were able to accomplish getting into the second round of the
NCAA?  
LON KRUGER: They did a good job. Even if you look back into the middle part of
the Big 12 where we lost five in a row, they were down and out at that point
and kept fighting and kept plugging, and we'll always have a great
appreciation for the fact they kept working. It would have been pretty easy
with the conference schedule coming up at that point. We're going to TCU, and
they're tough at home, and we were able to win there, then come back home and
beat Kansas in a big way. Then again, I thought they played as well as they
have all year against Ole Miss Friday night.  
  
So, yeah, a lot to hold their heads up. Again, you'd like to go through and
win them all, but when you get to that point where you're down and out a
little bit, to respond is a pretty good challenge and a pretty good test of
their character and their togetherness. They hung in there and had the
opportunity to play in the tournament.  
  
Q. How do you use games like this against this level of talent as
teaching moments for your team?  
LON KRUGER: Christian and Brady said -- and Jamal, who played a lot of
minutes, those guys coming back, a little different reference point. They know
what a Number 1 seed looks like more clearly now than if they hadn't played in
the tournament. They'll learn from it. They'll be a bit more motivated in the
off-season; spring, summer, fall.  
  
They're a good bunch that likes to be in the gym and likes to work. So they'll
get better.  
  
Q. Tony made a change in his starting lineup, put Diakite in to cover
Doolittle from the start. How much do you think that affected Doolittle and
the entire game?  
LON KRUGER: As Doo said, probably hard to measure, but definitely blocked a
couple three shots, changed a couple of others. I think it probably had a
pretty big impact on him. He's a long rangy defender that made Doo play a
little bit differently than he did Friday night for sure. So I think Diakite
did a fantastic job.  
  
Q. Followup to that, the way Doolittle's progressed, especially since
January, I think, he's become sort of a go to player. Is it hard for you to
win at this point in the season without him having a really good game? But
does that also bode well for the future that he can become an even more
impactful player?  
LON KRUGER: Probably so, yeah. When he or Christian, Brady, those been the
source of our scoring throughout the years. So if you take one or two of them
out of the mix, it's makes it tough, especially against a 1 seed and a very
good club like Virginia. These guys will get better. Jamal, I thought a little
uncomfortable in the first half. I thought he played much better in the second
half. It's a good experience for him to learn from and gain from. And
certainly Doo and Brady will, as well.

### [Johnny Dawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22741)

### [B.J. Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28541)

### [Tacko Fall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30561)

### [Aubrey Dawkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28523)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 77, UCF - 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: From the University of Central Florida, head coach Johnny
Dawkins with student-athletes Aubrey Dawkins, Tacko Fall, and B.J. Taylor.
First an opening statement from Coach, and then we'll have questions directed
to our student-athletes.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: It was a great basketball game. I thought both teams rose to
the occasion and played their best basketball on the stage where it counts the
most. Hats go off to them for their ability to continue to keep fighting and
competing.  
  
I was very impressed with the way that Duke, especially with freshmen, were
able to withstand some of the shots we were making, and it says a lot about
their will, it says a lot about their overall mental toughness.  
  
And with regards to our guys, I'm just very proud of them. What we were able
to do this year as far as competing at the level we wanted to compete at,
making the NCAA Tournament, winning a game in the NCAA Tournament says a lot
about our senior class because they led us all the way, and I'm just really
proud of everything they've done for our program.  
  
Q. Aubrey, if you could just sum up the last chance you had there and
what you saw and what you felt immediately afterwards.  
AUBREY DAWKINS: I had a chance at a putback on B.J.'s floater, and it just
didn't go, caught it on the rim. I mean, heartbreak. That's the only way to
sum it up. We spent all this time trying to get to this stage, and obviously
we want our journey to continue. When you invest this much in it, it breaks
your heart.  
  
Q. Aubrey, how long did it feel like that ball hung on that rim before
it fell off on that last one?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: An eternity. It was up there forever, I felt like, in slow
motion. Once I saw it go past the midpoint and roll out, it was, at that
point, nothing left to do.  
  
Q. B.J., your final shot looked like it was going to go in, as well. Can
you talk about that?  
B.J. TAYLOR: Yeah. I mean, Coach drew up the play. We executed it. We got the
shot that we wanted. It's a shot that I shoot -- you know, I've been shooting
that shot ever since I've been playing for Coach. It just didn't fall. It
kills me that it didn't fall, but I guess that's how it goes sometimes. But
that was the play. We executed it. We got the shot we wanted.  
  
Q. To all three players, if you could just quickly sum up how you guys
feel about the effort you put out there against the Number 1 team in the
nation.  
TACKO FALL: I feel like all the guys came in ready to go from the jump.
Everybody gave their best effort. Even the bench was very active throughout
the whole game, very involved. We left it all out there. I don't know what to
say right now because the emotions, but I'm very proud of the guys. It didn't
go our way at the end of the day, but we left it all out there, and that's all
you can ask.  
  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Same as Tacko. I'm very pleased with how we played. I thought
we played really hard and gave our best effort, and that's all you can ask
for. Yeah, great game for us.  
  
B.J. TAYLOR: Yeah, I mean, we left it all out there. We played as hard as we
could. I think we showed a lot of people across the country that we were a
serious basketball team and that we really could play with anybody. I know
coming into this game a lot of people had us losing by 15-plus to these guys,
and they're a great team. Like Coach said, they fought and played extremely
hard, but I think we represented UCF as best we could. I think we did
everything we could to win that game. It just came down to a couple plays.  
  
Q. Tacko, on Zion's last drive there, did you feel you had position?
Wonder if you thought you'd done enough to get a charge call there.  
TACKO FALL: I just tried to stay big and make a play. Obviously, I was in foul
trouble, so I was being careful. But I just tried to make a play and make him
miss, and it didn't go my way.  
  
Q. Two-part question, one for Aubrey, one for B.J. Aubrey, Zion said he
thought your last tip-in was going to go in, and the basketball gods had
Duke's back today. Is that just how it goes sometimes? And for B.J., was there
any contact on your final shot, and could a foul have been called?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: You miss and make shots, and you've got to live with it. We
got the opportunity, and it just didn't go.  
  
B.J. TAYLOR: My last play, it's kind of a blur. I just remember I got to the
spot I wanted to get to. Like I said, that's a shot that I shoot all the time,
and it just rimmed out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach Dawkins.  
  
Q. Coach, just what do you say to your team immediately after a game
like that?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: It's tough. We invested so much, of course, like we do every
season, and when you invest as much as we did, it's going to be a tough locker
room, and it was. But that's the way it should be. Everyone was down because
everyone knew how much we invested in and how much we sacrificed to be in this
position.  
  
So we talked about that, talked about how proud I am of my team and of our
program, and I thought we represented UCF and our community great all year
long. I thought our guys were great on and off the court, and I'm just so
proud of the men that they've been.  
  
Q. Johnny, Mike was tearing up a little bit when he was talking about
you earlier. I saw you guys shared an embrace after the game. Can you kind of
share with us a little bit about that? And did you ever envision, when he came
to D.C. to recruit you, that you'd be in a position like this having to coach
against him?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: No way. I never thought we'd be in this position. It's tough.
Like you said, we're family, and our embrace was one -- you know, I love that
man. That man, without him, I wouldn't be where I am today. So he's meant a
lot to me throughout my life, and that's what type of an embrace it was.  
  
Q. Can you describe Aubrey's performance and the shots he was making to
keep you guys in the game?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Aubrey was terrific. You've been part, you've seen us a lot
this year. He's capable of having moments like that, and he had one tonight on
one of the biggest stages you could have it on. He couldn't have picked a
better time for that for us. I thought that really helped us throughout the
game, his ability to knock down shots, open some other things up for us, and
he had a terrific evening.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, you had an historic season marking a milestone,
winning your first NCAA March Madness game. How do you build upon the success,
and what do you tell your team, especially the seniors like B.J. and Tacko?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I just thanked all the seniors, especially in front of the
team, for everything they've done for us for their careers. For us, going
forward, we need to use these type of moments to build on. Now our guys
understand what it takes to be in these moments, to be in the NCAA Tournament
team, and now we need to grow from that.  
  
We'll lose some valuable players, guys that helped do some things at UCF that
hadn't been done before, and now we need the players that are returning to
understand the importance of continuing that legacy that the seniors left
behind.  
  
Q. Coach, when you saw Aubrey's tip-in, did you think it was going to go
in? Just your viewpoint.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I did. I thought it was going to go. I thought he got a good
look at it at the end. I thought B.J.'s shot was very close to going, also.
When that one didn't go and it rolled out, I saw Aubrey come into the picture
real quick, and he had a quick tip at it, and it just kind of hung there, and
it just rolled out. As he mentioned before, it's part of our game. It's a fine
line, and he just came up a few inches short. You have a different outcome.  
  
Q. About Tacko's performance, everybody talked about Tacko and Zion
coming into this game. He dealt with some foul trouble, and you played him
with some foul trouble. Just talk about his performance today.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Tacko was amazing, and he has been for us. He's been one of
the most dominant bigs in the country. I think his last probably six weeks of
the season, I can't think of too many guys that's played any better than him
at that position. Just really, really proud of him. He was a leader in the
locker room. On the floor, he led by example. He went out there, and he would
compete for us. He had a presence on both ends. I thought he affected the game
offensively for us around the basket, and he definitely affected the game
defensively. He was terrific around the basket guarding our rim.  
  
Q. Coach, Zion's final drive to the hoop where he got Tacko fouled out,
were you comfortable with that call? And can you talk about the missed free
throw, where R.J. Barrett got the rebound?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Definitely. You have a terrific game, and I thought the game
was ref'd great. I have no issues with how the game was ref'd. It's a game you
have to make plays. Unfortunately, we just didn't make enough plays. They made
one more play than we made, and that's how it was going most of the evening.
They came up with one more big one.  
  
That's all it was. I think his drive to the basket was strong, and you have to
call what you see. I have no issues with that. So that's the nature of our
game.  
  
Q. R.J. Barrett?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: R.J. Barrett, I haven't seen that play over again, so I'm not
sure. Same thing, the ball kind of bounced his way a little bit, and the kid
made a great play. A lot of guys don't see those plays to make. R.J., you've
got to give him credit. He was staying in the moment. He made a terrific
basketball play also, the rebound putback.  
  
Q. B.J. talked about when he was out here how it kills him the shot
didn't fall. Aubrey, same thing. I wonder as a coach, for you, how long it
would take for you to kind of get over this kind of game?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I can't put a timetable on how long it will take. I just know
that, when we have games like this, we have to use them to become a better
team and a better program. So we need to use this opportunity that we had to
grow. For our players that were in that locker room that aren't seniors, for
our staff and everybody involved, we need to use this opportunity. So the
feeling shouldn't go away right away. I think that still having that feeling
is not a bad thing. We need to utilize that to become better at what we do.

### [Ty Jerome](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34923)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Virginia - 63, Oklahoma - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: With head coach Tony Bennett and the University of Virginia, Ty
Jerome, Mamadi Diakite, and Braxton Key.  
  
TONY BENNETT: Obviously, just excited to come away with a hard fought win. I
thought these guys really came to play. They played for each other
defensively. I hope -- they did it at the end of the first half all through
the second half against Gardner-Webb, and then all game they just rotated and
covered and made it hard for Oklahoma.  
  
They ran their hard stuff. You know, an uncharacteristically cold shooting
night from Kyle, but they withstood that, some foul trouble from De'Andre.
These guys that are on the podium and the guys in the locker room, they
stepped up and big plays were made and it certainly felt good.  
  
Q. Ty, it seemed like there was some carryover from the opening game.
You played very loose in this one, very relaxed, as opposed to some of the
pressure you mentioned feeling in the opening game. Did it feel a little bit
more comfortable tonight?  
TY JEROME: Yeah, but like I said, after last game, just a testament to our
coaching staff really. They're doing such a great job of giving us that
freedom offensively and just getting us to play hard but allowing us to play
free. That's just such a great job by them.  
  
Q. Braxton, what did you think when Kyle fed you that little pass there
on that one play?  
BRAXTON KEY: Kyle, he's an underrated passer. He can make a lot of plays
passing the ball, creating for teammates, stuff like that, but he just has
eyes in the back of his head. It was a good find. I should have dunked it, but
my legs were a little tired.  
  
Q. Mamadi, another big scoring game for you. Kind of what do you
attribute to your last few games scoring? What's been clicking for you?  
MAMADI DIAKITE: I've just been very patient and letting the game come to me. I
wasn't trying to force anything, pretty much.  
  
Q. This is sort of playing off of that, Mamadi. You really seemed locked
in tonight from being able to hedge past the top of the key and still sprint
back and defend in the post. Were you locked in? Was it your night?  
MAMADI DIAKITE: Yeah, I was locked in, and I was trying to respond to the
challenge Coach gave me. He started me tonight, and I wanted to prove him that
I was ready to play. So I did so.  
  
Q. Braxton, in their first game, Oklahoma was able to get to the rim
very easily against Mississippi. Obviously, the way you guys played defense,
it's designed to stop that, but how much of a focus was keeping them away from
the rim tonight?  
BRAXTON KEY: It was huge. Our coach just told us I think they got most of
their points from a two-point field goal. So just trying to get in the pack
and make it more difficult for them to get inside. When they got inside, just
post trapping their guards and try to give them different looks that they may
not have seen prior to today.  
  
Q. Ty, talk about advancing to the second weekend for the first time in
a while for this group. What does it mean to you?  
TY JEROME: It means everything to me, honestly. It's my first time in the
Sweet 16, like I said. After last game, I told you I've never been to a Sweet
16. Everyone is talking about a Final Four, but I've never been to a Sweet 16.
Just the opportunity to play with this group again for a whole 'nother week
and practicing with this group and traveling with this group, that's what
means the most, I think. Just to keep playing with this group of guys.  
  
Q. For all you guys, coach just talked repeatedly about urging you to
enjoy the joy of pursuing a championship. How much does the enjoyment grow, I
guess, game to game, round to round, as you get some momentum and you get
really into this?  
TY JEROME: Yeah, I don't think the joy necessarily grows because every time we
step on the basketball court, you have to understand how blessed you are to
play the game you love. I think it's just, like I said, another week, more
opportunity to play with the teammates you love for the coaches you love and
for the fans you love.  
  
But we're nowhere near relaxed, nowhere near satisfied. We're not even close
to our end goal. Just got to come day by day and get ready to practice on
Monday.  
  
MAMADI DIAKITE: Thinking of what he just said, we try to enjoy every step that
we have, but, again, the job is not done yet. We've got more games to go, more
preparations, and we have to know what other teams have for us. In order to
get to the next phase, we need to prepare ourselves.  
  
Q. Mamadi, you said that you wanted to respond to your coach's challenge
because he decided to start you today. When did you find out you were
starting, and what exactly did he want to challenge you to do?  
MAMADI DIAKITE: It was this morning, and I mean, starting is a big -- to me,
it's a big challenge. He's telling you, okay, you have the responsibility to
help the team, and we're trusting you. So I just answered to it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach Bennett?  
  
Q. Tony, Ty said the other day that a big reason for Mamadi's success
this year is because of how much he's grown as a person. Have you seen that,
and how has that sort of manifested in his play?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, he's matured. I think a key, I said it after the game, is
he allowed us to play Doolittle one-on-one in the post. Mamadi's quickness off
the floor to bother maybe his midrange shot and just work so we didn't have to
come and trap. That puts a lot of pressure on their defense with your ability
to shoot from three, especially their four man, Brady Manek. When we could go
one-on-one, that was significant.  
  
I think Ty made a great statement. We got off to a rocky start last game,
Mamadi, all of us, and Mamadi responded. He just kept playing and stayed
steady. So certainly maturity, resilience, those are things that -- you know,
it's just part of the maturation process that each player kind of comes at
differently, and I say it all the time. He's newer to the game, and he's young
and joyful and all those things, and to be able to handle adversity or a hard
start, that's a separator for a lot of players. He's definitely coming in the
right direction, and he was terrific yesterday and today.  
  
Q. We already asked the guys, but it seemed like maybe there was some
tightness or pressure in that opening game. Certainly, the circumstances of
the game played into that. Tonight they seemed like they played very relaxed
and free. Did you notice that? Did you notice it pregame, during the game, or
do you think I'm crazy?  
TONY BENNETT: No, only the guys in the locker room and the coaching staff who
were part of last year's team and this year's team can truly appreciate and
understand -- you know, we tried to get back to this spot. Even to be a 1 seed
and then to have to go into the situation and to be down in that game,
definitely pressure in terms of the game. So that was real. You could feel it.
And to show the resilience to kind of get through that.  
  
Then I was hopeful that they could play -- I don't think it was no worries.
There's pressure and excitement and tension to try to advance in this
tournament, that's always there, but it was a different feel. It's unlike
anything -- well, no college basketball team really in the history of the game
has had to go through that. It's our doing. We were the first 1 seed to lose
last year, and then all of a sudden to fight back and become a 1 seed, and
then to be in that situation again. You talk about trying to focus in and then
getting down, it was real. So I think those guys will have that as something
they can always draw upon to say we faced a giant and battled through it.  
  
So I think that, for sure, they were in a better place to start this game. We
tried to be in a better place. That's a credit to how Gardner-Webb played to
start the game, as well.  
  
Q. Tony, I seem to keep feeding questions that people asked before me,
but to my trained eye, this looked like one of the best games you guys have
played in a while. Everything seemed to go smoothly. The rotations on offense
and defense went well. Is that the way you saw it?  
TONY BENNETT: I thought we played enough quality basketball. We had to be
ready from the start, and we got off to a real good start, and then we had a
little trouble at a stretch there. But we were steady and got good lifts, and
again, to absorb not shooting as well from Kyle and the foul trouble from
De'Andre, different guys -- Braxton stepped up, Kihei was terrific, Mamadi.
Obviously, Ty and all the guys did the job, but I think that there was a
playing for each other defensively, as I said in my opening statement, and
sharing the ball and just trying to -- you know, you get into these possession
games trying to impose your will or outlast, and that was part of it. Both
teams were playing hard, and fortunately, we just had enough good plays and
stops at the right time.  
  
Q. Tony, when did you decide to start Mamadi? And how important was he
to that fast start and then rebounding back from that little run Oklahoma had
after you went up?  
TONY BENNETT: He started the second half against Gardner-Webb, and we thought,
well, Jack Salt is so physical, and we thought maybe he could play one-on-one
against Doolittle. But what we wanted to do offensively, I thought there was
some more scoring opportunities for how we were going to attack for Mamadi,
how to roll and get on the rim and make some plays. And then his quickness, I
thought might be a factor. That's the reason why, and that was planned on.  
  
I was mulling it over. I told him at the morning walk-through that my plan is
right now to start Mamadi, but I'm not 100 percent sure. So I had an out in
case I didn't start him, but that's how it played out.  
  
Q. Tony, you didn't mention him yet, but it seemed like Jay Huff gave
you a big lift in the first half.  
TONY BENNETT: Yes, absolutely. Terrific.  
  
Q. Two big baskets that got the crowd going and a couple of blocked
shots also defensively.  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, absolutely, Jay, his length, he scrambled. He did a good
job defensively. His dunk, the three. That's what you need in these settings
for different guys to come in and step up. We know who our main three guys are
scoring, but you saw it from Mamadi and Jay and Kihei with big baskets and
timely plays. I was going to play Jay in the second half, but our defense was
going and the matchups were right, so I did it and he was phenomenal on the
bench. He's coming. His best basketball is there. He and Mamadi are continuing
to improve, but big lift from Jay.  
  
Q. I know you're going to enjoy this one, but have you thought ahead a
little bit to Louisville and a place you're familiar with, you've been to,
you've had some great moments there in that arena?  
TONY BENNETT: Not really. Just survive and advance. Now we go and play there.
I'm not even sure who we play, if that game's over or not. So we'll get to all
that stuff. But we will enjoy the pursuit of what we're doing.

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [R.J. Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36968)

### [Zion Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36804)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our student-athletes from Duke University, Zion Williamson and
R.J. Barrett. First question on the right, front row.  
  
Q. I'm actually going to hand you my cell phone. You guys create a lot
of highlights. I don't know if you'd seen that photo from last night and just
get your reaction to that photo if you take a look at it.  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I think we both saw this photo a lot. It's something we both
do. We like to celebrate for each other, so whenever one of us gets it done,
you'll probably see the other one in the background jumping just as high as
him.  
  
Q. To that point, for both of you, what does that mean -- like what does
that photo mean to both of you? Because the other one everyone remembers is
Dwyane Wade and LeBron, when he threw the alley-oop up for LeBron, and Dwyane
Wade is already celebrating, and he can't even see LeBron throw it down. Take
us through just the connection you two have. It's almost like you're one
player on the court. You guys experience the same emotions. You have the same
energy, and you celebrate and enjoy each other's dunks, moves, points the same
way.  
R.J. BARRETT: It's cool. It's great. Definitely -- when we're winning and
making winning plays, just to see my brother out there doing his thing, doing
great, making a highlight, I've got to get excited. It's like that for all our
teammates. When someone makes a play, you've got to be excited for him.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Just like he said, it just brings energy to the table. We're
always happy to see each other do well and succeed. So when somebody makes a
big play, we don't even have to be on the court. We're going to celebrate.  
  
Q. Zion, if you've seen the picture, you may have seen this, too, from
Tacko Fall, the comment not allowing you to dunk on him, where he said I won't
allow it. I won't allow him to put me on one of his highlight tapes. Your
reaction to that?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: What is he supposed to say? Is he supposed to say like I'm
going to dunk on him? He said the right thing, but I'm not really focused on
that. I'm just focused on trying to help my team win the game.  
  
Q. On that note, regardless of what he said, he is a different kind of
player than you've seen all year. What is your impressions, kind of, what it's
going to be like playing against someone that tall and the kind of balance
between your strength and power and jumping and his just sort of raw height?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: He is a very unique player, and I got a lot of respect for
him because for him to be that size and be able to move the way he does and
have as much skill as he does, he's a great player. I think we're just going
to have to come together as a team and figure out what we're going to do to
try to stop him.  
  
Q. I'm curious, Zion, who the biggest player is that you've gone up
against in terms of height in your career. I don't know if you've faced
anybody that tall in high school? I know you've faced a few probably close to
7-footers in college. Is there anybody you've faced close to that height-wise,
like 7'6 "?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yeah, just Florida State's big man, Koumadje.  
  
R.J. BARRETT: What is, is he like 7'4" or something?  
  
Q. You said he's got to say what he's got to say, but do you find when
you're matching up with guys, that they appreciate the challenge against you?
They want to show themselves off, and they use you as the stage to do that? Or
do you find guys are a little bit intimidated? Or is there a balance between
the two?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Nobody's going to be intimidated on the court. I mean, it's
not like he came out and just said it himself, like that's the media asking
him those questions. Like I said, he's not going to sit here and say, yeah,
he's going to dunk on me, like he's a competitor, so obviously, he's going to
say he's going to block my shot. Like that's just basketball.  
  
Q. Zion, you were asked the other day about sort of dealing with the
tension over the course of the season and how your parents have kind of
prepared you for that. So I was wondering, as the season has progressed, how
have you continued to lean on that support system, and how have you gotten
better as the season's gone on?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I've definitely gotten a lot better with it as the season's
gone on. Just having my parents and, obviously, Duke staff. They help a lot
with, I mean, handling the attention because it is Duke University. They've
been doing this longer than I've been born with this attention. I feel like
coming here was the best choice with handling the attention.  
  
Q. So last night Tre said that, yes, it was an exciting win, it was the
first win. He's taking all of his energy and focusing it on tomorrow. Are you
guys giving yourselves the opportunity to kind of enjoy at least the first win
or is it all just refocusing for tomorrow?  
R.J. BARRETT: I felt like last night was the time to enjoy that win. Now today
we just have practice preparing for tomorrow's game. We've got to take it one
game at a time, and we've got to look at what's ahead and not the past.  
  
Q. R.J. and Zion, it seems like the last couple weeks in the ACC
Tournament and last night, you guys have really struggled out of the gates.
What's been a common trend for you guys in getting out slowly in those games,
and what do you guys have to do to get out strong?  
R.J. BARRETT: I think teams really take it to us at the beginning, and we
really can't let that happen. We actually have to throw the first punch and
keep throwing punches throughout the game. We've just got to come out more
focused.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Like he said, we've just got to come out more focused and
more prepared for what the team's going to throw at us because it's not like
we're only game planning against them. They're game planning against us, as
well. So I think it's just a matter of like on-time adjustments, like making
the read while it's happening.  
  
Q. Zion, I imagine that you heard about the sort of Zion Cam that was
being used for the game. I was wondering just what your thoughts were on
having something like that being used to kind of follow your action throughout
the night?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yeah, I think one of the managers might have showed me that,
but I wasn't focused on that at all. I was just focused on trying to go out
there and help my team win.  
  
Q. Kind of to piggy-back off that a little bit, R.J., you came in as the
Number 1 recruit in the country and obviously have a very bright future ahead
of you. Has it been weird for you to kind of see the attention that's been on
Zion throughout the year? And do you think in some ways maybe it's been good
for you? Would you have been as comfortable with an R.J. Cam following you
around all day? Or do you think the roles that you kind of have been put into
have suited your personalities fairly well?  
R.J. BARRETT: I mean, it's been great. I wouldn't ask for this year to be any
different. I love -- I'm very happy that he gets all that attention and people
pay attention to him. That's not going to stop me from playing my game or
whatever. No, I mean, I'm just very happy to be in the position that I'm in.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Duke head coach Mike Krzyzewski.  
  
Q. Mike, you generally do not play your former players or coaches in
regular season games. I wonder if you could elaborate on why that is and what
does that make tomorrow's game against Johnny Dawkins?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Why would you want to? They're family. If you don't have to
play against him, I'm not going to do it. But this presents an opportunity for
both of us in a great setting. So both teams are winners.  
  
Johnny's done a fabulous job of establishing his program at Central Florida.
They're having an historical year. Once the game starts, I don't look at the
other sideline. So it's all about my team, just like when he played for me.  
  
Q. Zion, for how aggressive he is, how big he is, really doesn't get
into that much foul trouble. I'm curious, what's your take on that? Why is
that that he's so able to, one, control his body, but, two, also not do what
conventionally would be a foul the way he plays?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: God is good, and God gave him extraordinary ability but also
extraordinary intelligence on how to use the ability and a work ethic to blend
the two. He's a magnificent athlete, and people just look at it as jumping.
His lateral movement and his ability to move with speed and change directions
is phenomenal. So he avoids.  
  
He probably gets fouled a hell of a lot more than they're called. In fact, I
know he does, because he's able to finish. He's one-of-a-kind. He's just one-
of-a-kind, and he's going to keep getting better.  
  
I think the arena that he'll play in, like the stage that he plays in,
elevates that. So that's been elevated this year playing in our conference,
all the big games, playing the NCAA Tournament. And then when he goes pro, it
will be elevated. It will keep getting elevated, and he'll keep learning.  
  
Q. When you have a player like Zion who's garnered the spotlight, he has
the Zion Cam and everything else, how do you as a coach kind of help him
manage that over the course of the season and stay focused on the task at
hand?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: He's very level-headed. None of that fazes him. He's all
about his team, really, and about winning.  
  
It's amazing, when people who are really good don't seek attention, they get
more. It's the people who don't necessarily have the ability, they seek
attention, and then they get pressured and all that. He doesn't seek
attention. He seeks winning and playing really well. He sees pure. He's pure,
bottom line.  
  
He's been amazing to coach and amazing to be his friend. He's got it all and
brought up the right way. He's got great parents and value system, everything.
It's remarkable, really.  
  
Q. Mike, when you have a player like Zion who does the things he does,
do you ever catch yourself --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You guys always say like Zion. Why don't you just say you
have a player named Zion. I don't have another player like Zion. If I did,
both of them would start, and we'd be really, really good.  
  
Q. That being said, do you ever catch yourself going into fan mode on
the bench sometimes --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, no, no.  
  
Q. \-- and thinking, wow, what a player?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No. My thing is to coach him. He came to Duke to be coached
and learn. And as he progresses, how we can not put a ceiling on him. Even
yesterday, we added something during the game that went real well because you
keep learning about a player, and that's how I like to coach is to keep
adjusting.  
  
Q. Two coaches on the staff at Central Florida, you got to coach. You
inherited Vince Taylor, you recruited Johnny Dawkins.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I would have recruited Vince Taylor, though.  
  
Q. I know you would. How important are they to you, and what did they do
for you in your early career at Duke?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: In Vince's case, we were going through an amazing transition
there. He was captain of my team, and we were 10-17, but I can remember in the
last game we're playing Wake Forest in the ACC Tournament. There are about
four people left in the Greensboro Coliseum, and he had 30-something points
and played his heart out. We've become great friends. I'm glad that he and
Johnny are together.  
  
And in Johnny's case, obviously, he was the start of us developing our program
at Duke. Our first great player, although in his class, there was another
great player, Mark Alarie. Don't let Bilas tell you that he was the other
great player, but he was a real good one. And then adding Amaker with
Henderson, it was just a great combination. His senior year, I'm not sure
we'll ever have a team of guys like we did in '86 where you have two head
coaches, Amaker and Dawkins. Alarie was a pro and is very successful. Bilas is
the best at what he does. Henderson is a scout for Cleveland. Billy King and
Danny Ferry have been -- Danny was an 18, 17-year pro, both of them GMs. Quin
Snyder is the head coach of Utah.  
  
What a collection of great guys who really understood the game. It's been all
uphill from then, but a really -- up mountain, let's put it that way.  
  
Q. I know Aubrey Dawkins spent some time, while Johnny was there, he'd
be in the gym with you guys. Do you have any memories of him being around when
he was a young kid?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Not really. Again, their family is really close to ours. In
fact, I think some of the family still lives in the Raleigh-Durham area. I
don't remember.  
  
Q. Were you able to follow his journey and talk to Johnny about him as
he went through high school?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Not really. You know, not really. I followed him once he went
to Michigan. I was amazed that he was not able to play for his dad at
Stanford. That's why we never recruited him. I thought -- come on. He should
be able to go there, but apparently, that didn't work out.  
  
Q. Real quick on Coach Dawkins again, 35 or 37 years ago, when you
recruited him, you were struggling a little bit early in your career.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: A lot, yeah.  
  
Q. Was he sort of the pied piper, hey, it's okay for elite players to go
to Duke?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It's not as defined as it is today with recruiting and all
that. Basically, we have to put together a great class. We actually turned --
we did not accept two kids who wanted to commit to us at guard, and I just
held off for Johnny, and it worked out. And I can remember the first time I
saw him, it was in the Jelov (phonetic) League. They used to have an outdoor
league in D.C. I was there watching him, and I said, holy mackerel, this guy
can play. And a guy named Reginald Kitchen, he's an AAU coach in Northern
Virginia. He came up to me and said, are you the Duke coach? I said, yes, I
am. He said, there's a kid better than him in the next game. I said, you've
got to be kidding me.  
  
So I watched the next game, and it's Amaker. It was amazing that on that day,
I saw my -- one of the great backcourts in the history of the game, and I can
remember Alma Amaker in the stands. It's probably a recruiting violation, but
I just waved to her.  
  
(Laughter).  
  
Is there a limit? 30-something years? Maybe not for me. And I told Mrs.
Amaker, your son's going to look great in Duke Blue. The basketball gods were
good for me that day. It was a sunny day, and I saw my backcourt.  
  
Q. Since you're talking recruiting and you're here in the state of South
Carolina --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I wasn't talking recruiting. I was talking about two of my
great players.  
  
Q. Right. The popular thinking back when Zion was going through the
process here in the state was Clemson looked very strong with him and even
leading up to his announcement day. So I'm wondering with you, can you recall
maybe a turning point in the recruiting?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, there's not -- no. I don't want to talk about recruiting.
We recruited him hard, and I think Zion always had a love for Duke. There's so
much that's said about recruiting on a day-to-day basis that doesn't have much
substance. All the things with Zion and his family were substantive. So we
never looked at it as being in a race or anything like that. It was just keep
developing a relationship with him.  
  
Q. Mike, should the NCAA put some protections in place for the kids who
jump at the G League $125,000 this summer?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Let's just wait until all that is -- all that isn't ironed
out yet. All the parties, they haven't met, and they haven't done it. Let's
give them an opportunity to do that.  
  
Q. And will you give your reflections on the one-and-done, which will
officially end but not be --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: The one-and-done is not going to end because, even if kids
come out of high school, there will still be kids who go to college for a year
who will leave after a year. So the early entry into the pros is not going
away. It just will be added that the early entry will include high school
players.  
  
But like one-and-done hasn't hurt college basketball. It's helped college
basketball. How many questions are there of Zion today? Come on. The more
talent, the more good players, and really the more -- you're not going to see
everybody just jump at that because going to college and being in all these
unbelievable programs around the country, at the schools, there's a maturation
process that takes -- that goes on both on and off the court that an 18-year-
old needs. In some respects, a 17-year-old needs. And they're much better
prepared with any amount of time they spend in college.  
  
That's not just to say financially. Part of going to the pros is not just
getting into the pros, it's staying in the pros, and you're not going to stay
in the pros unless you've got balance and you've got maturity. So you'd better
be careful that you don't just jump. You take advantage of what our
institutions have to offer and the great programs around the country have to
offer.  
  
Q. Coach, you know better than maybe anybody how important --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Don't say that, please.  
  
Q. How important leadership it.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Someone's going to say Coach K said he knew better than
anybody.  
  
Q. Well, you know how important leadership is, especially this time of
year. How have you seen somebody like Javin take to that role?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Javin's been excellent because he's improved -- I think it's
helped him improve as a player. A big part of when you have a lot of talent in
a freshman class is for the upperclassmen not to feel inferior, not to feel
less, and where they feel secure about what they do. Our freshmen have been
great about that. They're secure. And our upperclassmen have developed that.
We have a really great unit.  
  
But it doesn't just happen. It happens because those kids work together and
make each other feel that good. Just watching us at team meals and stuff like
that, everybody's sitting with everybody. Just little things. Last night, they
were having something to eat, and they were coming down at a little bit
different times, and one table had one seat available, and Antonio was sitting
at another table, not all the guys were there. Marques came down, and all of a
sudden he's getting ready to sit down. He saw Antonio, and, boom, he went to
that table. So you may think that's a little thing. It's not a little thing.
Our guys just have done that naturally, and it's been beautiful.  
  
We've loved being with this group. They've been sensational every day.  
  
Q. Coach, you coached against Johnny about four years ago in a Coaches
vs. Cancer game. I wonder if you have any memories of that game.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I don't even remember it, to be quite frank. What day is
today?  
  
Q. I was going to ask if the emotions of that day will be similar to
what's going to happen tomorrow.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: My wife didn't give me my name tag. I'm sorry. Once the game
starts, it doesn't matter who I'm coaching against, really. And then once it's
over, I don't have a rearview mirror. I'm on to the next thing. I don't even
remember it. I think we won. Did we win? Yeah. Thank you.  
  
Again, I've coached a lot of games, man. If I start trying to remember all of
them -- there's only so much space, mind space, especially as we get older.  
  
Q. Mike, what's Jack White's availability for tomorrow?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We don't think he's going to play. He had a decent workout
today with band work and that. He'll try it out probably and warm up, but I
don't think so. But Marques came out really well from yesterday's game. I
thought he did a good job, especially guarding. They have a lot of shooters.  
  
Q. Is game planning for Tacko Fall any different than maybe game
planning for the Florida State guys when you see them?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, because Florida State's -- they're both big teams, but
they play different styles, and how Leonard uses his big men, both of them,
and Kabengele is a lot different. But I think it's helped playing against
Koumadje, but Fall is stronger, bigger, and they go to him more, and he really
just takes up the paint. He does a great job.  
  
Johnny's team plays excellent defense whether he's in or not. They're a
veteran defensive team.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our student-athletes from Oklahoma, Jamal Bieniemy, Kristian
Doolittle, Christian James, Brady Manek.  
  
Q. Christian James, can you talk about playing a big role on the Final
Four team and sort of your mindset at that point thinking this is going to
happen every year and all those things, and then three years later, you
finally got another NCAA Tournament victory, and just the frustrations of
fighting through what you -- I assume you sort of expected was going to happen
a lot.  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Definitely coming in as a freshman, you don't know how hard
it is on a collegiate level to make it into the Final Four. My freshman year,
I thought we were going to go every year. It's definitely a lot harder than it
looks. I'm having great guard play and just great players on my freshman team.  
  
We had some struggles my sophomore year and my junior year, but I'm just doing
what it takes. Just hard work and dedication. I'm locking in every game. Have
to take every game seriously. I feel like this team -- we have a pretty good
team. We can do that. I feel like we can go on a big run. We got a lot of work
ahead, though.  
  
Q. This is for Brady. The numbers would indicate that yesterday was your
best -- the team's best offensive game of the season. Did you as a player
perceive it as such?  
BRADY MANEK: Yeah, I think so. I think yesterday was probably the most fun
we've had as a team. I mean, we came out, and we hit them first. Everybody
contributed, whether it was find an open guy or knocking down shots. I think
everybody played a really big role in yesterday's victory.  
  
Q. I guess this is for any of you all. Do you -- in a region that has, I
think, three double-digit seeds left, and y'all are the 9 seed here, do you
feel like a Cinderella at all because you've got to take on the top seed
tomorrow?  
JAMAL BIENIEMY: No. We expect to be in this position. That's what we worked
for all season, and we kept chipping away. That's just our expectation.  
  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Like Jamal said, we've worked hard. We worked hard all year
just to get to this point. I don't want to say a Cinderella story, but we've
worked hard, and we kind of expect to be in this situation. We just want to
take it one game at a time, lock in and focus. When the lights come on, we
just want to show up.  
  
BRADY MANEK: I don't think we want to take anybody lightly. Just we know what
we have to do. Now we have to bring energy like we did yesterday and just play
hard and play together.  
  
Q. Brady and Christian, UVA is a pack line defense. Everyone knows about
it. They play to keep teams out of the paint. You guys have a really strong
inside-out game. What do you think about that system, and what's the key to
maybe competing against that system?  
BRADY MANEK: I think just moving the ball, finding the open guy, finding a
possible mismatch here and there, just doing small things correctly and
hopefully getting better results.  
  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: You're asking me? Moving the ball, like Brady said, inside
and out, just being able to make the right play, not really forcing the issue,
like we did the other day. Being able to just take the right shot and just
trusting the offense that we have set in stone for the game.  
  
Q. This is for Christian James. Christian, Virginia is ranked among the
top ten nationally in defensive efficiency, but so too are Texas Tech and
Kansas State, teams you're very familiar with. As f.  
You have studied Virginia -- I don't know how much you've gotten into yet --
but do you see any similarities between UVA and, perhaps, Texas Tech and/or
Kansas State, especially on the defensive end?  
  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Most definitely. They're both long teams, very long, and they
play with great help defense. When we penetrate, they do a great job of
swarming to the ball. That's something that they have in similarities and
things like that. They're great teams, great teams. We've been watching them.
We've been studying them. Like Brady said, we just have to move the ball and
find the right guy, find the open man.  
  
Q. Christian James, you guys are a senior-dominated team. The four up
there, you're the only senior. Do you find yourself as a senior being more
desperate when you reach the NCAA Tournament, realizing, hey, this is my last
chance? Got a bigger sense of urgency maybe than you did before your senior
year?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: Most definitely. Most definitely. Last year and my sophomore
year, I was really frustrated. We made it to the tournament last year, but it
kind of hurt me a lot. Just looking forward and being in a situation again, I
don't want to take anything for granted. Being a senior on this team, just
making plays or just getting somebody else going, that's really big for our
team because we have a lot of great players. I just want to come out and do
whatever I can just to get a win.  
  
The energy has to be there, and I'll make sure my team is ready to play.  
  
Q. Brady, three of the last four games, you got 22, 21, and 18 points.
What's the reason for your game sort of accelerating to such consistent high
production?  
BRADY MANEK: I think just having guys like Jamal on the court with me, find an
open guy, having other threats on the court, too. They can't just face guard
me the whole time. They have other guys on this court to be threats on the
offensive end. I think just everybody having their confidence up. We played
well yesterday.  
  
Going back to the Texas and Kansas games, everybody really had their
confidence high, and I think that plays a big part in how everybody and myself
score like that.  
  
Q. This is for any one of you guys who would care to answer. If they
didn't look so much alike, would you know that the two Coach Krugers are
related just in the way they act or the way they interact?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: I mean, Kev has his own personality. We call Coach
Kruger's son Kev because they're both Krug. Kev has his own personality. He's
a young guy, so we have side conversations with him all the time. Big Krug
been through it all, so he's speaking from experience whenever he's telling us
something. We can relate to Kev whenever we're just sitting around talking or
chilling. But to answer your question, I mean, that's kind of tough. I'm
pretty sure Big Krug was just the way Kev is when he was younger. So it's kind
of hard.  
  
JAMAL BIENIEMY: I spent a lot of time with Coach Kev, and I can definitely see
some similarities, and I can see Coach Kruger acting like Kev when he was
younger.  
  
Q. For Christian James, it looks as if you had that five-game losing
streak, went to TCU, got the win. What kind of turning point was that in your
season?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: It was huge for us. We went on a losing streak, and we went
to their place and got a win, so that was big for us just to go get an away
game just to get our momentum rolling again.  
  
Q. Brady, what was missing during the five-game losing streak? Why did
that happen, and what's better now?  
BRADY MANEK: I don't know. I just think we had a few close ones, and then they
kind of brought us down, and getting that TCU win brought us back up. I think
just our confidence level was kind of low at the time, and I think winning a
few games got it back up and led to where we are now.  
  
Q. For Kristian Doolittle, want to get your impressions on Virginia's
bigs, in particular Mamadi Diakite, and what kind of challenges he brings on
the defensive end?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: Can you say their names again?  
  
Q. Mamadi Diakite, 25.  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: That's better. The Coach was telling us today all their
bigs are tall and long. They read the post on every post touch, whether it be
the bigs or guards. Passing the ball around would be very tough. Being able to
throw around hands. With that said, we have to make them pay for doubling, so
just making the right play and knocking down shots.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Oklahoma head coach Lon Kruger. We'll start questioning on the
right-hand side.  
  
Q. Coach, I was talking to your son about the experience of playing for
you, working for you. I'm just curious, as a coach who's seen all that it
entails in the business, did you want Kevin to go into coaching after
basketball, and what has that experience been like?  
LON KRUGER: It's been a great experience. What he chose to do, as any parent,
you want your kids to be happy and enjoy what they do. I'm not disappointed
that he decided to do that for sure. Surely, it was his decision. But it's
been great, from the time as a player, when a young guy or daughter leaves
home after high school, you really don't expect to be around them on a daily
basis ever again, perhaps, and we've been blessed with the opportunity to
spend a lot of time together since he graduated from high school and graduated
from Arizona State when he came back as a fifth-year grad to UNLV and now back
on the staff. So it's fantastic. You can't beat it.  
  
Q. Coach, Kihei Clark for Virginia yesterday was very active in terms of
chasing loose balls, getting steals, getting rebounds. What have you seen from
him so far, and how do you prepare for a player like that who's so active?  
LON KRUGER: He's engaged in everything. Like you say, he's active defensively.
He's alert. All the players do a great job of being alert, focused on each
possession. He keys a lot of things they do offensively. Terrific leader for
them, it appears. Does a good job on both ends.  
  
Q. Lon, how has the recruiting of international guys changed since you
first became a college coach?  
LON KRUGER: Back then, it was probably rare to have a foreign player on the
team. Now, it seems like a majority of teams have at least one from outside
the country. So just the numbers of foreign players have changed a lot. I
think the technology, the video, the information that's available today on
foreign players is much greater than it was 40 years ago for sure.  
  
Q. Do you find yourself recruiting them more through that technology, or
do you get out and get feet on the ground and go see those guys? How do you do
it?  
LON KRUGER: Usually, it's the technology. You get video on someone, and you're
intrigued, and maybe you have an international competition or you may catch
them when they're touring the United States. We did that with Matt Freeman. We
saw some video, and he was playing an event in Vegas actually that we watched
him four or five summers ago and liked him more. Usually starts with a video,
though, on someone that gives us a heads-up on someone.  
  
Q. Coach, you competed against Dick Bennett back when you were both in
the Big Ten. As you study Virginia on film, do you see Dick Bennett in what
Tony Bennett does?  
LON KRUGER: Tony does -- he's got his own standpoint for everything he does,
but certainly, how difficult it is to score, the great job they do
defensively. His dad's teams are always like that. So maybe a little bit
different style in a way, but still the difficulty in playing against him is
very similar for sure.  
  
Q. Coach, Virginia is known for its pack line defense. What have you
seen out of the defense, and have you faced anyone this year that you can
compare their defense to?  
LON KRUGER: They're very, very good. Not many people as good in the country as
they are. Probably out of our league, the two teams that are a little bit pack
line, very, very tough to score on. Texas Tech, Kansas State, probably reminds
you more in preparation than any other teams, and we had trouble scoring on
those teams. So we've got to improve for tomorrow.  
  
Q. When you're approaching tomorrow's game, do you kind of play the
psychological angle that, hey, you're the 9 seed, you can be Cinderella, or do
you go at it, hey, you play in the Big 12. You play teams like this all the
time, and we'll just have at it.  
LON KRUGER: Combination probably of the two. We want to play. We want to be
aggressive. We want to attack. We want to be dictating. We try to go into
every ball game thinking that way. Certainly we've played a lot of good teams
in the Big 12, and Virginia is every bit as good as them based on the
rankings. So, yeah, we'll go in, swing away and go ahead and try to do the
best things that give us the best chance to be effective.  
  
Q. Couple more on your son real quickly. He mentioned that earlier in
your career you were not a guy to sit. Your demeanor on the sideline has
changed. Is that older, wiser? What's behind that?  
LON KRUGER: I don't know if it's -- I don't think about how it's changed
necessarily. But, yeah, probably -- I don't know about the wiser part,
certainly the older part for sure.  
  
Q. In terms of your relationship away from the court and away from -- do
you have to guard against being too much Oklahoma basketball with him and
trying to have some other -- or do you -- is every family dinner Oklahoma
basketball related?  
LON KRUGER: I think a good mixture. Certainly, when you start the season in
early October, there really aren't any days off until it ends in April. So
it's kind of just every coach's life. I don't know that you ever go through a
day not thinking about basketball and talking about basketball. So there's
certainly a blend of that. But there's a lot of other interest, as well.  
  
Q. Coach, the numbers would indicate that yesterday was your team's best
offensive performance of the season, if not going back even farther. From a
coach's more critical eye, was that indeed the case?  
LON KRUGER: Probably one of the top ones for sure. Three weeks ago, probably
Kansas had a really good, similar type performance against Kansas in Norman or
had a good margin throughout the game and kind of played for 40 minutes. I
thought yesterday the key was being able to sustain it for 40 minutes. Getting
off to such a great start, and they made a little run to start the second
half. Then we scored quickly right on the heels of their run and kind of
widened the margin back out.  
  
I thought the guys were really focused for 40 minutes and took good care of
the ball, and shot selection was good. Like the guys mentioned, moved the ball
well and trusted each other and made good plays.  
  
Q. Christian James, I believe, was on your Final Four team as a
freshman. How much have you leaned on him this season for leadership?
Specifically in this tournament environment, how much do you lean on him to
kind of guide the younger guys?  
LON KRUGER: We've got seven or eight seniors. It's a case where collectively
they do a good job, Christian being one of them. He's played a big role for us
all year long, he's made big shots for us. I thought he really had a good game
yesterday, not just offensively, but his focus and engagement on the defensive
end and rebounding the ball and just the complete game, I thought, was really
good from him yesterday.  
  
Q. Coach, 25-year anniversary of your Final Four team at Florida. What
do you remember about that team? What did you learn from that team? Sort of
just the legacy of that team?  
LON KRUGER: It was a great group of young guys. I think probably the biggest
thing is they really trusted each other. I think they really respected the
abilities, expected one another to take care of the responsibilities. They
really came together as the year developed, a lot of confidence out of the
group, great leadership out of Dan Cross and Andrew DeClercq, Dametri Hill,
Brian Thompson, Craig Brown -- you go down the list a long way. They were very
secure with themselves and trusted each other and enjoyed playing together.  
  
Q. Lon, your teams have always run really great offense, even through
the period of time when things got really difficult to move. So I'm wondering,
now that we're like three or four years into the freedom of movement thing,
sort of really going at it from the rules standpoint; what you've thought of
that initiative and whether you think it's effective in making the game more
attractive.  
LON KRUGER: I think the intentions are great. I think people want to see
movement. They want to see scoring. I think it opened up a little bit. I don't
know that we've fully maximized on our goals. It's tough to score in the low
post, all the physicalness of that. I think that's why you see more people
going to the three-point shot. It's such a higher percentage shot. It takes a
really skilled guy to score in the low post with all the contact that occurs
on every shot. I think that's not necessarily healthy for the game. I think we
would like to maybe get back to re-examining where we're at and where we want
to go and maybe try to clean it up even a little bit more.  
  
Today a guy keeps his hands back, he can do pretty much anything he wants with
his body, in the low post especially. There's a lot of walking under, a lot of
moving into guys as they shoot the ball. So it makes it a tough to score in
there.  
  
Q. Coach, as you look at Ty Jerome and the way he sort of commands
things offensively and defensively, what challenges does he present? And
specifically, his willingness to take threes from just inside of the half-
court line, how does that enter into your defensive plan?  
LON KRUGER: He's terrific. Like you said, he can score from deep. He can get
in the paint and score. He's very, very good with ball screens and making
plays, finding big guys. He just puts the pressure on the defense all the time
because he sees the floor. He's got great vision, great imagination. Really a
good player.  
  
Q. Lon, you mentioned the difficulty about scoring in the post. When you
look at Virginia's bigs, particularly Mamadi Diakite, what do you see out of
him and the challenges that he presents?  
LON KRUGER: He's terrific. He's long, rangy in there. They've got great poise
when they catch it inside. He did a great job last night of catching it a
couple times in a crowd and just collecting himself and letting the defense
kind of make a mistake and then score. And, again, Hunter's great. Salt brings
a different dimension to it. So their big guys are good.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our student-athletes from the University of Central Florida,
Aubrey Dawkins, Tacko Fall, and B.J. Taylor. We'll open the questions from the
floor at this time.  
  
Q. B.J., I wonder if there was any talk this morning about the game last
night at all.  
B.J. TAYLOR: Yeah, we went over some of the things we did good against VCU,
some of the things we did bad, and we moved on to our next opponent. That's
our main focus right now is getting ready for the game tomorrow.  
  
Q. This is for B.J. or Tacko. If you didn't know that Aubrey was Coach
Dawkins' son, like how would you describe kind of the relationship of father
and son? Do you guys see it strictly as coach and player, or can you tell at
points that it's father-son?  
TACKO FALL: I mean, he's -- I see them not really as a father and son, but as
a player and coach. Obviously, he coaches him really hard, like he do for the
rest of us, and he treat him the same way that he treat all of us. I would say
basically pretty much all of us are his sons, the way I see it.  
  
B.J. TAYLOR: Yeah, what Tacko said pretty much. I mean, to add, Aubrey is such
a good person and such a good teammate, that he makes it easy to just like be
one of the guys and just fit in with us because of his personality and just
how he is and how he approaches every day.  
  
Q. Off that, Aubrey, what's your favorite thing about playing for your
father, and how has that dynamic kind of evolved over time?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: The best part is building our relationship. And now being a
young man in this game and having the ability -- or having the chance to be
around him at this stage in my life and my career in basketball has just been
priceless. That's what I love most, just going every day next to him and
learning from him and us getting closer as a father and son and also as a
player and coach.  
  
Q. Tacko, it seemed like last night you were maybe having some fun with
the idea that Zion might try to dunk on you in the game tomorrow. In here
earlier, he said, he kind of had fun with it too, and he said what are you
supposed to say? Do you feel like he is going to try to go at you just to
prove a point because you're the tallest player he's ever played against?  
TACKO FALL: I mean, I don't know. I don't know what his mindset is, so I
cannot speak for him, but I can speak for myself. I'm just going to go out
there and try to win the ball game and do everything I can to help my team win
the ball game. Basketball plays are going to happen. I'm going to be out there
and be aggressive and be the protector that I am. Zion is obviously a very
talented kid, great kid. I've seen nothing but positive things about him, and
great high ceiling too. And he also has great teammates, great bunch of kids,
but he's going to do his job, and I'm going to do my job, and whatever happens
happens.  
  
Q. Aubrey, you played at Michigan before you came here. Then you joined
a team with a unique player like Tacko. Did you have to relearn or adjust to
what he does to both the opposing team and how he changes your team as well?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: He just makes the game easier, which is -- that's all I can
really say. You have a guy back there that you can trust to block shots if you
get beat on the drive or a guy that's going to score 75 percent field goal
percentage at the basket. It's nice to have that, nice comfort back there.  
  
Q. Aubrey, as much affection as you know your dad has for Duke and Coach
K, do you think he'll do anything? How do you think this matchup is affecting
him, if at all?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Not -- he's a game-by-game kind of guy. Same mentality whoever
we play. The name on the jersey doesn't really matter to him. Just play our
game and focus on the win. That's really it. Yeah.  
  
Q. Aubrey, going off that, do you have any memories of -- I know you
used to spend time with him when he was a coach at Duke and being around the
team. Do you have any memories from any specific teams or any specific players
that you grew up with?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Yeah, I spent a lot of time around the guys, especially
growing up. Chris Duhon, Dahntay Jones, all kinds of players I can list off.
And just seeing them as I worked out and worked out in the gym after practice
was done or working out in the college gym. So, yeah, a lot of good memories.
It was good for my foundation to see that.  
  
Q. This is for all the players. You already made history. This was UCF's
first NCAA win. Does that kind of -- do you get to play a little looser now, a
little freer? What's the mentality going into this matchup?  
B.J. TAYLOR: It's the same mentality we've had for every game this season, to
just try to go 1-0. That's my focus for this game and the same focus we have
for every game.  
  
TACKO FALL: Same thing he was saying, we just try to go 1-0. Obviously, we
made it that far sticking to our principle, so why change it? We're just going
to keep the same mentality and move on.  
  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Yeah, what they said, just try and get a win as best we can.
Whatever we can do to get that win is the goal. Focus on our principles and
what we stick to and let the rest take care of itself.  
  
Q. For B.J., you're one game into your NCAA Tournament run now, and
you're playing one of the most storied programs in basketball history, five
National Championships, all the attention that Duke has gotten. How do you
approach that? And is it a little staggering to think what you face
tomorrow?  
B.J. TAYLOR: I mean, for us, like I said, we're going to approach it the same
way we've approached every game this season. Coach does a great job of making
us treat every game like it's a championship game, making us treat every game,
no matter who we're playing, like it's the biggest game of the season. So
we're prepared for this, and now it's just about going out there and
executing.  
  
Q. Tacko, you guys, this is your first time in the NCAA Tournament as a
group. So is there a difference in the attention paid? Does it change anything
about going through and preparing for the game and going through the game?  
TACKO FALL: We've been preparing for this moment all season. So nothing has
changed. We've been taking the championship approach to everything that we've
been doing so that, when times like this come, we will be ready. So nothing
has changed from how we approach things. We've been following the same
process, just following the coach's plan, and just taking care of business.  
  
Q. Tacko, what are the keys to using your height advantage to make sure
that you don't end up on any Zion Williamson highlight reel?  
TACKO FALL: I mean, obviously, I'm a great defensive player, but I just don't
want that game to be about me and Zion. Obviously, it's very exciting. You got
a guy who's 7'6". You got a guy who's a freak athlete, very talented. But at
the end of the day, it's a ball game. It's basketball. We can't make it bigger
than what it really is. I don't want it to be like a freak show between Zion
and I. It's bigger than that. It's UCF versus Duke. They have great players,
talented guys. We have also great players, very experienced, talented guys,
and we're going to go out there and do whatever we can to win the ball game.  
  
Q. B.J., so what would it mean to this program, to the team, to you if
you guys do win tomorrow?  
B.J. TAYLOR: It would mean a lot. That's our focus. That's what we're here to
do. Everybody is here to win. So like I said, before we get to that, we're
just getting ready for practice today and just trying to prepare to make that
happen.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Head coach Johnny Dawkins with the University of Central
Florida. Questions for coach.  
  
Q. During the season, how often do you and Mike Krzyzewski on average
talk? And when was your last conversation prior to the tournament?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, we're always going to be in touch. That's just going to
happen. I can't say the frequency, but we're always in touch. Probably the
last time, formal conversation, I want to say probably two weeks ago maybe or
less. So we had a good conversation somewhere around then, just talking about
one of our wins. He called and just kind of caught up with him, he caught up
with what we were doing.  
  
Of course, we follow each other's progress and see how each other's team is
playing and stuff. So I would say quite frequently.  
  
Q. How do you process the many ties that your team has to the Duke
program? You played there. Vince played there. Your son grew up around the
program. What kind of impact will it have on this game, and what kind of
impact will it have on how you prepare for this game?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: For us, having been a part of the Duke family, of course, it
was special. We all realized that. We all felt fortunate to be a part of it.
We all felt fortunate to play for Coach and work for Coach in my case. For my
son, growing up in Durham, that was special. He was always around the team,
always in the gym working out afterwards, so I'm sure it's a unique feeling
for him as well.  
  
It's one of those things where, for all of us, it's -- like I said, it's
awkward, too, because you don't feel -- it's someone that you've worked for,
you're very close with. Like I said before, no one looks forward to that type
of situation. It's something that happens because we're in the tournament and
it means we've done well because we're all moving forward, but it's not
something you look forward to.  
  
Q. There may be elements of what Jeff asked you to this question too.
Obviously, there's been a ton of water under the bridge, and you're colleagues
and friends now, but is there still a part of you that is like Johnny Dawkins
the freshman who showed up to Duke and he was your coach?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: That's always there. He'd probably put me on the line now, and
I'll probably start running suicides. That's just part -- once someone's
coached you, they're your coach for the rest of your life. That's how it is. I
have, of course, the utmost respect for Coach and his program. Like I said, I
was a part of it and loved it, and I love Coach. So that's easy.  
  
Q. You went through this at Stanford a few years ago when you guys
played Duke up in Brooklyn. Does that take away some of the awkwardness that
you've been through this before? Do you draw on that experience as far as
being able to set all that stuff aside and approach the game?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: No, I think it does help some that we've done this once before
where we were in this environment. It's still the same. You still don't relish
it, but it's still something you've already experienced. You understand
everything that's kind of -- that will be around this. That's a good thing for
me, and I'm sure the same thing for Coach. He's done it with several former
players before. I had never done it with Coach until that time. So it was good
to kind of understand what that was all about.  
  
Q. Johnny, you said the other day you hadn't had a lot of chance to
watch the Duke guys play. I assume that you've watched a bunch more film now
in preparation. What do you think of Zion and R.J. and Cam and the rest?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Very impressive. They don't play like freshmen. Really, really
talented young men. And I've seen a lot of freshmen over the course of my
career, of course, that have been talented. They have a certain will about
them. They have a certain togetherness about them that oftentimes only happens
with maturity and playing a lot of games together. I watch them. They seem to
have fun playing together, making each other better on the floor. A lot of
times with young players, finding that chemistry is difficult. They seem to
have found that. I think that's why they're having so much success.  
  
Q. Specifically on Zion, how do you prepare to guard a guy like him?
When you watch the tape, I assume you've seen four or five of his games. He's
playing extremely well those games you watched. How do you prepare for a guy
like him with his size? You obviously know what you have at the rim with
Tacko, but outside of the painted area, how do you prep for that?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: We have to understand that he's a great player on any level.
His skill set with his size and his explosiveness makes him unique. You're not
going to stop Zion. We don't go in, we're going to stop Zion. No, we want to
try to contain a player like that, and that's a success for you if you can try
to just contain him because he's going to find ways to score the basket. He's
going to find ways to make spectacular plays. He's done it all his life.  
  
We have to understand that we can't let that be a distraction to what we do.  
  
Q. Johnny, what are the challenges and the rewards of getting a chance
to coach your son? I'm not talking about in Pee Wee ball or AAU, but high
Division I basketball.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: It's been really special. I didn't know what to expect. I've
said this often. I really had no desire to coach him early on because I'd
worked with him every single day. We'd be in the gym after I finished work at
Duke. I'd bring him to the gym, and we trained, and when I was at Stanford,
the same thing. So we've done that pretty much all his life. So like I said,
the last thing I wanted to do, if we're doing this every single day, and now
I'm going to grab you and coach you. So I kind of avoided it. Just the timing
worked out where we could get together.  
  
The time was right, and I think he was ready as far as where his maturity
level was. I was ready where my career was. And it's been terrific. Other
coaches had told me, Steve Alford being one of the main ones, Ray McCallum,
another coach. They all said, you get a chance to coach your son, you should
do that. That always kind of stuck with me as I was coaching in my college
career when he was of age. When the opportunity presented itself, we did it,
and they were absolutely right. I've enjoyed every moment of it. It's really
been special.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it was 37, 38 years ago, but can you recall why you
chose Duke when Duke was struggling at the time when you could have gone
anywhere?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, absolutely. A few reasons. One, of course, Coach K. He
hadn't accomplished what he's accomplished now. He's arguably the greatest
college coach to coach our game, but back then I still had a belief in who I
thought he could become. He painted a really good vision for us as a team,
what he thought we could do. He painted a great vision for me, what he thought
my career could be like. So that trust in him, that person was important.  
  
And they did a great job recruiting. They spent a large amount of time
recruiting me, you know, years of developing relationships. It wasn't
something just happened that first year on a whim; they started recruiting me,
and all of a sudden, I'm going to go to Duke. It was years of recruiting. That
was a great commitment.  
  
So with his commitment, with Duke University being the institution that it
was, they made me feel real comfortable. They made me feel it was the right
decision.  
  
Q. Coach, do you get a sense of how your team, not only facing in a
tournament game, but facing the tournament's Number 1 overall seed, the Number
1 team in the country. Do you get a sense of how your team is sort of
attracted to that kind of challenge?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I think my team will come out with a sense of maturity. I
think they'll come out with a focus. And that's where they've been all year.
They've come out, and they've competed against everyone we've played against,
and that's, I think, largely because of the leadership. Our senior leaders,
guys that have been around. They've demanded that from all of our players. I
think they'll continue to lead the same way they have all season.  
  
Q. Yesterday Collin Smith played eight minutes. I wonder what you said
to him after the game and what you really need from him in this game
tomorrow.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, Collin -- every game is different. We found something
that worked well for us during the game versus VCU, and when something's
working well for you like that -- and we've done this during other games
during the season. I'm sure you know that, where minutes may be divvied out
differently, but based on our opponent and what's working well for us. So it
was a night where things were working better for us, so we stuck with those.  
  
Collin is always a player that we believe in, and we know he can make huge
contributions for us. So just based on personnel basically, and that decision
was made.  
  
Q. Coach, it seems like the last few games Frank Bertz has really
contributed coming off the bench late. Last night had a couple of threes and a
couple of big offensive rebounds. Talk about what he brings to tomorrow
night's matchup and coming off the bench for you guys late like that.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: As much as he contributes making threes, I just love his
energy and his effort. He makes a lot of winning basketball plays, a lot of
plays that can kind of go unnoticed. He'll make threes, and everyone sees him
knocking down and getting points.  
  
I just love his overall game. He plays with great energy. He plays the right
way. He plays to win.  
  
Q. Johnny, having grown up in Mike's system, is there any advantage to
you tomorrow knowing the way they like to run their sets or the way they do
things?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: It's different from when I was there coaching and when I was
there playing for him. As you know, Coach is -- he's the master of adapting to
change and times. I was there over a decade ago. This game has changed so much
since then. Coach has adapted to that. How they play now and the schemes they
use aren't the same schemes they used when I was coaching there and definitely
not the same schemes when I played for him.  
  
He's changed a lot. I've been watching a lot of tape, of course, all last
night and this morning. It's a different team. They're different players he's
coaching, and there's a different style he's utilizing to bring the most out
of those guys.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
COLUMBIA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+COLUMBIA)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Tony Bennett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18257)

### [Ty Jerome](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34923)

### [Kyle Guy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32835)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes from Virginia, Kyle Guy and Ty Jerome.  
  
Q. Both of you guys can take a shot at answering this. You're pretty
aware of guys that have come before you in the UVA program and what they've
accomplished and been able to do. In terms of your group, if you're able to
have a deep run in this tournament, what do you think that would be for your
legacy, and where do you think you guys would fit in?  
TY JEROME: Just to be in the same boat or be able to be mentioned with those
guys is a huge honor, and we're extremely thankful for that, all the wins
we've been able to achieve. But we're not really worried about entertaining
that right now. For us, it's just about trying to do everything we can for our
team. We just want to play with this group more and more, and we have to win
to be able to do that. We just want to win for us and for the coaches and
Coach Bennett really.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, we can come back to that conversation when our careers are
over. We've got more important things on our mind right now. Like Ty said, to
be mentioned with Malcolm, Joe Harris, and guys that are excelling in the
league or guys making money professionally or whatever they're doing is truly
an honor.  
  
Q. I know it's embarrassing, Kyle, asking Ty to talk about you. The
other day Kyle said he invited himself to your house when you were in high
school for the All-Star Game. You said he started following you on social
media. Kyle seems to be a unique guy in a lot of ways. He helped a guy up
yesterday, he'll congratulate people on the other team if they beat you guys.
Have you met many guys like him, and what's it like to have him as a friend?  
TY JEROME: First of all, we're teammates, not friends. Strictly teammates. It
stops there (laughter). Yeah, he's really unique, and one of the best things
about him is how confident he is in his own skin. He's not really worried
about a lot of people's opinions. He's really confident. He can annoy you a
lot, but honestly, he doesn't care really. He's super confident on and off the
court. He's funny. He's fun to be around. He's just a really unique person,
like you said, and it's fun to be around somebody who isn't worried about the
outside world.  
  
KYLE GUY: Thanks, man.  
  
Q. Kyle, how much college basketball do you watch on television during
the season? How well do you know teams at Oklahoma's level?  
KYLE GUY: We're definitely a basketball junkie group. We watch basketball
together all the time. It's kind of how we bond off the court. Playing cards
and watching basketball is what we do. We got a chance to watch Oklahoma in
Battle For Atlantis, obviously, because they were there. We've watched teams
from all over. We know they're a good team and I'm looking forward to playing
them.  
  
Q. Kyle, with a night to sleep on it, is it a relief to have finally
gotten that first round out of the way? Do you still have that pressure on you
from the fact that with all the high seeds Virginia's had the last several
years, they haven't made it to a Final Four?  
KYLE GUY: I would say the outside world is always going to try to put pressure
on you. Sometimes you can find yourself putting pressure on yourself. But
we're just trying to have -- Coach was referencing the Friday Night Lights,
"clear eyes, full hearts." So just trying to focus on what's important. We got
out of the first round my freshman year. Last year we weren't as fortunate.
This year we got the job done. So just looking forward to playing Oklahoma.  
  
Q. Kyle, I know you've mentored Kihei a little this year. Was what he
was able to do yesterday on defense, chasing after loose balls, getting
rebounds, steals, sort of a good example of the value he brings to you guys?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, he may not be scoring the most points every night, but he's a
very valuable player on this team. The little things he does is kind of Isaiah
Wilkins-esque. Obviously, he's not as big as anybody on the court, but he does
some things that -- you know, picking up full court for 33 games now, you
don't see me doing that. So he's a selfless player, and he doesn't care about
stats, and he does a lot of little things that help us win.  
  
Q. For both you guys, going back to some of those players who have come
before you, was there anybody early in your career and/or now that you stay in
touch with who's had a big influence on you in terms of the guys who came
before?  
TY JEROME: I stay in touch with everybody that we've played with, even the
guys that transferred, like Marial, D.T., Darius Thompson. So I stay in touch
with everyone really. I still speak to Devon almost every day. I speak to
London all the time, Isaiah all the time. We have a relationship with all
those guys who have left.  
  
And then even the guys we haven't played with, like Malcolm and Joe and
Justin, I spent weekends with them, too. So our alumni base, basically
everyone reaching back and wanting to see all of us succeed is great.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, that's one of the special things about this program is how all
the former players really just buy in to this program and want to give back
and come back and hang out with us and mentor us in any way they can. We're
all open ears for that kind of stuff whenever -- sometimes we don't listen to
Justin Anderson very much, but all the other players -- no, I'm kidding.
Because he's got experience and he's obviously in the league doing just fine.  
  
That's a brotherhood that this university and program has, and we're thankful
for that.  
  
Q. What kind of things do they counsel you on or what kind of mentorship
and advice do they give you?  
TY JEROME: Before the tournament, Malcolm texted me, and he said just don't
put so much pressure on yourself, continue to lead the group, and just be
yourself and trust your work. And then after the game, he texted me good job.
Now go make it through the weekend. Really just little things like that, where
he didn't have to text me. He's going through his own rehab process right now,
and for him to be worried about or be concerned about what we're doing shows
how selfless he is and shows what a great group of guys have come through
here.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, for me, I talk to Isaiah a lot, and he's just a fun-loving
guy, as you know him. He's all about taking care of your business but remember
to have fun in it. So that's what he told me leading into this tournament.  
  
Q. Oklahoma prefers a fast pace. I just wondered if you guys prefer a
pace. Secondly, they've been getting good performances from Doolittle and just
wondered about your thoughts on the inside. They got a lot of paint points
yesterday.  
TY JEROME: They probably want to play a little faster than us. We're really
about getting the best shot, and we want to keep teams out of transition, so
sometimes the game will be slower if we have preference. And I think Doolittle
has been playing great. He had a great game yesterday -- or two days -- yeah,
yesterday. So we'll have to put different matchups on him, throw different
coverages at him. They're also really balanced, too, so it's not just him.  
  
KYLE GUY: We already watched some film on them, and we're going to watch more
tonight. We don't know exactly what we're going to do, but we know they do
have a balanced offensive scoring attack. I think four guys had more than 17
yesterday, I believe. They do want to get up and down. We're fine with that.
We try to keep teams out of transition. I know we take what the defense gives
us, so whether that's fast break points or a quick shot or a late shot clock
shot, whatever is the best shot is what we're going to take.  
  
Q. Ty, how much of a benefit was it, if it was a benefit, to be
challenged the way you were for a half yesterday?  
TY JEROME: I mean, not necessarily about benefit or non-benefit. It's just
you're in the tournament, so every team is good. The whole -- you're playing a
16 seed. The game shouldn't be close, that whole stigma is kind of nonsense
because every team is good. They won their conference tournament. They came
out playing at a high level. So we had to respond. Now it's kind of just move
on. You survive and advance and focus on the next team.  
  
Q. This is for Kyle. You were talking yesterday that you're very
competitive on the court, but that isn't going to make you forget how you were
raised. Could you talk for a moment, if you don't mind, about how you were
raised?  
KYLE GUY: I have a unique family setup. So I have two stepparents and
obviously two biological parents, and they're all best friends, which is
something that you don't see. My stepdad and dad would go on road trips with
me when I was in the recruiting process. They drive down to games together.
That in itself is hen -- obviously, they butt heads, because that's just how
life is, but they keep that away from me because they want what's best for me,
and I owe them a lot for that. Then I have five siblings, which is why I wear
the number 5.  
  
We were just raised to be good people, be kind to everyone, no judgment, no
discrimination. So that's just kind of how I've always been and how I want to
try to continue to be.  
  
Q. Kyle, you mentioned seeing OU in the Bahamas. Wondering if you had an
impression of them back then and how much of a challenge do they present to
you all?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, they're a big, physical, athletic team, which against anybody
can impose their will. I think they really found their rhythm now, as compared
to Battle For Atlantis. Then again, we weren't playing at a highest level
either then. It was early in the season. They've grown and gotten a lot
better. So I think it will be a great game.  
  
Q. Kihei said that he tries to pick your brain every chance he gets and
absorb the knowledge that you have. What have you seen, how far he's come and
what improvements do you think he's made this year?  
TY JEROME: I think the biggest thing for him is that he's grown on just
understanding the value of every possession. He's always had that work ethic,
that competitiveness and that drive from day one, but I think he was a little
sloppy with the ball at certain times when he came in. Everyone who comes from
high school is just used to playing with a huge leash in high school. So I
think he's grown so much from day one in that aspect. I think that his biggest
asset to this team is his selflessness. He could care less how much he scores.
He's just all about winning.  
  
We have certain plays where he'll take -- he'll bring the ball up. He'll play
the point guard position on certain plays that don't involve ball screens, and
then the plays that do involve ball screens, he'll ask me if I want the ball.
He's just super selfless. He's all about winning. He's all about the team.
He'll give up his body for the team. And we have to tell him to be more
aggressive, too, sometimes. So just a great teammate and an ultra-competitor.  
  
Q. Kyle, we kind of joked about what people are going to ask you guys
once you get past that 1-16 game, but it was a relief for a lot of folks
yesterday. Can you break down the dynamic, it's still the NCAA Tournament,
you're not going to be relaxed now, but still getting the, quote, unquote,
monkey off your back and moving forward?  
KYLE GUY: I think how we won yesterday is a huge testament of our growth from
last year. Last year, we were in the same situation, and we panicked as an
entire program, and this year we didn't, and we took care of business and got
the job done. Yeah, we can breathe a little bit easier now, but at the same
time, it's the NCAA Tournament, so like you said, we're not relaxed. We're not
content by any means. We still have our foot on the gas and just trying to go
as far as we can.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Virginia head coach Tony Bennett. We'll start with questions on
the front right.  
  
Q. Tony, Kyle Guy seems to be sort of a different type of person. He's
very happy. He's very accessible. I've seen him go out of his way to
congratulate opponents who have beaten you guys, which is rare, of course.
Yesterday, he accidentally knocked down a Gardner-Webb player, went over and
told him it wasn't intentional. You seem to have a pretty good relationship
with him. What is it that makes him the way he is, and what is it you find
refreshing about him?  
TONY BENNETT: I think I've been fortunate to coach a lot of guys that are just
a strong character, and that comes from, I think, how he's been brought up
from his family. He is, he's a kind person. He enjoys the game. He has a love
for the game and is lighthearted. So I think that's a credit certainly to his
family. Again, he just has always been that way. He's a competitor, but yet
enjoys it and understands the big picture in regards to that.  
  
Q. Tony, I think it's fair to say maybe a portion of the fan base had
maybe been down on Kihei at times this year because of his offensive
production. Was what he able to do yesterday defensively, chasing loose balls,
getting rebounds and steals, sort of indicative of why he's continued to be a
big part of your rotation in starting?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, he's been so valuable. You can't concern yourself with the
opinion of others. He's helped us. He guards the ball hard. He scraps, and
he's made some good offensive plays for us, gives us a dimension that we
haven't had in a long time. Again, you asked specifically defensively, and
it's that, when you play against certain kinds of teams that have elite
quickness and you can set your defense with good ball pressure, that's really
important, and he's allowed us to do that.  
  
Again, offensively, he can touch the paint, and he's made some really good
plays and passes for us. He's so competitive, and he brings that. I think that
is contagious when you watch that, when you're behind that and he's setting
your defense and you're a player, I think that can be inspiring or get the
guys going. Taking charges, he's done that over the course of the year.  
  
Q. You've told us a few times this year that you've encouraged the guys
to take joy in the pursuit of a championship. You've also told us in past
years that your disappointment in losses stems from wanting your guys to win,
wanting them to experience success, Final Four is the thing that they want.
I'm curious how you strike a balance of finding joy in the pursuit of a
championship versus any pressure you feel to get some players that you
obviously care about as far as they can go.  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, we talk -- it was actually a quote in a book I read, "the
joy of competition and the fun and the pursuit of a championship." That can't
define you in terms of who you are, but it's worth it to go after it for all
you're worth. These guys have been gifted. All the players and teams in this
tournament have such gifts. It's a worthy goal to go after.  
  
Only one gets it, but I think you, as a coach, certainly you have goals and
dreams for yourself, and when you spend as much time with these young men
getting to know them, going through the ups and the downs and the battles,
it's just they're an extended part of your family, and you want to see it go
well for them and the program.  
  
So I think it's just our theme this year is united pursuit, and that's, I
think, a good way to kind of summarize what it's about. You're so united in
everything through this pursuit. That means in success, and that also means in
failure. If you can keep that balance, I think that helps, but it certainly --
it's a great desire for everyone.  
  
Q. Tony, you've taken some transfers at Virginia, and they've usually
been players who were starters at their other schools. What do you tell them
about playing time? Everybody wants to play. And also, for guys like Nigel and
Braxton, who are immediately eligible, how challenging is the pack line and
your system in general to learn so quickly?  
TONY BENNETT: I think, when you come into a program that has been fortunate
enough to have success, you just -- you have to say, do you want to be a part
of this? And you can't guarantee anything unless you know here's a spot, X
amount of minutes, but that's so fluid. You just want guys that are willing to
go get everything that they earn. Sometimes they maybe earn less than they
get, but will they be willing to be united in the pursuit of what we're trying
to do?  
  
I think there is always a learning curve when you come from a different
system. I think the experience that transfers have as playing in this game,
and they understand the physicality and the intensity -- a guy like Braxton,
who played in the SEC and played in an NCAA Tournament game or two, that's
invaluable. And he was an important part in this, I think it was 12 minutes.
Every game we've seen this year, sometimes it's more minutes, sometimes it's
less. But he understood, when he became eligible this year, when DeAndre and
some of the established guys there, it was going to be -- we'll talk about
that. We'll plug you in where we can and you'll get what you earn, and we'll
just keep plugging because he's an important part of this.  
  
Q. OU hasn't had the season it wanted until yesterday when they played
really well. They're a senior-dominated team -- six, I think, play. Did you
sense, when you watched them play or through the video, that those guys have a
sense of urgency now that they're end of the road? And in your experience, is
that a factor, do you think, in the NCAA Tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: Of course it is. Just playing high level ball at the right time.
We were in Atlantis in the early season tournament over Thanksgiving, and they
were playing a little different. Now they're playing real big. I think
Doolittle is playing the three sometimes. They have the talent. Coach Kruger
is one of the best coaches there is. When I was at Wisconsin, he was in the
Big Ten, and I've followed him and have a great amount of respect for him.  
  
What he's done with last year's team was very good, and how he's taken this
team and used the versatility as strength and how it culminated yesterday --
and other games. It wasn't just yesterday, but was impressive. So to have
experience, to have veterans and sort of that end of the road or seeing the
light at the end of the tunnel, there is certainly a sense of urgency. So they
showed it at a high level the other day, yesterday, and they cause some or
present problems matching up with them because they score in unique ways.  
  
Q. Tony, you said a moment ago Kyle is lighthearted. Is he all business
on the court, in practice and everything or do you sometimes have to remind
him that this is a business-type deal? How did you find out about him, and how
did you get him to come to UVA?  
TONY BENNETT: I think he enjoys -- there's a joy to the game. He enjoys
playing. He has fun on the court, but he's competitive, and he plays hard. I
haven't had a problem with him, say, be more business-like because he works
hard. I found out about him -- we were watching another guard, and Coach
Sanchez said, hey, look at this skinny guy on the other court. I think it was
in Chicago at an Adidas event. We kept watching. He's pretty thin. I don't
know. He kept making buckets and, again, was real competitive. You just kind
of, your eye caught him, and we followed him more and loved him and thought,
boy, he could be really good.  
  
So we got involved and weren't sure, being a kid from the Midwest, Indiana, if
we could lure him or get him interested in us, but it worked out. We
connected, and I think he really took off, I think once he committed to us,
then he became a McDonald's All-American. He was highly recruited, but I think
we got him committed, and it just went to another level. So I'm glad we got in
early, and I'm glad Coach Sanchez pointed out the skinny kid on the court to
the left of me.  
  
Q. How has Mamadi's game developed offensively over the last few years?
I think back to last season at Syracuse, he made a bunch of acrobatic jumpers,
falling away, awkward angles. Is that kind of an underappreciated part of his
game?  
TONY BENNETT: I think he's just gotten better and better. Ty made the comment
yesterday. It was a little bit of a shaky start for everyone. Mamadi's matured
in the sense that he fought through that and he gave us some play on the
offensive rebounding, some post moves and finishing, and he does have touch.
It's just in increments. It's just gotten better every year. I think it's just
maturity. It's experience. He's always, I would say, a little newer to the
game than most kids from America, and he's, again, showed great flashes, and
that's become more consistent. He had a really good outing yesterday in a big
time setting.  
  
Q. Coach, Oklahoma had a big day yesterday in paint points, and it seems
you stressed that. Do you and can you talk about that matchup?  
TONY BENNETT: We stress that on offense or defense? Keeping them out of the
paint?  
  
Q. Just the paint points. Yeah, you defensively.  
TONY BENNETT: They shot -- I think it was 62 percent inside the three-point
line from two-point range yesterday. Scoring 95 points, and I think they only
took 13 threes. That shows you their efficiency and how they run their actions
and, again, how their bigs can back you down and their guards and post you up
in play. It's going to be a war in that regard. It's kind of going to be bend
but not don't break because they have the ability to create their own, and
that's the test because they can space it.  
  
I don't know if Brady would be their four or their five, but he can space it.
Doolittle can go to work as he's working in the post. So they put some
pressure on you with that. But we have to be as good as we can at making them
shoot the contested shots. That's our goal every game defensively. That's kind
of the pack line mentality. Can you pressure the ball but be jammed up and
make people shoot the majority of their shots contested and bothered, not at
the rim.  
  
Q. Before the opener, the guys were talking about the TED talk that you
showed them, and earlier, Kyle mentioned that you quoted Friday Night Lights.
I wonder how recent that was. And also, when it comes to finding things to
motivate them or push their buttons. Do you enjoy kind of playing part coach,
part psychologist when it comes to that stuff?  
TONY BENNETT: I love movies. I love quoting movies, movie lines. Kyle loves to
quote Fletch. So there you go. Oh, he already left. He was asking -- did he
leave? He wanted to know more about Kyle's kindness. I guess I didn't give him
enough the first time. He can quote a lot of Fletch lines. Friday Night Lights
-- "clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose." Everybody knows that, and that's
such a good thing.  
  
As a coach, you're always trying to find a way -- I don't know. I can remember
quoting a line from The Karate Kid, and I'm talking to our guys, and they're
looking at me sort of blank. And I'm thinking of the original Karate Kid with
Ralph Macchio, and they're thinking the one after that. Sometimes my age shows
up, and I can't quite connect. But you try to motivate in different ways, and
I think that's the fun stuff seeing how you can connect with the guys. Some
things just click with the guys and respond. That's part of coaching --
teaching, motivating, trying to inspire them, encourage them, challenge them,
get after them. It's all mixed in.  
  
Q. Tony, you mentioned -- Kyle mentioned that, with you guys going to
the Battle For Atlantis, you saw Oklahoma then. Did you have a first
impression with them? And also, to kind of add on to that, how much do you
guys feel you've grown since that tournament, as well?  
TONY BENNETT: They were huge. The way they were playing their size. They were
one of the bigger teams. Playing now -- at the time, they would play
Doolittle, Kristian it is, at the three at times. Now they're playing them
sometimes again four, five. But I just remember their size. We did not end up
playing them. We played solid basketball, had a good tournament and ended up
winning that. So we just saw, I think it was -- they played Wisconsin. I think
we would have played the winner of that, if I can't remember, the Wisconsin-
Oklahoma game. One of our coaches said, I haven't seen a team that big.
Wisconsin had a good game against them then.  
  
Have we improved since then? I think every team improves in certain ways. I
think we've just become more settled. Different guys have stepped up. Braxton
Key has -- he's been good for us, and he's established himself more and more.
Mamadi, at times, Kihei, those guys who are a little more experienced now have
really added to our program.  
  
Q. With the Friday Night Lights reference, first, what was kind of the
message and the point you were trying to get across with that? Could you see
the guys kind of get it? Do you have any Friday Night Lights fans on the
team?  
TONY BENNETT: I don't know if the guys got it or not. No, it was the quote,
"clear eyes, full hearts, can't lose." It's just, if you clearly understand
who you are as a team, your identity and what you hang your hat on, either as
an individual player or as a team, and you have a full heart in your pursuit
of it, you can't lose. Maybe someone will beat you, but you can't lose. It's
pretty simple.  
  
I think I asked, have we got any Friday Night Lights fans? I think most of
them knew that quote, so that was the idea. Sometimes it works. Sometimes it
doesn't. But I like the movie, so it was good.  
  
Q. Tony, you mention often that you tell guys who maybe don't start or
get the full complement of minutes, be patient, your time is coming. I can't
tell you when, but it is. It's easy for you to say. How difficult is it for
them to accept that and be patient? And on the flip side, are you pleased with
the patience guys like Braxton and Mamadi and Jay have shown? Because at
times, including yesterday, they've been invaluable for you.  
TONY BENNETT: Of course, they're a huge part of that team. Every guy is so
valuable. That's the hardest thing. These guys come from high school, and
they're the main player. Sometimes delayed gratification is very hard in
today's society, with all of us, but for young people, it's the instant
gratification. Those who are willing to wait and work, it's rewarding, and
it's doing stuff for them beyond which I think will produce fruit in their
lives, way past just the season, but that is the challenge.  
  
I'm sure friends, family, hey, you should be getting more opportunities. I
think that's also why there's such a transfer. The numbers are so big. But
those usually who fight and wait it out, good things happen. I couldn't be
more proud of those guys. At times, they're playing big minutes, and their
time is still coming. Some guys -- not everybody can play 30 minutes a game or
35, but I've liked their attitudes, and I love that at just the right times,
they've stepped up.  
  
Q. Was there a tipping point for your recruitment of international
players, or has that just gradually grown as the game has grown that way?  
TONY BENNETT: When I was at Washington State, I try to think who our first --
was it Aron Baynes from Australia? I had spent some time in Australia and New
Zealand after playing. And then Kirk Penney, a guy who played for my father at
Wisconsin, is like a little brother to me, is from New Zealand. When I lived
over there, I got to know him. One of my assistants, Ben Johnson, at
Washington State played over there. So we had that connection, then we got
couple guys from Europe.  
  
When you're at Washington State, Virginia, schools, I think sometimes finding
those hidden gems, guys that are academically sound that are excited to come
over, a lot of schools are doing it. Sometimes you can find players that maybe
you wouldn't be in such a fight for here, or you would be in a fight, I'm
saying, if there's a player of that caliber. If you have connections, if you
can get to them early, sometimes you have a better chance to land them
whereas, if they're in the states, they're so exposed, and it's such a
recruiting battle. So you try to find your niches. That's what we've done.  
  
Q. What are the specific challenges with finding those guys?  
TONY BENNETT: It's connections over there. More guys are exposed over the
Internet and all that. It's just trusting people, getting your eyes on them,
getting video, all those things. Trying to assess the competition that they're
playing against, and you don't always get it right, but we've been fortunate
where some of those guys have been terrific for us.  
  
Q. If you've already been asked this, I'll get it off the transcript,
but are there advantages to being scared a little bit or being challenged the
way you were in the first half yesterday?  
TONY BENNETT: I already answered that, so get it off the transcript. No, I'm
just kidding. I didn't (laughter).  
  
You know, that was -- you felt, certainly, the way Gardner-Webb played, as I
said, was challenging because of how they use their fours and fives, the way
they're shooting, their quickness, and to get down like that and feel the
crowd turn. We were in that spot last year, and human nature says this could
happen again, but you've got to keep fighting. That was the thing that, I
don't know if it was good or not, but we just talked about that at halftime.
You got to fight. You can't panic, but you've got to fight.  
  
As I said, only the guys that played and were part of that team last year and
that were in that locker room this year and understand all that was there will
appreciate them responding the way they did in light of that. Like I said, I'm
glad that we, they, all of us could experience that turnaround in that
setting, which pressure, stress, those things, they put you in stuff, and you
see some of the best players and best athletes in the world. You can come
unravelled in that, and we have at times, and we fought through some of that
stuff and came out on the positive end. So I think that was important for
sure.  
  
Q. Kyle and Ty were talking about former players, how they stay in
touch, they mentor, they text. One, what does that give your current guys,
hearing from them? And what does it mean to you the guys who are in the NBA or
rehabbing from injuries, things like that, still take the time to be involved
in the program?  
TONY BENNETT: It's everything. It kind of leads back to the question why you
want success for the young men that you coach, because I know the kind of
young men they'll become, and I know how they're going to pour back into the
program and what they're about. So you just desperately want it. When you have
a healthy alumni base or former players that are helping your current players
or just come back and work out with our strength coach and they keep in touch
with us, that's the most -- some of the most rewarding stuff as a coach, I
would say. That's the stuff that's going to last.  
  
I see that with my father when guys from whatever teams he had, his high
school players, they'll still go and visit with him. They'll play a round of
golf, or they'll just go and sit, and my mom will make them their hot fudge
sundaes she used to make when my dad would recruit them. They'll sit and tell
stories and send me notes and all that. That's the good stuff. That's the
lasting stuff.  
  
You're bonded together through experiences with most of your guys through
life. You really are. That is so rewarding in this game. There's a lot of
things that can be challenging, but those are the memories, and I think a lot
of reason why many of the coaches do it and go through the things that we go
through. So we've got great former players all the way from my first year here
up until now. Can't tell you how good they are. You guys know that. You've
covered them.  
  
Q. Tony, the way the offense has changed this year with the sets that
you guys are using, have the new offensive sets kind of become the best sets
for the offense? Is the new stuff kind of the future of the UVA offense?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, I think you look at your personnel every year, and you
make adjustments, and a lot of the stuff was born out of either struggles
you've had in years past or, again, personnel that you have and what spots
they're in. So you're always challenging yourself as a coach. You have to keep
improving. The game changes. You have to try -- I mean, there's certain things
that are constants, but certainly those are things that I think have helped
us, and we worked hard on some of the things that have been key for us this
year through the summer, fall, during the year.  
  
Like I said, a couple things we've brought back from previous teams because we
have that kind of personnel that can use it. So it's always evolving. Is it
the future of UVA offense? Kind of depends on the personnel, but you're always
trying to move that needle.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 85, North Dakota State - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have North Dakota State head coach David Richman with
student-athletes Vinnie Shahid, Jordan Horn, and Tyson Ward.  
  
DAVID RICHMAN: Obviously, Duke was the Number 1 overall seed there, especially
in the second half, they get out in transition like that and turn you over,
they're elite. That's an exceptional team, and it was a pleasure to coach
against Coach K and for our guys to compete in that environment.  
  
More so than anything, what our guys accomplished in the last three weeks in
particular and over the last six weeks is tremendous. But that doesn't come
close to what I'm really proud of. What I'm really proud of is how they did
it. We talked a lot about representing a school, a community, a fan base, a
state the right way, and to me, these guys did it.  
  
We talk in our program a how is way greater than a what. Our guys, how they
attacked this, how they stayed the course from a group that was 2-7 at one
point, it was just an absolute pleasure to be around.  
  
Appreciate it. This is a great opportunity. Our guys stayed in the moment. I
asked them in the locker room to stay in the moment for one more minute and
challenged them to what are they going to sacrifice to put ourselves in a
position where we can be right back here next year?  
  
Q. Vinnie, Coach K just called you a dominant leader. What does that
mean hearing that from a coach of his stature?  
VINNIE SHAHID: It means a lot. A lot of it has to do with what my teammates
do. They give me confidence. They trust me with the ball. But it means a lot
to hear that.  
  
Q. Vinnie, you've known Tre for a while now. What was it like battling
it out with him?  
VINNIE SHAHID: It was very exciting. You grow up with somebody playing on the
same team as them, and then you compete with them again through high school,
and then you see them on the biggest stage there is in college basketball in
March Madness. It's very exciting.  
  
Q. Tyson and Vinnie, the stretch that Zion had at the start of the
second half was something else. Have you guys ever seen anything like that,
and how would you describe what happened there with him going off there?  
TYSON WARD: To be honest with you, the game just went by in a flash. So I
can't really tell you like what really happened at certain points in time. But
he went on a stretch where he got some rebounds, and he does what he does, and
it makes him a good player.  
  
VINNIE SHAHID: Yeah, he's a really good player. He capitalized in transition
and on the offensive boards, and he's finishing around the rim. Probably one
of the best athletes I've ever seen with my own eyes, but he's a really great
player.  
  
Q. Question for any of the players, Coach mentioned a minute ago, guys,
taking a moment in the locker room to think about what you want to accomplish
and get back here next year. What do you guys each take away from the last
three weeks building toward the future?  
VINNIE SHAHID: Coach just said it, staying in the moment a lot. If you go back
to June, we had a lot of ups and downs throughout the season, starting in June
and going 2-7 and then going 5-0 and then losing three. A lot of it was just
staying in the moment and learning and growing from those experiences.  
  
JORDAN HORN: I kind of have to agree with all that Vinnie said, kind of hit it
on the nail. But, yeah, we just stuck together through the whole process.
Since June, since we've been here in the summer, we've all had our ups and
downs personally and as a team. To get through what we went through and do it
all together as one, it's very special. We all know we want to get back to
this moment, to this stage, and make it even further. We know what we expect
from ourselves, so we'll be right back.  
  
TYSON WARD: We can take just how hard we worked, how much perseverance we went
through, and when we get back, it starts then, preparing for that first game.
Actually, that first practice in the summer or first practice in the spring,
just preparing for those big moments and those little moments.  
  
Q. To Tyson and Vinnie, can you talk about the opening stretch? You led
most of the first half and got out to a 12-5 lead. What was the feeling like
when you were executing and scoring and taking a lead against Duke here in
this scenario?  
TYSON WARD: It was just playing basketball. You know, 40 minutes were up, and
we came out teed up, ready to play, and when we played with a whole bunch of
excitement, we're a tough team to beat.  
  
VINNIE SHAHID: I feel really good. I think we were getting some stops on the
defensive end, and we were scoring on offense. So it wasn't allowing them to
get out in transition as well as they usually do. It definitely feels good to
have a lead. Only down four going into halftime.  
  
Some things we had to clean up coming out in the second half, turned the ball
over a little bit, but it feels really good.  
  
Q. Did playing against Mike Daum multiple times during the season help
you prepare for Zion, and who on your scout team had the impossible task of
trying to emulate his play this week?  
TYSON WARD: I think they're two totally different players. Mike Daum, he's a
great player himself, and Zion Williamson is a great player himself, but you
can't really compare those two. I think that you just come out and play
basketball at the end of the day.  
  
JORDAN HORN: I would say the same thing. They're both really great players,
and playing against both of them, it was nice to see them and play against
them and stuff like that, but I think they're two totally different players.
In practice, we kind of challenge each other on both ends, whether they're on
the scout team or in the rotation. With the scout team, playing against Mike
Daum, we didn't really get that much time to go over Duke as a scout, but just
pushing each other in practice was huge, and preparing was a big stage for us.  
  
VINNIE SHAHID: They couldn't have said it any better.  
  
Q. Tyson, you guys struggled in the first half and most of the second
half shooting three-pointers. That's usually your bread and butter, making
three-pointers. What did they do to make it so tough on you?  
TYSON WARD: They just weren't falling. Sometimes you get a little bothered by
their length and athleticism, but you've just got to prepare for that and
shoot your shot. You can't be overthinking sometimes. I think that's what kind
of happened a little bit. Overthinking really might have affected our shot a
little bit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Congrats on a good season. Questions now
for Coach David Richman?  
  
Q. What do you do when that second half starts and you can tell the
whole thing is about to slide down? Is there anything you can do? Or do you
just go, we gave it our best shot?  
DAVID RICHMAN: That's not what we're about, just throwing our best shot.
Obviously, it's Duke, the Number 1 seed. We knew it was coming. It's really
tough when they're so well-coached, the length and athleticism. When you get
them out in transition, we talked about it to our guys the last couple days.
They're elites, and it's hard to get a stop when that gets going.  
  
Q. On preparing for a guy like Zion, because you don't see a guy like
him ever because you can't practice --  
DAVID RICHMAN: Is there any guys like him besides him?  
  
Q. Exactly right, and you're not in the ACC, where you see him twice a
year. All those things considered and you have two days to prepare for him,
how do you prepare for him? Because it seems what you guys did in the first
half is as effective as you could have been in the first half?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I think it's just real important. We talked about. You've got
to be solid. You've got to be disciplined. You've got to make him earn it. He
hit a three, something he hasn't done at a high level this year. But early in
the second half, he got that offensive rebound off the free throw. It's things
like that that breathe life into a guy who might have been quote, unquote,
might have been struggling a little bit and just got his energy going. That's
why they talk about him being the Number 1 pick overall. He's a special
talent.  
  
Q. A whirlwind of a week for you guys. Winning in Dayton, late night
flight here to Columbia. What does it say about your team that they came out
and competed and fought the way they did?  
DAVID RICHMAN: When I asked at Selection Show for people to help tell our
story, I think it's something that I've known, our staff's known, our guys
have known. This is a terrific group. Being a student-athlete is extremely
tough. It's a lifestyle. You give up a lot of things. You've got a head coach
that's on your tail all the time asking you to be better and probably not in
this voice all the time. These kids keep showing up. They've done tremendous
work in the classroom. They're doing tremendous work in the community. Just
extremely proud to be the leader of these guys.  
  
Q. Jones against Vinnie, what do you know about their history together
and watching them battle it out today?  
DAVID RICHMAN: We were talking about it in the back. Jordan played AAU with
them. Those guys are really tight. Vinnie Shahid is like a pied piper in the
twin cities. Everybody knows Vinnie. Same with Jordan. They're at every open
gym. Whether we play somebody from Omaha or somebody from Denver, from the
twin cities, everybody knows those two guys. So it was a cool experience for
them. We want to wish Tre all the best, too. His mom is battling some cancer,
we understand. We want to wish Deb, I think she's got some North Dakota ties,
all the best.  
  
Q. Coach, to have a lead on the Number 1 overall seed and to fight for
40 minutes against that team, what does that do for your guys that you bring
back every single guy on the roster next year? What does that do for their
confidence moving forward?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I think it's just that. I think it breeds a lot of confidence
on the biggest stage against the best in the biggest tournament in one of the
greatest -- obviously, I'm biased -- but in the greatest sporting event there
is. We competed. What we've got to understand is we put up 40 minutes. We
weren't able to do that -- and by no means am I or we ever going to be about a
moral victory, but there's an extremely -- I and we can be extremely proud of,
again, a lot of things we were able to do.  
  
Q. Dave, how did you position this game with your team going in? Did you
say, guys, we're going to go in and win the game, we're going to play our best
and see what happens? How did you approach the game philosophically with your
team when you started talking with them about it once you knew you were going
to play after Wednesday's game?  
DAVID RICHMAN: We talked about three things. Do the necessary, do the
possible, and you will achieve the impossible. When you tie in the necessary
and the possible -- it wasn't necessarily that we thought it was impossible,
it was everybody else thought it was impossible. I get it. I get the
percentages. I get the rankings, all those things. But it's just a weird
feeling being around our group, and you could see it. You saw it Wednesday
night. You saw it in the tournament, the poise and the confidence they play
with down the stretch. It just never felt like you were going to get beat
until they really got going and things got out of hand in the second half.  
  
Q. I think you shot about 13 percent on three-pointers in the first
half, which is not your norm. Did you almost feel like you could have had a
lead at halftime if you'd have made some more threes? You were only down four,
I think, at halftime.  
DAVID RICHMAN: Yeah, but that's Duke. The length and athleticism is something
that we don't see. You have to experience those things. You get sped up. I
give Tyson a lot of credit in his answer to it, but they have the ability with
their length and athleticism to speed you up, and that's what happened here
this evening.

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [R.J. Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36968)

### [Zion Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36804)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Duke - 85, North Dakota State - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: From Duke University, head coach Mike Krzyzewski with student-
athletes Zion Williamson and R.J. Barrett. First, an opening statement from
Coach Krzyzewski.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I thought we beat a really good team today, a championship
team. The last month of their season, I thought they were the best team in
their league. They lost a heartbreaking game against South Dakota State at
home, which they dominated, and really, that knocked them back a couple games,
I think. They got it back, and they've been playing beautiful basketball. I've
watched at least six of their games.  
  
Extremely well-coached. The kid, Shahid, is a dominant leader, and he played
so well today, especially in the first half. They don't turn the ball over.
They make you play defense and then multiple shooters, multiple scorers, well-
conceived. They're good. They're very good.  
  
I thought we started out just taking jump shots and not working the ball. Once
you get behind, there's the confidence level of the other team and the
pressure of the game. I thought our defense then picked up for the rest of the
game after about ten minutes. In the second half, we played just beautiful
basketball for those 12 minutes, and then we subbed, and they subbed.  
  
But it was a good game for us and applaud them. They return, everybody, watch
out, man. Watch out. They're going to be that team in their conference. That's
my prediction.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions to the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Zion, for you, there's obviously a lot of attention on you. Nothing
different there, but to be in your home state, to deal with this, and then to
come out the way you guys did in the second half, how did that feel for you?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Obviously, it's nice to be in my home state, but like I said
in our last press conference, I can't put my personal happiness before my
teammates. We did start out very sluggish. We weren't playing very well. But I
think in the second half we calmed down, and we just started playing Duke
basketball.  
  
Q. This is for both players. Going into the game tonight, it's your
first tournament, was there any nerves, excitement? Or how did you feel going
into tonight's game?  
R.J. BARRETT: I felt like we were excited, definitely excited to play. We've
all been growing up watching the tournament for many years, and we're excited
to get out there and just -- we didn't really have as much energy. We weren't
really playing as well at the beginning. Thankfully, we were able to pick it
up.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Like R.J. said, I think we were very excited because,
especially for me, I remember watching March Madness, like live-streaming it
in high school and middle school, just watching the intense games and telling
myself I was going to be a part of that. So I think last night, when I was
sitting in my hotel room, I'm like, wow, I'm actually here. It's very
exciting. But you've got to put the excitement aside and just go out there and
try to get the win.  
  
Q. Zion, to start the second half, you were on a stretch where you had a
dunk, you had the steal, picked up the loose ball and went down and made the
layup. You had quite a stretch there where you kind of almost took the game
over by yourself. Can you explain what happened there and what led to that?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Before that even happened, my teammates were in my ear. They
were just like be me, like be myself. My teammates, and obviously coach said
the same thing. When they're constantly telling you to be yourself, it just
gives you energy, and I just try to bring energy for my team. I think in those
situations I just happened to be in the right spot. Like R.J. could have did
the same thing.  
  
Q. For R.J. and Zion, I'm curious, you guys talked -- or Coach K talked
the other day about talent helping talent. I wonder if you could talk about
what your relationship has been like this year or how each other have helped
each other's games throughout the season.  
R.J. BARRETT: It's been great, definitely playing with this team, playing with
Zion. Especially for me, we had a little joke that, whenever I'm in trouble,
he always bails me out. Every time I get stuck, he always cuts, and I can just
throw it anywhere and get it to him. So we definitely bail each other out, and
it's been a lot of fun to play with him.  
  
Q. R.J., can you talk a little bit about Shahid for NDSU's performance,
especially in the first half?  
R.J. BARRETT: He was taking it to us. Very dominant leader, like Coach K said.
He really got them going, got them on their run. They were pushing it down our
throat, but we regrouped at halftime. So it was great to see what we did in
the second half.  
  
Q. Zion, on the missed free throw, were you surprised? It didn't look
like anybody got a body on you, and you went ahead and threw down the dunk,
and that seemed to turn things. Did anybody try to get out on you at that
point?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Honestly, I just think it was one of those simple mistakes by
both teams. They both crashed, and the ball just kind of bounced right over
them. But, yeah, like you said, nobody was there to box me out. So I just went
and dunked it.  
  
Q. You guys have a good, strong relationship, good friends, have a lot
in common. Is being left-handed -- is that something that just adds to the
bond that you guys have?  
R.J. BARRETT: I got it. I mean, it's cool for sure.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Being right-handed is cool, too.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: It's not your turn (laughter).  
  
R.J. BARRETT: It's great being left-handed, and we can both use both our
hands. So it's amazing to see, you don't really know which way we're kind of
going to go in the name.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yeah, it makes the connection deeper (laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys.  
  
Q. Coach K, in the second half, can you point to something that turned
it to let your team get out of the gates quickly and make that big run to open
up that lead?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: No, we were just more ourselves. We didn't start the game the
way we have played. We started it being jump shooters and just being fast
break. Most of our possessions had no passes, and therefore, we had no
rebounds. I think we were outrebounding us about 14-6 because we weren't
running good offense. They run very good offense, but they're going to get
even more confidence when we take one and miss, and that's it. How do they
feel us? They never felt us on the offensive end of the court.  
  
Then we started getting stuff more inside, and then they started to feel us on
both ends of the court. But we didn't start the game well, and they did, and
that's why they were ahead.  
  
Q. You said that you all just played some beautiful basketball in the
second half. What was your favorite part about that first 12 minutes of the
second half?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Just that we're winning, man. It's the most beautiful thing.
We're winning, got a double-digit lead, and we're hungry, and we want more. To
me, that's beautiful. It's not one play. You're not going to win this with one
play, no.  
  
Q. Coach, Jordan came in with the team down seven and kind of helped
spark the defense. Can you just talk about the energy he brings and the
improvement he's made to where he's now a household name in the rotation.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: He's part of our rotation, and he's earned that, starting
with the Louisville game. He's a very good athlete, and he plays defense on
and off the ball, tough. He does not turn the ball over, makes simple plays,
and then he hit a big three. That's added. He's a valuable guy for us right
now, but he's earned everything.  
  
And also, what he's earned is the confidence. He has confidence in himself,
and he knows that we have confidence in him. So it's a good place.  
  
Q. Mike, how would you assess the toughness of this job or compare it to
others in the past with having as many high level freshmen as you have, but
obviously guys who lack experience playing games on this stage?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Nobody thinks I have a tough job, so I'm not going to talk
about a tough job. My job being tough? We've been the leader of the pack for
about 25 years, so we get everyone's best shot. That's the toughest thing. Our
guys need to be ready for that each time. I'm not saying we're the only leader
or the only -- but we're one of a handful that does it every year. So getting
kids, young kids to understand that. They don't get that in high school. They
never play more than two. They hardly play tough games because they're the
best players by far. And all of a sudden, every game they play is a T-shirt.
They have blackout day, game day, the most viewed game -- all those things.  
  
Although I do think it prepares us for this moment where everyone thinks is
the biggest game. We've played a lot of big games, and I think that's why our
kids responded in the second half.  
  
Q. Coach, you've coached some incredible players throughout the years,
but with Zion and everything that's been written and said about his
generational ability, do you find even yourself sometimes saying wow to the
things he does on the basketball court?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, but I've had a lot of wow guys. Yeah, he's there, but
R.J. is a wow guy. Tre on defense. When Cam comes down and hits those trail
threes or fast breaks. Javin makes a block. I get excited for all my guys, and
obviously I get excited a lot about him because he's a hell of a player.  
  
Q. NDSU is a really good three-point shooting team, and you guys shut
them down. Was that a point of emphasis coming into the game, to take away the
three-point shot?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Obviously. They had to work for their shots. The thing that
they did, though, when they missed in the first half, they got their rebounds,
and we were not defensive rebounding.  
  
Look, they're a really good team. I watched six of their games, and I told my
guys, I said, look, they don't beat themselves. They don't beat themselves.
They play solid, really good basketball. And each kid has a confidence in his
role. Very, very well-coached team. I'm very impressed with them. We beat a
good team today. It's a good win for the Duke Blue Devils today. Thank you.

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Lon Kruger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13820)

### [Rashard Odomes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37019)

### [Kristian Doolittle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34843)

### [Christian James](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30613)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Oklahoma - 95, Ole Miss - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Oklahoma head coach, Lon Kruger with student-athletes
Rashard Odomes, Kristian Doolittle, Christian James, and Brady Manek. Coach,
if you have an opening statement. After that, we'll have the questions
directed first to the student-athletes and we'll allow those individuals to be
dismissed and follow with questions for coach.  
  
LON KRUGER: Just really happy for the guys. I thought they were really sharp.
A lot of respect for Coach Davis and the Mississippi program. These guys had a
good week of practice. I thought they transferred things from practice to the
game today from start to finish. Pretty solid. Good communication defensively.
That really moved the ball and identified some matchup advantages on the
offensive end.  
  
Proud of them. Happy for them. Ready to go watch some ball games.  
  
Q. Christian James, I just want to ask you, you opened up with two
threes to start the game. Did you have a really good shootaround, feeling
really good opening the game? Because you guys were offensively explosive to
start the game.  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: We did have a good start. We've been having a lot of good
practices, just getting reps up and things like that. The ball felt good
today. It felt good today. Trying to give my team a boost.  
  
Q. Guys, just how much momentum does a performance like this give you
moving forward looking ahead to Sunday?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: I think it gives us a lot of momentum, just moving forward.
Ole Miss is a good team. So we just want to go out there and get momentum and
just get as much momentum as possible and just keep it rolling. We're going to
watch some ball games and regroup and get ready for Sunday.  
  
Q. I guess, Doolittle, this one's for you. Did you think you could have
this kind of dominating performance inside? 15 rebounds, I think 19 points.  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: Going into the game, I couldn't have predicted I'd have 19
and 15, but I'm glad to have it. Just doing what my team needed me to do and
getting it going early in the first half. Then my teammates took over for the
remainder of the first half, and the points were spread out evenly across the
board. So just taking what the defense gives me, not really forcing anything,
just following the game plan.  
  
Q. Rashard, that was one of y'all's best shooting performances, I think,
of the season. Maybe West Virginia was just a tick better. Did you feel like
you all were going to have that -- have you had practices in the shootaround
and everything? Did you feel like it was going to be that kind of night for
you?  
RASHARD ODOMES: Yeah. Like Kristian said, the previous practices have been
great. We've been having great energy in it. Just locking in and making shots.
We felt like what we did in practice really just transferred to the game.  
  
Q. Brady, you guys -- what you guys each do individually, you did today,
but you also did some new stuff, like when Freeman posted up and you ran
baseline, he hit you with a bounce pass. I don't think I've seen that all
year. Did you add some new stuff today for Ole Miss?  
BRADY MANEK: I think we were just playing basketball. We came in. We wanted to
have a lot of energy. I think we did that, and we just played together and
just played basketball. I mean, I don't think that was a set play or anything.
We just made a play and went from there.  
  
Q. This is for any of the players. When you get off to a start like
that, does that pretty much just loosen you up today where you didn't have any
pressure or any nerves and you could go out and play your game?  
RASHARD ODOMES: I don't know. I think it just sets the tone for the whole
game. I felt like we just carried that momentum throughout the whole game, as
well. We just wanted to deliver the first blow. When you're doing things like
that, great outcome comes. That's all we wanted to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Kristian Doolittle, if you'd like to add to that.  
  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: I guess he said it basically the way I would say it.  
  
Q. This is a question for Rashard. Obviously, you all came out as a team
collectively, just really filling up the basket, but you specifically with 20
points. Was it something about your matchup that was just favorable to you or
just good sight lines in this gym, or what was it about you for your
performance tonight?  
RASHARD ODOMES: Just the team really got me going, you know. Before the game,
we were all hyped, and it's just the way everyone's been practicing
previously. So the team found me for good looks, and I just finished,
honestly.  
  
Q. Kristian Doolittle, you guys came out red hot both halves, I think 8
and 9 to start the game and 7 of 8 to start the second half. Played good the
rest of the time too. Why specifically do you think you came out of the locker
room both times so efficient?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: To start the game off, we knew we had to come out with a
lot of energy, be able to hit first, set the tone for the rest of the game.
Shooting the ball well really helps do that. We were able to get stops on
defense and force them into tough shots and be able to rebound the basketball.  
  
The start of the second half, they came out with a lot of energy. They made a
couple of their first shots. So as far as us on the offensive end, we were
able to take our time and be able to get the looks we practiced on. Going
through all of our reads and getting the matchup that we wanted and be able to
execute.  
  
Q. Kristian, on those fast starts, they threw a lot of different guys at
you, a lot of different guys guarding you, but you were able to really just
kind of have your way. What were you seeing defensively from Ole Miss?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: We were planning on them to double the post whenever I got
it going in the post, but they didn't do that. So whenever I have a one-on-one
matchup, it's pretty much my world, whatever I want to do, be able to make the
right play, whether that's to shoot it or pass it or to keep the ball moving.
So I felt like I did a good job of that.  
  
Q. Coach, talk a little bit about your balanced scoring. You had two
players with 20, one with 19, one with 18. That's pretty good.  
LON KRUGER: We've had different guys different times in the year step up and
be key scorers for us, not always the same guy. Today they kind of all hit on
the same date. But the guys moved the ball. They got good looks, like they
said. Duke played great out of the post. Christian James making shots early,
Brady, I thought Rashard, perhaps one of his better games of the year. A lot
of different guys stepped up and played well.  
  
Q. Never gets old for you, does it? The fifth time to the playoffs and
the Final Four, and just like you said, on Odomes, he came in and was
averaging a little over 6 points a game, he goes, runs for 20. You just went
crazy out of the game. Ole Miss made a run, and you're still up 15 or so. So
great defensive effort. What goes into all of that?  
LON KRUGER: Like the guys mentioned, they've been sharp in practice, really
focused. I thought they really transferred the things they've done all week to
the game today. Got off to a good start. That always helps reinforce
confidence, reinforce the things they've been working on in practice. Again,
just happy for them. It's a special opportunity to win tournament games.
They're hard to win. Any time you can do that, it's a good memory for the rest
of their lives.  
  
Q. Lon, you had a good inside presence today. You shot well from the
outside. Is that the kind of thing you need to do when you face who you're
probably going to face in the second round?  
LON KRUGER: Of course. To have a chance against, if it is Virginia, they're
one of the best teams in the country. You've got to get everyone playing well
and make shots. That's probably the biggest thing against good basketball
teams, making shots. Easier said than done, but, again, if it is Virginia, we
know hands will be full.  
  
Q. How different is it coaching this team compared to last year's team
with Trae Young?  
LON KRUGER: Usually different. Any time you've got a player like Trae that led
the country in scoring and assists, a lot of things revolve around him. Pretty
much everything did. Here you've got a situation where we need more balance,
need more guys contributing, and that's kind of the other extreme, if you
will. So different guys at different times throughout the year have stepped up
and been our leading scorer.  
  
Kristian Doolittle, Christian James, Brady Manek certainly at the core of it,
but different guys, like Rashard tonight. He's worked awfully hard and very
happy for him.  
  
Q. Coach, what will the next couple of days look like for you and the
staff, watching games, getting ready, scouting? And should you face Virginia,
what stands out about them offensively with the way they've shot the ball, as
well?  
LON KRUGER: They're terrific. They've got a lot of terrific players. Tony does
a great, great job. They're very secure in what they do. They do it as well as
anyone in the country, defensively and offensively. So they're fantastic.  
  
Q. Coach, Ole Miss threw a lot of things at you man-to-man, one-three-
one, two-three, and you guys were able to seamlessly pick that apart. What
went into that, and how were you able to just easily dissect them on the
offensive end?  
LON KRUGER: In the end, making shots makes it look good for sure. I thought
guys recognized things well, again, transferred things from practice to the
game today. When you do what you work on and then shots also go in, it works
out pretty good.  
  
Q. Coach, as you saw Kermit Davis transform a program from how they did
last season, just some comments on what you think Kermit Davis has done.
Despite beating them today, what do you think he's done with the program?  
LON KRUGER: I think Kermit is fantastic. Everywhere he's been, he's done a
fantastic job to go in and get a team immediately to the tournament, it's
amazing. It doesn't happen very often. He's got good players, but I think his
ability to get everyone working together and doing things that they do well
individually and trusting one another. I think that's the strength of Coach
Davis and the great job he's done everywhere he's been.  
  
Q. Lon, what do you think it meant to your guys that Trae showed up, and
were you surprised that he made the drive?  
LON KRUGER: That's great. Not that far from Atlanta, I guess, but still the
middle of his schedule, it's not easy to take a few hours out of any day. And
Trae's playing so well. He's playing great, especially in the last month to
six weeks, fantastic to see what he's doing, and certainly our guys appreciate
it a lot.

### [B.J. Taylor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28541)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
UCF - 73, VCU - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: University of Central Florida head coach Johnny Dawkins with
student-athletes Aubrey Dawkins, Tacko Fall, and B.J. Taylor. Coach will have
a brief opening statement followed by questions to the student-athletes.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: We beat a very good basketball team. Of course everyone knows
the tradition that VCU has. Coach Rhoades has done an amazing job with his
group. And as you know, everyone in this room knows the tournament is very
unforgiving. We're fortunate to be moving on.  
  
I thought they made a great run in the second half, showed who they were down
the stretch defensively, making threes. Hats off because they played for the
full 40 minutes, and I'm just proud of our guys for staying focused and
winning a very good basketball game.  
  
Q. B.J., as you know, this program has waited a long time for a moment
like this. It's part of the reason why you stayed in Orlando to go to UCF. Can
you articulate on behalf of yourself and your teammates what this victory
means to you and to the program tonight?  
B.J. TAYLOR: It's great. It's a great step. It's hard for me to talk about it
right now because we're in a moment, and we are already getting ready for the
next one. But it's great for the program. It's a great win. But we'll reflect
on that after the season's over. Right now we're not satisfied. We want to
keep this thing going. So we're ready to get on to the next game.  
  
Q. Tacko, kind of the same question. I wonder if you could talk about
also the impact of being able to say that you were part of a team that notched
the first tournament victory in this program's history.  
TACKO FALL: It means a lot to us, to me, to the fans, finally being able to
pull it off after all these years has meant a great deal to us. But as B.J.
said, we're not satisfied. We want to keep going as far as we can, and we're
going to bring it every night no matter who we play against.  
  
Q. Tacko, you had your double-double tonight, UCF's first double-double
in the NCAA Tournament. What did you see on the court tonight against VCU?  
TACKO FALL: Obviously, we had the size advantage. I think we pretty much have
the size advantage over anything we're going to play against. We took
advantage of it, and my teammates trusted me. I was out there being
aggressive, just like I'm supposed to do every night and just trying to make
plays for us to win the ball game.  
  
Q. Aubrey, B.J., when you guys were running into the locker room, it
sounded like you guys were yelling Duke, Duke, Duke. What does this next
matchup mean to you guys?  
B.J. TAYLOR: First off, to answer the first part, I didn't hear nobody say
that. I didn't hear that. But it was a great first win for us. Like Coach
said, we beat a really good basketball team tonight. Duke is our next
opponent, and we're going to treat them like every other opponent. We're going
to prepare. They're a good team, and we have a lot of respect for them, but
we're going to treat them just like we treated every other team we played this
season and just try to go 1-0.  
  
Q. This is for Aubrey and Tacko. What was going through your minds when
VCU was making that run, and what did Coach say to you guys to maybe calm you
down during that time-out?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Just got to lock them up defense and cut their water off. We
knew they were going to make runs. Basketball is a game of runs. We were
prepared for that, but like I said, we figured we've got to cut their water
off and end it right there. Our defense is what did it.  
  
TACKO FALL: Like Aubrey say, basketball is a game of runs. We know teams are
going to make runs. They're a really good basketball team, so it's only right
that those things happen. So we just have to lock in and just stick to our
principles and just make plays.  
  
Q. Aubrey, about 13 minutes ago in the first half, it seemed like you
guys really started clicking into gear offensively. What changed? What was
different just to kind of get you guys going out there after the slow start?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Just shake the nerves off. It's a big game. The biggest stage
that UCF has been on. For us, we have to shake the nerves off and get in the
flow of the game, and that's what we did. Once we got used to the flow, things
started to click for us. We played good basketball, moved the ball, played
unselfish, and good things usually happen when you do that.  
  
Q. For Tacko, 18 boards tonight, 5 blocks. You altered a bunch of other
shots. You talked about being aggressive. Being in the tournament, did that
make you even more fired up?  
TACKO FALL: I mean, I feel like I've been the same. You don't just turn it on
and off. You got to do it every single night to prepare you for nights like
this. But it's all credit to the guys and the coaches, just pushing me every
day, trying to make me do my best out there, and it's paying off.  
  
Q. B.J., I know you said you're in the moment, you guys are in the
tournament, and you don't want to think about it. You talk about leave your
legacy basically every week, and leaving your legacy on that. Is this at the
head of that, this kind of win at the head of that statement?  
B.J. TAYLOR: I mean, yeah, at the moment. Like I said, we want to see how far
we can take this thing. We're not satisfied. I mean, yeah, we all came here to
leave our legacy. That's why we came here, and that's why we stayed and played
for Coach Dawkins. Like I said, right now, we're going to go to sleep tonight
and wake up and get ready for our next game.  
  
Q. Aubrey and B.J., how long does this win last? You guys talk about
moving on, but how quickly does that actually happen?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Right away. We don't have the option. We don't have the luxury
to think about this victory. We've got to keep winning. We're motivated. We're
not satisfied with this. We've got to move on to the next one.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of firsts this year -- first NCAA Tournament win for
this program. What's it mean for your building?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, I think when I look back on it, it's going to be really
meaningful. I think right now, we're in the moment, so we're still happy that
we still have more basketball to play. So that's what we're excited about. I'm
just really proud of our guys. They worked hard to put themselves in this
position. I'm happy to see them take a first step in this tournament. I'll
think about all the things about this season they've accomplished along the
way when we finish, but right now, we just stand in the moment.  
  
Q. From your vantage point, Marcus Evans, their point guard, how healthy
did he look? What impact did he have on the game? Was he the player you
prepared for?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: We felt he'd be ready to go tonight, and he was. I'm not
saying he was 100 percent. I don't know that because I'm not in their locker
room. But I thought he came out to compete. They're a very good defensive
team, and so are we. I think we really did a good job of game planning for him
to be at his best, and I thought our guys really were locked in in trying to
take away the things we knew he liked to do.  
  
He's a terrific player. He's a first team All Conference player in their
league, and I think he's a terrific point guard. He has a bright future.  
  
Q. What stood out to you most during the 19-0 run that you guys were
able to really stretch the lead out? What stood out to you most during that
run?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I thought we played some of our best basketball both ends of
the floor. I thought defensively, Tacko's presence down there was amazing. I
thought we rebounded it well. We knew they were going to crash the glass hard.
And then offensively, as Aubrey mentioned, I thought we made a lot of
connecting plays. We shared the basketball. Guys found shots and rhythm shots
they would normally take, and they were knocking them down tonight
consistently, and I think that helped build the run for us.  
  
Q. It's early, but do you have any impressions of Duke? Obviously, I'm
sure you've seen a lot of them maybe this year.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Actually, I haven't. When you're doing what we do for the last
six months, we don't have much time to see anyone other than your opponents. I
have seen them play bits and pieces, three minutes here, four minutes there
throughout the season when you're taking a break from your scouts. I haven't
seen much of them. I'm looking forward to seeing them this evening and
tomorrow as we start to prepare.  
  
But I know Coach. He's amazing, and I know the young men I've heard so much
about like Zion Williamson, R.J. Barrett, Cam Reddish. Those guys are
terrific, terrific players along with the point guard Jones and the rest of
their players. I know they're really talented, and it's going to be a good
challenge.  
  
Q. Coach, can you elaborate on Tacko's play tonight, his performance? He
seems to have really gotten better the last half of the season. Was tonight
sort of the ultimate in that?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: We've been challenging Tacko all season long about really
imposing his will on the game. I think probably the last six weeks, you
started to see a turn in that. He started to see what he was capable of doing
out there on the floor. So I'm excited for him. He gets 18 rebounds in an NCAA
Tournament game, a double-double, that's having a huge impact on a game, and
he's capable of doing that. So I'm just really happy for him. I'm happy he's
realizing the type of impact he can have on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you to be the coach of a team that gets the
program's first NCAA Tournament victory?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I'm proud of our guys. I'll always look at it as me being
proud of my team, proud of my coaching staff. I look at the guys that really
make this go, and we have terrific coaches. Tacko's improvement you've seen
over the last three years is a result of how hard these guys have worked with
him. B.J. doing the things you've seen him do, transitioning into the position
he's in now. Again, our coaches. I think we have amazing coaches. They're very
talented guys, and that's a huge factor in, I think, the development of our
overall student-athletes.  
  
And then you look at our strength and conditioning coach, and you look at our
trainer. These guys have kept these guys going, kept them healthy all year,
kept them playing at a high level. It takes a team to accomplish these things,
and I'll always think about that. I'll think about all the contributions of
the staff. I'll think about the contributions of each individual player that
I've had a chance to coach.  
  
Q. Duke has meant so much to you, obviously, as a player and an
assistant coach. If you had your druthers, would you rather not -- would you
rather play somebody else? I don't think Coach K likes playing his guys, does
he?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: No, I feel the same way. I was like -- we'd rather not play
each other, of course. We're friends. I played for him. I've worked for him
for over a decade. It's not something you look forward to doing. We know in
this type of setting -- and we're all competitors. We do what we have to do,
but it's not something we would pick, let's play each other. That wouldn't
happen under any other circumstance other than a tournament.  
  
It is what it is with that. You've got to get ready to compete. They're going
to do the same thing, and both teams will come out prepared.  
  
Q. How did you feel like your guys handled their press?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I thought for the most part we handled it well. I've watched
so much tape of those guys and what they do. Their weapon is their depth. They
just keep coming at you with body after body, playing at a high level. You're
going to wear down. You're going to have some mishaps with the basketball.
That's inevitable. I thought for the most part our guys handled it well. The
turnovers we had, not a lot of them led to easy baskets for them, which was
good, our guys were able to scramble and get back on "D" and make them set up
or take a tough shot. I thought, all in all, we handled it fairly well.  
  
We had 15 turns, and I'm disappointed, but I thought under the circumstances,
that was a good number for us.

### [Kermit Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25105)

### [Devontae Shuler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36788)

### [Breein Tyree](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34850)

### [Terence Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32970)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Oklahoma - 95, Ole Miss - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Ole Miss head coach Kermit Davis, accompanied by
Terence Davis, Devontae Shuler, and Breein Tyree.  
  
KERMIT DAVIS: It was a really disappointing day for our team. Just right from
the start, Oklahoma, give them all the credit. They totally outclassed us,
out-toughed us in every area. Give Oklahoma a lot of credit. They played
really, really well. This is not going to define who we are, based on when we
took the program over a year and how much progress we have made in a year. I'm
so proud of these guys, these three guys. They were unbelievable all year
long. Obviously, we didn't play like we wanted today, but to be with this
group the whole year, extremely excited about our future. But just give Lon
and Oklahoma a lot of credit. If they play like that, they'll have a chance to
win in next round, Game 2.  
  
Q. Terence, that's your last game as an Ole Miss Rebel, and you went out
playing really well. Just what was it like out there in your final game. Going
out there, was it tough for you?  
TERENCE DAVIS: Definitely going out that way was tough for me. They jumped on
us quick. I think it was like 11-0 I looked up. You've just got to give them
all the credit, man. They made the tough plays. They exploited mixed messages
and things like that. But, yeah, it was pretty tough.  
  
Q. Breein, last couple games for you, two tourney games, really
struggled there offensively. What was it that kind of you struggled with as
far as getting your shot going? Were you frustrated with that?  
BREEIN TYREE: Just couldn't make a shot. It's unacceptable. I've got to become
a more consistent player over this off-season and just got to be better.  
  
Q. Terence, they got off to a particularly hot start in the post with
Doolittle in there. What did you see? I know you weren't matched up against
him so much early on, but what allowed them to be so effective with him in the
post early?  
TERENCE DAVIS: That's part of his game. I would say he got better throughout
the season this year. I think it's like most improved player in the Big 12. He
just went, exploited mixed messages, that's what Oklahoma does. That's what
they did with Doolittle.  
  
Q. Breein, I know this probably didn't end the way you guys wanted it
to, but as a player, are you able to process the step you guys made as a
program this year?  
BREEIN TYREE: Of course. As a player and as a competitor, you want to win
every game, especially our first time being in March Madness. I know, when we
take a step back probably a few weeks from now and look at what we did this
season, we had a great body of work. We all got better as people and as
basketball players on and off the court this year. So there's a lot of
positives, but never happy or satisfied with losing like that.  
  
Q. Terence, rather than just dissecting this game, having a full year
with head coach Kermit Davis, I just want to expand on what he's meant this
year, coming in and flipping a program from 12 wins to 20. Just comment on how
your relationship has been with Kermit so far this year.  
TERENCE DAVIS: The first time meeting Coach, he looked me in the eye and said
it wasn't going to be a rebuilding year, and I believed him. We all believed
him. He brought so much success upon me, my teammates, and this program.
They're going to do great things here at Ole Miss.  
  
Q. Bree, you talked Thursday about just how you guys have maybe a lot of
basketball experience but not a lot in the tournament. How much do you think
that factored in, especially the first ten minutes. Nerves? Experience?  
BREEIN TYREE: They got out to a really good start. Oklahoma is a really
experienced tournament team. I think they made it like four of the last five
years. Got to give them all the credit. In my matchup, whoever I was guarding
was exploiting me for most of the game. I know it. Everybody saw it. I'm not
happy with it, but back to the drawing board we go.  
  
Q. Devontae, with T.D. gone, Kermit's already said he thought you were
the most important player on the roster this year and what you did. Do you
anticipate taking another step as far as leadership is concerned and
establishing yourself in that way?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: Definitely. Me learning from T.D. and practicing with him
every day, I learned a lot just from him being tough on the court and his
mindset off the court. I learned a lot. I'm just trying to work on myself
getting better.  
  
Q. Devontae, turnovers for you guys in the first half, was that a part
of nerves or their toughness, or did you guys just not start like you wanted
to?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: We didn't start like we wanted to, but I think the main
thing, we weren't really running offense, we were just shooting the ball on
the first side. We usually have a high percentage getting on the second and
third side. I think that was the most thing. They just out-toughed us on
rebounds. Like Breein and T.D. said, they just explored on mismatches.  
  
Q. You guys came out with a lot of energy in the second half. Looked
like you guys cut it down to about 12. What were they able to do offensively
that just threw you off again in the second half.  
BREEIN TYREE: We did make a pretty good run to start the half. Coach was
trying to tell us at halftime, just get it down to a manageable game and see
what they do. Credit to Oklahoma. They stayed with it and kept moving the ball
in the zone or in the man. We were throwing at them, and they were making
shots and making plays. They expanded the lead back out; and you saw what the
outcome was.  
  
Q. This is for Devontae. Being a hometown kid, obviously, does it make
it easier or harder for you to take this loss, maybe in the same town that
kind of helped you?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: I don't think it really was a hard loss for me. I think me
just coming back home and playing in front of my fans and family for the most
part, that was the main thing. The fact that we lost is not what I wanted to
happen, but it's nothing I can really do about it. Just keep working.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys.  
  
Q. Kermit, you went into this matchup saying that Dom and Bruce guarding
Doolittle in that front line was probably the biggest match of the game. They
struggled there. You've been talking about front line help all year. Do you
anticipate this off season being really important as far as adding up there
and trying to get bigger and longer and more athletic?  
KERMIT DAVIS: It's got to. When I started watching Oklahoma the first five
minutes, I knew it was going to be a problem. We were playing two five men,
and Doolittle, you're trying to guard him at wide post areas at 15, 17 feet.
They've got big guards. James and Odomes are big, big physical guards. Kind of
puts you in matchup problems at 16, 17 feet. It's kind of a one-on game. It's
not something we've been great at all year.  
  
We did get exploited right there with Bruce and Dom. You're right. We've got
to improve the guys in our program and improve our team with a couple of guys
in the spring for sure.  
  
Q. Kermit, you called a time-out with less than two minutes into the
game. What was it that you saw right then and there that showed you something
wasn't right with your team?  
KERMIT DAVIS: It just seemed like we wouldn't contest a shot. We would guard,
and their hands were down, and it was just so easy for them. I saw kind of a
different look on our team, and I just wanted to call a quick time-out and
just kind of sell into our team. It didn't do a lot of good because they went
on another 8-0 run. But I just saw a different look, and I was just trying to
get our guys' attention to kind of settle in. Obviously, we never really did
until the first maybe four or five minutes of the second half.  
  
Q. Just like I said with T.D., rather than just dissecting this one
game, season as a whole, Coach Kruger has said you did a phenomenal job, when
I asked him from Oklahoma saying how well you developed these players, to flip
a program from upside down. So I just want to ask you what have these boys
meant to you? Obviously, very emotional with T.D. being his last game. But
just from an emotional standpoint, how great has the season been for you and
those players?  
KERMIT DAVIS: It's really been probably one of the most rewarding years I've
ever had as a coach, as far as a team maybe overachieving. Our staff did a
great job. These guys did a great job. I know it wasn't the last couple games.
Breein Tyree may have been the most improved guy in the SEC. Went from a no
team preseason, averaged 9 or 10, to second in the league in scoring. Devontae
Shuler has never played point guard in his life, played point all year long.
And T.D. had a great year. It was, but we'll reflect back. I think it's what
they said, in about a week. The biggest thing I take away is just so
appreciative of how the players and the fan base connected, how we grew there.
We've got a lot of work to do. There's no question about that.  
  
But what Ross and Keith and just the people in the administration, the
opportunity they gave us, it's going to be hard for me for about two or three
days. Then we'll get right back on the road recruiting, and there's a lot of
positive things to think about.  
  
Q. Kermit, you made a late switch to start Dom instead of Bruce. What
did you like about that matchup with Dom early?  
KERMIT DAVIS: Dom had been better in practice than Bruce. We always reward
guys on practice. I told Blake or K.J. who had the most rebounds, and then the
four or five practices leading up to the start, and Blake had more rebounds
than K.J. I knew it was going to be a tough matchup for both of them, and Dom
didn't get off to a great start defensively.  
  
Q. Kermit, do you feel like this year expedited the process of what
you're trying to build at all? Does it change your outlook going forward at
all?  
KERMIT DAVIS: It expedited fan interest. I think it hopefully expedites
recruiting, just from a national level, just because of what people saw -- not
today, but just the tournament, so our fan base and those nationally televised
games in the pavilion. I really did. We've got a lot of work now. We've got a
lot of holes to fill, and we've got to get guys better, but I do think it sped
up the process.  
  
Q. Kermit, now the year's over, how much of this team looked like what
you would like it to look like down the line? Did you ever get close to
molding it into your image? How far along do you need to come, where does it
need to get fixed?  
KERMIT DAVIS: From an emotional standpoint, it's almost like we got it
together and won at Missouri to kind of get us in the tournament, get us 10-8
and 20 wins. I think the Tennessee and Kentucky games, we played as well as we
could play, one-possession losses at home, and the crowd was unbelievable.
Then in the Alabama game, we were up 16, and the thing kind of took its toll.  
  
It didn't ever really look like what I really wanted it to look like. I was
really proud of their improvement, but for us to really be a contender in the
SEC, bodies have got to change. We've got to develop a lot better depth.
There's still a lot of work for us to do.  
  
Q. Coach, you brought a team in here that had never played in the NCAA
Tournament. How much do you think that that kind of factored into it,
especially how they opened the game? And how much does that experience in the
tournament help moving forward?  
KERMIT DAVIS: You know, I just -- I don't know how much experience mattered,
or is it just Oklahoma was just better? They were just better. And they got
their head up, and then they made a couple tough shots. I mean, James probably
has made -- for the Big 12, probably had a little disappointing year in the
Big 12. He wasn't shot making. And today, boy, he got off to a great start,
and then like I said, Doolittle made shots.  
  
I think it probably -- it has a little effect. I just really think Oklahoma
was just better in all phases today.

### [Issac Vann](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36972)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
UCF - 73, VCU - 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: Virginia Commonwealth University head coach Mike Rhoades is
accompanied by student-athletes Issac Vann, Malik Crowfield, and De'Riante
Jenkins. We'll have an opening statement from coach, allow questions to be
directed to the student-athletes.  
  
MIKE RHOADES: Credit to UCF and Coach Dawkins. They played a great game. It
was an exciting game to start off with. It was back and forth a little bit. I
thought we had some momentum. I thought our defense got us going a little bit,
but then we just missed some shots. You're not going to score like other games
around the basket, as we have most of the year. We knew that.  
  
But we had opportunities. We had some open threes we didn't make that they
made, and they got a run there. Then in the second half, we just -- very
uncharacteristic of us, but we lost our composure there and they made a run
there that really got them going. That had a lot to do with the result for
sure.  
  
Q. Guys, what do you feel like is maybe the biggest factor in some of
the shooting struggles? It seemed like you guys were getting some looks but it
wasn't falling. What do you think was the biggest factor there in some of that
early on?  
ISSAC VANN: Definitely in the paint. I mean, Tacko is 7'6". I mean, some of
those shots that we usually get at the rim is kind of hard to get those with
him down there. We got some good open looks from three. We just couldn't knock
them down tonight.  
  
MALIK CROWFIELD: Based on what he just said, like Tacko's 7'6". Like he's
holding the paint down. So we had open shots, but in the first half we
couldn't hit nothing. But in the second half, we got it rolling.  
  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: They pretty much said it all.  
  
Q. De'Riante and Issac, when there's a 7'6 " guy rebounding, does that
even affect your shots from the perimeter knowing that most of the time
there's only going to be one shot? Does that put any extra pressure on you?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: Over the course of the game, we don't even really think
about it. I didn't think about it until you just said it. You just gotta
outwork him. That's what we tried to do tonight. Unfortunately, he did a good
job.  
  
Q. Malik, what started clicking down that stretch, about ten minutes to
go in the second half. You guys started hitting some shots. What do you think
kind of led to that? You had back-to-back threes there in a sequence and you
went on that 11-0 run. What really sparked that run down the stretch?  
MALIK CROWFIELD: They made a huge run, so I'm thinking on the bench I need to
bring more energy so we can keep this game close. When I got in the game, I
started hitting three threes in a row, and De'Riante started hitting threes,
and that's what got it going.  
  
Q. For all the players, could you guys go through what you felt like you
accomplished this year, what you learned, what you gained, and what you carry
into the off-season and next season?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: I believe that the work that you put in, it tends to show.
For a whole group to get out of their own way and just want to see each other
succeed, you get the thing that happened to us, like winning regular season
championships and having a great year, going on winning streaks, and having
our fans show support, and everyone rooting for us. We've just got to build on
it and come back even stronger next year.  
  
MALIK CROWFIELD: Based on what D.J. just said, we had everything going into
the summertime. We had to push ourselves in the summer to get back to being
VCU, and it really showed in the regular season when we went on these winning
streaks.  
  
ISSAC VANN: Just the fact that from the end of last year, everybody bought in,
and everybody locked in. All that hard work paid off. Just because it ended
tonight doesn't take away the fact that we had a great season.  
  
Q. Kind of piggy-backing off of that, what are you most proud about this
year? Again, kind of the turnaround you guys were able to experience? Seeing
that work pay off? And how does that propel you into next year and all the
pieces you bring back next year?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: Seeing everyone, how the work pays off at their given time,
you never know. It was days when some dudes were down, and they just kept
working, and eventually they had that game where all their hard work paid off
and everyone was excited for them. We all just want to see each other succeed,
no matter who it was. We didn't care who was the hot man tonight. We just
wanted to win. Overall, it was just a great season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Marcus Evans told me that he told you, I don't have it tonight,
essentially. What did he have, and what did you think of what he gave you?  
MIKE RHOADES: I thought he gave us some -- just him being out there was great
psychologically for our guys, without a doubt. He did some good things. He got
us going in the press with pressure on the ball, just that -- you saw him.
There's certain movements going to his left and to his right laterally that's
just tougher. You play with that bone bruise like that, there's certain things
you can do, there's certain things you think you might be able to do, but it's
not there.  
  
He did some really good things, but you struggle too when you're not a
hundred. He's been through a lot. He wanted to play. He wanted to play in the
NCAA Tournament with his guys. When we knew he would be able to play
yesterday, you could see the guys really excited for him, and that says
something about what everybody feels about Marcus and each other.  
  
But not one of his finer games when you look at the box score, but his
presence out there is what we need, and it just -- we fell short, but that guy
needs an off-season. He hasn't had an off-season in a while, and he'll be back
stronger than ever.  
  
Q. With them having sort of maybe not being quite at the level you
wanted to be, how did that affect maybe the offense, shot selection with him
at the point --  
MIKE RHOADES: You try to maybe throw one up there and try to get some momentum
and all that stuff. He forced a couple -- I thought he got off the ball at
times. In the first half, he had the ball moving here and there. We just
didn't make open shots. I want to go back and watch the tape probably tonight.
They made a run there. They made two. We had two wide open ones, we missed it.
They had two wide open. Marcus got the ball moving a little bit.  
  
But it wasn't there for them like you've seen throughout most of the year.
It's tough, but he wanted to make sure he was with his guys, and we wanted his
presence out there and his experience out there, and that's how it goes.  
  
Q. Mike, everything in the paint, everything around the rim is going to
be really challenging for you tonight. Do you think that it does affect --
that it has any effect on perimeter players when they know it could be a one-
and-done shot?  
MIKE RHOADES: I'm not sure it's as much about one-and-done, but you can't mix
up your game as much. You're a perimeter guy, and guys are running at you
because you're known as a three-point shooter. You don't tend to maybe --
you'll get by that guy and get by his close out really quick because Fall is
in there.  
  
Early in the game, we attacked -- we had a couple of plays where we created
contact. Some things didn't go our way. We had a couple of good finishes. But
they don't help as much as other teams because they don't have to. So they run
some three-pointers down and maybe take a couple of contested ones or you do
take a tougher two. I didn't think we took awful twos in the first half. I
just thought we missed some wide open threes. We knew going into this game
we're not going to get some easy ones around the basket, or we're not going to
power over him throughout the game. So we knew we had to make some shots. When
we got downhill and moved the ball, we got some open shots. We just didn't
make enough of them.  
  
Q. One more on Marcus. Obviously, he went to Texas with you to Rice,
came back here to VCU with you. What is your relationship with him on a kind
of more personal level like?  
MIKE RHOADES: We've been through a lot. When you become a head coach for the
first time and you get your first recruits, it's a special thing because you
don't have much of a track record to say -- you know, there's a lot of belief
in a relationship before you even get on the court. It's almost like you talk
about taking a chance, you take a chance on people. I recruited him hard to
take a chance on him, and he took a chance on us. We had some special things
go there.  
  
His sister went to VCU and, of course, the same high school as Briante Weber,
so he's familiar with VCU. We recruited him a little bit when I was an
assistant. He was really excited to come to VCU. He's been through some stuff.
He had a pretty awesome year this year for everything he's been through.  
  
It's a cool relationship. We're tough on each other because we both want to
win, we've got an edge, and I think it's awesome. Also, being through some
experiences, it makes you not want to let each other down.  
  
Q. What do you take from this season? What did you establish? What's the
foundation you've built, and how does it carry forward now?  
MIKE RHOADES: This stinks right now. This hurts. I didn't want to see these
guys go out because I've had a blast with these guys. But culture, the
culture, the culture, the culture. After last year, I just made it a point of
it. There's certain things we're going to do in this program. We're going to
demand a certain level of work, accountability, approach, and these guys rang
the bell, man. I'm so proud of them. They made it about each other. They
worked really hard together.  
  
When the lights aren't on and it's in the summer and there's nobody around but
the players and they're doing all the work, we built a culture based on work
and making sure we're taking care of each other. I think that makes it hurt
more when you lose, but you celebrate more when you win because you're doing
it for your brothers and the family approach that we talk about.  
  
So as much as this stinks right now, I'm very proud of -- a lot of people
counted us out and never thought we'd be in this position. I told the guys
this time last year that, if we really work and put the program and the team
first, great things are going to happen, and throughout the year they really
did. I'm proud of these guys for that.  
  
Q. Going to last off-season, the priority was defense. With what you
guys have been able to accomplish this year, what's your priority heading into
this off-season and looking into next year?  
MIKE RHOADES: Get better. Flat out get better. That's everything to me. If you
stay the same, people pass you out. We've got to get better. A lot of things.
We'll go back and reevaluate the program from how we tie our shoes to how we
throw the ball in the post to how we shoot and how we play defense. That's one
thing that I believe in. You've got to reevaluate everything in your program
all different ways so you can evaluate it and make it better because that's
the most important thing.  
  
I want these guys to grow. I want them to get better. I want them to be better
than they were tonight. I want them to be better as young men. That's very
important to me. We'll go back and reevaluate every part of the program, from
the head coach all the way down -- heck, to the managers -- to make it better
because that's what these guys deserve. Let's help them get better.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Virginia - 71, Gardner-Webb - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gardner-Webb head coach Tim Craft with student-athletes David
Efianayi, D.J. Laster, Brandon Miller, and Jose Perez.  
  
TIM CRAFT: Yeah, I'm just unbelievably proud of our team for really just our
entire season. This hurts to lose, but in our second half, we just didn't play
particularly well. I thought Virginia had a lot to do with that. I think
Virginia's a terrific team, obviously.  
  
Just really proud of our group, proud of these guys up here and all the guys
in our locker room and what they've done for our school, for our university,
for our alumni, our former players, our community. This run that they've been
on, that we've been on, has just done so much for a lot of people in our area
and that are associated with Gardner-Webb.  
  
So just very thankful to coach this group of guys, to coach these three
seniors, and just very, very thankful.  
  
Q. This is for the players. Talk about the great start you got off to
and the support from your fans. It looked like you really fed off your fans in
the first half.  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yes, sir. I think we just came out with a lot of energy. We
were moving the ball well, and we were making great shots.  
  
D.J. LASTER: At the beginning of the first half, our fans really had us going,
and we fed off their energy. We were just playing well as a team -- passing
the ball, making the right cuts, making the right plays. It was a really good
experience for them to all show support, and even at the end, they were still
showing support.  
  
BRANDON MILLER: Pretty much the beginning of the game, the nerves kick in.
Everyone's excited. We're moving the ball, we're scoring. The first bucket,
everyone was going crazy. First one for us in March Madness, it was a great
experience. The fans, the best I've ever seen in my five years. That really
motivated us to do better and just keep Gardner-Webb happy at the end of the
day.  
  
JOSE PEREZ: It was a great atmosphere here. I just want to thank the fans for
traveling from Boiling Springs down here. It's a small town. Looked like there
was about a thousand people here supporting us. It was a great atmosphere.  
  
Q. Obviously, first time, we've written a lot about that. You mentioned
a little bit of it, Brandon, for the players. You all didn't seem to play
nervous early on. Was it because it was going well? Everything looks good when
shots are falling, but how did you fight off not being nervous coming into
this historic first game for you?  
BRANDON MILLER: I mean, we just played our game. At the end of the day, we all
strap up the same way. So no matter what school you're going to, at the end of
the day, the ball goes in one hoop, you know. So for us, it was just being
ready, be prepared. We had a couple of days to prepare. Practice was crazy
good. A lot of guys communicating and talking. At the end of the day, we want
to win. We didn't really care about anything else but winning.  
  
So definitely us staying locked in, staying together, and just communication
is best. Guys were just flowing together, you know. No one wanted to be a ball
hog today and be a hero. That was something that really lightened my eyes as a
guy that didn't play much, but such an experience. A crazy experience and
something I will never forget.  
  
Q. Brandon, you mentioned that you wanted to win, but when you get some
time to kind of look back on this, you won the Big South Tournament, two road
games -- yeah, it wasn't happily ever after with Cinderella, but you were up
14 in the first half. Is it something you think, when you have a little time
and distance to look at, you'll be like, that was pretty amazing?  
BRANDON MILLER: It's amazing, but you don't want to settle for it. You want
more out of it. We're hungry for more. It's not enough to settle for it. Yeah,
we're up 14, and all of a sudden give up the lead. We're dogs. At the end of
the day, we want to keep pushing that lead as much as we can. It didn't go our
way like we wanted it to. They figured it out a little bit. This is just
motivation for the guys coming up next, especially for Jose and all of them.
They're going to stay hungry, and they'll be back next year for sure.  
  
Q. I know the end result was not what you wanted, but what does it mean
to each one of the players to have the opportunity to participate in March
Madness in an NCAA Tournament?  
DAVID EFIANAYI: It was a dream come true. As a player, you want to play at the
highest level, and March Madness is basically the high level in college. So
it's a dream come true for me and for all the guys just to be playing at the
highest level.  
  
D.J. LASTER: Yeah, like he said, just a great experience, like something I'll
never forget, something I could tell my kids that I participated in. It's just
good that we were able to do it for the school and do it for the community
also, and I just thank God just giving us the opportunity to play in this.
Just through success and failure, I still give God all the glory for just
giving us the opportunity to compete and play against the Number 1 seed and
showing that we can compete with them in the first half. We just let it go a
little bit. But still give God the glory through success and failure.  
  
BRANDON MILLER: For me, it's unforgettable. I could carry this on for the rest
of my life, and no one can take it from me. You can do what you want at the
end of the day, but we're Conference champs, made history at Gardner-Webb, and
that's something no one can take from us, and we take pride in that.  
  
I'm going to dream about this tonight for sure. It was a great experience, and
the fans have been amazing. There's no better way to go out senior year than
going to March Madness.  
  
JOSE PEREZ: Well, as a freshman playing in March Madness is like definitely a
dream come true, and being a part of it with these guys, they're like family,
especially Dave, D.J., and Brandon. Those are guys that in practice pushed me
every day, even when I was going through the motions sometimes. They just push
me to become better every day. We can compete with anybody. Unfortunately, we
didn't come out with the win today, though.  
  
Q. For you, Jose, obviously, those three seniors, you said pushed you.
You talked a lot about how the seniors have tried so hard to get to this
point. You've got a chance to come back. How much have you learned through
this process, and how much of their leadership will help going forward with
the program?  
JOSE PEREZ: I've learned a ton from them. They're like my role models, even
though I don't tell them because they'll probably pick on me for that. But,
yeah, I learned a lot from them on and off the court, like how to move and
stuff like that. It's just great. It's sad it had to end today, though.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Craft?  
  
Q. In the second half, as they decided to use their size to their
advantage a lot more, how difficult is it for your guys to cover a guy like
De'Andre Hunter, who is an NBA lottery pick, and they're able to really kind
of stretch out that floor?  
TIM CRAFT: Yeah, I think it was difficult for everybody in the ACC this year
for the most part, so it was going to be a difficult challenge for us. We
ended up -- they did, they beat us up on the glass. I thought they made some
good adjustments, both offensively and defensively, to exploit some areas that
in the beginning of the first half, they weren't.  
  
But they were getting it on those pick-and-rolls like right to the block and
being able to kind of finish over our smaller size. And then when they missed
jumpers, they were getting them back a lot early. Credit those guys for
getting to the glass, for fighting on the glass. I was a little disappointed
with our effort on the defensive glass. I didn't think it was -- obviously,
not good enough. But I did think they made some good adjustments to kind of
get it to a spot that was hard for us to guard, and Hunter was -- yeah, he's a
monster for us to guard, and most of the country.  
  
Q. How did you approach halftime? What was going on in your mind, and
what did you tell the team?  
TIM CRAFT: We felt like we had a great half, obviously, and we talked about
some of the things that we felt like led to us getting stops and led to us
being able to get good shots and just kind of emphasized trying to continue to
do those things. We really emphasized trying to communicate defensively on
that far end because they weren't going to have our bench, you know, kind of
talking to them and calling things out and to try to stay connected there.  
  
I think in that first four minutes, I really thought that first four minutes
was going to be critical, whichever way it went. If we were able to make a run
there early, maybe we put a little pressure on them, but that didn't happen. I
thought, when they made a couple buckets and we struggled to score and had
some bad offensive possessions, then we started to break down defensively. We
started to give stuff up that we didn't give up in the first half. Some of
that was mental, just not responding to adversity in the way that we needed
to. That was unfortunate.  
  
But I thought that Virginia really made some great adjustments there to attack
us in some weak spots. But that's what we talked about at halftime. We just
tried to emphasize the game plan again, and we said, hey, let's try to do it
again for another 20 minutes.  
  
Q. At that point, the elephant in the room is you're leading the Number
1 seed. Did you address that at all, or was that all basketball?  
TIM CRAFT: No, it was just about, hey, here's what we've done well. In the
last four minutes, they got a couple offensive rebounds. We've got to keep
fighting on the glass. Here's the keys that we talked about before the game.
Let's make sure we're continuing to do these things well, and let's make sure
we stay connected down on that far end because we're not going to be in your
ear.  
  
And when they make a run because they're going to make a run, we'd better stay
together and be able to come back and have good offensive possessions.  
  
No, we're trying -- we came into the game, obviously, knowing we're playing a
great team, but we certainly came into the game with a game plan and with good
players that we felt like, if we have a chance to execute, we'll have a chance
in the end.  
  
Q. Coach Bennett referenced that last four minutes of the first half and
thought that kind of gave them a little bit of momentum. Surprised that you
started as well as you did? And did you think that that kind of shifted the
game's momentum?  
TIM CRAFT: Well, I wouldn't say I wasn't surprised necessarily. You hope to
start well. You prepare to play well. So when you play well, I don't think
that you're going to be surprised. But our guys played with a lot of
confidence. I think they -- I think probably them talking about some things in
time-outs, talking about some things at halftime as the game wore on and they
got a little bit of a rhythm guarding us, and they made some adjustments. They
started switching Jose Perez's pick-and-rolls, which he had made some threes
early. So that took his threes away. Then we were trying to post him on the
smaller, 0, Clark, their point guard, and they were doubling the post, and we
didn't handle that great.  
  
D.J. Laster had some success inside there early, and they began to double the
post. Their length bothered us when they came with the double-teams, and we
were getting passes deflected. Just our offensive rhythm was out of sorts.
That last three minutes, and I thought a lot of the second half as well.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
Virginia - 71, Gardner-Webb - 56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Virginia head coach Tony Bennett, accompanied by
student-athletes Kyle Guy, De'Andre Hunter, and Ty Jerome.  
  
TONY BENNETT: I thought the way these guys on the last part of the first half
to get it back to a six-point game was pivotal for us because Gardner-Webb's
good. They move hard. They're quick. We understood that. They had a great
backing, you could feel that.  
  
But I thought the way these guys came out and fought.  
  
And then the second half, there was a few adjustments that we did, but these
guys really stepped up and played, and that's a pressure, there's no doubt
about it. You know, when you're in that spot, you feel the crowd, but it's
something we had to go through. I'm glad I'm up here this year feeling a
little different than when I had Ty and Kyle with me last year.  
  
But it's the beauty of the tournament. You just don't know. But we played well
in the second half and the end of the first half, which we needed to do. I was
proud of these guys the way they responded when it got a little -- well, it
was just intense. That's the reality of it.  
  
Q. De'Andre, I know you said the other day you didn't really go through
your head what you could have contributed last season, but it sure looked like
you were trying to make up for lost time the second half. How much did you
take it upon yourself to make sure you guys were going to advance this time?  
DE'ANDRE HUNTER: I was just trying to score on the offense. I didn't play
outside of it. I just tried to be aggressive when my team needed me and make
shots.  
  
Q. What did you learn from last year's disappointment that you think
maybe helped to get you through the adversity that you went through first half
today?  
THE MODERATOR: Start with Ty.  
  
TY JEROME: That's crazy. The first thing is we came into this game knowing
real well we were going to be in for a battle. It wasn't going to be -- last
year was our first time being a 1 seed. So we came into this game knowing how
capable Gardner-Webb was going to be. They punched us in the mouth, but we
just said we've been in that position before. We were at Louisville down 14 or
15, and we came back and won that game.  
  
It's just about doing what we do, staying united, not looking around. Just
staying in the moment.  
  
KYLE GUY: We had an author come and talk to us last year, Joshua Medcalf, and
one of the things he said always stuck with me is be where your feet are. So
some of those outside pressures that can creep into our minds is all external,
and it comes from thinking too much about the future, too much about the past.
So we just tried to be where our feet were and positive reinforcement all the
time and stay united, like Ty said.  
  
Q. Ty and De'Andre, what kind of sparked your second halves, your second
half individual performances, was one of those situations where things kind of
snowballed for you when you saw some shots going. What was the spark for what
you guys were able to do in the second half?  
DE'ANDRE HUNTER: Like I said, I was just being more aggressive. Got some easy
buckets at the rim, got a couple and ones, got the energy going up. I felt
like that helped us in the second half, and he started to make shots, as well.
So I feel like those shots helped our team a lot.  
  
TY JEROME: For me it was coming out and being in attack mode, trying to touch
the paint and get guys shots. If the shots didn't fall, keep telling them keep
shooting them. As long as we get good shots, I could live with whatever
happened. I just told my guys to keep on the fly, especially Kyle. He's been
doing it all year. Key hit Kyle, Mamadi gave us a huge lift in the second
half, and like you said, Dre was great. The main thing was stops. We knew, if
we could get stops, the ball would eventually go in. So for us, it was really
about getting spots.  
  
Q. At each time-out, it seemed like Coach Bennett was saying things to
keep you calm and keep your heads in the game. What was he saying during the
first half, and what did you guys talk about at halftime that enabled you to
come out and play as you did at the start of the second half?  
KYLE GUY: These answers are going to become redundant, but that's what got us
through the game. Like Ty said, we knew we were in for a battle, and Coach
reminded us that we already knew that, and we've stood the test of time. Now
we're just playing our game and staying in attack mode and getting stops and
getting good looks, and we'll live with the outcome.  
  
TY JEROME: Every time-out, we had a different mindset because, I mean, I
remember last year, halftime against UMBC, one of our coaches came in
screaming at us, and we -- (laughter).  
  
TONY BENNETT: I was out there doing an interview. So it wasn't me.  
  
TY JEROME: We felt their panic last year at halftime, and that was one thing I
remember, not doing a good job keeping everyone calm. That's what I pride
myself on, too. Every time-out, it's just a matter of keeping guys calm,
keeping guys calm, but also keeping our edge. You've got to find a balance.
You can't come out, everything's going to be okay, stay calm. Just trying to
find the right balance of staying calm and keeping our edge.  
  
Q. De'Andre, after one of your three-pointers, you sort of spread your
arms really wide and smiled. After not being able to play in this tournament
last year, how gratifying was it for you to be able to contribute and hit some
of those three-pointers?  
DE'ANDRE HUNTER: It was great. I was having fun. As Kyle said, I was just
being in the moment, being where my feet were in. I was happy because I was
missing some, and when I made that one, I was really excited.  
  
Q. Just want to ask Ty, you mentioned Mamadi. Talk about his development
offensively, and do you look for him more now than you did maybe earlier in
the year?  
TY JEROME: I think the biggest difference -- first of all, we don't
necessarily look for certain people. We're never going to not throw a ball to
somebody that's open, you know what I mean? For us, it's just about getting
the best shot we possibly can. But I think the biggest difference, what I was
most proud of Mamadi for, he did something today, and I don't know he could
have done it at the beginning of the year. He came out and had a shaky start,
and the way he responded was huge for us. We needed every bit of it, and
that's something he definitely couldn't do last year, and that's just a
testament to his growth as a person, really, more than a player, just his
ability to respond and fight through adversity.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for coach?  
  
Q. Tony, was that a conscious thing to try to stay a little calmer and
keep everybody a little calmer in the halftime locker room this time around?
And what was your message?  
TONY BENNETT: It was a different halftime than last time. It was just the
ability because I thought we had fought back, as I mentioned, at the end of
the first half, to get ourselves in a spot where there was a lot of basketball
left. It was one thing I said to my staff, and we just talked right before we
went in there. I said, uplift them, and we talked about don't panic, but play
with fight, because that's what got them back in.  
  
When you look at the stat sheet, I think the difference was some offensive
rebounds, some scrambling for loose balls. We had ten steals. I don't know how
many we had in the second half versus the first half. Yes, we made some
adjustments that I think helped the guys out there, but it was, you know,
don't you dare leave anything in this locker room. You don't panic, but you
play the right way with, I guess -- I don't know if calm is the right word,
but I thought that they did that with the fight. Last year, you could feel
that. You could feel it at the game. You ask any coach who's been in that
game, and it gets tight and we're the only one who's really experienced the
other side of it, but that's real stuff.  
  
I thought the guys just kept plugging, and Gardner-Webb missed some shots.
Maybe they got fatigued. I thought the resolve of our team was good to weather
that storm and have a good second half.  
  
Q. You guys outscored them 22-5 to start the second half. To build that
lead, it looked like you were attacking inside. Was that part of your strategy
at halftime?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, we wanted to give them something where they could be
assertive and not mix things up, and say run this, run that. Just here's our
base and play out of it, and get on the glass. I thought we did that. If
there's something inside, yes, try to get to the lane. Then, obviously, some
shots went down, and it was definitely part of it. We had to, without forcing
or taking too many bad shots. So I thought there was a good balance.  
  
Q. What did you know about Gardner-Webb, and what did they do that was
so effective for them early on?  
TONY BENNETT: I knew -- one of our assistant coaches, Kyle Getter, was at
Liberty with Coach McKay. Just watching them play, I watched them against
Georgia Tech, Wake Forest, even Virginia Tech. They didn't have D.J. the first
half against them. But then in the tournament, how -- when you play teams that
are five guards or four guards that shoot 40 percent from the three, their
offense is fast. They slip ball screens. That was hard. We tried to prepare as
well as we could, and we struggled. I think the nerves were there, but they
were banging shots and had us chasing, and they did a good job defensively.  
  
So we had all the respect. Those guys said it right. You know that. Certain
teams in matchups are challenging. I mean, they all are at this level, but
that's a tough one. You don't play a lot of teams like that in the ACC. Their
quickness was noticeable, how fast they played offensively, and then again we
turned it over. We were a little tight, I think, early with our turnovers, and
all of that started feeding in. In some ways it felt like a road game with the
crowd, too. Being less than two hours, Gardner-Webb people came out and
supported them, but the Virginia faithful were there, too. You had a lot of
those dynamics going. Much respect for Coach Craft. He's good, really good.  
  
Q. Tony, do you feel like today's win kind of, I don't know, gets you
past what happened last year, and now these guys maybe can relax a little bit
and play in the NCAA Tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: Did you watch Oklahoma play? I didn't get to watch it, but my
staff said they were impressive. So that will always be part of our story. I
understand that. I'm sure a lot of people thought it was going to be part of
our story the second year in a row. But it's just now, this is a new year.
This is trying to be in the moment, and that's a challenge to the best of your
ability. So now you get your rest, you prepare for Oklahoma, and get ready.  
  
So I'll tell you that after the game on Sunday, but I think it was important
for those guys, a lot of them were hoping to be in this position again, and
they stepped to the challenge even though it was a little wobbly at times.  
  
Q. Tony, you were talking about scrambling for loose balls and being
more aggressive. One guy who seemed to be really doing that quite a bit was
Kihei. Would you mind talking about what he gave you today and what Mamadi
gave you today?  
TONY BENNETT: When you go against these quick teams, you have to sometimes
match the quickness to the best of your abilities. Last year, we didn't have
Kihei or De'Andre, so that allowed us to be a little more versatile to match
their quickness and then to switch some of those ball screens. I thought his
competitiveness and his ability to come up with loose balls was significant --
banged a three, just did some things that were good. He played, obviously,
very poised and well for a first-year.  
  
And then Mamadi, I think Ty hit it on the head, and it wasn't all Mamadi's
fault. It was just a little hard early, getting used to their pace. Again, we
made some adjustments that helped him defensively, but, boy, he really did a
good job on the glass playing hard, finishing some stuff, and that lift was
huge because you have to get some easy baskets. You can't just live and die by
the three. I thought we tried to do a little better this time.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have our student-athletes from North Dakota State
University. We'll introduce the athletes. Tyson Ward, Deng Geu, Jared
Samuelson, and Vinnie Shahid.  
  
Q. Is this now the dream or the nightmare scenario for you?  
VINNIE SHAHID: It's another basketball game. For 40 minutes, we're going to
compete and plan on winning.  
  
JARED SAMUELSON: We're really excited for this opportunity, obviously, to go
out and compete and play another game.  
  
DENG GEU: Every opportunity to play March Madness is still part of the dream.
Just come at it like another basketball game. Just come ready to compete.  
  
TYSON WARD: What they said.  
  
Q. Guys, you're 5-0 in March. What is it about this month where you
seemingly figured it out and are playing such good basketball?  
TYSON WARD: Every game is a big game, no matter who you're playing against. 40
minutes are up on the clock, and you know you don't want to go home. You put
that in your mind and put it in the game plan, you don't want to go home. You
just set your jaw and get ready for a good game.  
  
DENG GEU: I think it's a win or go home factor. It brings out everyone's
competitiveness and you play to the best of your ability.  
  
JARED SAMUELSON: We're just playing our best basketball right now, which is
obviously what you want in late March. So hopefully, we can keep that up.  
  
VINNIE SHAHID: I think we're doing a good job of hammering the details and
staying in the moment. March is a fun time of year, and you can see our guys
are having fun playing the game in the month of March.  
  
Q. Tyson, growing up in the southeast, did you watch Duke a lot growing
up and one of those kids who always wanted to be a Blue Devil?  
TYSON WARD: They're always on TV, always a good game to watch. Always have a
great competition, great team. Wherever I could go, whoever gave me the
opportunity to play was going to be the place where I'd be, and North Dakota
State was the place to be.  
  
Q. So how do you put that aside and just try to treat them like another
team then?  
TYSON WARD: Just exactly like you said, just treat them as another team. It's
40 minutes on the clock. It's 0-0, ball's tipped, and you just play
basketball, do something that you've been doing for your whole life.  
  
Q. Tyson, can you speak to Sam Griesel's growth this year? True freshman
coming in and has improved seemingly throughout the season. Can you talk a
little bit to that?  
TYSON WARD: He's been big time. You can tell he's been in the gym a lot this
year. A couple of the guys have taken him into the gym personally and just
hammered some things with him. He's willing to listen and get better and do
everything it takes to help this team out. It's a true testament to what he's
been doing on and off the court. You can see that it's been reflecting into
this late March, and he's been playing real well.  
  
Q. Vinnie, can you just take us through your travel the last couple of
days? Normal, or has it been a little bit hectic?  
VINNIE SHAHID: It's travel. There were some late nights. Definitely not an
excuse for tomorrow when the ball tips up. It's definitely a little different
for us, but there's definitely no excuse there.  
  
Q. Did you get here today or last night?  
VINNIE SHAHID: Last night.  
  
Q. Deng, how do you try to match up with Williamson, just the sheer
size?  
DENG GEU: I think just come out and compete. Don't know what's going to
happen, but you just come out and play as hard as you can and at the end, see
what happens.  
  
Q. This question's for Vinnie. Vinnie, a lot has been made that not a
lot was expected of this team going into this season. What was your guys'
expectation as a team meeting in fall ball? Was it to be here in March
Madness?  
VINNIE SHAHID: Definitely. I think we saw this plan at the beginning of June.
When we came together as a family, we saw this happening. Through the ups and
downs, many people were like, they're too young, they can't do this. But I
think our locker room stayed together, and we definitely kept our mind on the
goal at stake, was to get here to March Madness, and not only to get here but
to win some games.  
  
Q. I know you guys have said it's just another game. Has there been any
talk at all in the locker room or from the coaches? You're going to face Coach
Krzyzewski tomorrow, you're going to face Duke. Bill Raftery and Jim Nantz are
out there calling the game. Has there been any talk at all about the bright
lights and the focus?  
VINNIE SHAHID: We're aware. We're human. Anybody that doesn't think about it
or tells you that they don't think about it, they're lying to you because
we're human and we do think about it. At the end of the day, like Tyson said
earlier, when the ball goes up and it tips, it's something we've all been
doing our whole lives, 40 minutes goes on the clock, and it's the basketball
game.  
  
Q. Tyson, just take us through the experience so far of going through
the Selection Sunday, traveling to Dayton, now here in Columbia. What's the
experience been like for you here so far?  
TYSON WARD: It's every college basketball player's dream. You know you put in
a lot of work from when you're a young kid. You fill out your brackets, and
you're like, man, I really want to be on a team to play in the NCAA Tournament
and win some games. It's a dream come true. It's just been surreal. Sharing
this moment with these guys and just being able to live in the moment, it's
just been great and a great opportunity, and I've been blessed -- we've been
blessed to share this journey.  
  
Q. Tyson, can you speak a little bit to the job that Coach Richman has
done this year. Again, these guys have touched on the expectations maybe
weren't high to start the season, but you're playing your best ball now. What
has Coach Richman done to get you to this point?  
TYSON WARD: Been doing the same thing, just getting us better in every
practice. Making sure we're making our way with Coach Miller and just doing
the little things because that's what really keeps us to think about the
little things, the things that have gotten us here. Just constantly hammering
on us like, hey, defense, defense, defense. Just little things. That's really
all I can say is just hammering the little things.  
  
Q. Jared, what's this team's mentality been like shooting from beyond
the arc? Just the ability to hit three-pointers and being able to get to the
rim and space the floor? How has that been an attribute the last couple
games?  
JARED SAMUELSON: Shot selection is big for us on offense. We're confident
shooters out there. We've been working in the gym and stuff like that. We have
confidence in ourselves, and that's how you become a good shooter. We've been
doing a good job of sharing the ball, setting each other up, and just got to
rise up and knock it down.  
  
Q. Deng, your season, the international experience, can you sum it up a
little bit in the last several months?  
DENG GEU: This summer I got the opportunity to compete for the Uganda national
team in the FIBA World Cup qualifiers. It was a great experience, just going
out there, meeting new people, and getting a taste of professional basketball.
I think it really helped me this season with confidence and just slowing down
the game.  
  
Q. Did you face anybody the caliber of what you might be seeing tomorrow
in the tournament?  
DENG GEU: Yeah, there was a couple of NBA guys on the Nigeria team, but
obviously, Duke has some really good talent. So I think so.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
North Dakota State head coach, David Richman. Opening statement, and then
we'll open the floor for questions.  
  
DAVID RICHMAN: A few more people here than Dayton the other day. Obviously,
we're extremely excited to be here, unbelievable opportunity and unbelievable
challenge for us tomorrow night. We stressed to the guys along the way, going
back to the Thursday before we left for the summer league tournament, that
make sure you embrace this journey. We talked about that all year, but make
sure you stay in the moment. Enjoy this along the way, but also come 7:10
tomorrow night, be ready to compete.  
  
Obviously, against a team that I don't really need to explain. Duke is Duke.
Coach K is Coach K, and the success that he's had, a lot of challenges, a lot
of just great opportunities for us. We'll be excited and ready to compete
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. You're a guy that spent almost your entire life in North Dakota. I
think you went to Northern Iowa for a little bit, and tomorrow night you're
going to be coaching against Coach Krzyzewski on the biggest stage. Can you
just put that in perspective, what that means for a North Dakota kid?  
DAVID RICHMAN: It's obviously really, really cool. I think at the end of the
day, you are who you are because of your roots. I was raised by two wonderful
people. My mom and dad, John and Marsha, and my sister, great family that
really is the core of who I am. Again, hopefully who I am is a guy of
tremendous virtue.  
  
But to be on this stage tomorrow night, CBS, to coach against obviously a Hall
of Famer, a legend, I don't know if I could have dreamt this, Mike, a couple
years ago.  
  
Q. Are you ready for it?  
DAVID RICHMAN: Absolutely. Ready or not, here it comes. With a great challenge
comes a great opportunity, and certainly, I'm going to be ready for it, and I
know our guys will, as well.  
  
Q. Have you had a chance to talk to Coach Krzyzewski?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I have not had a chance to talk to Coach.  
  
Q. I'm just curious, when you go up in a matchup like this against a
team with future NBA players, a guy like Zion, who's obviously taken over
college basketball. Do you, as a coach, kind of view this as a stressful,
challenging situation or something you're excited about? How do I scheme
against these guys? How do I make this come together?  
DAVID RICHMAN: Coach Miles, the guy who I started working with, said when he
left college, he got into college coaching because of the environment and the
experience of college. I get the narrative about stress and all this, but this
is fun. You think about it. We get to play college basketball. We get to coach
college basketball. So I think maybe, if there was any pressure, it was the
other night, Wednesday night, in Dayton for some of our guys to just
experience that, but that's gone away, and we're all excited for the
opportunity.  
  
Q. Dave, facing Duke, I think Vinnie sort of addressed this, saying
we're human. Any fear of deer in the headlights with your guys, a team with no
seniors?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I was just thinking about that. They don't have any seniors
either. Really, again, I think we just kind of addressed that in the last
question a little bit. I think some of that deer in the headlights, I did see
a little bit of that the other night against a really good North Carolina
Central team, and I think some of that's gone. We expect a lot of pressure
from Duke. We expect them to come out, teed up, ready to go, like the Number 1
seed would. We'll see. I think it's important, like we've stressed to them all
along, the quicker you can figure out you're doing something you've done your
entire life, the quicker your chances of success will be.  
  
Q. Coach, whether it's at a shootaround or even having the guys on stage
before you came up, there's a certain chemistry and camaraderie among the
guys. Was that something that was present from the start of the season? Did it
develop throughout the season? What was Vinnie's role in all of that?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I was thinking about that. It really has, and it really went
back to about May, early June, when our guys went on an FCS like week long
deal in the twin cities and really formed a great bond. There was a great
bunch of eight guys that stuck around in the spring and had a tremendous
spring. And then they welcomed and embraced those six new guys with open arms.
For a guy like Vinnie to come in and to be named captain five, six weeks,
maybe a couple months into it is pretty darn neat.  
  
But you can see his personality. You can see his smile. You can see his sense
for the moment that his guys embrace him, and he embraces them real quick.  
  
Q. What changes have you seen in Sam Griesel throughout the year, from
the start of the year, true freshman up until last night, I guess?  
DAVID RICHMAN: One of the biggest things with Sam is Vinnie. It makes more
sense to me when you're there at 6:00 a.m. in the morning for lifting sessions
and just different things, where Vinnie just breeds confidence in everybody,
myself included. When we were able to get Sam in late May, we knew we had
something really special. That's a young man that looks the part, just attacks
his job with great resolve every day. He's been more invested in the weight
room and the diet and those things than I anticipated.  
  
But I think you could see from the moment we started him, that he was going to
be pretty good. Then he had that injury, and I think it was really telling,
when he came back in that Omaha game, that he didn't play great, but he didn't
play with fear. If you think about it, sitting there with five, six weeks with
a knee injury like that, he could have been hesitant. He's grown. He's come
out of his shell a little bit socially, been more comfortable, getting
outward. I think a big part of that is Vinnie and his teammates just breathing
confidence into him all the time.  
  
Q. You played Gonzaga as a Number 1 team, in Spokane in late November.
Do you use that game as a template at all coming into this game at least from
a mindset point of view?  
DAVID RICHMAN: Maybe the first ten minutes. That's it. We had a lot of other
extenuating circumstances at the time, some tough travel. Sam was out. It's a
game where Cameron got hurt. But also, I think it showed us that for the first
ten minutes, when we were locked in and fresh, so to speak, we can compete. We
know that we're a different team. Duke's obviously got more experience now
than they did at that time of the year, like Gonzaga would this time of year.
But there's certainly some things I hope we can lean on.  
  
Q. Dave, how much did Dayton, the first four game, just kind of help get
the taste in the mouth of your team in understanding what an NCAA Tournament
atmosphere is like?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I'm hoping it helped a lot. I saw some things that, again, I've
said it all along about this group. This is an experience group. What I mean
by that is you can talk to them about the experience, you can show them
experience, and they don't quite get it until they actually live the
experience. Wednesday night was them living the experience. Hopefully, that
will help us relax, get that deer in the headlights out of us, so to speak,
early in the game.  
  
Q. Who's the toughest guy on your team to say let's just play
basketball, let's just go out there and play a game?  
DAVID RICHMAN: Jared Samuelson; no hesitation. If you go into our video room,
there's a big sign that talks about being tough and together. Jared Samuelson
is tough, and he's together. His teammates love him. You've really got
something in the huddle. Jared doesn't say much at all, but when you get into
some of those moments, you go back to Santa Barbara at home, you go back to
the other night, last night, when he's teed up and he's locked in, it's pretty
cool because his teammates really embrace that, and it starts with his
toughness.  
  
Q. Follow up on that Dave, we like to talk about Jared's three-point
ability, but how about his ability to take charges? Smallest guy out there,
and he's diving on the floor getting burns. Just talk about his tenacity
defensively?  
DAVID RICHMAN: I think that's the beauty of March. If you flipped open a
dictionary and looked for a Division I basketball player, Jared Samuelson is
probably not the first guy that shows up. What you can't measure is somebody's
heart. What you can't measure is someone's basketball IQ. From the time you
saw Jared at a camp three or four summers ago until today, in a sense, it's
really not surprising. He's a guy that we talk about setting our jaw and just
competing. Jared sets his jaw every day. Not just in games, but in practice
and film sessions. He's at the edge of his seat.  
  
And in a kid that we couldn't hide more his first or second year trying to
guard the ball, now he's guarding the opponents' best perimeter guy. It's a
pretty neat deal.  
  
Q. Coach, maybe the biggest game in the history of North Dakota as far
as a sporting event. With so many eyeballs back home watching on CBS tomorrow
night, what would be your message to the people back home who are tuning in
and maybe seeing the Bison for the first time this year?  
DAVID RICHMAN: Hopefully, we represent the people back home. North Dakota is a
great state, and I like to say this, it's a state that for three, four months
out of the year gets really cold, but that keeps the riff-raff out, and it
adds some toughness. I think what you'll see tomorrow and I think what you've
seen the last back end of the year, when we've got some experience on these
guys, is a blue collar mentality. In Fargo, North Dakota, West Fargo, the Red
River Valley, Moorhead, the State of North Dakota, there's some tremendous
people with great resolve and toughness, and hopefully that's what this Bison
men's basketball team looks like, as well.

### [Marcus Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36973)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our student-athletes from Virginia Commonwealth University,
Marcus Evans, De'Riante Jenkins, Marcus Santos-Silva and Issac Vann. Please
introduce yourself and let us know your affiliation.  
  
Q. Marcus, can you give us an update on how the knee's feeling, what
you've been able to do this week?  
MARCUS EVANS: It's feeling better each day, still day-to-day. I got in
practice today and got moving a lot. So it's starting to feel better. I'm
looking forward to Friday.  
  
Q. Marcus, how would you describe your evolution over the last year or
so, especially as a defensive player? From your time at Rice now to your time
with Coach Rhoades at VCU.  
MARCUS EVANS: I think it's changed a lot. In the off-season, we all decided to
buy in. We knew defensively, it was a thing we had to improve on. In practice
especially, with a team as talented as this, you're going against guys every
day who are just as good as you. As the season progressed, we knew that was
going to be the key to our season. I just took it more personally as the
season went on.  
  
Q. This is for De'Riante. You're one of the few players on the team who
was in the 2017 tournament with that team. What was it like last year not to
be in the tournament, and what is it that you guys would like to accomplish
and prove to people this year?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: The feeling was strange to sit home watching the games on
TV, wishing you were out there and knowing the things you've got to work on
and improve just to get to this point in the season. We're just going to play
our style of basketball, and that's going to take care of itself.  
  
Q. De'Riante, you're one of the few that have played on this court in
high school. What do you remember about those state championship games and the
memories you have? Pretty good ones when you guys beat Newberry.  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: Yes, it was a great feeling. The second year we lost, so I
just tried to redeem myself and get the good feeling in the crowd and in the
locker room, and everyone just feeling that, and we have to go from there.  
  
Q. Marcus, just talking about the knee, you say it's getting better
every day. Do you feel limited in any way, in any activities you have to do?
Do you feel limited, and are there still improvements you think you can make
before game time?  
MARCUS EVANS: Obviously, I'm still working each day rehabbing, but I haven't
felt anything to hold me back so far, and everything I've been doing,
obviously, it's hard to simulate a game situation until you're out there, but
like I said, I've been feeling better each day, and we're all just looking
forward to Friday.  
  
Q. Marcus, as you look at the matchup with Tacko Fall and that,
particularly the size difference, how do you prepare for something like that,
and what do you see from him on film?  
MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA: Just focus on what he's good at, and, of course, he's
really tall, and just do what I've been doing the whole season. I feel like
I'll be all right.  
  
Q. Is there any matchup you can compare to that one?  
MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA: No, not at all.  
  
Q. De'Riante, what has Marcus brought to VCU basketball this year that
perhaps you guys didn't have last season when he was sitting out and also
hurt?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: Competitive edge. He's a tough player. We know we get out
of him every single night. He's going to heat the ball up and bring his
energy. We feed off of him every single night.  
  
Q. For anyone other than Marcus Evans, how important is having him in
this game? And how difficult or challenging is it to have the uncertainty of
maybe not knowing how full strength he might be?  
ISSAC VANN: He's an important part of our offense and defense. It's huge.
Whether he plays or not, we know if he plays, we know what he's going to
bring. If not, we know he's going to be a huge supporter on the bench.  
  
Q. Again for Marcus, you talked about Tacko Fall and how it's difficult
-- you can't compare it to anything. Have you tried to simulate that in
practice? You've got like broomsticks or ladders or something like that?  
MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA: We've been simulating it in practice. One of our
assistant coaches, Coach Scott, he's been practicing too because he's really
tall and big. We've used like pads to simulate him blocking shots. But nothing
really until you actually play the game.  
  
Q. Question for I.V. We've heard a lot about Tacko, but what has Coach
Rhoades stressed to you this week? What has Coach Rhoades stressed to you
about what UCF does well?  
ISSAC VANN: We've just got to move the ball. Once their defense is set, we
know they're a solid defensive team. We can't play one-on-one basketball.
We've got to get the ball hot and move from side to side, do what we do.  
  
MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA: Also, pressuring them when they're on offense, and don't
let them get comfortable at all and just deny everything. Then just do what we
do, and we'll be fine.  
  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: He's big on style of play. It's a style of play game, he
said. Their style of play versus our style of play, and which one is going to
win over.  
  
MARCUS EVANS: I mean, they said it all, yeah.  
  
Q. Marcus Evans, we've never really heard what exactly happened that
injured the knee. Did you just land awkwardly on it and something went out?  
MARCUS EVANS: Yeah, when I came down, kind of hyperextended it. Obviously,
with my history, I didn't know exactly what it was until we got in the back,
and our trainer kind of informed me everything was still intact. Then like I
said, just this whole week he's been great with me, just rehabbing, just
trying to get me back to feeling 100 percent.  
  
Q. Marcus, was there ever much doubt that you were going to have a
reunion with Coach Rhoades after he left Rice for VCU and considering how
close it is to home for you?  
MARCUS EVANS: Yeah, when I left Rice, I obviously looked around, was looking
for the best opportunity, but after talking to some coaches and narrowing down
the list, having an opportunity to come home was huge for me. And then like I
said, the familiarity of VCU and the coaching staff kind of just made sense.  
  
Q. For all you guys, VCU sort of launched as a brand, as a big underdog
story. Now all these years later, and you guys have been to a number of
tournaments, do you still feel like you have any of that underdog persona when
you think nationally? Or do you think you're more of an established brand at
this point?  
MARCUS SANTOS-SILVA: Definitely yes. I feel like people still doubt us of
things we can do. I feel like this whole season we've been doubted a lot. We
definitely feel like we're still the underdog and still need to prove to
people who we are.  
  
ISSAC VANN: Definitely. Going into each and every game, we've got an underdog
mindset, even before the season, we were picked seventh and ninth. We've seen
the disrespect all year. That's just a mindset we have every day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: De'Riante or Marcus, you want to add to that?  
  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: No, they pretty much said it all. That's just who VCU is.
That's what we feed off of, and that's how we built this from dudes in the
past until now as the underdog.  
  
Q. De'Riante, the NCAA's new metric this season ranks your nonconference
schedule among the top five in the country. How did those games prepare you
for not only the Atlantic 10 season, but perhaps this stage, as well?  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: We learned each game. We learned each game, and we use each
game as a measuring stick and come back in practice and just learn. In
conference play, it helped us. We seen ourself in those situations in
conference play, and we just learned from it.  
  
Q. For Marcus or De'Riante or both, BJ Taylor, their point guard, what
do you see out of him? What type of player do you think he is?  
MARCUS EVANS: He's a crafty guard. Obviously, he's strong. One of the things
that we realize is he draws a lot of fouls. So the thing about it is just
being disciplined when we guard him. Keep the ball in front. Any good player
is going to make tough shots, so you can't be discouraged if he hits a few
shots. You just try to make it tough for him, make him take tough shots every
game, and we'll be fine.  
  
THE MODERATOR: De'Riante?  
  
DE'RIANTE JENKINS: Marcus said everything.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for our student-athletes? Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
VCU head coach Mike Rhoades.  
  
MIKE RHOADES: Just really excited to be here. Appreciate everyone and their
hospitality. It's been great. Our guys are excited. They can't wait to play.
We've got a long wait tomorrow, but we're looking forward to being a part of
March Madness.  
  
Q. Mike, can you talk about what you've done in practice to simulate
Tacko Fall's size and height, and how you prepare the guys for that?  
MIKE RHOADES: I wish we could say we got up on a chair with some broomsticks,
but you can't really move very well that way. We've just did a couple drills
like that, when we talk about awareness drills of teams we play who have a
different style or a different player or somebody with great size or great
quickness. We talk about breaking down parts of the game, and we call them
awareness drills, to be aware of a really fast player like a Briante Weber
guarding you or a guy like Tacko Fall around the rim that you're not just
going to go in and shoot a finger roll. That's not going to happen.  
  
So a couple of awareness drills for guys to understand it's got to be on the
front of their mind when they're playing in the heat of the game, without a
doubt. A lot of it is prepare for the opponent, but it's all about us and
making sure we're ready to go.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
MIKE RHOADES: We had a guy on our team like that, like Larry Sanders, where if
you're going to attack somebody that big and they're waiting for you and ready
for you, it's probably not a good decision. We've got to play they way we do
with our style of play and move that ball and be fast and do what we always
do, try to get our opponent chasing and being a step or two late. But if
they're standing there waiting, it's not going to work.  
  
Q. Larry Sanders is 6'11 ", and he's still seven inches shorter than
Tacko Fall.  
MIKE RHOADES: Right.  
  
Q. Could you talk a moment about how you got Marcus Evans to Rice, how
your relationship with him has grown over the years, and the defensive impact
he's had on your team this year?  
MIKE RHOADES: When I was an assistant with Coach Smart, of course, we always
recruited that area of the 757, and Marcus was an underclassman at Great
Bridge when I was recruiting Briante Weber. I knew of Marcus. I knew he played
for the Boo Williams AAU program, which is one of the best in the country. I
just kept an eye on him, kept a tag on him, and he kept getting better every
year. He wasn't the shooter that he is now, but he was just a dynamic type of
guard the way he moved, and stayed in touch with him and his coaches.  
  
Then when the Rice -- we were recruiting him and staying in touch with him
when I was an assistant at VCU, but when all that went down with Rice and I
was going there, he was one of the first phone calls -- I think I called him
before I called and offered some assistant coaches a job. I think it was a
good move. And just the neat thing about Marcus is his competitive spirit, his
competitive edge. I knew it would fit my personality really well, and I
thought then, and I still feel it now, but probably his greatest strength is
he just has a competitive spirit that his teammates catch, too. That's the
biggest thing.  
  
You see that when he plays defense ball. He can guard the ball different ways,
but he can just constantly put pressure on the game with his defensive
pressure and his knack. I guess there's something in the water at Great Bridge
because on-the-ball defense, we've been very fortunate at VCU to have some
guys from Great Bridge that can really guard the ball and pressure the game
and impact the game just by his defensive presence.  
  
Q. Obviously, forcing turnovers is big for you guys, so what are your
impressions of their guards, BJ Taylor and Terrell Allen?  
MIKE RHOADES: Very good players. You can't play in that conference with a
really good team -- be a really good team and play against all those other
guards if you can't hold your own and do more. BJ is a really talented player.
I remember him for a number of years now. He can make plays. He's strong. He
handles the ball. He's an upperclassman. Allen can really play and handle the
ball. Everybody can handle the ball. Guards are really good when you get to
this point in the year, without a doubt, and they've seen all types of
defenses. It doesn't mean you're just going to turn somebody over and get a
steal every time down the court, but that's just what we do. We play. We want
to have great pressure and mess things up for the other team as best we can,
but you're playing against really good players, too, so number one, you've got
to respect them, and you've got to have a plan against them. But also, we're
going to do what we do, and hopefully, that's enough.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke about this year being a learning experience. Is
there any team that you can go back to in your nonconference schedule or
regular conference season that has a style or tendency of UCF? Anything look
similar or familiar?  
MIKE RHOADES: I think Temple, playing Temple early in the year is similar with
that, the way they play, and the two games that they played against each
other. You saw some similar tendencies. And probably some of the teams in our
league are similar with really strong guards, confident guards, and then
really solid around the rim and guys that can make plays.  
  
So we've played a really tough schedule, and I think all our games this year
really helped us. We had some games where we got the style of play going. We
had some games where we had to grind it out, some games we didn't shoot the
ball well but our defense showed up. Hopefully, all those experiences help us.
There are some teams similar. I would think Temple is one of them, for sure,
and then I think it's more about preparing for whoever you play in the NCAA
Tournament. You've got to make sure your team's right, more important than the
plan itself.  
  
Q. What did Marcus Evans' workload look like over the last day or so,
and what will it look like over the next 24 hours for Friday night?  
MIKE RHOADES: He's worked really hard. He's rehabbed. He's pretty much lived
in the training room since Saturday. Each day has been a little bit better.
Workload, probably more today than he has all week. Probably tomorrow, we'll
move him around a little bit and shoot around. We'll see where he is. He's not
100, but he's going to give it a shot, and we'll see from there.  
  
Q. Mike, how good does it feel to be here after not being here last year
for the first time since 2011? And how tough is it to be in the 8-9 matchup
where neither team is really favored, neither team is really an underdog?
Since '85, it's 68-68 in those games. What do you want to prove, and what can
you prove from that spot?  
MIKE RHOADES: Just to be back here -- I said this numerous times throughout
the year. We had to go through a year like last year for us to sort of
recalibrate who we are. You have to go through some stuff to build your
culture. You have to go through some stuff that you don't always like to build
the program the way you want it. I'm not saying we got spoiled because this is
something we want to do all the time, but we've got to make sure we're always
doing it the right way on and off the court and that we're never taken it for
granted.  
  
I think this year everybody is very appreciative the position we're in, but I
think it was -- the reason we're here is because of all the work these guys
did in the spring of last year, the summer and the fall, when nobody was
watching, when the lights weren't on. That's what I'm most proud about. That's
building and working on our culture, which if you have that, then it gives you
a better chance to get to the NCAA Tournament each year.  
  
On top of that, I think the experience of this season, we probably surprised
some people and then kept getting better and better. That gives us confidence
to go in a tournament, whatever your seeding is. 8-9, you're exactly right,
very similar teams, but it's about how we prepare and how we go about it. We
played some really good teams. We played a bunch of teams that are in the NCAA
Tournament. So I think our guys are going to be really excited, but I don't
think they'll be nervous. I think they really want to play, and they deserve
it for sure.  
  
Q. If you're facing a team that's got a really dominant left-handed
player -- and, obviously, you're going to go over that in the scouting report
-- but do you find that still, sometimes guys in the heat of the battle, that
kind of eludes them a little bit, and they might shade towards the right hand
accidentally?  
MIKE RHOADES: Yeah, absolutely. Sometimes you do all the scouting report, and
then the ball goes up, the scouting report's out the window. We've all been
there. If you coach long enough, you see it. But we talk about having
awareness all the time. You might do it once because we shoot for a perfect
game, but you're not playing a perfect game. But if you make a mistake, own
it, have awareness, and move on. When you have a clear mind and clear head and
your teammates are helping you, that's maybe when you don't make that mistake
a second and third time. If you make it a second and third time this time of
the year, your season's usually over.  
  
So we talk about having great awareness, and when something doesn't go our
way, own it, move on, and play with a clear head.  
  
Q. Have you found in your experience that lefties tend to use both hands
better than righties do?  
MIKE RHOADES: We really talk -- in our scouting report, we really talk about
personnel and who we're guarding and stuff like that, so our guys know. We're
really big on talking about the scouting report and personnel. So it's just
not a report that the coach gives because he's supposed to do that. We want to
get to a point in our program where our juniors and seniors are pretty much
running the scouting report and personnel and holding their teammates
accountable. We're getting there. We saw that throughout the year.  
  
So tendencies of players, I know a lot of good players that are righty but go
better left because that's what the coaches tell you at a young age and vice
versa. We've got to work on it. We show our guys a lot of tape. We do a lot of
stuff on the court when it comes to personnel of other teams, and we want to
make sure they own the scouting report from that way.  
  
Q. Obviously, the NCAA Tournament is a goal for so many players. Once
they get here, what is the mental preparation like both from an individual
basis and as a team, especially for guys who haven't been here yet, to make
sure they're focused and ready to go for tip-off?  
MIKE RHOADES: You know what's greater than getting in the NCAA Tournament,
winning a game in the NCAA Tournament. Look, their whole lives, these players,
they're pushed. Their first goal is to be a Division I player and get a full
scholarship to get a free education; check. Then the next thing, they want to
go to a basketball school where they can win a championship; check. Then they
want to make the NCAA Tournament; check. You know what's better than all that?
Taking your teammates that you love to be with, your brothers that you're
going to have for the rest of your life, and going in the NCAA Tournament and
winning games. Why not go after that? That's the fun of it. I think you've got
to get your team excited about being here, but go win. That's why we're here.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously, it didn't result in a win, but losing Marcus last
Friday night, but seeing Issac Vann, seeing De'Riante talk to the team, work
those guys around, communication was key. What did your team -- what did you
find out about your team in that moment on the fly last Friday?  
MIKE RHOADES: Well, there was definitely a level of fight, and the guys were
trying to figure it out. I think some of the guys were really nervous for
Marcus because they thought it was like a career-ending injury. They're
thinking of the worst, and that took some time for them to figure that out.  
  
But we've been through some crazy battles, and some of these guys have been
through some coaching changes, some players leaving. Last year Issac Vann
played with a bad leg all year and then got surgery. We had another guy get
surgery. We had some crazy things happen last year. We went through it, not
the results we want in the end, and they've all matured. Now there's another
thing that occurred in the A-10 Tournament last weekend. Figure it out, deal
with it, move on. You saw that during the game.  
  
Now, we didn't win the game and disappointed, but what more do we have? Now
we're here in the NCAA Tournament. What more do we have to give each other?  
  
Q. Probably more of a dilemma for your fans, but with a 9:40 tip
tomorrow night, you guys have only had two or three 9:00 tips this year. How
do you manage time, energy, and emotions tomorrow with the team?  
MIKE RHOADES: We'll sleep in a little bit. We'll have -- we'll do a little
stretching program that we usually do when we play a late game like that.
We'll go shoot around. We'll have our shootaround and walkthrough. Guys will
be watching games. What do you do? I know what some of you guys will do. We
can't do that.  
  
I think, as the day goes on, you watch games, they'll be fired up. 9:40 is a
late start, but these guys have played AAU basketball since probably third
grade, and there's some times you start games at 11:00. They'll be fine.
They'll be raring to go.  
  
Q. De'Riante mentioned the other day that it's kind of a style of play
game. How much has that been kind of the message throughout the week?
Obviously, you want to get the pace up in every game you play, but
particularly, when going up against a player like Tacko, make sure you get the
pace up to where you want it on Friday.  
MIKE RHOADES: It doesn't matter who we play and what the other team has, we
want to play that way because we're going to play a lot of guys. We want the
pace -- I want our guys to play fast. I want them to play aggressive because
that's the fun way to play. That's been successful for us. So we want to do
that. Playing a team for the first time late in the season and you can get the
style of play going, I think that's an advantage.  
  
Now, there's going to be times where we're going to run plays and settle down
here and there, but we definitely want to make sure we're being really
aggressive. If you get beat in the NCAA Tournament, you don't want to have any
we should have or could have. We don't want to say we were on our heels too
much. If we're going to go down, it's because somebody's going to beat us at
their best and us being close to our best, and I can live with that. We want
to make sure that we're playing and the game is going the way we want.  
  
Q. You guys are, I believe, seventh in the country in defensive
efficiency. It's a team effort, I'm sure, but is there one guy you would say
is the ring leader for you defensively?  
MIKE RHOADES: I couldn't pick out one guy, but I will say this: Marcus Evans'
pressure on the ball up the court starts our defense when we're not pressing
or it turns into a half-court. Issac Vann's been guarding perimeter offensive
players at a high level all year long. He should have been All Conference on
the defensive end. I think around the rim, our guys are really versatile and
they can really move, so that really helps our guards. Sometimes takes some
chances, sometimes deny, push the offense out. I think our big guys really
this year have done a great job of protecting the rim and scrambling because
they can really move.  
  
So it's a collective group, without a doubt, but I think certain guys are good
at certain things that have really helped us.  
  
Q. Mike, you said maybe sleep in a little tomorrow. I'm curious, going
back to the preseason, can you remember the last time you slept in?  
MIKE RHOADES: I got three kids, and I take them to school every morning. I
don't sleep in at all. The players will. I mean, these guys would sleep till
2:00 if they could. We're not going to let them. But, no, the problem I have
is I don't go to sleep, and then I go to sleep, and then you hear people
waking up in the morning. So it's over for me. So sleep in May.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
COLUMBIA](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+COLUMBIA)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Mike Krzyzewski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13672)

### [Javin DeLaurier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36125)

### [R.J. Barrett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36968)

### [Zion Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36804)

  
_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the student-athletes from Duke University. We will
introduce the players. Zion Williamson, Javin DeLaurier, and R.J. Barrett.
Open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Zion, you played AAU ball with Devontae Shuler. You've known him for
a while. What was he like as a player then, what was your impressions of him,
and how far along has he come, do you think?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: He has come a long way, obviously. But for me, when I played
with Shuler, I was a ninth grader, he was a tenth grader, and I was like,
yeah, he's the best player in the state. He would impress me with so much,
like he'd get steals but act like he got faked out by a spin move and just
turn right back. He would be a very explosive scorer, like score 15 points
straight. I used to just watch in awe of him. So, yeah, he has come a long
way.  
  
Q. This is for all of you. Notwithstanding the Number 1 seed, this team
has gone through a lot this season, injuries and a tough schedule. How has
this team evolved? We keep hearing brotherhood. How has this brotherhood
evolved for all of you?  
R.J. BARRETT: Yeah, it's been a challenging year, going through adversity,
going through injuries, different stuff like that. Like you said, brotherhood,
we remained together, and that's what's really helped us along.  
  
JAVIN DELAURIER: I would agree with that, and I'd say the adversity that we've
gone through has in a way made us closer, just because, when one guy goes
down, we feel like we owe it to him to continue to produce on the court. And
then when they finally get back and join us, we're just happy to have our
brother back playing with us again.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: To add on to what they said, like, when players get hurt, it
forces you to respond in a different way, and it just makes us closer as a
team because we've been through so much, and the fact that we're here now, I
mean, it's a brotherhood. We bonded through it all, and it just makes us
close.  
  
Q. Zion, does the location of these first two games have any extra
significance to you beyond just the NCAA Tournament because it's in your home
state?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yes and no. Yes, because I didn't think I would ever like
have a chance, once I committed to Duke, to play in the state of South
Carolina in a college basketball game. So that's obviously a blessing, so I'm
very excited about that. And no, because I can't like put my personal
excitement ahead of my teammates because, at the end of the day, I'm on a
team, and I want to win with my teammates, and we have to focus on just
winning.  
  
Q. Zion, did you have an opportunity to watch any of the North Dakota
State game last night? If so, what were your impressions of the Bison?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Yeah, I got to watch some of it. My impressions were very
good. They play as a unit. They can really shoot, and they remained calm, like
they got the lead, and then Central cut it down. But even with that momentum
swing, they didn't like fold. They held their composure, and they got the win.  
  
Q. Zion, you've been like the biggest story in college basketball all
year. How have you maintained your composure through that? And how excited are
you for this chapter of playing in the NCAA Tournament?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I'm going to thank my parents for that because, when I told
them I wanted to be a basketball player when I got older, they told me
everything that would come with that, like all the on court and off court
stuff and the media. So I was prepared for it. I'm very excited to be here
because I watched March Madness as a little kid, and to actually be here
playing for Coach K, playing for Duke, I couldn't ask for a better situation.  
  
Q. Zion, coming back to your home state, has there been any buzz amongst
your family and friends the last couple days? How many people do you expect to
be here to be able to watch you?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: There's going to be a lot of people here because, at the end
of the day, this is Duke University, so people will be here just because we're
Duke. Yeah, I had like a lot of friends and family telling me like good luck
and they're happy for me that I'm able to play in my home state.  
  
Q. R.J., this is your own journey, but your godfather has played in the
tournament. Your dad had a long career playing in college basketball. What
advice did they give you at a time like this? Not necessarily that you need it
or not, but do you listen, and what might they be saying?  
R.J. BARRETT: Just it's been a great year so far, and not to stop, but just to
keep doing what I'm doing, stay even keeled. We have six more games to win, so
just stay together as a unit really.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
R.J. BARRETT: We've been texting back and forth, and he told me just to remain
calm and don't really change what I've been doing all year.  
  
Q. This question is for Zion. What is your most favorite memory about
South Carolina and maybe of this town when you were growing up playing
basketball?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: My favorite memory from playing at Columbia would probably be
my junior year, the Chick-Fil-A Classic. Playing against one of my best
friends, Jalek Felton. Playing against Keenan High School, those three games
we played, those were a very exciting three games. Each game, the gym was
packed, sold out, and the energy that the fans brought was incredible. So
that's my favorite memory from playing at Columbia.  
  
Q. Javin, how has your role either grown or changed because of the
injury to Marques Bolden? And what do you do, anything differently, to prepare
for the games now?  
JAVIN DELAURIER: I wouldn't say my role has changed that much. The
expectations that my teammates and the coaches have for me remain the same.
The only difference is I just have to be a little bit more careful, especially
with fouls and whatnot, just because our rotation has changed because Ques,
obviously, isn't here. But that being said, whenever I'm on the court, I
always just try to do the same thing, play as hard as I can and do whatever I
can to help us win.  
  
Q. R.J., a little off topic, but you played at Montverde when Jermaine
Couisnard was there, who plays here at South Carolina. I think you guys
crossed paths a few times in those scrimmages, post grad versus the undergrad
team. What do you recall about him and his game, and what do you think about
his future playing here at USC?  
R.J. BARRETT: He can shoot. Anywhere over half-court is his range. I remember
guarding him, and he would pull in my face at half-court. I think he'll be
good here.  
  
Q. Kind of fun question for all of the gentlemen. Is there a particular
song on repeat on your playlist right now that's kind of getting you pumped up
and in the game?  
THE MODERATOR: For this, we'll start with Zion and move down the table.  
  
ZION WILLIAMSON: You're asking for just --  
  
Q. The song that you have on repeat that's kind of getting pumped up for
tomorrow's game.  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Mine would be A Dream by Jay-Z and it features Faith Evans
and Notorious B.I.G.  
  
JAVIN DELAURIER: I've been listening to a lot of Roddy Ricch recently. I would
go with Every Season.  
  
R.J. BARRETT: Anything Drake.  
  
Q. Zion, you mentioned that your parents prepared you to handle the
pressures and all the attention you would get. Have any players or coaches
reached out to you to kind of help you also maintain that kind of composure
that you've showed throughout the season?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Like former players or former teammates?  
  
Q. I mean, like with last year, with Trey Young, the way he went
through, not particularly him, but have any players reached out to you helping
guide you through that? Just any advice they might have given you.  
ZION WILLIAMSON: Oh, yes, sir. A few players have reached out to me. I don't
want to say their name because I don't know if they want me to share that
private information, but, yeah, a few players have reached out. They just all
told me what to expect, like it's college. You're going to have some good
things are going to happen, and there's going to be a time where it's not so
good.  
  
So I was kind of prepared for this. I had like a cheat sheet on what to
expect, basically.  
  
Q. Zion, when you look back to last year, between the signing, being
able to win another SC State Championship -- I know that brings a smile to
your face. Obviously, everything's been going on crazy. You have to get ready
to go to Duke. Everyone is talking about what's going to be next for him,
making millions, NBA, all that kind of stuff. When you had your injury a
couple of weeks back and everyone is speculating, did you have the time to
maybe reflect a bit and kind of, you know what, this is my last go, this is
why I want to play, because some people were saying he should just sit this
next one out?  
ZION WILLIAMSON: I did think about that. I always knew I'd be coming back
because I love playing the game of basketball, and I love my teammates. I made
a commitment to them when I committed to Duke. I feel like I would have been a
bad person if I didn't come back. So coming back was not an issue.  
  
But one thing I did think about when I was out was a year has gone by fast.
Just last year I was a senior in high school. My high school season was over
at this point. You know, you just think about life and how you just have to
enjoy every moment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Duke head coach, Mike Krzyzewski. Opening statement and open
the floor for questions.  
  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: We're very excited to be here. Tournament is already going
on. I know our guys are anxious to play. We're coming off of a great
performance in the ACC Championship in the tournament. You'll see, if you
watch our workout for 40 minutes today, that Marques will be ready to play. I
don't know how many minutes, but he'll be ready to play. He won't start. Jack
White; there's a good chance he will not play. He hurt his hamstring a little
bit against Florida State. He's close, but I don't anticipate him playing in
the first game, maybe in the second. If we win, maybe in the second. If we can
continue to win, then hopefully going forward. But Marques will play. So any
questions that you all might have?  
  
Q. Bill Foster preceded you at Duke and then came here to South
Carolina. What do you remember about Coach Foster? And did you ever run into
him after he left and was here?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah. Coach Foster really is one of the outstanding coaches
and guys in the game. Great promoter. Really helped move the needle for Duke
in those late '70s because, after Coach Bubas left in the '60s and the start
of the '70s was a rocky time. When Coach Bubas did such a great job and then
Bill put together a great team and almost won the National Championship and
left. We had a couple years of rebuilding and then were able to keep it going.  
  
Q. Coach, why do you think your four freshmen have been able to work so
well together here in an era of I've got to get mine, whether it's points,
playing time or whatever?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, well, they're great kids, and they're very secure about
who they are. They're really all about winning, and they've been terrific. And
our upper classmen have been good with them, and you would not know class on
our team -- who eats together, who's hanging with one another. But those four
kids are very special, and they've been parented extremely well and prepared
well for something bigger than them. They're always involved with something
bigger than them. It's a pretty cool thing.  
  
Q. Coach, to that point, in particular R.J. and Zion, with all the
challenges this season, how have you seen them evolve? Not only as players,
but people.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Great. I think they bring the best out of one another on and
off the court. The two of them have become brothers. I've had a chance to
coach a lot of really good teams and coached the U.S. Team for 12 years, and a
lot of times when talent plays with talent, talent on both sides gets better.
And also because personally, you can become good friends because you actually
know what the other guy is feeling because he's also really good. They've not
had a chance to do that, but we have other guys like that. But the two of
them, in particular, right away.  
  
I think a big part of that was our Canadian trip when we had a couple
injuries. Trey and Cameron could not play, so it was kind of all on those two
guys, and they forged a great friendship.  
  
Q. Coach, did you have an opportunity --  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I figured you weren't from Mississippi.  
  
Q. The accent gives it away, right?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I thought the movie was coming on. Either that, or it's a
hell of an impersonation. Do you do like improv?  
  
Q. I do weddings and bar mitzvahs.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You've got me next bar mitzvah.  
  
Q. Did you have an opportunity to watch North Dakota State's game
against Central? What were your impressions of the Bison?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I've watched them a lot. I've watched both those teams before
they played. Actually, last night was a big time game. Both teams were
deserving of winning -- great pressure. I thought both teams responded very,
very well. It was a heck of a game. Coach Richmond, he's done a great job with
his squad. They're deep. They share the ball. Obviously, they shoot really
well.  
  
They play like one, and so I'm very impressed with them.  
  
Q. After last year's upset with Virginia, how and where are you that
anything is possible? And how has that influenced your preparation for
tomorrow?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, I didn't need that upset. We've been upset in the first
round. I have personal experience. Anything can happen in the tournament
because there's so many champions. Like the team we play tomorrow, North
Dakota State, is a championship team. They won the Summit League. It's
different when you're playing a championship level team. So they know how to
win. They've been in pressure situations, and they've been in that moment, and
they'll have that moment again tomorrow. We respect that, and we'll be
prepared to play a championship team.  
  
Q. Mike, I know you and Johnny Dawkins talk during the season. How soon
after the bracket came out did you guys share anything?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: You know, I haven't really talked much to anybody. I've been
under the weather for about nine days, so my texting and Bitmojis and all that
have been tabled for a little bit. But Johnny and I talked quite a bit during
the season. He's done a marvelous job with his team. I'm proud of him and
really happy that he came to Duke about 37 years ago.  
  
Q. Follow up on that. Can you just talk about what Johnny meant to your
program in those early stages when you were building it?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Johnny meant everything. He was the first great player that
believed in us. He started it, along with that class, with Alarie, Bilas,
Henderson, and then Tommy Amaker joining them. That served as the foundation
for our program. We've tried to recruit youngsters just like them because we
found that those type of youngsters can win at Duke and win at a high level.  
  
But Johnny, Johnny's like -- they're family. So, so important to us, no
question.  
  
Q. When Marques was out last weekend, Javin got more minutes, and Tony
got a little bit. What have they showed you during that time that can help you
going forward, even with Marques coming back?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: It does help. I thought Javin played his best basketball of
his career, and maybe his best game against Florida State. But that whole
tournament, he played well. And then for Antonio to come in against North
Carolina and do so well, it means that all these kids have been ready. They've
had great attitudes, and the more depth that we have, the better.  
  
Q. Forgive me for not knowing, but it has to have been a long time since
you were considered an underdog in a basketball game. Is there a level of envy
in what the Bison have coming into this, that free spirit, that nothing to
lose that they get to bring to a basketball game?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Why would you assume that the team, that we wouldn't have
that?  
  
Q. Because you're the Number 1 seed.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: But you only win if you have that. So if you need to lose to
have that, then you would never win. So we try to have that while we're
winning, and that's how you sustain excellence, and that's what we're going to
try to do. We will try to be as hungry and as into the moment as the team that
we're playing against. In fact, we'll try to be more.  
  
Q. Coach, as far as -- what was the tenor of the advice that you gave
Zion from the time he was out until the time he came back in the ACC
Tournament, and what ultimately led him, in your mind, to be ready to come
back and play?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Well, the very first thing is he always wanted to be back. He
loves Duke, loves his team, and he's playing great. His parents are terrific.
Not so much advice, I just told him, look, if you don't want to play, if
you're concerned, don't play. Don't ever feel like you have to play unless you
want to play. And so it started from there.  
  
We were very, very cautious in making sure that he was -- he's a different --
much different player than anybody, and so I wanted to make sure that he was
ready before -- where he could be instinctively reactive because that's what
he does. Once he was ready to go, he went. I was shocked, really, with his
endurance during the ACC Tournament, for him to play 35-plus minutes in three
consecutive games was absolutely remarkable.  
  
But, no, it's always been what's in the best interests of the player. Always,
and always should be.  
  
Q. NDSU likes to spread out the scoring a lot, a lot of different guys
who can lead the team in scoring. Is that a lot tougher when you can't just
key in on one guy to shut them down?  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: Yeah, it just depends on if it's a really good team, and
they're a really good team. So it's not just that they spread the scoring, but
they use the court. They use the three-point shot to create really good
spacing, and then it creates more scoring opportunities for more people. So
they'll be difficult to defend. I don't know if it's more difficult, but
they're difficult. We play a lot of teams where it's difficult to defend, and
hopefully we'll be successful tomorrow.  
  
Q. First of all, sorry you're not feeling well. Curious how you have
evolved or modified your coaching approach and messaging, if at all, when you
get into this tournament with a team that has so many young players.  
MIKE KRZYZEWSKI: I think we've been -- this is our 35th time in the NCAA
Tournament. You have to adapt to the type of kids you have, the culture --
'80s, '90s -- and then to the age and the -- it's not just the age, but the
experience. You might have an older team that isn't experienced in the
tournament.  
  
For us, we try to approach every game the same, not just in the tournament,
but in season. Every game is huge for us, and so that, when we get here when
everyone else says it's huge, we already know what huge means, and we don't
have to let the ambience or the environment of the tournament determine that.
We've determined that. So if we played North Dakota State on November 23rd, it
would be a huge game for us, so it's not going to change. The more you keep
things similar, when you get into the habit of performance -- I think our guys
are ready to go.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes with us today from Oklahoma, from my side
across the dais, Jamal Bieniemy, Kristian Doolittle, Christian James, and
Brady Manek.  
  
Q. Jamal and Brady, I asked the Christians this the other day, but you
guys played so well in the nonconference and not as well in the conference.
What's the excitement level that you're playing somebody, not just the NCAA
Tournament, but you get fresh faces, fresh opponent, somebody you don't know
so well that's not in the Big 12.  
JAMAL BIENIEMY: It's good because it's a new season and just a new beginning
for everybody so for everybody to start on a clean slate just to work hard and
get out there it's going to be fun.  
  
BRADY MANEK: It's good for us because in the Big 12 you have teams you see all
the time. They're scouting you really well. You're scouting them really well.
You come here and have a few days to prepare. I feel like that will help us.  
  
Q. Kristian Doolittle, the ups and downs of this season, you talked a
couple times about how, if you don't come out with the energy as a team, it
usually doesn't work out well for you guys. What do you think can make the
difference here in the NCAA Tournament with that?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: Just realizing we have another opportunity to get better,
be able to play against somebody new, as Brady just mentioned. We put a lot of
work coming into this game, game planned really well for Ole Miss. And just
get a new mindset of this could be our last game. So just an added pressure is
going to bring out the best of us.  
  
Q. For Christian James, when you look back at your career, you go back a
long way. You played in an Elite 8, scored 10 points in an Elite 8 game. It's
been a long journey. Reflect back on your career, especially from an NCAA
Tournament standpoint, and how long ago that might seem.  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: It's very important, looking back, playing throughout four
years in the tournament, it's a blessing. It's a very serious thing. We want
to go out here, and we want to make a statement. We have to -- we know we have
to play together. We have to bring energy and effort. Every possession is key.
Every possession can be a game winner. All it takes is one play to turn a game
around. We know we have to be clicking on all cylinders. We just have to come
out here and prove a point. We don't want to take anything for granted. We're
just happy to get another opportunity to play.  
  
Q. Jamal, what are your impressions of Ole Miss, specifically their
backcourt?  
JAMAL BIENIEMY: They have really good guard play. Those three guards that
start for them are very talented, and they can all score. We're going to have
to take on the challenge as guards and just play good "D" on them and just do
what we do.  
  
Q. Kristian Doolittle, from your perspective down low, what do you see
from Ole Miss' bigs, and what can you do to maybe exploit some of their size
disadvantages?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: They're very versatile. Two starting bigs are a little bit
different than their back-ups as well. Being able to shoot the 15-foot jump
shot, even stretching out to the three-point line. So the rotations on defense
will have to be precise, knowing our role and knowing the rotations as well as
that on our offensive side of the ball. Using our mobility to our advantage
across the board, getting them in switches that they probably wouldn't want to
get into. So ball movement would be key.  
  
Q. For Kristian Doolittle, millions of people throughout the country
today are going to be turning on, watching all these games. You guys have a
practice and things like that. Will you find yourselves staying up late,
watching games, seeing what's going on, or is the preparation for tomorrow all
encompassing for you guys?  
KRISTIAN DOOLITTLE: I'm going to go to sleep tonight. We play at 12:30. Can't
be up too late. We're going to have an early breakfast tomorrow. As far as a
lot of people watching these games, some people go the whole year without
watching basketball and then tune in for March Madness. It's an honor to be
here, to be able to be under this spotlight that this tournament creates. So
we're all going to want to go play our best.  
  
Q. For Christian James, they got a veteran backcourt. You guys have
experience in the backcourt. Talk about the challenge of that as a senior, and
then as you look back, when you're a freshman in the Final Four, what that was
like being inexperienced in big NCAA Tournament games?  
CHRISTIAN JAMES: They have a great backcourt. We know they can score the ball
well, they move the ball well. Just looking back, experience on how Buddy
Hield and all those guys made plays in the backcourt, it's just a thing of
moving balls and making shots. Making shots is key to this tournament. So
that's the thing. We have to play together on offense, get stops on defense,
move the ball, and make shots.  
  
Q. Brady, sort of an off-the-wall question, you got your haircut there
midway through the season. Since you've done that, does it just feel better?
Is it a superstition? Were you just trying to change up the vibe? How's it
going for you, going back to your look from last year?  
BRADY MANEK: I really don't know what I was doing. I just decided to grow my
hair out last year. I've never done it. Everybody made a big deal out of it,
so I kept it. And then it got to the point where I couldn't stand it anymore,
so I just buzzed it off. I love it. Buzz cut is where I'm at.  
  
Q. Back to Brady, did you get tired of hearing about all the Larry Bird
comparisons? Since you shaved it, have those kind of gone away?  
BRADY MANEK: I think they're pretty much done. It was cool. I got a lot of
attention from it. A lot of guys got a lot of attention from it. Me and
Christian made one of the best commercials ever. It was fun, and I'm glad I
got the buzz cut back. I feel more like myself.  
  
Q. Brady, for those of us not aware of that commercial, tell us about
it, please.  
BRADY MANEK: It was a remake of the Michael Jordan-Larry Bird McDonald's
commercial. Me and Christian basically remade it, and it was pretty good. I
mean, we're up in the rafters at the football stadium. I mean, just some funny
stuff.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the student-athletes? Thank you guys.  
  
Now with us is Oklahoma head coach, Lon Kruger.  
  
LON KRUGER: It's a great time of year. Super excited for these guys to be here
and have the opportunity to play in the tournament. Every team has a goal when
they start the season, and these guys really had a lot of ups and downs during
the year, a little bit of a roller coaster ride. Finished probably the last
month playing a lot better than we did middle third of the conference season.
Very good nonconference slate.  
  
Again, a lot of respect for Ole Miss and how tough that will be tomorrow, but
looking forward to seeing the guys play.  
  
Q. Coach, curious if you could go back to Matt Freeman's recruitment.
What stood out about him that attracted you? He told me that he got an offer
after a tournament in Las Vegas where he didn't think he played particularly
well. What do you recall about that?  
LON KRUGER: Actually, one of those rare cases where you get video on a lot of
players. We got Matt's video, as he sent, I'm sure, to a lot of people. Just
liked his actions, liked his mobility, liked his ability to shoot the
basketball. Again, that's on video. And then we watched him in Vegas,
reaffirmed a lot of things, and he's done a good job. Been a little bit
streaky shooting the basketball, but always works extremely hard, great
attitude, good teammate -- all those things that you're looking for.  
  
Q. Coach, is it refreshing to face a team that's not in the Big 12? You
did so well in nonconference. Do you get the feeling the players are excited
about playing somebody that doesn't know as much about them?  
LON KRUGER: The players are definitely excited about playing, I don't know for
that reason necessarily. Big 12 is tough. It's a grind, like a lot of leagues
in the country. The top few in the Big 12 are hard to beat, and we struggled
with that at times. Playing against someone we don't know quite as well and
they don't know us quite as well, it's part of the NCAA Tournament experience.  
  
Have a lot of respect for Ole Miss and how well they score the ball. Coach
Davis' team is very sound defensively, and we know how tough that will be. I
know our guys are looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk specifically just about what you have learned
about Ole Miss, backcourt, frontcourt this week?  
LON KRUGER: Obviously, their three leading scorers are their perimeter guys.
All three can really score the ball in a lot of different ways. All can make
plays off the dribble for each other. They all shoot it well, get to the
paint. Their big guys can score. Looked like they're a little more comfortable
pick-and-pop, can score inside.  
  
Again, they play about eight people. Guys off the bench bring great energy and
a little bit more versatility. So they're good. Again, like I say, very sound
defensively. Push the ball offensively, create opportunities for each other.  
  
Q. Lon, I'm just curious, how familiar are you with Kermit Davis and the
style of basketball he plays? Also, what's the challenge with the way they
switch defenses presents?  
LON KRUGER: Anytime a team switches, you've got to be a little bit concerned
about rhythm, getting into the flow of things. They do a good job of that.
I've known Kermit for a long time and followed his teams for a long time, and
I have a lot of respect for how they play. They play the game right. They
space the floor well. They move the ball well. They're always very sound
defensively. He always does a great job.  
  
Q. Haven't talked to you in 46 hours. Can you give us an update on
McNeace and just how he's looked since you got here?  
LON KRUGER: He's looked good, actually. Didn't practice on Monday, practiced
full speed yesterday for the first time. He'll be out there today, so we'll
see how he feels coming off of that full speed day yesterday. But it's been a
long time. He was playing so well in November, prior to the ankle and foot
problem. Every time he's tried to get back, he just hasn't been able to quite
get back into the flow before he injured it again.  
  
He's a guy that needs athleticism, running the floor, mobility is a big part
of his game, and he just hasn't had that. So he hasn't been able to be as
productive. Even though he has played some, he hasn't been as comfortable as
he was in November.  
  
Q. We equated your slide, sort of, to the start of conference play. How
much was it related just McNeace? Because when he got hurt is sort of when you
started playing not as well. How much are those two things related?  
LON KRUGER: For sure to some degree. No question, we'd love to have Jamuni at
full speed. Coming out of the Bahamas in that early game, after we got back
home, he was dominating the boards. He was blocking shots, changing shots,
even becoming more of a significant factor offensively. Every team goes
through that to some degree. We certainly miss Jamuni. More importantly, I
think, at this point, is just for Jamuni, because senior year, fifth year
redshirt, great attitude, getting better every year, and now he can't do what
he potentially could do because of that injury.  
  
So disappointed for him. But he wants to go, and we'll certainly throw him in
there and see how he feels tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, you have kind of an interesting blend of guys. You have guys
who played in the Final Four. You have grad transfers in their first NCAA
Tournament, guys who played last year, lost in the first round. Talk about
what their motivation is and that blend of guys who want to do well in this
tournament, some in their last chance and some in their one and only chance.  
LON KRUGER: That's exactly what we have. It kind of sums it up right there.
You've got the full extreme, two extremes with the guys returning, those on
the Final Four three years ago to one and out last year. Grad transfers, one
of the things they talked about is playing in the tournament when they made
the decision to come to Oklahoma, so we're pleased they have that opportunity
and know they'll be bouncing off walls tomorrow to get out there and play.  
  
It's great. Everyone -- 68 teams are playing, 290 aren't. It's a great
experience for the guys never to be taken for granted. I know these guys
aren't taking it for granted, and they're excited to be out there.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the student-athletes from the University of Central
Florida. Introducing the players, Tacko Fall, BJ Taylor, and Aubrey Dawkins.
Open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Aubrey Dawkins, good to see you again. First time UCF gets an at
large bid to the NCAA Tournament after 15 years of being away, what does this
mean to you guys to be on this stage this season?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: It means everything. We worked hard for this. Put in the
hours, put in the practice time. It's a blessing. I'm appreciative to be here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: My apologies on the name.  
  
AUBREY DAWKINS: It's okay.  
  
Q. Aubrey, as a player on this team who's been to the tournament, what
kind of knowledge have you tried to impart on your teammates about what it's
like to play in the tournament and how it's different?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: We don't want to make the game any bigger than it is. It's
still basketball. Just want to stay composed out there and take it possession
by possession because every game is going to be grind it out. Not going to be
any blowouts really. We're going to have to earn it, and that's what it's all
about.  
  
Q. When you went to the tournament with Michigan, was there something
that, after it was all done, did you feel like something that surprised you,
something you weren't prepared for that caught you off guard while you were in
the tournament, anything like that?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Not really. Guys are going to play hard. This is biggest stage
in college basketball. You know guys are going to bring it. You've just got to
expect that and be ready for it.  
  
Q. Tacko, what's it like to be here for you? I know you've been working
hard to get UCF to the tournament. Now as a senior, you get a chance to
play.  
TACKO FALL: For me, for us, I would say it means everything. After all the
hard work that we put in, everything that we've been through, all the
injuries, after all this year finally being able to pull it off, especially in
our senior year, we have to make it happen. We just put our heads down and say
we have to make it and we made it happen but now we just can't get too happy.
Like Aubrey said, we have to go out there and compete every night because
every team is going to bring it.  
  
Q. BJ, all three of you guys were injured at points last year. Now near
the end of the year, you guys have all been banged up but not suffering any
debilitating injuries. How big is that? How like just relieving has it been to
just really kind of be able to play the entire season?  
BJ TAYLOR: It's been great. Having the three of us out there the entire
season, just being able to play together. We've kind of been together for
three seasons now. To finally be out there and play together and stay healthy,
it's been a blessing, and it's been a real joy playing with both these guys
next to me. Like Tacko said, try not to get too satisfied and see how far we
can take this thing.  
  
Q. BJ, VCU, like you guys, are a team known for defense. What is your
expectation of the way that game could go tomorrow?  
BJ TAYLOR: I think the biggest thing, talking about VCU, is they're
aggressive, and they want to press, try to get after you and speed the game
up. For us, we know we have to stay composed, we have to play our game, and we
have to dictate the tempo.  
  
So that's my biggest thing, playing our game the same way we've been playing
it the entire season. Usually when we've done that throughout the season,
we've been successful. They're a really good basketball team. They've had a
great season, and we know it's going to be a very competitive game.  
  
Q. BJ, you mentioned yesterday about how the football team has sort of
done their part to put UCF on the national map. How have you guys -- have you
noticed that, since they got good, more people notice you? And what do you
guys have to do to build up on that?  
BJ TAYLOR: Yeah, they kind of got this thing started. With the way they've
been playing the last two seasons going undefeated and only losing one game
this year, they've done so much for the university and keep bringing
recognition to the school. We're just trying to do our part now by reaching
that level and continuing to grow the athletics program at UCF because they
put us on the national stage. That's what we're trying to do here in March
Madness, not just by showing up, but by winning and having a good effort out
here.  
  
Q. Tacko and BJ, can you think about what your emotions are going to be
like tomorrow night? You guys have talked about this for four years, BJ for
you, five. Getting to this point and now you're here, can you even imagine
what you're going to both be feeling like tomorrow?  
TACKO FALL: Like we said, we're very happy to have made it after all the hard
work that we put in, but at the same time, we just don't want to get too
happy. At the end of the day, it's a basketball game. You've got to stay
locked in.  
  
Obviously, it's a big deal. We're not going to downgrade it, but at the same
time, it's still a basketball game. We've got to go out there and compete and
not let our emotions take over. Just stay locked in, make sure we lead the
guys, and just do our part.  
  
BJ TAYLOR: Yeah, basically what Tacko said. We don't want to get satisfied. In
the locker room, in our talks, we haven't been satisfied. We came here, not
just to show up, but we want to win games. Starts with VCU tomorrow. That's
our main focus right now. We're blessed to be here and honored to be here. Our
goal isn't just to get here. We want to win it and make a statement.  
  
Q. Tacko, I apologize for a little bit of a non- basketball question,
but I know you talked in the past about the Muslim travel ban and how you felt
about that, and then last week, of course, the horrific incident in New
Zealand. I'm curious what your emotions were after hearing about that. Do you
kind of embrace an opportunity to be part of a conversation about how people
within the Muslim world are viewed here and elsewhere?  
TACKO FALL: I mean, yeah. For me, I love the game of basketball, but it's
always bigger than that. Being able to represent what we are about means a
great deal to me. I was very sad when I saw what happened down in New Zealand.
I thought about it a lot. But we've just got to learn how to get along. I
mean, everybody -- we all pretty much are people, regardless of the religion.  
  
Me, I grew up in Senegal. We have a lot of Muslims. We have a lot of
Christians. We all get along, and that's a culture where I grew in. So I
really don't see that. But at the same time, we've got to learn to love each
other, and that's how I see things.  
  
Q. Aubrey, even though you're not listed as a senior, it feels like
you're a senior. When will you start thinking about what your future is?  
AUBREY DAWKINS: Hopefully, in a few weeks, if we're enough fortunate to go
that far. I haven't thought about it too much, not really paying attention to
it. Just taking these days as they come. Trying to focus on the game in front
of us, the practice in front of us, not too far in the future. I'll cross that
bridge when it gets here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: University of Central Florida head coach Johnny Dawkins.  
  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: It's exciting to be here. Always have loved this environment.
The chance to compete in the NCAA Tournament is special, and I'm just happy
our players have the opportunity to experience it.  
  
Q. Johnny, was it any different getting this group to an NCAA Tournament
than maybe Stanford or during your time with Duke?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I think they all are different. I think every time you take a
team, because they all have different personnel, they all have unique
challenges. This year was no different with the group that we had. Probably
the biggest difference with this group is that we only had one player on the
team that had any NCAA experience. So that's always tough. I thought we did a
good job of kind of imparting our knowledge from our playing days, whether
it's our coaching staff, who have all played, as well as myself, trying to let
them know what the experience is going to be like, how we have to get there.
So I think everyone did a really good job of lending that type of support to
our players as we've gone through the process.  
  
Q. Coach, we've talked about injuries in the past, and now as we get to
the end of this season, guys are banged up, but you haven't suffered any
debilitating injuries to star players, unlike last year. Talk about how
satisfying that's been for you to coach really a full team this year.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I wish I could explain to you how exciting that's been for us
because we've battled that a lot. This season we've remained relatively
healthy, and that's, I think, put us in that position. All of our guys have
been able to compete most every night. When we've been healthy, we've been
very competitive. I'm just really happy for our guys. Again, I look at our
strength and conditioning, I look at our trainers. Those guys did an amazing
job making sure we're healthy and fresh. So I think they play a major role in
that, and they did a great job.  
  
Q. Johnny, we're treated here to the biggest personality in college
basketball in Zion Williamson and the biggest player in Tacko Fall. What does
that do for the setting here as far as turning this into a show as much as a
championship?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: I think the NCAA is always going to have some amazing story
lines, and that's no different with Zion and Tacko. They both are uniquely
different players, but their personalities are amazing. Zion, I haven't seen
him play much, but what I have seen, he's one of the most talented basketball
players I've ever seen play on the collegiate level. With Tacko, as big as he
is, with his mobility, he also is a unique player at this level. He's both
ends of the floor. He's dynamic. He protects the rim, shot blocking, altering
shots offensively. He's really improved his skill set. He scores around the
basket, doesn't need to dunk everything to score.  
  
Both of those players, I think, in an environment like this is great because
they get a chance to showcase kind of who they are during this time of their
careers.  
  
Q. We asked Aubrey about being in the tournament and what he's told his
teammates about what it's like to be in the tournament. I wonder if you have
told your guys about what to expect and how it's different. How do you handle
yourself in a tournament, things like that.  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: No, definitely. As I said earlier, we definitely talked about
this experience and what to expect, and basically what we try to tell our
players is just stay in the moment and enjoy this experience. This is
something that you should cherish. These are hard to come by. When you have
this opportunity, make the most out of it. So we kind of talked to them that
way. Along the process, we talked about how to get there and how consistent we
need to be in order to give ourselves a chance to be in this position.  
  
I think all the things coming from, not just myself, but my staff. Coach
Norris played in the tournament. Coach Taylor played in the tournament. We
have guys who have been there before. We didn't want them to keep that
knowledge a secret, to share that throughout the season, to make up for the
lack of having a number of guys in the locker room that did not have that
experience.  
  
Q. Johnny, it seems like Tacko's a very interesting young man. When you
guys came to Charleston a couple years ago to play in that tournament, he was
very interesting to talk to. Up here, the same thing. Can you discuss his
development as both a person and a player, and what do you think his future is
in this game beyond college?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Well, as a person and a player, he's one of the best human
beings you're going to meet. Hands down. And I've coached a lot of terrific
people, and none any better than Tacko. He's a beautiful human being.
Engaging, intelligent, just -- he's funny. He has the whole gamut. He's a
great young man. In basketball, I think he has a bright future. I hear the
game has changed and his style of play no longer exists, but when you have a
player like Tacko Fall with his personality, with who he is, in any community,
he'll be one of the best people you'll ever have in the community. You want
guys like that around. I know I would as a teammate or in that locker room.  
  
I see him playing on the highest level. I don't know how and what path he's
going to take, but a 7'6", 300, still has a huge upside in this game because
he does. He's gotten even better this year. Throughout the season, I've seen
improvement. I see him playing at the next level, and I think that's something
he can accomplish because of his ability on and off the court.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of high school talent comes from the Central Florida
area. I'm just wondering, have you used BJ's story, or will you use BJ's story
when recruiting to say this is what can happen when you stay home?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Definitely. I think that's very important. We have a talented,
talented community in Florida and the Orlando area, and we want to keep those
young men home and give them a viable option to play for us as opposed to
going out of state and playing for other teams. BJ's a perfect example. He
could have gone anywhere. He chose to stay at UCF because his dream was to do
something special for his hometown team, and that's what he's been able to do.
I think he's made us all proud at that university and in that community
because he sacrificed and made a choice. I wouldn't even call it a sacrifice.
He made a choice to be part of something special in Orlando and not elsewhere.  
  
Q. Is there a standard within the locker room of what would make this
trip to the tournament a successful trip to the tournament?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: We haven't really talked about that. The thing we want to do
is we just want to stay in the moment. We have a big game coming up tomorrow
versus VCU, and that's the most important thing that's on our mind right now.
After that, we figure out where we are. I think getting here, there's a
certain level of success just getting in this tournament and being involved in
it. And then from there, we see what can happen. We see what's possible, and
we'll find that out when we throw it up tomorrow.  
  
Q. Johnny, just to follow up on the Duke angle a little bit, how
appropriate is it for you to see your old team take the floor before you do
and your old coach see you take the floor with your new team in a breakthrough
season?  
JOHNNY DAWKINS: Probably a little awkward, actually. Who could imagine that
would happen? I'll be excited for them, of course. I'll be rooting for them.
It's my alma mater. Of course, Coach K and I are really good friends, as well
as my mentor and coach. So I'll be rooting for those guys to have a successful
outcome, and then we'll be preparing for our game.  
  
It is awkward because, like I said, I've never been in this situation before,
but we'll block all those things out. Like I tell our players all the time,
stay in the moment. We don't get distracted very easily. I think that's a big
part of why we've been able to have consistency this year is the fact that
we've always stayed in the moment. That's what we'll do. I'll practice what I
preach to our players every day.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the student-athletes from Ole Miss. We'll introduce the
players -- Terence Davis, Devontae Shuler, and Breein Tyree.  
  
Q. Devontae, when you saw the draw and you saw Columbia pop up next to
your team's name, just what was your first thought?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: It was just an opportunity for me to come back home and play
in front of my family and friends and also for me to have a better chance to
play better in my home state.  
  
Q. Devontae, what's it been like to talk to your sister earlier this
week, ticket requests and everything. How many people do you expect to have
here, and just, last time you guys were here last month, didn't go so well.
What needs to happen to have a better performance?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: I have plenty of family and friends coming, of course. This
is like right in the middle of where I'm from. For the most part, for me just
to come back and stay focused and just for me to come back and get the win,
that's the main part of me coming back home and playing in this. That's really
it.  
  
Q. I'll continue the line of questions for Devontae. I believe you were
teammates in high school with Braxton Key from Virginia. What do you remember
about him, and have you guys maintained a friendship?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: Definitely. I won a National Championship with him, so we
always stay in contact. Braxton is not just a friend of mine on the court. Off
the court, he's a great person. We always say in contact. He's always in
contact with my sister, so it's a long relationship.  
  
Q. Breein and Terence and Devontae, if you'd like, you can chip in on
this, too. Experience is always considered a big thing in the NCAA Tournament.
Are you guys concerned that you don't have any? Breein, why don't you start?  
BREEIN TYREE: I do feel like experience is a big thing in anything you do.
We're experienced guards, and we played a lot of college basketball, but this
is our first time in the tournament. This will be a new experience for us, but
on the other side of it, we'll be just as excited as any other person would be
for this major opportunity.  
  
DEVONTAE SHULER: Definitely for me, too. We definitely got to have a great
experience. Of course, I've never been here, but us going against a D-I
college basketball team, we're going to treat it as if it's an SEC regular
season game.  
  
TERENCE DAVIS: And just to go along with them, we three guys who have been
playing with each other for quite some time. We have no experience in the NCAA
Tournament, but we do have experience together with this team. So we'll be
okay along the road.  
  
Q. T.D., this is what you came back for to play in this. Now that you're
here, what's the feeling for you?  
TERENCE DAVIS: It's unbelievable. To get to share this moment with some of the
guys you've been around forever, and just to be here, man, is just special.
But we're not satisfied.  
  
Q. Terence, the last couple of games, you've had a hard time scoring,
getting buckets. Have you kind of flushed that, or do you feel like you need
to see a couple go in to get some confidence going tomorrow?  
TERENCE DAVIS: Once it's the game, that's flushed. The great thing about it,
we have another opportunity to play tomorrow, and that's the good thing about
it.  
  
Q. Breein, from your scout of Oklahoma so far, what stands out about
what they do well and what kind of challenges might there be in this game?  
BREEIN TYREE: They shoot the ball really well. They also exploit mismatches
very well. All their players from one to five can bring down the ball and
dribble the ball. They do a lot of isolation. We just need to guard the ball,
stay in front of our men, stay second in the air, be physical with them and
rebound the ball, and I think we should be fine.  
  
Q. Breein, a big reason why you all were able to do the turnaround was
because Devontae got moved to point guard and you got to be moved off the
ball. What kind of growth have you seen in Devontae, what he's been able to do
at that position specifically?  
BREEIN TYREE: Tremendous growth. Even from his freshman year, when I was
playing point and he was playing the two guard, he grew tremendously in that
year. But just from freshman year into his sophomore year, just leadership
qualities has grown tremendously, to handling the ball, making better
decisions, getting the team in the right sets. I don't want to say taking a
backseat to me and T.D., but not taking as many shots and maybe not even
getting the spotlight at all times, but he just keeps it going, and he's a
major part of our team. Without him, this train doesn't go. His growth has
been tremendous, and he's still not done yet. We've got a long way to go as a
team.  
  
Q. Breein, along those lines, what specifically has that freed you up to
do on the wing as opposed to you having to play point last year?  
BREEIN TYREE: It's freed me up to just be a lot more aggressive offensively.
That's what Coach wants me to do, assert myself on the offensive end and take
better shots than I did last year, and Devontae's helped me do that a lot this
year. Just getting me open because he's such an aggressive guard. A lot of
help will come and kick outs to me and T.D. on the wings, and then it's time
for us to make a play and try and get the ball in the basket.  
  
Q. Devontae, as a younger -- as a young person, how many times did you
come to this gym as a fan, and did you play here?  
DEVONTAE SHULER: I didn't really come to many games, but my sister was a big
fan of the basketball team and my brother. So they'd always tell me, like,
come into USC and get a good feel for how Coach Frank Martin is, just me being
around and the environment of me getting a feel for a college basketball
stadium has been great.  
  
Q. T.D., Devontae is a guy that you took under your wing really, really
early in his career. It was important in getting him here actually. What have
you seen from him, and how far he's come as a player and just all around in
terms of his game?  
TERENCE DAVIS: Like Breein touched on, Devontae, just a tremendous player. To
be a freshman and play key roles last year and then to play a whole 'nother
role, point guard, never played the position ever, it just tells you how good
of a player you are. Just to play a whole different position and be good at
it, get his team to March Madness just tells you everything.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any more questions for the student-athletes? Thank you,
gentlemen.  
  
We'll go ahead and get started with Ole Miss head coach Kermit Davis and SID
Adam Kuffner.  
  
KERMIT DAVIS: First of all, probably been one of the most rewarding years of
my 37 years of coaching to come to Ole Miss, which is back home for me and my
state and to be involved and connect with the Ole Miss spirit. You take a team
that finished last, picked last, and for the improvement that they've made, I
have so much respect for our players.  
  
And then to see the connection with our fan base that we probably grew nearly
25 percent increase in attendance in SEC games, which was the most of any
league team. So that part has been great.  
  
Then to play a really good Oklahoma team in the NCAA Tournament, known Lon for
a long time. He's had so much success in this tournament. He's got another
really, really good team, and I think it will be another really, really good
8-9 matchups.  
  
Q. Kermit, Devontae Shuler's move to point guard was so big as far as
the turnaround was concerned. How far has he come at that position
specifically, and what have you seen as far as what he's been able to do, ball
handling and all that stuff?  
KERMIT DAVIS: He's probably been the key to our team. He got nicked up for
five or six games after the Mississippi State game, and he's now back healthy.
He didn't even play point guard at Oak Hill for Steve Smith. He kind of played
off the ball all the time and played off the ball as a freshman. We really met
in the spring, and I really think he understood.  
  
The biggest thing he's done, he's valued the ball. He's a tough, competitive
guard on the ball defending. He really has -- Breein and T.D. have had these
great All-SEC years, but Devontae Shuler has been maybe our most valuable
player on the floor.  
  
Q. You mentioned this team finished last, picked last. What point did
you realize they had the potential to be an NCAA Tournament team and exceed
all these expectations?  
KERMIT DAVIS: We took a trip to Canada that really helped us. As I said
before, we left a lot of bad basketball in Canada. It gave us time to really
get extra practices. An NCAA Tournament team, probably when we beat Auburn at
home and they were ranked. Then three days later, we go to Mississippi State
and beat another ranked team. Probably at that particular time that we got
ranked ourselves that we started kind of thinking that maybe you have a
chance. Didn't talk about it to our team -- but to play in the NCAA Tournament
and be a postseason team.  
  
Q. Kermit, you and Lon Kruger are two of the most experienced coaches in
the field. Do you have any familiarity with him or crossed paths with him at
any stops?  
KERMIT DAVIS: You know, I've just known Lon forever. This is the first time
I've ever coached against Lon's team in any game, but I guess I've just always
admired Lon and followed him when he was at Florida and Illinois and obviously
at Oklahoma. We both had the same assistant, a guy named Greg Grensing that I
hired when Lon was at Vegas fixing to go to Oklahoma and Greg was a great
assistant of mine at Middle Tennessee. Just as a coach and one of his peers,
I've admired him for what he's done. The main thing is how he's gone about his
business for so long in his career.  
  
Q. Kermit, it seems like Bruce has really put it together in the last
month. How much of what you've gotten from him has kind of changed the dynamic
of y'all's team?  
KERMIT DAVIS: He's a critical matchup tomorrow, he and Don both. Obviously,
number one, Doolittle is an undersized -- he's really a four man, but he plays
the five and so he gets good matchups. Can you guard Doolittle, and Bruce and
Don, especially Bruce? Can you guard him at 17-feet isolations that Lon puts
him in? So that's a big critical key. Then can we throw the ball to Bruce,
pick up fouls, and make guys guard him around the goal? We know he can pick-
and-pop and shoot goals. If us going forward, if we're going to have some
success in this tournament, he's going to have to be a big part of it.  
  
Q. Kermit, you've had so many close games just go down right to the
wire. Is that something you think you've talked to your team a lot about, you
know, finishing at the end of it? But do you think that's kind of fueling them
as you head into a game with such pomp and circumstance?  
KERMIT DAVIS: We have. We played a hard late year schedule. We were up one,
and Grant Williams makes a shot with four seconds to go to beat us at home,
one-possession game with Kentucky. We go to Arkansas and have the ball at one,
they hit a last second shot to beat us. Obviously, Alabama, we were up 16 and
get beat at the end. So it's a concern.  
  
But I think some of those games we've been really, really competitive and
played good in parts of those games, and that's something to draw on. But
you're right, we've got to do a better job of closing games out and just
making basketball plays at the end of those clocks.  
  
Q. Kermit, coming off that Alabama game, how has been the focus and the
recovery in practice after a loss like that?  
KERMIT DAVIS: We got after them pretty good just after we got back. The next
day, on Friday, we watched the tape before we left from Nashville to go back
to Oxford, and then on Saturday and Sunday we had two really physical
practices, not very long, an hour and 20 minutes, but got back to trying to
rebound and defend. And then as the week -- you know, we got selected to come
to the regional, we've kind of backed off. It's been really good. I wanted to
get that out of our system and back playing. We needed to go up and down some.  
  
So I think our attitude and energy level has been really good this week.  
  
Q. Kermit, this seems to be like a pretty good guard-oriented matchup,
especially with your group. But what do you see on the other side,
specifically with Jamal Bieniemy, the freshman point guard?  
KERMIT DAVIS: I just told Lon, I saw him in the hall. I said, God, Lon, I
watched him probably ten games ago and watched him until now, and he's got to
be one of the most improved players in the Big 12. You can tell he's just kind
of grown up as a freshman, great size, great pace. The biggest thing, he just
takes care of the ball. And obviously, James is a real physical kind of a
celebrated guy that's played in the Final Four. I like them. And the other
guys are real physical, driving guards. So you're right, our three guards are
going to have to play really well tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kermit, a lot is made of experience in this tournament. You have
some, but your players don't. How do you think that factors in?  
KERMIT DAVIS: I think because you've got Oklahoma, you've got some guys that
have played in the Final Four. You've got a team that played in it last year
in the tournament. I just think that, when you play in leagues like ours, when
you've played in those kinds of games every night. I told our team yesterday,
I said, guys, you've been tested in every way possible a college team can get
tested by what you went through in an 18-game schedule in this league. So
they've been in these big environments and big arenas. Do you have a little
nerves, probably a little jitters first when the ball's tipped and you get it
going? Sure.  
  
But the biggest thing is just stay true to yourself, do what you do, don't try
to go out of character, and just be who we are, the best version of our team,
and hopefully they'll do that tomorrow.  
  
Q. Transition defense has been something that your guys normally do very
well. How important is transition "D" just going to be in a team against
Oklahoma?  
KERMIT DAVIS: Any time you play Oklahoma or Lon's team, transition defense is
always big because Doolittle can get the ball off the defensive boards and
bring it up as a center, a so-called center. So it makes your adjusting,
getting back defensively some different matchups. And obviously, the way that
they shoot the ball on the perimeter, the stretch four is so good. He's as
good a stretch four shooter as there is in college basketball.  
  
So you're right, that's something that's been kind of a staple of ours for
many, many years, wherever we've coached, and we're just going to have to be
true to form tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kermit, how helpful has it been to have the -- I guess as of
tomorrow, the eight days off? Did your team kind of need that rest after
pretty much of a grind?  
KERMIT DAVIS: You know, I think mentally, nobody wants to get beat in their
conference tournament by any means. Obviously, we were disappointed, but
probably in the end, I think mentally, it's been really good for our team, a
team that, like I said, went to Canada, had extra days of practice. So we have
really stuck to about an hour, hour and ten minutes this week at most. So I do
think -- I saw it with Breein and even T.D. the last couple days, a little
fresher legs and fresh minds. Hope it does help.  
  
Q. Kermit, Lon said he had an awareness of you. Have you guys coached
against one another?  
KERMIT DAVIS: No, we haven't. We've just known each other for a long time.
Just through recruiting and different basketball, as you cross paths, and like
I said, it's just been a great respect on my part for Lon.  
  
Q. What would you say is kind of a staple, I guess, of his teams and how
you have seen them through the years, I guess?  
KERMIT DAVIS: They've guarded at a high level, and just the way the ball moves
offensively, I think he's just always had great spacing. He was one of really
the first guys. I mean, I know the dribble drive, the spacing and driving
balls, and I just think their best players shoot it. He puts them in spots to
catch and score, and he's done that his whole career.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for Coach? Thank you.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the student-athletes from Gardner Webb University. Head
coach Tim Craft. SID Marc Rabb. I'll introduce the players. We have David
Efianayi, Eric Jamison, Jr., D.J. Laster, and Jose Perez.  
  
Q. D.J., what is it that has been clicking for you here over the last
five games or the end of the season? And how much confidence do you bring into
this tournament?  
D.J. LASTER: I have a lot of confidence. I think what's clicking is just being
more efficient on the court and with my shot selection and getting the right
shots and having my teammates find me in the right places. So I'm pretty
confident in my workouts and everything that I'm doing. I'm pretty confident
coming into this tournament.  
  
Q. David, what has this past week-and-a-half been like and what has
today been like, I guess starting yesterday, coming here for the first time
and experiencing this for the first time, not only for you as players but as a
program?  
DAVID EFIANAYI: It's very exciting. The past few years we've been very close,
losing the semifinals and quarterfinals. This is a great experience to be
here, and we're just going to try to continue going on.  
  
Q. For all of you four guys, I know this last two weeks has been quite a
blur. What was your emotions pulling out yesterday morning at 8:30 knowing you
were coming to Columbia, knowing you were coming to the NCAA Tournament,
knowing you had meaningful practices left ahead of you for each one of you
guys?  
ERIC JAMISON JR.: For me, it was a very exciting feeling, just a dream come
true to play in an NCAA Tournament. A lot of guys don't get a chance to play,
and it's just really everybody is excited and happy, and we're just ready to
play.  
  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yeah, like he said, it's just being a part of March Madness is
very big. As a college player, that's what you want to do. It's just very
exciting.  
  
D.J. LASTER: Just great to have this opportunity to be here. Like Dave said,
we've been in the semifinals, we've been to the quarterfinals, but we never
got here in school history. Just an exciting experience and just an
opportunity to play and compete at the highest level.  
  
JOSE PEREZ: For me, this has been a dream come true being here as a freshman
and being here with these guys. They're like my role models, and they're
older. They always tell me what I'm doing wrong and right. Just being here is
like a dream come true, like they said.  
  
Q. For D.J. and Jose, what do you see when you look at De'Andre Hunter,
and what do you anticipate in terms of who might match up there?  
JOSE PEREZ: He's a great player. He won Defensive Player of the Year in the
ACC. To me, he's going to be a tough matchup all night and just be physical
with him as much as possible as we can and see what the refs let go and what
they don't let go.  
  
D.J. LASTER: Yeah, he's a great player, but we just want to compete at the
highest level and just give him all we've got. I know he's going to come at
us. We just want to compete.  
  
Q. Anybody can answer this, but what does it mean playing so close to
campus knowing there's going to be tons of fans wearing the red and black
tomorrow?  
JOSE PEREZ: It's going to be great here. I'm still getting a couple of phone
calls on tickets and stuff. It's going to be a great atmosphere. They're
probably going to travel with a lot of people. It's most likely going to be
like a home game here. So let's see. Just ready to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. David, Mike was asking D.J. earlier about his confidence, but what
kind of confidence did the entire team derive from going on the road in the
semifinals and the final of the conference tournament at Campbell and Radford
and being able to win those games in those conditions?  
DAVID EFIANAYI: It starts off with the coaches. The coaches do a great job
preparing us for each game. We had a great game plan going into the games, and
as players, we just go in there with just confidence. We just go in there
playing together, playing freely, and we just knew that, if we played hard
enough, that we can be able to come out with those Ws.  
  
Q. You guys obviously know what happened to UVA in this game last year.
How do you think that will affect them for this game? Do you think they'll be
more focused? Do you think they'll be tight or anything?  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yeah, they're a high level team. I feel like they'll come out
with a vengeance. They'll come out ready to compete just as well as us. I
think we're going to come out ready to compete. Last year's team for UVA is
different from this year's team, so I don't think they'll play any
differently, but they'll play well. They'll be more focused coming into this
game.  
  
Q. To follow up on that question, your coach talked about how the fact
that they lost last year had no bearing this year, but it gives you a belief
that it can happen. A No. 16 had never beaten a Number 1 last year. Have you
all reflected on that, or do you even care about the seeding number?  
JOSE PEREZ: We're just going to come ready to play, to be honest. Anything can
happen. When we're both on the court, they tie their shoes the same way we do,
to be honest. We're just ready to play.  
  
Q. Some of my question has been answered, but just talk about what you
saw the night the pairings came out. Did you expect to see Virginia, or was
that a surprise at all?  
ERIC JAMISON JR.: It wasn't really a surprise. We were prepared to play
anybody. It doesn't really matter who we play. We're just excited to be here.
This is a great opportunity to play whoever.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other student-athletes like to answer?  
  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yeah, it wasn't much of a surprise. Like Eric said, we're just
ready to compete. We're going to give it our best shot, and we're going to go
out there and play our best.  
  
Q. For any of the players that want to answer this, this is the
program's first time in the Division I NCAA Tournament, but it's got a pretty
rich basketball history, NAIA, D-II. What do you guys kind of learn about the
program's basketball history when you get there, and how important is that for
you to show it off on the big stage?  
D.J. LASTER: It's very important for us to show it off because this is our
first time in history doing this. We just want to leave our legacy and leave
it all out on the court. I trust all my teammates. We're not the biggest team,
but we've got a lot of fight, we've got a lot of heart. I know my teammates
are going to go out there and fight and give it all they have. That's all I
can ask of all my teammates.  
  
My coaches are going to prepare us the right way, and I'm just glad we have a
chance to compete and have the opportunity to play at the highest level,
playing the Number 1 seed, also.  
  
Q. This question is for any of you all who might have watched last
year's game with Virginia and UMBC? You all had to be college basketball fans
your entire life. It had to be like a pretty amazing thing to watch. Did you
picture yourself potentially if you could pull this off this year getting into
this position, and if so, is it something you could imagine, going to a
smaller school, that you would get this opportunity to knock off a Number 1
seed?  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yeah, playing a mid-major school, you want to have those
opportunities to play those higher level teams. All of us is being recruited
at a mid-major level truly believe that we can play at the highest level. So I
don't think that matters to us. We're just going to go out there and compete.  
  
ERIC JAMISON JR.: It's just a humbling experience to be here. So us playing
Virginia is just going to make us better, to be on the court with them. We go
into every game thinking we're going to win the game, no matter who the
opponent is, but we respect the program that they have. We know they're a high
level program, and we're still going to put our plan together, and we're going
to go out there and fight and play.  
  
D.J. LASTER: Like he said, they are a high level program. I believe that we
have high level players on our team. So I think, if we just go out there and
compete and just play with them and control the game and control the
atmosphere of the game and how it's running, like we have a good chance.  
  
JOSE PEREZ: First, let's start off they have a great coach and a great program
there, but just seeing UMBC beat them last year, it's just like it happens,
like you have to come ready to play every night here in March Madness, like
anything can happen, like everybody said before. We have a great coaching
staff, Coach Craft usually prepares us very hard when we're about to play a
big name school or a low name school. He's just very detailed on what we've
got to do, and I feel like tomorrow we're going to be very highly prepared for
them.  
  
Q. Just curious, playing off that last question, you see a 16 seed upset
a 1 seed in Virginia, the team you guys are playing, that's the epitome of the
underdog story. I'm curious, for each of you guys, when you think about what
an underdog is, whether it's David versus Goliath or Rocky Balboa, what comes
to mind for you when you think underdog?  
JOSE PEREZ: Underdog to me is basically somebody like basically everybody is
against them, but the underdog knows they can go out there and basically come
out with the win. That's in my opinion, and that's what I think.  
  
D.J. LASTER: Underdog to me, it just means that not everybody expects for you
or for your team to win. I believe that the underdog has like the faith and
the belief that they can win. So just having faith in being able to know that
you can conquer even like the David and Goliath, like just knowing that, just
having faith is more like what I think of an underdog.  
  
ERIC JAMISON JR.: Perfect example of an underdog is, like you said, the David
and Goliath story. You just can't go in with any fear. You've just got to go
in with as much fight as possible and go out there and just execute the plan
and see where everything goes.  
  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Underdog is just what other people view us on the team. I
guess you just go out there and just compete.  
  
Q. I know you guys talked about, David with you back to the Big South
media day, you felt this could be a special year as your senior year.  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yes, sir.  
  
Q. At what point in the season did you think this was possible? Was it
beating Wake and Georgia Tech or something else?  
DAVID EFIANAYI: Yeah, beating Wake and Georgia Tech let us know we're capable
of doing big things. And then just the beginning of the season. Everybody was
just locked in. Started with like our preseason workouts. We're relentless in
our ball skills. I just feel like everybody was ready to compete. Everybody
was going at each other. We were playing together. It was just special.  
  
D.J. LASTER: Yeah, like David said, we've been locked in all year, and beating
Wake Forest and Georgia Tech really helped us with our confidence and stuff,
but as we got in the conference, we kind of knew that we were one of those
teams that people knew that they're going to have to fight and it's going to
be a dogfight all night.  
  
So I knew that with all my teammates, like everybody is going to go out with
heart. Like we're not going to bend or fold, we're just going to keep on
going, keep on going, no matter the adversity. When adversity hits, we're
going to take care of it the right way. So I knew that, in crunch time, we'll
be able to make the right decisions, and our coaches will make the right
decisions. So I have trust in all my teammates and my coaches. Just confidence
in myself and confidence in all my other teammates to make plays down the
stretch. I think we have done that, and I'm glad we have the opportunity to
play in the tournament to continue to play at that level.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Tim Craft, head coach Gardner-Webb University.  
  
TIM CRAFT: It's great for our program to be here and represent Gardner-Webb
University in the NCAA Tournament. As I was telling the guys from Westwood One
back there, there's no one in our entire program, staff, our players,
administrators that have been to the NCAA Tournament. So this is an exciting
thing for every one of us. We're thrilled to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Tim, if you would share what you will about kind of your plans for
De'Andre Hunter, wanting Laster, Perez, where you see that matchup best for
you?  
TIM CRAFT: He's a monster to defend. He's so good inside and out, really
versatile. Both of those guys will see him at times. We'll have other guys
that will see him. We'll try to limit his ability to catch it close to the
basket and then like give whoever's on him a lot of help, but he's a terrific
player. We can't just guard him with one guy.  
  
Q. Tim, what kind of confidence do you and your players derive from
having already beaten two ACC squads this season?  
TIM CRAFT: I think it helped us in our league certainly be confident in who we
are as a team. I think it certainly helps our guys to know that we can beat a
team that's from a power conference, which we had done in previous years, as
well. In Georgia Tech and Wake Forest, no disrespect to those programs, but
Virginia is a different animal for sure. They're the ACC champs. It's not a
negative thing, it's certainly a positive thing that we won those games and
can draw some confidence from those.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think -- and I know you can't be in Tony Bennett's head
or the UVA players' heads, but do you think they will be more focused or more
inspired based on what happened to them last year in this round?  
TIM CRAFT: Yeah, I would think potentially they would be, but I think they've
done a great job kind of handling that whole thing throughout the year from
the start of the year or when it was -- as soon as they lost a game, they did
a great job of kind of putting that behind them and moving forward, and
they've had a tremendous season.  
  
I'm not sure whether they'll be more focused or less focused, but we know
they're a great team, and it will be a challenge.  
  
Q. Coach Craft, there have been so many firsts this year. A lot of
people talk about coming in as a team the first time, jitters, nervousness.
Being in this big moment, how would you deal with that? Obviously, you had the
first ACC road win, first Big South Tournament finals, and then the Big South
Tournament championship.  
TIM CRAFT: Yeah, we have. We've done a lot of first things this year. First
team to win 20 games at Gardner-Webb in the regular season, first team to be
undefeated at home at Gardner-Webb. We've had a great year. We've been able to
accomplish a lot of those first time things.  
  
I think for us, the biggest thing is just our guys got to just play loose.
They've just got to go out and play loose and free, and I'm going to try to
really get them to just feel like, hey, let's go out and just have some fun.
Let's go have some fun. We've got to be detailed in our plan, but offensively,
I mean, we're going to be playing against one of the best defenses in the
nation on a huge stage. Let's just go out and let it fly. I think that's got
to be our guys' mindset in order to have success.  
  
Q. Tim, I believe you're friendly with Coach Aldrich at Longwood. He was
on the staff at UMBC. Did you hit him up for any advice on how to pull the
upset?  
TIM CRAFT: I did talk to them, not just about their plan for Virginia, but
kind of their plan for the week and just how they helped their guys have the
type of mindset they had coming into the game and what they did in practice
and just kind of how they attacked shootaround. Just logistical things as
well. But I did talk to Griff.  
  
Q. What was the best advice he gave you?  
TIM CRAFT: He said this, but a lot of people said this. It's just enjoy the
moment, enjoy the experience. I just alluded to trying to -- just trying to
play with confidence. Be attack minded and try to be loose and free. That's
the approach we're going to try to take.  
  
Q. Tim, a lot of people talk about Virginia's defense, but what concerns
you about their offense, and how do you defend that?  
TIM CRAFT: They've been so good defensively for so many years, and their
defense is suffocating, but this year's team offensively, I think going into
the tournament, they're like the No. 2 rated offense in KenPom efficiency.
They really grind the clock down. They make you play for long periods of time.
They're really sharp with their execution, whether they're running their mover
blocker, pin downs and flares and constant motion and cutting and screening,
and then they do it with really good players.  
  
So they present a lot of challenges for you. I think Ty Jerome is the guy that
kind of is the head of the snake in terms of can score, can facilitate, has
got size, can make shots, can score it in the paint, and then obviously, you
know, Hunter's had an amazing year and can do so many things for you, and then
Guy that can make shots at such a high level. And the other thing that
concerns me about them is their ability to offensive rebound. Their two big
guys, whoever they have in -- and they rotate those post players, and they're
all big, and they're all strong, and they crash the glass. That's been a
little bit of a challenge for our team this year is defensive rebounding.  
  
So trying to make them miss and be able to continue your stance to play late
in the clock, get a great contest and make them miss and then limit them to
one shot. All of it's a challenge.  
  
Q. A lot of teams in your position just try to break it down into four-
minute segments between the media time-out, and then you go and adjust from
there. Is that kind of your approach tomorrow?  
TIM CRAFT: Yeah, we kind of do that. I think a lot of teams do that, but we
break the game up into what we call four-minute wars. We're trying to take
each four minutes and trying to win that four minutes, try to focus on that
four minutes when you're in that media time-out. But, yes, we do.  
  
Q. So how much of your job tomorrow is psychological, and how much of it
is Xs and Os?  
TIM CRAFT: I think it's both. I think it's 100 percent both. I think it always
is. It always is 100 percent both in every game. There's a different challenge
you're facing from a psychological standpoint every time you go out there, and
certainly with this one, I think it's to just enjoy it, seize the moment. I
know we're going to play hard, but I want us to play really loose and attack
minded offensively because I think that's -- you know, if we come out and play
tight, we've got no shot.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked your players what it meant to be an underdog and got
some pretty good answers. I'm just curious, how has your team embraced the
role of being an underdog while also rationalizing the fact that a Number 1
seed, as we saw last year, is not unbeatable?  
TIM CRAFT: Sure, I think that's a familiar place that we've been in. Really, I
think, since -- in my six years, we've been the underdog a lot. A lot of times
we're not -- this year we were picked sixth in our league, came in as the 4
seed, won the tournament. Every year we play four to five road games against
Power Five opponents. So we're certainly used to that role, and I think our
guys enjoy embracing that role. We kind of took that mindset this season when
we were picked sixth in the league that, hey, man, nobody's expecting us to do
this. We've got a great team in this locker room, and every time-out kind of
coming out with a chip on your shoulder and playing with an edge.  
  
So sometimes that underdog role helps you play with that edge that you need to
play well.  
  
Q. You talked about talking to Coach Aldrich. How much have you
mentioned the UMBC game to your team, and have you drawn anything from that?  
TIM CRAFT: We haven't mentioned it much. They all know about the game, but we
haven't talked about it a whole lot. Our conference tournament happens earlier
than the rest. We won our league championship on the Sunday prior to Selection
Sunday. We gave them two days off, and the first thing we did on Wednesday in
our meeting was try to lock our guys in to, hey, we've achieved something
great. Now let's focus on playing a game and getting ready to play well.  
  
So we showed a lot of upset video clips, but really from the last 20 years,
and we haven't really spent a lot of time on that specific one, but just, hey,
anything can happen in this tournament. That's why this tournament is great.
Let's get focused on preparing to play the best that we can play when the
bracket comes out.  
  
Q. Tim, you mentioned Ty Jerome is, quote, the head of the snake. Can
you expound on that a little bit, especially what he does on the offensive end
and creating angles and getting to places and his court vision?  
TIM CRAFT: Sure, sure. He's just such a multi-dimensional player. He can play
in pick-and-roll, or he's coming off those pin downs, down screens, where,
like you said, just gets a little bit of an angle on a closeout. Now gets into
the paint, can make jumpers in those midrange areas, can make floaters, can
draw defense and dump it off to their post players for layups or spray it out
to shooters for threes. Again, he does it in a lot of different ways. He can
just do it on a pick-and-roll and a ball screen situation or coming off a
screen off the ball or just beat you one-on-one sometimes from the top.  
  
Then he's able to do that as well because his change of pace is so good and
he's such a good shooter. So you've got to be tight to him, or he can shoot it
from about 22, 23 feet at a high level. So he creates some problems for you
defensively just from a one-on-one standpoint, but then in their actions with
the pick-and-rolls and the down screens.  
  
Q. You've talked about earlier that 6 seed in preseason pick. I sensed a
quiet confidence out of you guys even back at Big South Media Day. How have
you navigated that? And how special is it that you're finally here and we're
not talking about it, you're actually doing it?  
TIM CRAFT: It is really special. But, yeah, I do think our team has had a
confidence just going into the season. We've got a really good mix of
experience on our team and some really talented young players. Some of the
guys that were up here -- D.J. Laster as a senior, David Efianayi, fifth year
senior. Christian Turner is a junior point guard. Jaheam Cornwall is a
sophomore point guard with a lot of experience that's been good for us. Eric
Jamison is a fourth year redshirt junior, Justin Jenkins, a redshirt junior.
So from the guys that are out front that have been real productive for us to
our kind of role players that have just been great leaders in our locker room,
all of that has really helped our team.  
  
And then we've got a great freshman class, and Jose Perez has been the guy as
a freshman that's been super productive for our team. So I think from the
preseason, our guys really felt like that we had the makings of a team that
could compete to win a championship in our league. But it's really special
having a team that can do it and being able to accomplish it are two different
things. We've had other teams that were talented enough to get here and lost
in the semifinals three years. So it's hard to make it through that conference
tournament. For this team to be able to play as well as they did, those three
games in those four days, and be sitting here right now is certainly really
special.  
  
Q. I believe you're scoring 78 points per game. They're leading the
nation in defense at 56 or whatever they've given up. Talk about tempo and
will it make a big difference?  
TIM CRAFT: They certainly want to play at a slower tempo. They're going to be
really hard to get anything in transition on. They do such a good job in
transition "D."  
  
We certainly want to try to score in transition when we can. And then
offensively, they're going to do a great job of controlling the tempo by a lot
of times playing late in the clock.  
  
So it's not a huge thing for our team. We're not a team that's emphasizing to
playing really fast or, hey, we're playing really slow. Our tempo is pretty
average. It's not a huge emphasis for us. I think the emphasis for us is, hey,
we've got to be down in a stance sometimes for 28, 29, 30 seconds at a time
defensively to get a stop because they're going to make you play two, three,
four sides of the floor sometimes before they shoot the ball. We've just got
to have great mental toughness in order to defend late in the clock.  
  
But in terms of the amount of possessions and that, it's not a huge thing for
us.  
  
Q. Sticking with the 100 percent that's Xs and Os, you guys did not take
the most threes in the league, but you had the best three-point percentage.
The way they pack in the lane, how important will your three-point shooting be
in this one?  
TIM CRAFT: It's going to be really important, and you said it from our
numbers. Offensively, we want to try to attack the paint on every possession,
and we're trying to get paint touches every possession before we shoot. They
make it real hard to do that with their defense. They make it really hard.
Just their one-on-one "D" is so good, I think, on the ball, and they get in
the gap so well and they're positioning so good. It's going to be hard to get
into the paint.  
  
So I think we've got to move the ball, we've got to cut, we've got to be
patient, and we've just got to make simple plays so that, when we drive it and
that help comes, we've just got to make the easy play and spray it and be
ready to shoot for sure or be ready to attack the next closeout.  
  
I do think making jump shots is important for our team to beat a team like
Virginia, because they're really good, but also because the way they defend
and how they pack their defense into the paint.

_Columbia, South Carolina_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have the student-athletes from Virginia, head coach Tony
Bennett, SID Erich Bacher. Student-athletes with us are Kyle Guy, De'Andre
Hunter, Ty Jerome, and Jack Salt. We'll now open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Ty, you committed to Virginia early in your junior year of high
school. Kyle committed like six weeks later. When did you meet Kyle for the
first time? When did you first play together? This is for you too, Kyle. How
quickly did you realize that your games complemented each other?  
TY JEROME: I remember I committed, and then Kyle started following me on every
social media. I was like who is this kid? I think we started talking over
social media. He told me he was going to commit, and then I think I met him --
was it Mary Kline? The first time we played in the All-Star Game together
called Mary Kline Classic in New Jersey. He stayed at my house for the
weekend. We played for the first time there together. We were on the same
team, and it was just fun.  
  
We also went to Top 100 Camp together, too, at Virginia.  
  
KYLE GUY: I mean, he pretty much nailed it. I definitely bombarded him with a
lot of questions and follows in all forms of social media, and then I invited
myself to his house for the tournament and for the All-Star Game. We've been
friends ever since.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, having played in this arena already this year,
how much of an advantage is it for you knowing kind of a shooting background?
It's a unique background with the wide sight lines here. How do you guys feel
about playing here having played here already this season?  
JACK SALT: Yeah, I mean, it was good to play here during the season. Kind of
got a feel for the environment. It's good to have that game in our back
pocket.  
  
TY JEROME: Like he said, any time you can get familiar with an arena, there's
always a little bit of a benefit. But when the ball's tipped, nothing really
matters.  
  
DE'ANDRE HUNTER: Yeah, like they said, having experience in this gym
definitely helps us a lot.  
  
KYLE GUY: They pretty much nailed it. I don't need to say anything (laughter).  
  
Q. Ty, we know De'Andre's probably not going to talk about himself too
much, but he's been on the team two years and hasn't had a chance to play in
this event. Can you describe what it's like to have him on your side heading
into what you hope will be a long run here?  
TY JEROME: Yeah, just a guy that might be the most versatile guy in the
tournament, can guard one through five almost, can get a bucket when you need
one, isolation, offensive rebound, knock down catch-and-shoot shots. Does
everything, a guy you want on your team. Pretty cool guy off the court too.  
  
Q. For Ty and Kyle, the Gardner-Webb coach was saying that he's telling
his players have fun, play loose, attack, be confident, enjoy the moment,
enjoy the experience. Don't be tight. If you're tight, we have no chance. Are
you guys hearing the same thing from Coach Bennett? Is that the attitude you
guys are taking into the game?  
KYLE GUY: I'd say most teams are probably saying that you want to play free,
you want to have a sense of joy and fun when you're playing the game, but it's
also -- when you step on the court, it's business time. So there's a level of
focus that we have to have in preparation today that we're looking forward to.  
  
TY JEROME: For us, it's about doing what we've done to get to this point all
year. We've had a pretty successful year so far, and just about when we step
on the court, playing with that edge that we've had all year.  
  
Q. Kyle, the Gardner-Webb coach referred to Ty as the head of the snake.
Are you okay with that?  
KYLE GUY: 100 percent. I've been saying that all year. He runs the show, and
we just sit back and wait for his passes and knock them down.  
  
Q. Is he a snake?  
TY JEROME: Do you try to make him mad or --  
  
KYLE GUY: It is a compliment? I don't know. It is.  
  
Q. You mentioned the edge with which you guys play. What is the source
of that edge? Where does it come from?  
TY JEROME: I think it comes from knowing what we want to accomplish, how hard
it is to accomplish what we -- how hard it is to do that. Last year's defeat
and just the desire to be great and all those different things and try to
instill that in every single person on the team. So when we get into a tight
game or when we get into a tournament game like tomorrow, it's not just one or
two guys or three guys with that edge. You're playing ten different guys that
have that same edge.  
  
Q. For Kyle, you can speak for your teammates, as well. After what
happened a year ago, for those of us who haven't been around you, how have you
guys kind of dealt with that history moment, and how anxious are you to kind
of get that off your back and get a roll going this year?  
KYLE GUY: Coach Bennett and the coaching staff did a great job of making sure
we talked about it after when the next preseason started and stuff. So we've
become closer as a team. That loss doesn't define us. We watched a TED Talk,
and he said something along the lines of, if you use it right, it can buy you
a ticket to a place you couldn't have gone any other way. So that's been the
motto.  
  
Losses happen. We knew it was going to happen eventually. Just ready for this
year.  
  
Q. Last week in Charlotte at the ACC Tournament, I think you said to the
media, you guys don't have to apologize for asking about last year. I don't
know if you meant that or not. But do people kind of toe the line with you
guys when they see you around campus or in the media when they approach you
about last year? Or how badly do you guys want them to know that is behind
you?  
KYLE GUY: I'm not going to speak for anyone else, but like I said, you don't
have to apologize to me. I'm very transparent. No one around campus or grounds
really mentions it to us or anything. Some people don't let it go on social
media. I get Venmos all the time saying we've got to pay them $5 because we
lost. I don't pay them, by the way. But it definitely is behind us, and we're
ready to put on a show this year so we can talk about something else.  
  
Q. For Ty as well as Kyle, how much does it help having a lot of that
same group around that knows that hurt and that can fuel that going forward
into this tournament?  
TY JEROME: It's definitely helpful, but you've got to be careful because you
don't want to play with anger. You don't -- you've got to be careful playing
with anger, I should say. Last year, like Kyle said earlier, we watched a TED
Talk about it. We discussed it a lot. We used it as motivation. And like we
said, it can take you to a place you've never been if you use it the right
way. So it's more about doing what we do, playing with our same edge every
single game we've played so far this year rather than just knowing we've got
to make up for last year and playing with anxiousness and anger.  
  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, I would say in practice, whenever somebody's tired or you're
trying to fight through a rep or take a play off or something, I always think
back to that. And then when I'm on the court, I don't even think about it. I'm
focused on what's in front of me because, if you're too focused on the past,
you're not going to be able to move forward.  
  
So, yeah, it's a chip on our shoulder, but it doesn't define us. We're just
trying to move past it and let the inspiration and motivation behind it take
us somewhere we haven't been.  
  
Q. Real quick, Kyle, screen saver on your phone, is it still the
picture?  
KYLE GUY: Yes, ma'am.  
  
Q. De'Andre, for you, as you hear these guys talk about last year and
knowing you couldn't be on the court for that, just kind of curious your
mentality and what emotions it stirs up as you hear them reflecting on last
year and look forward to this year?  
DE'ANDRE HUNTER: I'm just excited for myself and more for the team just to get
back to this stage and have the same opportunity as last year to play against
the 16 seed and possibly erase what happened last year. People are going to
still remember, but we have another opportunity to do something really special
in this tournament.  
  
Q. Kyle, Ty has talked about how much he learned from London
(Perrantes), the one year they played together. Was there anybody that first
year, the older guys, who was a mentor to you?  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, I would say London, also. He was my roommate on the road, so I
learned a lot from him. But to be honest, I learn so much from all these guys
every day. Even freshman year, I was learning a lot from Ty and his mindset
and the way he plays the game, so yeah.  
  
Q. Ty and Kyle, this TED Talk you're referring to, was this specifically
about your situation, or was it about handling adversity and using it to your
advantage in the future? And who made the TED Talk?  
THE MODERATOR: Whoever has that answer.  
  
TY JEROME: No, they didn't make a TED Talk just for us. It was --  
  
KYLE GUY: His name was The Storyteller.  
  
TY JEROME: Yeah, it was The Storyteller, and it actually had nothing to do
with basketball, the TED Talk. It was a story he told about his life
experiences, which weren't basketball related, but most of the times, you can
relate almost anything to your passion.  
  
Q. This is for Kyle again. Could you talk about Braxton Key's
contributions this year.  
KYLE GUY: Yeah, I would go as far to say he's one of the better rebounders on
the team. I think he leads the team in rebounding, unlimited minutes, and he's
gained a lot of trust from the players and the coaching staff. In these last
few games, he's coming around at the right time as we move forward in March.
His versatility has been great, and he's improved every day.  
  
TY JEROME: This one's got to be for Jack.  
  
Q. De'Andre, I'm curious, as you're watching the TED Talk and even going
back to just watching the game itself, what was that experience like for you,
and how many times have you run over what you could have contributed had you
been there?  
DE'ANDRE HUNTER: I feel like in the moment I wasn't really thinking about it
because I wasn't playing, but a few days after, I just thought about how I
wouldn't be able to play with those guys again, play with that team again. I
mean, it kind of hurt, but I don't really think about what I could have
contributed to the game because it doesn't matter. I didn't play, so just try
to move on.  
  
Q. This one's for Ty. Sorry, Jack. Specifically for you, Ty, Jose Perez
on Gardner-Webb says he knows you a little bit from some AAU experience. Can
you talk about him a little bit and how you know him and just what Gardner-
Webb, what jumps out on film about them?  
TY JEROME: So we actually played in the same AAU program, PSA Cardinals in New
York. I played against him, our high schools twice, I think. I heard he's
having a great year. I think he leads them in rebounds. He posts a lot from
the four position. He's been a versatile four for them, passed the ball well
from out of the post. So I heard he's having a great year.  
  
I think that versatility jumps out on film. One through five shoot the three.
They're a little smaller, but they all attack. They're balanced. They have
some really good athletes. They defend. They share the ball. They don't turn
it over much. So they're a real good team. It's going to be a battle.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Jack, do you want to elaborate on anything that jumps out about
Gardner-Webb?  
  
JACK SALT: Sure. Like Ty was saying, they're very versatile. They have five
men that can shoot the three, face up and relentless. It's going to be a good
matchup. We're excited to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. This can go to any of you guys really, but I guess, as it relates to
a year ago, you have new pieces that you didn't have then -- De'Andre being
one, Braxton being another, Kihei being another. How much more equipped do you
guys feel to play small ball defensively than you were maybe a year ago?  
THE MODERATOR: This will be the final question. So we'll start with Kyle and
anyone else answer.  
  
KYLE GUY: I would say that on the ball Kihei brings something to the game that
I've never played with or experienced. I'm not sure that full court-wise,
Coach Bennett's ever seen anything like this in his program. He will be a key
piece moving forward. Like I said, Braxton being able to rebound is huge.
Obviously, we know what Dre brings to the table is just a little bit of
everything. So whenever you're not playing with someone like that, your team's
going to struggle a little bit. We've got him healthy and back and ready to
go.  
  
With Braxton and Kihei, I'm just excited for them to play with this team in
the tournament for the first time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else? Thank you guys.  
  
Virginia head coach, Tony Bennett.  
  
TONY BENNETT: Obviously, excited to be back here and getting ready to play. I
heard the tail end of our guys' responses, and I'm sure you guys got a lot of
questions for me. So I'll look forward to answering them. Again, thankful to
be in this spot, and we know how good, I'm sure you'll ask me, Gardner-Webb
is, and we'll try to prepare as well as we can and look forward to playing
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Tony, you don't always get a chance to see your incoming recruits
play together before they get to college. Were you confident that Ty and Kyle
would complement each other as well on the court as they have?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, they're smart, skilled players, and they got to play in
the NBA Top 100 Camp. They might have been on the same team, but they played
in that. Just watching them in AAU, guys that have a feel for the game and are
skilled and smart usually gel or mesh together, and they've done that. I think
they've come in, and they've added to their physical. Coach Curtis has done a
great job. They've gotten stronger and more athletic. But, again, the way they
play the ball and the way they are, it was can we get them ready defensively?
They've even taken steps in that area. So no question they have that.  
  
Q. Some of your players describe Gardner-Webb's style as relentless and
balanced. What jumps out to you?  
TONY BENNETT: I'm impressed, well-coached. Tim does a great job. Teams that
have fours and fives that can -- well, all the players that can shoot the
three, multiple actions, great spacing of the floor, very good numbers
offensively and defensively. Just, they're good. They beat two ACC opponents
on the road, and one of the ACC assistants just called me and said they're
very good. You've got to be ready. They can play.  
  
Of course we're going to be ready. We understand that. When you get into this
tournament, everybody can play. So just their balance, their ability to
stretch the floor, the actions that they run, and, again, what D.J. did in the
championship game was amazing, but they have multiple players to attack and
score and play that way.  
  
Q. Tony, I wanted to ask you about Ritchie McKay, your former assistant,
obviously at Liberty, in the tournament for the first time since 2013. What
stood out to you about your time with him as an assistant and how impressed
are you with how he's been able to turn around the program to get to the NCAA
Tournament?  
TONY BENNETT: He did a great job when he was there the first time. Ritchie was
such a blessing for me to come in. He was a friend from way back, head
coaching experience, and have -- you know, I think he had been in the Virginia
area for I don't know how many years exactly when I took the job. But
excellent recruiter, understands the game at a high level offensively, great
mind. Just who he is.  
  
You have to, when you go through these rebuilding programs or the rigors of
just seasons, you want people that you always say are with you irregardless,
and you trust them. That was built in because of our relationship before,
because of who he is.  
  
Hopefully, he helped our program. Hopefully, he gained some things. But he's
taken that job, and he's got very good players. They play a sound system.
They're defending well. He's got them doing good stuff offensively. So really
happy to see the success that he had and Coach Soucie's there, who was with us
as well.  
  
Q. Over the course of the season, how do you make sure the guys are sort
of mentally where they need to be at this point of the year. During the
regular season, can it kind of feel long at times, and if so, how do you make
sure this time of year they're at their best going into tournament play?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, you're always trying -- the teams that can advance are the
teams that are healthy, that are playing their best basketball and are fresh.
The season is challenging and it's long. You know you always look at the
season and say how can we try to peak at the right time and play our best
basketball? When you're in a league like the ACC, we always use the term, it
will check you for leaks. If you've got leaks, it will show up. You just have
to be ready any time out. You're hopeful at that competition, if there's
something that's off, it will show and then we'll address it to work at it.
Just prepare the right way. That's all you can do.  
  
I told our guys they're going to get so many questions, I'm sure, about last
year, and I said, here's the deal. I said, you respect your opponent, which is
easy to do because they're very good. You respect the game. You prepare well
and then get yourself in the moment and go out and play. That's what you can
control. Again, you try to get your team playing the best basketball. But
that's the reality of it. Hopefully, we're in a good spot and ready to play.  
  
Q. Tony, dovetailing off of that, your players talked about channeling
last year's disappointment properly. What constitutes during that, and how do
you prepare them just having dealt with that for this stage now?  
TONY BENNETT: Everybody processes things or internalizes things differently,
but in all of your experiences when you go through a relatively hard thing,
those are the things that can really shape you, as you guys talk about, if you
learn to use them right. That was something we've talked about as a team and
certainly have dealt with it, and we've said we've owned that, and I think
that's just use it in the right way. You don't stay in it forever, but you
grow from all those things, but especially that, and then attack this year.  
  
We talked about running to the starting line. That was kind of a theme we
talked about through this year, and playing in the best way. Certainly,
there's motivation from all the experiences that have happened in the past,
but I think it's the ability, as I said, to prepare well and be in the moment
now and be as good as you can and know you're going to be -- it's a new year
and kind of that idea of pressing on, pressing on.  
  
Q. Coach Bennett, the players were talking about a TED Talk that they
watched. Was that your idea? Do you remember who gave the talk and what the
point of the whole exercise was?  
TONY BENNETT: It was -- if you've ever watched TED Talks, they're very -- I
think they're inspirational. Actually, it was done in Charlottesville, a guy
named Joe the Storyteller. He had gone through or witnessed something, a hard
thing. At the start of the year, we showed it. It was powerful. It was a
unique, I thought, TED Talk that really spoke to the situation at hand, and
it's really just there's so many things guys take from it, but the ability to
learn to use things that happen in your life in the right way because there's
just a quote -- and I think I shared it at ACC Media Day -- that if you learn
to use it right, it can buy you a ticket to a place that you couldn't have
gone any other way, talking about a hard experience. That was kind of the idea
about that.  
  
You know, that's the reality of the talk and the guys, and we've used that and
shared that and said, in anything, what can we learn from this? Are we
thankful for what we learned? Whether it's a tough loss, a great win, or a
situation like last year, the ability to grow from that and respond in the
right way.  
  
Q. Coach, you can show guys, and you can talk to them about certain
things, but what most impressed you, the message that you gave them last year
after that loss and the things you told them in the off-season? What's most
impressed your -- what's most caught your attention and impressed you during
the regular season about the growth and maturity of this team?  
TONY BENNETT: Yeah, you just, as I said, the league is good. You've got to
step in the moment and play. And with the guys' consistency -- a conference
season or a season is about the consistency of your team on the road, at home,
over 2 1/2 months or 18 games in the ACC. That's a different kind of challenge
than the NCAA Tournament. The NCAA Tournament or the ACC is the one-and-done,
but I've marvelled that how they found ways, they rallied, and they were at a
very consistent level for the most part. That doesn't always happen when
you're in a league -- any league, really -- because usually there's some drop-
offs or dips, and certainly that's possible.  
  
But how they did that -- what was our record in conference? What were we,
16-2, right? Yes, I had to go back. To be able to do that over that consistent
time, that impressed me. And they really played together. I think their
versatility was important, and they all improved in the off-season. So that
always stands out to me that, over that course of time, I think that's kind of
what you're asking, where I step back and say, hard to do, and they did it and
well done.  
  
Q. Curious if you could just speak to the impact of having De'Andre this
year in the tournament and his versatility and what he brings and the
difference it will be having him.  
TONY BENNETT: De'Andre's had a heck of a year. He's improved. You said it, his
versatility. Defensively, we've used him at times to guard ones, twos, threes,
and fours. That can be helpful. The way the game is going with fours and fives
now that are playing just like guards and separating, you need mobilitity and
quickness to be able to hopefully guard guys like that well. Offensively,
we've used De'Andre some on the perimeter and some as kind of a stretch four,
and he's been able, at times, to certainly manufacture some shots, shot-making
ability. Those things, I think, are really important, and you have to account
for him on the offensive end. He's scoring the post some. He's just versatile
really in both ways.  
  
So at 6'7" or 6'8" with the long wingspan, just his dimensions are good. So
just a high quality player, obviously, and I think that any time you can have
a versatile player that can play some four for you or three, I think that's
what helped us last year and has helped us again this year, among other
things.  
  
Q. Coach, Jack talked about Laster as a guy who can score on the
outside, on the inside. Whether it's Jack defending him or someone else,
what's the key to defending a versatile big like that?  
TONY BENNETT: What was the first part?  
  
Q. Jack mentioned Laster as a guy that can score --  
TONY BENNETT: I thought you said last year. Oh, Laster. You have to be really
good individually on him, and then collectively as a team, it can't be one man
just stopping him because what he did in the tournament and all, he's playing
his best basketball now, but it's not just him. You can say, well, we can just
lock into him. They have so many other quality players that can score and are
efficient, but they do a lot of good stuff with ball screens. You've got to be
able to stop the ball and quick to him as a shooter and then be able to spread
out because he drives well and, again, inside, outside. I think he's shooting
over 40 from three. Their team is shooting almost 40 percent. So it puts
pressure and the challenge on you, but very alert and very ready and quick to
him because of his ability to play outside and inside as their five a lot of
times.  
  
Q. Tony, I've seen you after some tough losses. You seem to have this
incredible calm about you in those tough -- in the toughest moments probably
of your career. Is that a conscious choice for you to act that way, to comport
yourself that way, or is that just something that comes naturally to you? When
you're ever in private, do you ever go somewhere and scream?  
TONY BENNETT: Punch the pillow. I used to do that when I played for my dad.
When he'd yell at me, I'd go to the dorm and say this is a pillow and pretend
as he's chewed us out. Of course you do.  
  
I'm thankful for the things -- you certainly feel things, and things bother
you, but where does peace and perspective come from? I always tell our guys
it's got to be something that is unconditional, and I know I have that in the
love of my family. Unconditional, acceptance and love. That's huge. And I know
I have that in my faith in Christ. That's, for me, where I draw my strength
from, my peace, my steadiness in the midst of things. But, of course you feel
things. Of course you desperately want things to go well, and it's frustrating
when you're not. You step back and look at it.  
  
I always challenge our guys, what's your secret of contentment? What's your
secret of contentment? There's going to be times, it talks about you're going
to be well fed and living in plenty, and there's going to be times when you're
going to be starving and living in want. What's your secret of handling that?
That I know, without a doubt, those of us who have parents or kids, that love
you give them unconditionally or if your faith is there, that has to buoy you,
and that has to be your center, and you dwell on what is good because there is
a bigger picture in all of this, and I believe I understand that. So going
through those refining moments, they're tough, but you look back at them, and
in a way, they're sometimes painful gifts that draw you near to what truly
matters. I think that's the best way I could respond to that.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
North Carolina - 81, Washington - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina head coach Roy Williams and Luke
Maye and Cameron Johnson. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think, needless to say, anybody that advances past this
point you feel good about a win in the second round. Last year, we had a
really, really nice year. In the second round we stumbled. We talked about it
quite a bit this summer, and I think the kids were really good at times today.  
  
Ten turnovers in the first half was very discouraging, but other than that I
thought we did some really good things in the first half. Second half, we got
it down to only five turnovers and still shot 50 percent. I think that was
good.  
  
Our work on the backboards was something. Luke, 14 rebounds to go along with
his 20 points. I think Nassir gave us a big lift. And I think two kids really
showed a lot of toughness today. Garrison, he'll have to go see the dentist
before we leave town to get two teeth straightened out. And he had some
stitches put in, and he came back and played almost the entire second half.  
  
And Kenny strained his hamstring and came back and tried to guard like crazy
when he got in there. And love our toughness, love the edge that our bench
gave us today. And just love the way we kept competing. And happy as we can be
that we're still; really happy with these two guys up here beside me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Cameron, and Luke you can answer too, what makes you so effective
attacking the zone? This is not the first time you've played so well against
that?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: The key today was getting the ball to the middle. The middle
was a soft spot. They were covering the wings and the perimeter pretty well.
And once we got it inside, it was basically a two on one for an easy jump shot
or a dump down. And I think we exploited that a lot more in the second half
than we did the first half.  
  
LUKE MAYE: I would agree. I think the biggest thing for us was trying to score
in a different variety of ways. And I think we scored inside. We were able to
score out of transition. Coby did an unbelievable job pushing the ball and
that really allowed us to get out and run.  
  
And then offensive glass was really big for us. Coach emphasized it a lot
coming into the game. And I thought we did a good job. Garrison had a few big
rebounds. Naz did a great job off the bench. Naz was great. When you throw it
to Naz in the middle and he just elevates over everybody, it allows it to be a
pretty effective zone offense.  
  
Q. Second game in a row you were much better defensively, seemed like,
in the second half. Is that a matter of kind of feeling out the opponent in
the first half? Is it a matter of the urgency that you guys talked about
Friday night? What would you attribute that to?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I would say a lot has to do with the urgency. I feel like
when we're defending the way we're capable of, we do a pretty good job. When
we lose focus, when we lose urgency, we don't do as well. I think we did a
better job in the second half today.  
  
LUKE MAYE: I don't want to give Coach too much credit, but I think when Coach
gets on us at halftime it fires us up a little bit, and I think it makes us
want to guard better for him. And it just shows how much our coaching staff
cares about us and cares about how much they want us to win.  
  
And we've got to bring that from the jump. And that's coming from the senior
leaders. And I take that upon myself, and Cam and Kenny. But I think the
second half we did a lot better job and it was big for us.  
  
Q. Cam, at the risk of embarrassing him, could you just talk, explain
what Luke's development has been like since you've been in this program?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I saw it when I first stepped on the campus for my visit.
When he was playing pickup, he was playing with a lot of confidence. And that
confidence, as you keep playing, you keep getting experience, you keep
getting, better and better and better.  
  
And so the Luke I saw when I was playing at Pitt versus the Luke I saw in
pickup that day, versus the Luke we see today, we just see a lot of growth.
And the kid works. He's in the gym all the time getting up extra shots. And he
plays harder than just about anybody. He works harder than just about anybody.
And that's a testament to his character.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: When you're as old as Cam is you can call Luke Maye a kid.
Gotcha. (Laughter.)  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Yeah.  
  
Q. Luke, maybe you can speak for yourself, what's it meant to you, your
career, your growth and to be in this position now?  
LUKE MAYE: It's been huge. I give a lot of it to my teammates just because of
how much they've believed in me and getting me into my spots. And the coaches
have believed in me since the very beginning.  
  
And it's really been great to have such a great coaching staff to really give
me the opportunities I had earlier in my career. Coach always said that he
believed in me from the beginning, and he gave me opportunities when I didn't
even think I wanted the opportunities.  
  
And it was big for me to continue to grow and develop as a player. And I
thought today it was a great win for us, and moving on to the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. After the loss last year to Texas A &M in the second round, how does
it feel to be in the Sweet 16?  
LUKE MAYE: We talked about it all summer. To lose that way and to have Joe and
Theo go out like that was really hard, especially for the guys who felt like
it was on us. And, I mean, I feel like it's just a testament to how hard we
worked and get back to the spot.  
  
And I think it's been great to see how many guys have grown this season and
really stepped up. And B-Rob gave us great minutes when Kenny went down. And
Garrison came -- like, Coach talked about him. He was just huge for us. And it
really shows how much character we have in the locker room.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Agreed.  
  
Q. Luke, you guys are ranked No. 1 in the country rebounding margin. I
believe they came in at 289. Did you feel you could exploit them on the
boards? And what did you do to take full advantage of that today?  
LUKE MAYE: Yes, it was in our scouting reports to take advantage of them on
the offensive glass, and defensively we just gotta box out. I had a couple
missed box-outs. I'll take the blame for that later.  
  
I think it's big Coach emphasize rebounding first time in practice. And I try
to pride myself in working hard and trying to get as many offensive rebounds
as I can. And I think Garrison's done a good job, and so has Cam and Naz. It's
been great to see how much they've grown offensively and defensively,
rebounding-wise.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Two games in a row that Nassir has seemed to embrace kind of getting
the ball in the middle and really attacking the rim. Is that a matter of
maturation for him? Is that a conversation you guys have had, maybe?  
COACH WILLIAMS: You know, it's a little bit of it is maturing. But he was
really coming along really, really well. And then he got his ankle hurt, and
then he got hit in the face -- in the eye, excuse me. And those kind of things
set him back quite a bit.  
  
But he's such a gifted guy around that basket, so quick, jumps so high that I
think he himself is realizing it more now than he did early in the practices
and early in the games. I was very happy when he went out to shoot that 3
right in front of our bench because it was a shot that everybody wanted him to
take. And we've seen him take those and he works extremely hard on the shot.  
  
But he has an ability to get around that basket and with the jumping ability
and the quickness he has and the power that he has, he can hurt a lot of
people inside. So it's a little bit of maturing, but it's also him getting
healthy again, because I really thought during that time period that he was
going to really take off. And he had about a four, five-game stretch, maybe
more or less, I don't know, that he wasn't as effective. But the last two
games he's been something else for us.  
  
Q. Coach, seems like with the popularity of the 3-pointer gaining each
year, that some teams lose a mid-range game. They either dunk or hit a 3. Is
Luke leading the revival of that in the game?  
COACH WILLIAMS: All our guys, I tell them all the time I want great balance. I
want to shoot the 3-point shot by guys who can make them. I want to get the
ball inside because you get the other team in foul trouble.  
  
We wanted to get Dickerson in foul trouble today and we weren't able to do it.
We were able to get Iona's big guy in trouble yesterday.  
  
I like balance and 3-point shots and -- shots inside to get the other team in
foul trouble. And Luke Maye can make it from 12 feet and 14 feet, and he
shoots a high percentage there than he does from the 3-point line. I like
those, I like makers.  
  
But our team was very unselfish today and after, as I said, the turnovers in
the first half I really liked what we did with the basketball, too.  
  
Q. I know it's early but could you assess where you guys fit in, some of
the challenges you anticipate you may face?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, I could, but I really haven't thought about that. I
swear, guys, nobody in the history of basketball has ever just played one game
and then started thinking about the other one after that is over with as much
as I do.  
  
I know who we play next and I know who -- no, I don't. I know who we play next
and I know where that is. And that's about it. Because I really do try to live
in the moment and coach that game. And I'm very pleased with what we've done
to get to this stage.  
  
I told the guys Marty Schottenheimer, coach at Kansas City, always talked
about enjoying the wins until midnight. In the locker room I asked them, do we
play Thursday/Saturday or do we play Friday/Sunday? They said Friday/Sunday. I
said maybe we'll enjoy this one a little past midnight. But that's all it's
going to be.  
  
But for us we're extremely happy to be where we are, but at the same time we
just want to enjoy this one and we'll start focusing on Auburn, I guess, who
is the next team that we play.  
  
Q. Maybe you can speak to as far as what kind of growth you've seen over
the past two games. What in particular has gotten better? What needs to get
better?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Well, we've got our tails beat at -- is Cason (phonetic) back
there? That's my boss back there. She's been my boss for 46 years. And my
grandson is waiting for me, so we'll get this done quickly.  
  
Throughout the course of the second half of the season I think we got better
and better and better. And our teams, a lot of our teams have done that
because they really focus and our staff really pushes. We don't just get too
high over a big win or way down over a loss; we try to get better every single
day.  
  
And I think if you talk to our team they'd tell you that's the focus. And
we've gotten better. But so has Auburn and some of these other teams that are
going to be playing. But I do like how our kids have focused down the stretch
and gotten better every game.  
  
Q. Luke had 20 and seemed to be thriving in the middle of that zone.
Could you talk about what he was able to do so well against this defense?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Same thing he said. We played against Syracuse's zone, we've
had some good success. But they've beaten our tail sometimes too.  
  
But I don't mind the other team playing zone. But I don't mind -- I don't care
what they play because we're so much freelance, we don't run a ton of set
plays. So we really don't care what offense -- excuse me, what defense they
run.  
  
When you move yourself and move the ball intelligently and try to find the
holes -- and we've had some success, but we know we've gotta do it again next
week.  
  
Q. What Luke was saying before, you believed in him from the beginning.
What was about him that made you believe in him?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I knew his father was a great individual, when he was in
school and a quarterback for us, and he comes to camp I'll miss the years,
sixth, seventh, eighth, ninth grade, I kept telling his dad: don't be in a
hurry because I think he's going to be good enough.  
  
The thing with me, he had great hands and he could shoot the ball and a brain
that he used, and a work ethic. So I'll take all those qualities all the time.
But I did have confidence and faith in him and still do. And I hope to do it
for a long time.  
  
Q. How did Coby's 3-pointers there, one, two, three, four in the first
half, kind of spark that offense? One from the corner was a very deep fade-
away there?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, it was a bad shot. It went in. All of a sudden it's a
great shot. But Coby has an ability to score. They were trying to cover him.
They were trying to have somebody in front of him the whole game. And he
picked his spots. And I thought he really did a nice job for us. He didn't
have many opportunities the second half because they tried to cover him more,
but he was good.  
  
Q. Two years ago Luke was really important to you guys making the title
run. What he did tonight, and even the impact he had in the second half,
Friday night, how good does that make you feel and how important is that going
to be going forward?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I agree with you, couple of years ago he's the MVP of the
regional and he does score a field goal at the Final Four. But he was
important to us. And last year maybe as good a year as I've ever had a kid
from sophomore to junior, the biggest jump he's had. He's an intelligent young
man. He finds the holes in the zone really well. Knows how important
rebounding is and adjusts his game to be a great rebounder, because you look
at him you don't think he's going to be a guy that's going to get 14, 16
rebounds against really good competition.  
  
So I say it's his intelligence and his desire more than anything. But he's
just a remarkable young man. And I'm very lucky to coach him.  
  
And I will tell you, you and I are okay for another year. If you want to try
to jinx me next year -- I know you didn't try to, that's not what I'm saying,
but I showed -- my wife even laughed because she did say I was smiling when I
did say that. Thank you. I'm going to go see my little grandson.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
COLUMBUS](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+COLUMBUS)

  

## March 24, 2019

  

### [Fran McCaffery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18323)

### [Isaiah Moss](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37081)

### [Luka Garza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34689)

### [Joe Wieskamp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37059)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Tennessee - 83, Iowa - 77 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll bypass the opening statement from Coach and start with
your questions for the Iowa players -- Joe Wieskamp, Isaiah Moss and Luka
Garza all with us. Questions for the players?  
  
Q. Isaiah, what got into you at halftime? What sparked the comeback in
the second half?  
ISAIAH MOSS: That just shows our resilience. Like the game against Cincinnati,
we don't give up. We know if we continue to fight we give ourselves a chance
to win.  
  
JOE WIESKAMP: At halftime -- obviously it wasn't the start we wanted -- we had
a decision to make. We could either fold and hand it to them. Or we could
fight back. I think we showed that in the second half. And we were able to
take it to them in overtime.  
  
LUKA GARZA: Just kind of like in the Cincinnati game, when we had that timeout
when we were down 18-5, in that timeout in the locker room at halftime you
could tell something was about to happen. All the guys were communicating with
each other, believing in each other. Our leaders were stepping up and talking
to each other to make sure we weren't going to go down without a fight. And we
were going to leave everything out on the floor.  
  
Q. Luka, the reverse of that, what happened in the overtime? How were
they able to take hold of it so quickly?  
LUKA GARZA: Grant Williams hit some big shots. He's a big-time player. And we
defended him well. He had a couple turnarounds and different stuff like that.  
  
And I think we executed well down the stretch when we needed to toward the end
and got a couple of layups to keep us in it. But I think if we could have
stopped him, it was hard. Those were really well-defended shots. Tyler did a
great job in those moments on him. Just credit to him for that.  
  
ISAIAH MOSS: What Luka said, he's made tough shots down the stretch. Tyler did
a good job on him the whole game, I thought. But made great shots.  
  
JOE WIESKAMP: Credit to Tennessee. They hit some tough shots. Grant Williams,
obviously, the SEC Player of the Year. But like he said, we executed down the
stretch, too.  
  
Q. Joe, seemed like a very disruptive defense from Tennessee that had
you guys out of your rhythm in the first half. Is that something that you were
able to get back on track in the second?  
JOE WIESKAMP: Yeah, I think so. Not the first half that we had hoped for. But
you could tell the resiliency and the fight of us in the second half. I think
we kind of got into their space a little bit in the second half. We were able
to turn them over quite a bit and execute on offense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. It took a lot of courage to come back, to get to the overtime; they
decide to put Schofield on the bench and go big. Did that surprise you?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Yeah, I figured he'd be out there. He played well in the
game. He's one of their better players. But again, I've got enough trouble
coaching my own team. So whatever Rick decides to do, I have great respect for
him, respect for that team.  
  
They were No. 1 for a very long time this year for a reason. It's not often
that you get down 25, come back and tie it. So very pleased with the effort
and concentration and execution of our guys to a man.  
  
Q. There's a lot of talk from your players about what happened at
halftime. Was it more technical changes, emotional? Where did you try and
strike?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think the critical thing in a situation like that, a lot of
things that we thought we were going to be able to do we weren't able to do in
the first half. I give credit to our opponent. They were up in our space. They
picked us up full court. They were literally sideways going east/west.  
  
Didn't get great looks at it. Down 44-19, and it just didn't look good. I
challenged Tyler Cook to be who he is. And I'm really proud of him. Not in a
negative way. That's not how I am. He's a special young man with great
character. I knew he was better than that. The same with Luka.  
  
So you talk about a few things from a technical perspective. You stay
positive. You challenge a few guys to be better than they were. And you're
trying at that point to build confidence, because we didn't play like a
confident group in the first half. I think that was obvious. So what do we
have to do as coaches to get them to play to their capabilities? That's all
you can ask from them. You can't ask more than that.  
  
It starts with effort. And I think it really started with we got some stops
early. We got some run-outs. We got a few buckets. Cook got going. Then Garza
got going. Then Moss got going. Then Bohannon got going. And we just fed off
of that energy. And the impressive thing for me, and what I'm most proud of as
a coach, is how we stayed connected and we stayed together, because anything
short of that and you're not going to be able to come back like we did.  
  
Q. Obviously you're disappointed; you wanted to win this game. But to
come back from 25 against a team of that caliber, does it make it more
palatable to know that you exited the way that, hey, we left it all out there,
was everything we could do?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Absolutely. It's the only thing that we can ever really ask
of our guys. We put a game plan together. We know it's not going to be
perfection. It never is.  
  
But what you hope to get is a perfect effort. And that's what we got. And I
think anytime that happens, you just want to hug your guys and tell them how
much you love them because you appreciate how hard it was to do what they did.  
  
Q. Quick thumbnail sketch, if you had to describe what makes Tennessee
maybe the best team in the country, what would you say?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: They've got a lot of weapons. They play both ends. They play
defense. They share the ball. They have go-to guys. They shoot it well enough
so you can't really just say, okay, we're just going to back it up. They shoot
the ball well. They have low-post options. And they have tremendous speed and
quickness.  
  
I think it's a confident, veteran group, which I think always helps especially
this time of year, but it helps you throughout the course of the year. It's
the reason why they have the record they have. So they're going to be a tough
out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations.

## March 24, 2019

  

### [Mike Hopkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34214)

### [Jaylen Nowell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36772)

### [Matisse Thybulle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34854)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
North Carolina - 81, Washington - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Washington head coach Mike Hopkins and student-
athletes Matisse Thybulle and Jaylen Nowell. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH HOPKINS: You know, you get a chance to play Carolina, it's a pretty
incredible opportunity. And I felt in the first half, you know, we got down.
We kept fighting back. Showed a lot of resiliency. Cut the lead to eight.
Missed a couple of foul shots at the end.  
  
And Coby White hit 4-for-5 from the 3-point line in the first half. We felt
like in the second half if we could find him, do a better job on the glass we
could be there.  
  
And they're just a really big team, really good shooting team. It seemed like
when they missed they got the rebound. And you're not going to win too many
games getting outrebounded by 24. Our kids kept fighting. They battled like
champions like they are. Unfortunately we ran into a tough Carolina team
tonight.  
  
Q. Matisse, how would you summarize your final season at Washington?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: I mean, like everyone's going to come into college saying
you want to play on this stage and be able to win your league and be able to
say you're a champion, all those things. I was able to accomplish all that
this year with three seniors, three of my senior teammates who we've been
through it all together.  
  
And even with these new guys, like Jaylen and the young guys, to be able to
bond together and achieve so much in my last year, I couldn't have imagined it
coming through, and I'm glad that I was able to do it with these guys.  
  
Q. Jaylen, you've played some good teams, other tournament teams this
season, including No. 1 Gonzaga. Could you compare and contrast North Carolina
with what you've seen from other top teams?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: Well, they're all really good teams. They all play very hard.
One thing I can say about North Carolina is that they're really resilient.
When we were up on them -- I gotta give them credit -- they kept playing and
they kept going at us. And they're a really good team.  
  
Q. Matisse, did you feel like there was a lot going on behind you for an
inordinate amount of time on defense?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: We flew around for the most part on defense, had some pretty
good energy. But like Coach said, the rebounding killed us. And they're a big
team, a strong team, a physical team. And we weren't able to get back and grab
a lot of those rebounds from the missed shots that we forced.  
  
Q. Jaylen, you had everyone on the team seemed like, especially in the
second half, some very good looks and then things just didn't go for a roll.  
JAYLEN NOWELL: Yeah, you know that's just how the game goes sometimes. So we
just try to make sure that even though those shots were falling we were able
to pick it up at least from the defensive end. That was really our main focus
when our shots weren't falling.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You obviously accomplished a lot in two years. I realize this is a
disappointing conclusion. But how do you assess now what was done and what
you've got to do?  
COACH HOPKINS: I think at the end of the day you see what the best looks like,
feels like, and Carolina's got a lot. They've got great guard play, great size
and great shooting. They're physical. They're big. And you saw what it felt
like.  
  
Sometimes our best offense is a smaller team. And you see the size that you've
got to have to get to be a top-level program. And that's our goal. That's our
standard. That's what we're going to try to do.  
  
And I learned a lot tonight. I think it was great for everybody. We always say
it doesn't matter, get better, DMGB. At the end of the day we're frustrated we
lost but really proud of the guys winning 29 games, winning the Pac-12
outright by three games, and played some really tough competition. Got into
the tournament, which was a major goal for this program. And to win a game.  
  
Unfortunately we didn't play our best tonight but that had a lot to do with
North Carolina. And the younger guys got some minutes and they got a chance to
feel what this is all about. And that's, I think, the greatest thing that
could happen for our program as we build forward, is to feel it, see it and
experience it, because that's a feeling playing in this tournament like no
other in this sport. And it's what you want every year. So to be able to
experience it with the young guys as well as what the seniors have
accomplished, I'm really, really proud.  
  
Q. What's the biggest positive you can take out of this experience with
the whole tournament and everything?  
COACH HOPKINS: The positive is for -- we're trying to build a program, and
when you're building a program, you've got to -- you get a lot through
experience. And to be able to win a game and to feel it, sometimes, you know,
you walk out on that court, on that stage, it's pretty big. I've seen it a
lot. But our guys haven't.  
  
And it's a pretty cool thing. And I've learned so many things. But the most
important was for our guys to understand that what it takes to get to this
level. And then what it's going to take to win a national championship. And
there's nothing like experience. And this experience is definitely going to
elevate and push us forward.  
  
Q. Noah was particularly impressed by how Carolina handled your guys'
zone. What did you see out there in terms of their execution. And how much do
you think them seeing it against Syracuse --  
COACH HOPKINS: I think the biggest thing is our zone is active; it's been
great all year. And I think the biggest thing is, when you're talking about
like size, you talk about Syracuse at 6'6", 6'6" at the guards and 7'1", and
guys holding hands from sideline to sideline.  
  
And that's why I give our guys a lot of credit when we have Dickerson in the
game, Noah, he's 6'6", 6'7". And you've got Jaylen at 6'3" in the back line.
It can be disruptive.  
  
We still had 12 takeaways, which was really good. But the rebounding aspect of
it was just a little bit too overwhelming. And you've got to pick your poison.
You can't defend everything.  
  
And so when they started making those 3s with Coby White, and then they kind
of spaced, pushed us out a little bit. And then when they got inside, you
know, those guys are pretty darned good.  
  
It's just one of those nights. Listen, they're one of the best teams in the
country. We got to experience it. We didn't have our best game. I thought at
the beginning of the second half we hit the 3 to cut it to five, and we didn't
get back. And that's what they're known for, is their transition; they hit a
3.  
  
So every time we kind of swung and hit them a little bit, they came back with
a haymaker, but a great learning experience for our guys.  
  
Q. You mentioned when they got it inside, just talk a little bit about
Little and Maye, 20 points each, and most of it was just getting it right
there in the lane and being able to do something with it.  
COACH HOPKINS: You know what, they remind me of Gonzaga a lot. They have
really good big guys that are great interior passers and guys that can operate
in that high post area. And it's a hard cover for us. It's a hard matchup.  
  
And I thought they got us everywhere. They got us in the high post. They got
us on the 3. They got to the foul line. And, unfortunately, I thought we got
some good looks. We just had one of those shooting nights: when you play
against a team like this, almost everything has to go right; you don't have a
large margin for error. And we just didn't have enough.  
  
Q. Their transition after made baskets was, I guess, borderline
astonishing. I'm sure you talked all about it yesterday. Why is that so hard
to coach against?  
COACH HOPKINS: You know, like I said before, the great thing about experience,
we played Kansas last year who runs pretty good, not like this. Played
Gonzaga, who I think really pushes the ball. It's just one of those things.  
  
We had Noah playing the forward. So it was a little bit different. So we were
going inside to him and Hameir is playing the center. One was a defensive
breakdown, the first play of the second half, or the second play, he ran down
the middle and Noah had (indiscernible) foul, they just sprinted down and we
didn't recognize and helped the guy who had fell.  
  
But it was something that we emphasized going in, when you play Carolina, it's
very simple: transition defense and defensive rebound. And we did a decent --
the fastbreak points are off here, because it was four at halftime and they
hit the 3. And then Coby went all the way for a layup. So there was more
opportunities. But that's what they do. And we just didn't do a great job in
those two areas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Tennessee - 83, Iowa - 77 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee student-athletes Grant Williams and
Admiral Schofield as well as head coach Rick Barnes. Questions for the
student-athletes first?  
  
Q. Admiral, can you explain how you guys can look so dominant for long
stretches and then have what happened --  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Honestly, one of the things we always say is that it
doesn't have to be perfect, never has to be perfect because basketball is
never perfect. Most times that's how a game goes sometimes.  
  
You have a big run, you have stretches. The way we started the game, that's
the team we win. The way we finished the game, we can't have that. That's what
got us beat throughout the season.  
  
The team you saw in the first half is what won 31 games. We have to be
consistent in that aspect. But this time of year it's about winning, about
surviving and advancing. All I can say is, go, Vols.  
  
Q. What can you say about overtime and what you guys were able to kind
of reverse the momentum and execute the final five minutes?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: We knew we had to make plays. We knew that defensively we had
to step up because we came out halftime and we were trying to slow the pace of
the game down and that's how they like to play. And we should have just kept
going how we were going and kept the pace up, kept trying to being aggressive
and dominant.  
  
That's a learning moment. We got it done. And going into overtime, we just
said, we've done this before a lot. We kind of fought through those games. We
just knew we had to get stops and we knew what plays were we were going to go
and attack and we got it done.  
  
Q. Grant, seemed like you wanted the ball in overtime. Is that true?
What was going through your head as you walked out after the final buzzer of
regulation?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: No doubt. I definitely wanted the gall, definitely. I knew I
had to be aggressive. But I also knew my teammates were going to hit shots. At
the end of the half, I knew Lamonté was feeling it and also he was going to
get us a good shot.  
  
So I knew that putting the ball in his hands we were going to get a great
opportunity. And we did. We had multiple possessions where Monté had big shots
and he also was defending his butt off tonight commend and respect.  
  
Gotta give credit to all the guys. Kyle Alexander was phenomenal tonight, and
if anyone doesn't believe that or anything like that he was incredible. He was
on the glass, he was a presence, he was defensively there. He was doing his
job and it's all love. Hey, Coach, how is your suit? A little wet?  
  
COACH BARNES: My suit got soaked. I got soaked and when my hair gets wet it
don't look that good. (Laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Would you like to make a statement, Coach.  
  
COACH BARNES: You've got to give Iowa and Coach McCaffery and his staff --
they just got back in it. We turned it over -- when you have a lead like that
you can't turn it over the way we did. But they took advantage of it.  
  
Once it got to overtime I thought we really responded the way we needed to.
But it shouldn't have gotten to that point. But I think because it did you've
got to give all the credit to Iowa, and the fact that they took advantage of
some of our silly turnovers.  
  
But Lamonté Turner I thought was key in setting the tone of the game early. I
thought we were aggressive. Came out played the way, the first half, like we
do when we're playing our best basketball. But second half, we talked about
the first four minutes, and we didn't do what we said we wanted to do in terms
of, again, coming out setting the tone.  
  
And Grant continued to pick up some silly fouls, and Admiral and that changed
the flow of the game and his foul in the last minute and a half of the first
half was a dumb foul and that changes the game a little bit. Then he picked up
another one trying to take a charge. We just weren't a real smart team when we
had the lead.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Grant or Admiral.  
  
Q. Grant, can you describe the pass that you made at the start of
overtime that might have changed the flow of the extra period?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: I just knew they were coming with the double team. I spun
baseline and they came and the dude sunk down on JB, so I knew I had to get
the pass. And Bone was wide open. I don't know how I got it there, I don't
know how I did it. But it got there and I had made the shot.  
  
Q. One year ago, a year and a week ago, you were on the other side of
this emotion, would you describe the difference how you felt now from how you
felt a year and a week ago?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: I would say the biggest thing is we're more appreciative
for the fact that we had another opportunity to play in a game like this. And
for it to almost go similar to what it was last year, it's almost nerve-
racking for a lot of guys on our bench because it was a lot of pain for us we
worked very hard last year to get to this point.  
  
And this year we worked even harder and put ourselves in a great position to
be here. We knew we were going to get here. It didn't matter what city. We
knew we were going to be in the tournament. So to be back here and be on the
other side of it, it feels great. And we won't take that for granted but the
biggest thing we learned we can dominate. We can dominate a game and we need
to do that for 40 minutes. We didn't do it tonight and we have to be
consistent.  
  
GRANT WILLIAMS: I feel like a fifth grader who just ate Skittles. Just want to
say that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Can you play better than you did in the first half?  
  
GRANT WILLIAMS: We definitely can. We had a lot of breakdowns in the first
half. That shouldn't have happened. We had some offensive possessions where we
turned the ball over. Those are possessions we can't have. But we definitely
have the talent to play better in the first half than that first half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Go celebrate. Welcome to the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. The final play of regulation, is that what you wanted with Jordan
Bone in the corner for three?  
COACH BARNES: No, we wanted the ball to Lamonté. They jumped into a zone. We
were going to go with a high-ball screen with Grant, and they jumped in a
zone. We, again, we were waiting for it to get down.  
  
But we had success just getting the ball to the middle of the zone. But now,
in that situation, players have to react as quickly as they can. But we were
really putting the ball in Lamonté's hand and see what he could create. But
they went 3-2 zone. And we should have, again, on that roll I still think
Grant was there but it was hard for three guys out there see it.  
  
I thought Kyle was terrific today. It was really interesting throughout the
game and our bench where we were wanting to sub, and at the end of the game
Admiral kept saying, you have to leave Kyle in; don't put me in; leave Kyle in
because they felt like he could do what he needed to do.  
  
And he did some -- he and Lamonté -- Lamonté's defense was huge. He set the
tone for us early. But I tell these guys all the time, you know, your defense
gets you the lead and your offense keeps it. And you can't turn the ball the
way we did to come out in the second half. It's just sloppy.  
  
But you know what? You sit back there longer than you normally do this time of
year, but couple of calls that were tough calls. But Fran did a great job. We
knew that once foul trouble -- they were trying to put fouls on Grant and
Admiral, and we were trying to do the same thing on the other end.  
  
And Lamonté was really dialed in and his conversation throughout the game with
his teammates was fabulous. It really was. And when we came out the start of
the overtime, we just said, hey, we're starting over. We're going to go get
aggressive.  
  
And we got back on our heels where we just -- when you turn it over like that
and you give teams those opportunities, you know, it's going to put you back
on your heels. Some of the ways we turned that ball over, it just baffles you
sometimes.  
  
But, again, you've got to give -- Fran's a terrific coach and his staff. They
do a great job. But I thought the biggest key was what Lamonté did with
Bohannon. I thought that was the biggest key in the game. He was hounding him,
harassing him the whole time.  
  
Q. Schofield took a 3 near the end of regulation that looked like a two
for one tactic?  
COACH BARNES: No, it was supposed to go inside. He was so wide open it was
hard to turn down. We knew they were starting to double Grant Williams and
when we have the small lineup, we run that little set; it's an offset where
they can't double with the post. If it comes into the post that means one of
the wings or guards have to come in and double because they can't get down
there. But he was so wide open.  
  
Q. A lot of us interpreted that as two-for-one like an NBA two-for-one.
Was that true or not?  
COACH BARNES: First half we were trying to do it for certain. But I don't
remember how much time was on the clock.  
  
Q. About 45 seconds.  
COACH BARNES: Again, we ran it right away to score. We weren't coming out to
try to hold it, but again the ball was supposed to go inside.  
  
Q. You took him out right after that and he didn't play in the overtime.
Why?  
COACH BARNES: He didn't want to play. He kept saying leave Kyle in the game.
Kyle is important. With four fouls, he knew they would come right at him. He
said, Coach, I can't guard the way I can guard. I'm going to foul. So you have
to leave Kyle in. That was his decision. He said, leave Kyle in the game.  
  
Q. What went through your head at that point? Did you not question his
own judgment?  
COACH BARNES: No, because again Kyle was effective. Kyle wanted to play. And
Kyle did a lot of great things today. But the other shot was a tough shot, the
one he had on the baseline where I think he shot an air ball, that was a bad
shot. There was no reason to shoot that.  
  
But the fact is, we knew they were going to keep trying to punch it inside.
And they ran a little, what we call lollypop action where they were getting us
deep in there. But after that Kyle tried to do a little bit better job
fronting when he was that deep.  
  
But, again, that's where I thought the guys were really locked in. They've
been together a lot. They were talking during the timeout. And we actually at
one time put Admiral back in the game in regulation. But he said, "Coach,
leave Kyle in the game. We have to have him to rebound the ball for us."  
  
And I think you realize that the players, they have a feel better than
probably anybody in the building. And he felt like that was the best thing.  
  
And Lamonté Turner kept saying the same thing, too, we've got to have Kyle in
the game. Normally in those situations we go with a small lineup because it's
a pretty efficient lineup. But I trust my players. I do. And for the fact that
they felt he needed to be in the game, you know, we went with it.  
  
Q. I saw that Admiral was standing up next to you, looked like he was
almost taking coaching stance, even with being in foul trouble. How does that
affect your team knowing that he's still helping and doing well, doing things
for the team even though he can't be on the floor?  
COACH BARNES: Well, it helps. He's into the game. He's a competitor. He's been
here longer than anyone. He and Kyle. It was great to see it happen today. I
thought it was great no selfishness on his part. He's been with this guy
forever, Kyle Alexander, he's watched him grow up from a little baby giraffe
to where he is today, where he used to wobble down the floor. And it's amazing
when you think how far he's come.  
  
But the fact that he felt -- again, he and Lamonté, those guys were adamant:
Kyle's gotta be in this game; he's got to be in this game.  
  
And so, again, I think it's their team and I know how hard they've worked. And
if they felt that strongly about it, we could go up a possession or two and
see what happens. And at that point in time we had made up our mind we were
going to really play through Lamonté and Grant. We were going to let those
guys, we were going to play through those two guys.  
  
Q. Was anything special said before overtime, any special thing? And
Jordan Bone, who missed the last shot against Loyola last year, missed the
shot at the end of regulation, but he made the one at the start of overtime.
How big a shot was that? And did you want to get him involved in overtime?  
COACH BARNES: He can shoot the ball. There's no doubt about it. And Grant, I
don't know how he got that pass to him, because I saw where he swung baseline.
But those are the kind of 3s we want to take once we go inside/out with it.
The ones I don't like, and we actually did that a couple times in the first
half, where the emotion of the game, the way we were shooting it, but we took
three 3s in the first half we shouldn't have taken where emotion got the best
of us.  
  
But when -- Bone's over there, he and Lamonté and Bowden, we expect them to
shoot -- actually Bowden turned down one in the first half when we came out of
a timeout, said we've got to play inside/out, and Lamonté drove it really well
from the right side and Bowden shot faked and drove it. And I can't remember
what happened. But I know he should have shot that one.  
  
Q. Talk about how far your players have come, how far has this program
come since you've been here?  
COACH BARNES: Well, you think about it, Admiral Schofield, Lamonté Turner --
well Lamonté wasn't on that team; he was redshirting -- but Admiral and Kyle
and our two walk-ons who have been a big part of our team, Lucas Campbell and
Brad Woodson -- and those guys lost 19 games, I think, four years ago -- and I
think the year after that, 15.  
  
And we came back after that, what was Grant's freshman year and their
sophomore year, and had the hardest spring we've ever had in probably my last
20-some years as a coach. We put them on the track, because I told them, you
guys have no idea what it's like to play, because we had not made the NCAA
Tournament -- we didn't make any tournament.  
  
And I said we're going to be a team that plays into March, there's three more
weeks of basketball. So I said for the next three weeks we're going to get on
the track and let you know this is how long the season should be.  
  
And they didn't like it. But they embraced it. And then last year when we got
where we were, they actually said they thought that was the turning point in
our program. So the end of last year, when we lost, a tough loss to Loyola, I
went back and reminded those guys, you guys said that that was the best thing
we did, so do we need to do it again.  
  
They said, let us take care of it. They really did. For the next two weeks,
last year, you would have thought they were still preparing to play three
weeks. They're a close group of guys. And they have worked hard. And I'm happy
for them.  
  
And you could tell the other day against Colgate, the first meeting we had
with them, after last year, we said to them, we don't get to pick up where we
left off a year ago. We're going to have to earn our way back there. But you
ask them to a man, they would tell you that -- and we talked about it after
the game against Colgate -- and that's what they wanted to do was to get back
there see if they could go further.  
  
So that's been on their mind. And they wanted to do that. And I thought that
they carried a little extra stress because of that. And then we came up here
and all I talked to them about was we've got to win a tournament, between us,
Colgate and Purdue and Cincinnati. And I wasn't real happy that Cincinnati
(indiscernible), we'd be playing in their backyard and we're right here in the
middle of Big Ten country.  
  
But we've been a good road team. And these guys found a way to get it done.
And the credit really does go to them. They worked really hard. And it hasn't
been easy because as a program we work but they've embraced that. And I'm
happy for them and mad that they just soaked me when I walked into the locker
room. They got me good. They got me really good. But if it makes them happy, I
can deal with it, you know.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:

### [Roy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14130)

### [Luke Maye](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33294)

### [Garrison Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37064)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina student-athletes Luke Maye and
Garrison Brooks as well as head coach Roy Williams. Questions for the student-
athletes?  
  
Q. Luke, just talk about how the game's becoming more inside as you go
further into the tournament. And also, Noah was here earlier and said you guys
have a little bit of history, that maybe you can share a little background
with that as well.  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah, we're going to try to play the same way we've played all
year. But it starts inside first. And myself and Garrison need to do our job
on the glass and also making the shots inside that we can make.  
  
And I think the biggest thing for us is to continue to play our game and play
how Coach wants us to play, and that's just doing our jobs and making it
easier on the guards.  
  
And with Noah, we played against each other at a lot of camps and he played on
a similar AAU circuit as I did. So we've played against each other a good
amount. And he's always been a good friend. And I've enjoyed playing against
him and I'm going to enjoy playing against him tomorrow.  
  
Q. You guys are a No. 1 seed, considered one of the favorites in the
tournament. But most of the year, nationally, you've been overshadowed by Duke
and Zion and all that stuff. How do you think that's affected you? Has it
bothered you? Has it helped you in a way?  
GARRISON BROOKS: I feel like it's helped us a little bit. Gave us a little bit
of motivation. It's fine that people overlook us and, like, the national
scene, it's fine. But we just continue to work and get better every day.  
  
LUKE MAYE: I'd second that. I think the biggest thing for us is focusing on
ourselves and making sure that we do what we can do on the court to put us in
the right position to where we are now and get a No. 1 seed.  
  
And at the end of the day everybody's going to play and everybody's going to
have their opinions on games and on players. And I think we're just trying to
do our best to get the right image in people's minds.  
  
Q. Luke, that would logically make sense, would it not, that you have to
have a certain pride in the ACC to have the three No. 1 seeds. It's good for
everybody.  
LUKE MAYE: Yes it's the best basketball conference and I would take that up
with anybody.  
  
Q. What kind of adjustment do you see, Garrison, when you do play a team
that obviously you're not familiar with? Is it going to be advantageous that
you've played Syracuse a couple times during the course of the year and know
that Mike Hopkins has taken a lot of those basketball practices out to
Washington?  
GARRISON BROOKS: I think it helps. It benefits us. We've seen it before. I
think we've seen pretty much everything we need to see this season. I think we
just do what we normally do, just play our game.  
  
Q. Is there always the adjustment of seeing a team on tape that you're
not familiar with, thinking you've got it? And then you went through it a
little bit yesterday in the first half, and then you see them in person and
the reality hits?  
GARRISON BROOKS: Yeah, it's different. Film doesn't do some people justice.  
  
Q. Luke, it's been established, you have a history with Noah a little
bit. He was an all-conference player two years ago and didn't make it this
year because I think everyone figured out they have to double him or they're
going to be in trouble. Just as a one-on-one matchup, what's it like dealing
with him in the post?  
LUKE MAYE: Yeah, he's a great player. He's always been able to use his body
really well, be able to finish over people. And for somebody who plays the 5
spot at right around 6'8", some people list him at 6'9", but I think he's
pretty similar size as me, maybe a little taller.  
  
And I think he does a good job finding his areas and finding his angles, and
he's a great scorer in the post. And we're going to do our best to slow him
down and make sure that we have a body in front of him and the basket every
single play.  
  
But everybody at this stage is going to be really good in respect to their
leagues. Everybody has a lot of accolades, and we're just trying to win a team
game, and that's what we're going to try to do tomorrow.  
  
Q. Garrison, is there a comfort level with the officiating during the
regular season because you generally get three guys that you know, and then
you come into the tournament and you're really not sure of these three guys,
maybe one, and how they're going to call a particular game?  
GARRISON BROOKS: I'm pretty sure every referee is different. So you have to
really adjust to the style that they're going to blow the whistle for pretty
much every call.  
  
Q. Do you know five minutes in what it's going to be like or does it
change?  
GARRISON BROOKS: You can pretty much tell from the jump, you can tell by the
first foul, tell basically by the first rebound, basically, that's how I feel.  
  
Q. What is the most annoying aspect of playing against a Syracuse
zone?  
LUKE MAYE: I'll go first. I think the biggest thing is how active the top two
defenders are. I think one of their players is leading the country in steals
and does a great job. I think it's Thybulle does a great job of getting in the
passing lanes. We have to make sure that we make good fakes and get it into
the middle of the zone and try our best to attack.  
  
And I think playing against Syracuse has helped us. And it will help us moving
forward. But then again every team's different. Every team has their strengths
and we've got to find our strengths against a good team like Washington.  
  
GARRISON BROOKS: I'll agree with Luke, like the top two guys they're really
active. It makes it tough on, like, the whole team.  
  
Q. Luke, is there additional pressure on you guys as a team because
you've got Carolina on your jersey?  
LUKE MAYE: I think it's definitely -- playing against any team they're going
to bring their best shot, especially in the NCAA Tournament. And I think going
off of what happened last year, I think we're going to come out with a little
bit extra motivation and making sure that we play our best basketball.  
  
And we struggled a little bit the first half yesterday. And we can't have that
let-down tomorrow. And we've just gotta do our best to make sure we come out
the right way and gotta punch them in the mouth early.  
  
Q. Was the adjustment at halftime yesterday more technical or
emotional?  
LUKE MAYE: I think it would be more emotional. Coach got on us about playing a
little bit harder, playing with more passion. He felt like we missed some
shots we usually make. And they made some shots. And I think just playing
harder and playing with more aggression would benefit us the second half. And
we made some more shots. And kind of affected them, which was big for us.  
  
Q. I'm only asking this because the Washington players said their coach
was crazy. Is there any part of Coach Williams that you find to be crazy?  
LUKE MAYE: I think I could probably speak on it a little more than Garrison
just because I've been around four years and I've had a lot of experiences
with different attitude changes, different mood swings. And I think the
biggest thing for us is that Coach gets on us, and Coach really wants to push
us in different ways, whether it be yelling or kind of aggression.  
  
But I think he knows it that -- he knows that we know that he cares about us.
And he wants us to realize how much he wants us to succeed. And that's the
biggest thing that Coach tries to imply every single day. And no matter how
hard he's on you or how mad he gets, you understand that because he shows you
every single day. And that's been big for my growth and development.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach Williams joins us and we're ready for your
questions.  
  
Q. You guys have had some really good success over the years against
Syracuse and that zone, and Mike's going to play pretty much the same kind of
defense. What has made you guys so successful at attacking that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'll give you a better answer after the game if we're
successful against Mike's. It's a little different, but the basis the same.
They're long, athletic, quick to the ball. They're aggressive. They'll
probably double team in the corner maybe more than Jimmy's teams have done in
the last couple of years.  
  
But for us we try to get the shot that we want, not just the shot that they
want us to take. And so for us it's got to be a balance. We want to get the
ball inside and attack the basket area and shoot open 3s, but not just be
content to just pass the ball around the perimeter and do what they want us to
do.  
  
But the good news is that we have played Syracuse, because it would be hard to
get ready for this type of defense with just half a practice, which is what
we're going to have today. But at the same time, some other teams have played
the zone, and guys played some zone against us yesterday and we didn't handle
it very well in the first half, particularly.  
  
But it is, with their length, they take away your open shots, because they can
-- football terminology, they can close on you, like they talk about defensive
backs, you think you're open and they can close. I can go all the way back to
2003, the national championship game, my last game at Kansas. We have what we
think is a wide-open 3 to tie the game, and Hakim Warrick came out of nowhere
and blocked the shot.  
  
You have to understand that, that they have athleticism and can really cover
ground and they want to get there. They want to bother your shot. But we've
got to try to get the shot we want.  
  
Q. I can remember back to your Kansas team in '93 and when you talk
about length, it seems like every team now has seven or eight of those guys
you describe with length. And when you go back to earlier in your head
coaching career, if a team had one, it was a story, wasn't it?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, but these guys, they're 6'7" up to 6'11", and they do
have the length and athleticism to cover to a lot of ground.  
  
Q. You've been asked this many times this year, but you're a No. 1 seed,
no one's overlooking you. But you've been overshadowed to some degree by Duke
and Zion Williamson. How does that affect you negatively or positively this
year?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Me, it hasn't affected me at all. I'm serious, not one iota.
This doesn't bother me. It doesn't bother me. It doesn't make me happy or
anything. I just don't think about it.  
  
But I think Zion, the attention that he's gotten, he's deserved. He's stood up
to all the accolades that he got before. And we tried to recruit him as hard
as I've ever recruited anybody. I thought he was a unique young man. There
wasn't anybody like him.  
  
I've been married 46 years, my wife's been to a lot of high school games over
the years. I took her to a game when we saw Zion one night. We left, we were
in the car and she didn't say anything, didn't say anything. I said, what do
you think? She said, I don't think I've ever seen anything like that.  
  
That's pretty perceptive. And you watch the games, and that's what you say,
man, I haven't seen anything like that. I think he's that blend of power,
explosiveness, athleticism and competitiveness that I haven't seen maybe ever.
So that part doesn't bother me. He deserves what he gets.  
  
When we win, we get good publicity. If somebody else beats us, we don't. And
gotta get ready for the next game. But I haven't really cared about it.  
  
Q. It's been a while since you encountered Washington in the finals and
lots of things have changed. But I wondered what you remember about that 2011
game in Charlotte, where I guess you woke up sick that morning and got a
little sicker as the game was going on?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I remember they were very, very good. We were lucky to win the
game. We have a 3-point lead and John Henson, standing under the basket jumped
up and sort of caught the ball -- it was definitely going to be short; so it
should not have been called goaltending.  
  
But I about had a heart attack because we had a three-point lead. I said,
John, why would you do that? He said, Coach, he was inside. It was just going
to be two.  
  
I said, how do you know that? That kind of thing. That's what I remember the
most about at the end of the game. We got a great deflection, they had the
ball out of bounds. I think with just for us, a one- or two-point lead, and
John was able to get his hand on the ball in front of the ball and deflect it.
We came up with it and scored again on the other end.  
  
But Lorenzo was coaching, I believe, at that time. Isaiah, I think, was there.
They had some good players. And I remember getting in the locker room thinking
that we just beat a very, very, very good team, and we were lucky to win.  
  
Q. I'm not sure how well you know Mike Hopkins, so there might not be a
lot in there, but I'll give it a shot. He's a different guy. Yesterday he was
trying to decide which candy he wanted on the scorer's table and played "eeny,
meeny, miny, moe." He tackles players in the middle of practice, starts doing
push-ups, all that kind of stuff. I'm just wondering if there's anything that
you've come across where, that's a different guy. He's not like the other
coaches.  
COACH WILLIAMS: What the crap do you think people say about me? I spit in
rivers. Mike and I are twins. That's what the hell it is. (Laughter).  
  
I've never gone "eeny, meeny, miny, moe" with the candy on the side of the
table, but I've got two different kinds in the locker room.  
  
I really think he's a good guy, a really good coach. I'm old enough to
remember when he played. I think he was so loyal to Jimmy and great to Jimmy
Boeheim for a long time and Jimmy was loyal to him. The teams they had at
Syracuse, they beat one of my teams in the 2003 National Championship game.  
  
So I've known Mike for a long time. Two or three years ago, whenever it was,
that Jimmy sat out those nine games and Mike was in charge of the team, and it
didn't go as well. I don't know what it was -- it was 4-5, 5-4, 6-3, whatever
it was, but it wasn't very pleasant.  
  
And the first game that they played when Jimmy came back was against us at
their place. And I remember grabbing Mike before the game and saying, hey, I
know that hadn't been the most pleasant experience but you did a great job.
It's a hard job. It's unusual circumstances. Just put it behind you and one of
these days it will be a very small blip on what you're doing. And I don't know
if he remembers that, but it was very comfortable for me to say that to him.  
  
And I think he's one of the good guys. Now, I've not -- in the old days I
would do crazy stuff but I've stepped down and done pushups on the floor. So
what you're describing isn't unique, that sounds normal to me. That's all I've
got. (Laughter).  
  
Q. We've got to find some storylines here, so we've got to nitpick a
little bit. 3-3 in the second round last six years. Anything to that? Has it
just been matchups that have been stumbling blocks, or what do you read into
it?  
COACH WILLIAMS: 99 percent of the coaches in the world would take that.
Seriously. 3-3 in the second round. Hell, a lot of guys are sitting at home
getting ready for their golf game.  
  
But probably -- let's see, Texas A&M last year was really a bad matchup for
us. Year before that we were okay. We were 6-0. There wasn't nobody else 6-0.
And so I'll take 3-3 all the time if you'll make two of those three years go
to play for the national championship game. So that would be the one I'd have
the best answer for you.  
  
Frankly, my dear... (laughter).  
  
I didn't mean to shut the crowd up. I was being nice. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Sterling Manley, talked to him yesterday. And have you had it in your
career where, a situation like that where a player has been playing enough and
then gets hurt and you have to sit him down because the rotation that you have
has been so good? How has he kind of been receptive to that?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know. But I've been a head coach for 31 years. So I'm
sure I've had some things like it. But it depends. Before he got hurt, he was
playing 11 or 12 minutes. But Garrison was in front of him. And Sterling was
doing some things that were good for us or he wouldn't have been playing 11,
12 minutes a game. But he got hurt for a long time.  
  
And now coming back, my job -- to be honest, if we don't win, I get fired. So
my job is to win. And the group that we have, got a pretty good rotation set.
We won 15 out of 16 or 16 out of 18, something like that.  
  
So if it ain't broke, don't fix it kind of thing. But I'm sure that I've had
some guys that I was able to get back into the rotation. But it's where they
started. If a guy starts and beat everybody else out, then you've got to try
to give him a chance to do that, too. But I'm trying to think Jacque Vaughn,
at Kansas, he broke his wrist, missed the first nine games.  
  
When he started playing, you know what he did, he started because that's what
he deserved over time. So I don't think there's been an exact situation like
that.  
  
But Leaky was playing a certain number of minutes, too, and not playing as
many now as he was at that time. But none of those kids want to get hurt. And
I understand that. And they want to play more. But every kid wants to play 60
minutes in a 40-minute game and take 60 shots. And I understand that. But
Sterling's handled it well, and he's practiced better now than he was before
he got hurt. And so I like that. But his life in basketball is not going to be
over tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa student-athletes Joe Wieskamp, Jordan
Bohannon and Luka Garza as well as head coach Fran McCaffery. Questions for
the student-athletes first?  
  
Q. Jordan, just in the second half there, we talked yesterday about the
shooting. To have that out of the gate, how important is that against a team
like Tennessee?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: It's going to be really important, especially how they play.
They're a team, unique style that they play, really run the court. So we're
going to be ready for that.  
  
But for us to get going, we're going to need to make our shots and start the
game. I think that was big for Cincinnati to start their game last night
against us. We weren't hitting shots. They got up on a big run, and it really
took everything within us to get back into that game.  
  
So it will make the game a lot easier if we're able to get out there right
from the start and hit some shots, for sure.  
  
Q. Jordan, you said Tennessee plays a unique style. What about it is
unique? What makes them different?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: They definitely have a lot of NBA players potentially on
their team. That's definitely unique within its own right. And playing an SEC
team, I don't think we've played an SEC team yet since we've been here. So
we've just got to -- they know it's a tough conference to play in just as well
as the Big Ten.  
  
They've been battling all year around as well as we have. We know it's going
to be a physical game. They play a physical kind of basketball like we do. So
it's going to be a lot of fun tomorrow. We're looking forward to it.  
  
Q. Joe, is it harder or easier in your mind to prepare for a team when
you don't have as much time to prepare as you did for Game 1?  
JOE WIESKAMP: I think it's a little bit harder, obviously, but I think our
coaching staff has done a great job getting us prepared for this. In the Big
Ten season, towards the end of the year, each team has each other figured out.
They have each other locked in, the personnel. So it's a little harder at the
end of the Big Ten season. It will be nice to play another team from a
different conference.  
  
Q. Luka, that kind of struck me what Jordan said about not playing an
SEC team. Does it make a difference for something you're familiar with, or do
you like the challenge of seeing totally new systems?  
LUKA GARZA: I don't know. I think both teams in both leagues have very hard
schedules. And each game in the SEC is a battle as well as the Big Ten. So I
think both teams are really well prepared for this in terms of all the battles
we've been through throughout the course of the season.  
  
And like Joe says, it's nice to play teams from other conferences because at
this point the Big Ten knows each other so well; they know what your
tendencies are even more so than a new team could pick up so quickly.  
  
Q. Joe, you just talked about the battles. You've had some -- a couple
weekends now in tournament play. They have as well. What do you expect the
battle to be like tomorrow with the Sweet 16 on the line?  
JOE WIESKAMP: They're obviously a very strong team, were ranked No. 1 in the
country at one point. This is what you sign up for when you sign up to play
Division I basketball. This is the type of team you want to play. We're
excited for the test.  
  
Q. Luka, you're going against another physical opponent, the inside-out
game. How in the past, when you go against physical teams, how does that open
up things for you guys?  
LUKA GARZA: I think I'm a player who just kind of sees what the defense is
giving me. When they're really aggressive on my post-ups, I tend to go a
little bit more outside, try to open it up.  
  
I'm going to do my best to try to create some space on the floor for other
guys to drive and different stuff like that. So I'm just going to take what
the defense gives me, and I think that's what our whole offense does,
everybody, they just take what the defense gives us.  
  
Q. Luka, your impressions of Kyle Alexander, from what you've been able
to see. And I guess how important it would be, he's a guy who has had foul
trouble at times, to try to get him some early fouls?  
LUKA GARZA: Yeah, they're a different team when he's not on the court. You can
see that when you watch some of their games. He's really athletic, long, can
really affect shots around the rim.  
  
And when we go into games, we have a goal to get their bigs in foul trouble. I
think that remains the same with him and Williams this game.  
  
Q. Jordan, have you been taken by the Big Ten's success, or is that
something you expect as you headed into the tournament?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: I think we all expected it, every single player in the Big
Ten. We went through the battle on a night-to-night basis these past few
months. For us to go a 20-game schedule, it made it even more difficult.  
  
So we're not surprised at all that Big Ten started 7-1. I thought we've had
really good matchups with teams, and quite honestly I wasn't surprised that
any team won, obviously. But, I think, looking forward, I see more teams
advancing in this tournament. I wouldn't be surprised if we get the same
amount into the Sweet 16 as well.  
  
Q. You mentioned matchups I always think that's interesting as you
approach a game. Are there teams that you think specifically you match up
better because of what they do or don't do?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: I mean, obviously it's difficult in the NCAA Tournament
because you only have a couple days to prepare. But you look at it, it all
comes down to matchups in most games. And that's the beauty of the NCAA
Tournament; you don't have time to prepare for it, but you've got to take
what's there during the game, and you've got to realize what matchups happen.
And that's something you have to definitely take advantage of.  
  
Q. Jordan, Tennessee has given up 15 3s to each of their last two
opponents. As a guy that can kind of get it going, does that excite you? And
how do you avoid falling into the trap of getting trigger happy against
them?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: Yeah, obviously I love shooting 3s. Every time I step on the
floor, I'm trying to shoot as much as I can. So, I'm looking forward to
tomorrow. Hopefully I can get a lot of 3s off. And Joe is looking forward to
it as well, and Luka is, too. That's the beauty of our team.  
  
We have a lot of shooters on this team. A lot of times we have five shooters
out there. So it's really difficult for teams to play us. Luka can go
inside/out. And Tyler is one of the most dominant inside players in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
We have a really tough team to guard. But we also know what we're capable of
on defense as well. So it's going to come down to getting stops in important
times tomorrow.  
  
Q. Joe, is there something you've seen from Tennessee as to why they've
given up so many seemingly good looks from the perimeter lately?  
JOE WIESKAMP: Not necessarily. Obviously we haven't had a whole lot of time to
prepare for them. We'll probably be watching a lot of film of them today and
kind of figure those things out, see where we can attack them offensively. And
our coaches will give us a game plan of how to attack that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach McCaffery is joining us.  
  
Q. Coach, how difficult is it to get enough sleep during a time like
this with a short turnaround?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: You're not going to get a lot of sleep, but you've got to get
some because you've got to be fresh. You just jump from one game to the next.
Obviously the assistant coach responsible for that team has been studying them
for quite some time.  
  
So we just, we were up late last night, but got a little bit of sleep, back up
this morning, had a meeting, breakfast. And then came over here and had a live
practice which is good, get up and down, get a little sweat going. Have a few
more meetings and then get ready to play.  
  
Q. As you look at Tennessee, how much of a difference do you think Kyle
Alexander makes for them when he's able to be on the floor and able to stay
out of foul trouble?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: They have great versatility. And obviously he provides
something different with his length and his size. But they can also downshift
and go small, and put some big-time weapons out there offensively.  
  
We look at matchups, in particular. I think that's maybe what you're also
thinking about when you look at our big guys versus their big guys. Here's a
6'11" guy with length and the ability to defend our scoring post players.  
  
But, you know, it will be a constant situation where we're both pushing
different buttons with different lineups and looking for different things.  
  
Q. When you come off a half shooting 65 percent like you did in the
second, having another game two days later on that short rest, does it make it
easier to kind of ride the confidence for your shooters?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I hope so. We've had an interesting season in that respect.
There's times when our offense has really been clicking. And there's times
when we've been off. Last game we played before yesterday, we shot 1-for-16
from 3. And then yesterday we make 11.  
  
I look at our team and say, we've got good 3-point shooters. But I think you
have to be able to establish that you can throw it inside and score; drive and
kick; drive and finish; drive, get to the free throw line; throw it inside,
get to the free throw line. Over the course of your entire body of work, you
have to do all those things.  
  
To beat a team that's won 30 games, you better be able to do all those things
or attempt to do all those things to beat them.  
  
Q. Tennessee has allowed 15 3s each of the last two games. As a coach
how do you balance taking advantage of that while also trying to avoid guys
settling for too many shots?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think that's something you probably deal with every game.
Especially when you have multiple 3-point shooters like we do. At what point
do you settle? At what point do you work the ball?  
  
And you're hoping every game that your guys truly understand the difference as
it relates to time and score. What defense are they?  
  
I think Colgate's a team that probably shoots a lot of 3s anyway. So are we.
But we also have won a number of games where we just hammer that thing inside.
So we just hope that our guys make the proper decisions, and you want them to
be confident.  
  
Q. Jordan said that he feels like Tennessee is different stylistically
than any team you've faced this year. Do you agree with that? And how have all
the teams you've faced this year prepared you to face them?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, I think in the Big Ten every team has a great coach.
Every team has really talented players, three or four of whom expect to play
in the NBA. I would say the same for the SEC.  
  
So the difference, I think, when you look at Tennessee, they've got tremendous
team speed. They're quick. But they also can throw the ball inside. They also
have 3-point shooting. That's why they have the record that they have.  
  
But we feel like, when you look at Michigan State versus Maryland, versus Penn
State, versus Nebraska, when you go right on through our league, what it does
is prepare you for different styles. Some teams play man. Some teams mix it a
little bit more. Some teams are a little more deliberate. Some teams play
faster.  
  
The one thing about Tennessee is they can go either way. They can go fast --
you look at the Auburn game and, the championship game. And that was as up and
down and athletic a game as I've seen in a long time. But they can also play
half court. They've got a great coach. And they've got intelligent players
that share the ball.  
  
I think it's one of the things that's impressed me the most about them, they
have really good players with big reputations, but everybody seems to put
winning above everything else and move the ball. And that's why they're still
playing.  
  
Q. I know this is an old story for people that follow you every day but
for those of us who are new to Iowa, how do you deal with a player who is
playing another varsity sport at the same time?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: It's a little bit different because it's my son. And
obviously you're hoping that he can maximize his opportunity. You would want
the same for anybody else. Coach Heller and I have an agreement that we're
going to work together and do what makes sense.  
  
So we had a window of time after the Big Ten Tournament ended where he could
play in some games, which he did and did really well. And then we had it set
up -- had we lost yesterday he'd be playing today in a doubleheader at
Indiana.  
  
Is it too much? I don't think so. It's what he's always done. He's always gone
from one sport to the other. He's thrilled to have the opportunity to play for
our baseball team. Has tremendous respect for Coach Heller and his teammates.
He grew up playing baseball with a good number of those guys; either played
with them or against them.  
  
And I think as long as we can manage it, while at the same time managing the
academic side of it, he's Academic All-Big Ten, so he's tailing that part of
it, we'll keep doing it that way.  
  
Q. Brings up one of the quandaries that parents have as their kids grow
up. And so many times you'll have even high school coaches that want them to
specialize. I think I know what your belief is on this after that answer. But
what do you think non-son would do as he grows up and whether he can play two,
three, four sports?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: It's interesting, because you're so right. When you look at a
lot -- a lot of high school coaches just won't allow it anymore. And when we
came to Iowa we met with the folks at Iowa City West High School to make sure
the coaches were willing to work together because we felt that this was
something that he would want to do. And it's a place where they welcome that.
And we appreciated that.  
  
And I honestly think it helps you tremendously to continuously be competing
from one sport to the other. There's nothing like having to get in that
batter's box and have to hit something coming 95 miles an hour. And I think by
the same token, Connor's got to hit a big 3 yesterday and make an inbounds
play to Luka Garza at the exact time for him to hit a 3; you're competing
under pressure. I think it develops you in so many different ways.  
  
So I encourage it. I like two-sport athletes because you know what you're
getting is a competitor.  
  
Q. Big stage is a big stage.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Exactly right.  
  
Q. You've kind of mentioned it a little bit, but between Tennessee and
yourself, two of the best teams in terms of offensive efficiency in the
nation, how comfortable are you getting into a shootout, so to speak, with the
Vols tomorrow?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: We're typically very comfortable getting into a shootout.
Obviously, as any game goes on, adjustments are required. If you feel like
you're losing a shootout at some point, I think you might have to slow it
down. I think you have to be smart enough to recognize, all right, let's work
the ball a little bit more. Let's maybe try to shoot a few less 3s and go
inside a little bit more. Let's put it on the deck and see if we can get to
the free-throw line a little bit more.  
  
Because we want to press. If you can get to the free-throw line, you can get
into your press a little bit easier.  
  
So normally I would say if the game can be in the 90s we'd be happy about
that. But sometimes you gotta be careful, especially when you're playing a
team of this caliber.  
  
Q. It's been 20 years since Iowa got to the Sweet 16. What would it mean
for the program to get past this hurdle tomorrow?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: It would be tremendous. We've come close. We all know how
hard it is. I don't care where you are. It's very difficult to put it all
together and get into the tournament, and then advance once you get here. So I
think our players all recognize the situation we're in. And we would really
love to have this experience for each other, but also for our fan base.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Washington student-athletes David Crisp and
Noah Dickerson as well as head coach Mike Hopkins. Questions for the student-
athletes?  
  
Q. As the tournament goes on, post play is often overlooked but becomes
more and more important. Can you talk about that, both as a guy in the post
and as a point guard looking for baskets, easy baskets -- although they're
actually tough -- but tough baskets, something that you can really kind of
goes at attacking the opposition?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Well, as a post player, we do get overlooked a little bit,
especially in a long tournament. But the longer the tournament goes on, the
more guys get tired. Some -- maybe jump shots are a little bit short and
things like that.  
  
But when you're a post player, being around the basket it's hard to be short.
You're right there at the basket. And so just going and attacking the basket,
shooting great field percentages. And then, look, I get double-teamed a lot,
so it's a lot easier to make open jump shots when they're out there playing
H-O-R-S-E, when they're stepping into jump shots rather than shooting
contesting ones.  
  
DAVID CRISP: For sure, to back up what he was saying, when you've got a great
post player like Noah, teams like to double-team them a lot. And he's a great
passer out of the post. Whenever teams set a double-team, he's great at
finding the open man and finding cutters.  
  
When they don't double, he puts guys in a tough position because he can score.
He's got a lot of moves down there, can finish with either hand. He's
definitely -- works to our advantage.  
  
Q. Is it really playing H-O-R-S-E, like you said?  
NOAH DICKERSON: You saw us shoot yesterday.  
  
DAVID CRISP: Definitely.  
  
Q. Noah, staying with that theme, I'm not sure how much you know about
North Carolina yet, but they are a team that leads the country in rebounding.
They get a lot of points in the paint. How do you go about trying to slow them
down and kind of stuff it in there to prevent some of those close baskets?  
NOAH DICKERSON: We play zone. And so we just play with our strength, do what
we do. Our zone is meant to stop that. We don't give up layups. We don't give
up 3s. So basically our game plan is the same thing we did every year, or I
mean all year.  
  
Q. David, this is obviously a unique time of the season. And you're
seeing teams that you haven't necessarily prepared for and you don't
necessarily know their style because you're not that familiar with them.
Familiarity with the officiating is also something that changes very much. And
obviously yesterday you had to make a big adjustment to that.  
DAVID CRISP: Yes, for sure. They called a lot of fouls that could have been
just overlooked in the season. That's just something you've got to adjust to
and just be smarter, make better decisions and just adjust to the game, but
still be aggressive, not play timid.  
  
Q. Do you try as a team to make that adjustment early to find out how
the game is going to be called and then go from there?  
DAVID CRISP: We just come out and try to play as hard as we can, stick to our
game plan, leave it all out there, give it extreme effort. And we feel -- get
a feel for how the refs are calling it. And we adjust to that.  
  
But we always go in with the same approach -- play aggressive and give a lot
of effort.  
  
Q. David and then Noah, I'm sure you guys have seen Carolina a lot on
TV. But being on the opposite side of the country, what do you know about them
outside of what may have already been done with the scouting report here in
the last couple of hours?  
DAVID CRISP: Obviously everybody knows a historically great program. Very
well-coached, they've got a great coach over there. And they've got some guys
over there with some experience, and guys who have been in this position
before and got a lot of experience.  
  
So we knew that coming in. And we know that for us to come out and have a
great shot tomorrow, we're going to have to play really together, play really
hard. A lot of effort, trust the game plan that our Coach has given us, and
just go out there and leave everything out on the line.  
  
Q. David or Noah, Noah talked about the zone defense which we've seen.
We know where Coach Hop got that from. UNC sees Syracuse's zone twice a year.
What makes your defense stand out a little bit more and makes it a little more
dangerous?  
NOAH DICKERSON: We tend to try to take away the 3 completely. We extend our
zone out so we don't give up 3s and no layups. So the way basketball's going
nowadays, people can shoot the ball from all over the place, all over the
court, very deep. And so our zone really takes into account how people are
shooting and try to take them out of the game.  
  
DAVID CRISP: I completely agree with Noah. Try to take that 3 ball away for
sure and try to limit the high post touches as best we can.  
  
Q. We've seen North Carolina in this situation year after year. What
does it mean to your program to get to this point and be in this spotlight?
David?  
DAVID CRISP: It means a lot to our program, especially how everything has been
going down over the course of our four years here. Two years ago we were 9-22,
won two games in conference, didn't make any postseason tournaments, anything.  
  
NOAH DICKERSON: Terrible.  
  
DAVID CRISP: Two years ago nobody would have expected us to be where we are
now. Just making it as far as we have has been -- it's been great.  
  
But we're still working. We still have more that we want to achieve. So we're
still hungry.  
  
NOAH DICKERSON: For sure.  
  
Q. Noah, a little bit along those lines, you've been clearly the best
team in your conference, but your conference has taken a decent amount of
criticism this year. North Carolina is North Carolina from the ACC. Is there
any element that you're playing more than just for your team but for your
conference as well?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Yeah, you know, Oregon beat us at the Pac-12 Tournament. We
were shaking hands and all (indiscernible), now we've got to go win some
games. It's for the conference.  
  
Our conference got a hit this year. People are talking bad about us. It is
what it is. And so I do think we are playing for our conference, just to show
some more respect for us. You know what I mean? I understand it's an East
Coast by as. I'm from the East Coast. It's understandable, but we do have some
hoopers over here.  
  
Q. How does a kid from the East Coast end up in the Pacific Northwest?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Man, I came out and visited during the summer. So it was
really nice out. It was really nice out. I thought it was like that year-
round. I didn't think the rain was how like they said it was. For sure. For
sure.  
  
Q. Noah, I was going to ask you about being from back East, being from
the Atlanta area. Have you had any run-ins with any of the current Carolina
players, maybe Brandon Robinson?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Yeah, Brandon Robinson played for the Georgia Stars. He wasn't
on my team. He was on one a couple years younger than me. Luke Maye, when I
was a junior, when we were in our last year of AAU, I played his team, like,
seven, eight times that whole summer, about seven or eight times.  
  
Our parents talked a lot, got pretty close. Throughout the years, I've always
been glad he's been doing his thing at North Carolina. It's been fun to watch.  
  
Q. How did you do against Luke?  
NOAH DICKERSON: I guess we'll have to see tomorrow. (Laughter).  
  
Q. What's it like when you have, again, post players that are allowed to
play in the post as hopefully you two guys are? You're not a lot of bunch of
3-point shooters, I think Luke may take a couple more than you. But basically
you guys are 10 feet and in. What is it like to have 30, 40 minutes of that
kind of basketball?  
NOAH DICKERSON: It's always fun, especially another guy who plays kind of just
like me. We've had these battles for three years now. It's tough; it's hard on
your body. But it's how I love to play the game of basketball. It's how I grew
up playing it. And that's how I'll always play it. It's fun to me. And I like
to do the dirty work.  
  
Q. What was it about Coach that made you believe that he was going to be
the right guy for the job?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Oh, he's crazy. (Laughter). He's crazy. And I've had success
at the high school level. I won two national championships. And my coach in
high school was crazy. So I realized -- (indiscernible) and he just -- he's
just a man with a plan. And he was able to show that plan and this is where we
sit now, two years later.  
  
DAVID CRISP: Same thing Noah's saying, he's crazy. And the same with Noah. My
coaches in the past, they've been crazy. First phone call I had with him, he
just told me pretty much his life story, how he grew up. Told me when he was a
kid always overlooked, always had a chip on his shoulder.  
  
And that clicked with me because that was the same way I felt growing up. Once
he told me that, we connected off of that. And he just told me his vision. And
he wasn't just telling me anything I wanted to hear; he was telling me the
truth, telling me everything he thought we could accomplish as long as the
guys bought in.  
  
So right from day one, I told him you've got me, and I believed in his plan.
Like Noah said, we're sitting here today.  
  
Q. How is he crazy? Can you explain and why he's crazy and why that is a
good thing and not a bad thing?  
NOAH DICKERSON: You all haven't seen my man drop down and give you 10 push-ups
in a press conference? Who does that? I'm not. But his energy is contagious.
He's contagious. And we feed off of it on the court.  
  
And one second he could be going crazy and next second he's the calmest person
in the room. With him you never know. You've got to be ready for anything. And
that's one of our mottos for the team.  
  
Q. Does he ever run the old game film of himself at Syracuse?  
NOAH DICKERSON: No, I saw it on Twitter one time. He looked a lot different
with hair, though. He looked a lot different with hair.  
  
DAVID CRISP: Lot different.  
  
I will give you two stories from the first-time experience with him. First
time I seen him in person, I was just -- it was springtime -- I came in, he
just got in town, about to do his press conference. They're going to
introducing him as the head coach.  
  
He sees me from the top of arena, he's in full suit. He said, is that DC? He
sprints down the stairs, runs across the court and picks me up, gives me a big
hug.  
  
And then the second one, our first workouts we have, he breaks his nose
because he's in there battling with us, like, body, trying to be scrappy with
us. He breaks his nose. But he took it like a champ.  
  
He got up, I think I broke my nose. And the next day you see him, he has
purple all over his eyes. He's crazy, but definitely contagious, though.  
  
Q. And it's a good crazy?  
DAVID CRISP: Good crazy.  
  
NOAH DICKERSON: Good crazy.  
  
Q. I guess after hearing this, what do you guys, when you see around the
country, like, all the brouhaha or whatever, outside looking in, with Coach
Izzo and what you just said with Coach Hopkins, do you get the sense that
people don't understand coach/player relationships?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Oh, yeah. Are you talking about that tweet that came out on
Twitter about Tom Izzo yelling at his player? Yeah, for a fact, because I've
seen it -- you've seen it?  
  
It's crazy to me because coaches yell at you, you know what I mean? Like he
said in his press conference, if you weren't doing your job you would be
criticized about it, too. It is what it is. And people get yelled at. You're
men. You're 18, 19, 20. Like, get over it. It is what it is.  
  
DAVID CRISP: And on top of that, a lot of people, you don't see a lot of
things that goes on behind closed doors. You don't see the team meetings at
Coach's house. You don't see the long conversations you have in the coach's
offices. You don't see how much Coach is there for you. They don't see that
love that's always there.  
  
And when somebody loves you, you're willing to let them push you to your
limits. And that's what brings the greatness out of people.  
  
So people don't understand that a lot of times with these coaches, it's more
than just, oh, that's my coach; it's real love -- it's family.  
  
NOAH DICKERSON: Yeah, families fight. I fight with my twin brother all the
time, to this day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. We're joined by coach Mike Hopkins. Coach,
we have to start out by saying we had two particular witnesses previously who
referred to you as crazy.  
  
COACH HOPKINS: That's not true, (laughter) not true, not true at all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We did surmise it was a good crazy. Any questions?  
  
Q. Along those lines, it's not often players call their coach crazy --
affectionately. (Laughter) is it true that you did hug David Crisp the first
time at your introductory press conference and you broke your nose in the
first practice?  
COACH HOPKINS: That is true. I'm just pretty passionate. And I just love life
and love being around my kids. And when David Crisp told me he was going to
stay I probably could have suffocated him I squeezed him so hard.  
  
I like to interact. I like to be involved. I don't like to be the guy sitting
on the ceiling saying, run faster. I like to be involved. It's my assistant
coach in me that I love. That's why I love it. I love the interaction with the
kids and being out there sweating with them.  
  
Q. Is that something that's easily overlooked, is when you come into a
new situation as you did at Washington, and you have to say, I've got to get
this guy, this guy and this guy to stay? Is it more than we in the public
realize?  
COACH HOPKINS: You know, it is. Because you're going to have one hour to meet
with these kids, for them to make a decision for the rest of their life. And I
said it was a form of speed dating. You had to be on. You had to be sitting
there, and you're going from table -- guys were coming in, you're meeting with
the families and sharing your vision.  
  
And it was an incredible time, and a lot of those guys stayed with us, which
was really, really special. And here we are. And we've grinded together. We've
worked hard together. We've sweated together -- staff, players, administrative
staff. It's been a heck of a run.  
  
Q. I asked the players, so I'll ask you regarding the game, the
importance of post players. This tournament continues to go on and on and on.
It seems like that becomes imperative. And come to find out, Noah said he and
Luke have a history together. Can you, one, as far as post play going forward;
and, two, that matchup in particular?  
COACH HOPKINS: We have a program, we go inside/out. We play inside/out. And
believe in offensive balance, having a great post player is like having a
great penetrator. And then you have a guy who can score in a man-to-man
situation but he can pass out of double teams. And he can make foul shots.
It's a heck of a weapon.  
  
And this year, Noah sacrificed a lot. Last year he was All-Pac-12. And this
year they double-teamed him and triple-teamed him and game planned around him.
And it's opened up opportunities for guys to step up and make plays. That's
where we've become better. We've become better with our balance.  
  
I know this is kind of the corny coaching cliché, but we honestly have nine
guys that could start for us. Naz Carter came up big, Dom Green's been like
that the whole year. Jamal Bey is coming on, came in and in gave us a great
eight minutes. Sam Timmins has had great minutes. And they've stayed together,
positive. And it can be a different guy any night. And it's a luxury for a
coach to have that.  
  
Q. And Luke (indiscernible)?  
COACH HOPKINS: I don't know what their past is or what their history is. But
you're talking about two incredible post players. Luke is a guy I saw when I
was at Syracuse, and he just kept getting better and better, and he's turned
into one of the best big guys in the country.  
  
He shoots it. He's great in the mid post. He can pass. He's an aggressive
rebounder. I mean, you talk about Carolina, you talk about their big guys.
They've had great guards, but their big guys -- they're inside/out. They try
to crush you on the glass. That's what they do. And he's been a great player
for them.  
  
Q. It wasn't that long ago that this Washington program was well below
.500, but the past two years, back-to-back tournaments. You get a win
yesterday. How have you gotten these guys to kind of buy in? And has this all
kind of come together quicker than you might have thought?  
COACH HOPKINS: That's a great question. All we were trying to do was put in
our offensive system, put in our defensive system, put in our culture system
and work hard every day. People say you never know. Some people, the
learnability, I've worked with kids. You show them a move, move, move, and it
takes them a year to even get it.  
  
Some guys just get it faster. And our guys kept believing. They've worked hard
every day and we have a saying, DMGB -- doesn't matter, get better. So you
lose by 30? Doesn't matter, get better. Win by one? Doesn't matter, get
better.  
  
That's what these guys have done. They've believed in what we're selling with
our defense and they've gotten better at it. It's been fun to watch them grow.
And if I told you I knew the timeline or when we would get it, I would be
lying to you. You just never know.  
  
All you can do is work hard every day. That's kind of the culture that we have
at University of Washington, and we just try to get better every day.  
  
Q. Is the zone that you run pretty much the same thing you and Jimmy did
in Syracuse, or are there a few wrinkles you've thrown in now that it's your
system? And then as familiar as Roy is with what you do, you're pretty much as
familiar with what he does. How much does that kind of play into the
preparations for this?  
COACH HOPKINS: Like anything, when you're playing against the zone, you can't
really mimic it in practice. When you're playing against Carolina, you can't
mimic how fast they push the ball up because that's what they do better than
anybody in the country.  
  
And we run a very similar zone. We have different types of personnel, so we
have to utilize it a little bit differently based on our personnel. But it's
all -- the foundation is definitely what we did at Syracuse.  
  
And very familiar with North Carolina. I was very familiar with Coach Williams
at Kansas. We had played them multiple times. One of the great coaches to ever
do it and one of the great program, college basketball programs of all times.  
  
It's an honor to even have the opportunity to play them. For a coach and for a
program that's trying to build it's like a dream come true. You get a chance
to play against the best of the best. What's better than that in March Madness
time?  
  
Q. The guys talked about relishing that look on an opponent's face when
you guys have frustrated them defensively and said they saw it last night. How
do you build that and instill that in guys, maybe even more so than getting
excited by offense?  
COACH HOPKINS: It goes back to what your culture is and our culture is defense
travels. You can bring it anywhere. It's what you can control. You can't
control make them miss shots, but you can control how hard you play and how
smart you play and how together you play.  
  
And for us on the defensive end, it's something that we hang our hat on. And
it is like a Rubik's Cube. We can make adjustments and it can frustrate teams.
But that goes back to when we are locked in and focused on our game plan and
moving around and flying around. We've also proven in certain times when we
haven't been locked in and haven't been focused where teams can hurt it. So
hopefully we'll be that locked in and focused for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Some people in the Northwest are starting to compare you to Pete
Carroll because of your high energy, your positive approach on the floor. Is
this something you've always had as a coach or was there another coach that
passed that philosophy to you?  
COACH HOPKINS: The one lesson that I learned is be who you are. And I'm 49
going on 14 sometimes. I like to have fun. I like to interact. I've been
fortunate in my career to learn from some of the greatest coaches and be
around some of the greatest coaches in the game.  
  
And my high school coach, Gary McKnight -- Bob Johnson was my sixth-grade
Little League baseball coach, the super quarterback coach, high school coach
at Michigan High School, played for Jim Boeheim. I was with the Olympic team
with Coach K.  
  
I've been really lucky. And whenever you're around great coaches that have
changed your life, you learn a little bit from everybody. So the one thing
that they all have in common is they're all real simple, they're all great
people, they all care about kids and developing kids. And most importantly
they are who they are.  
  
And if I have to roll up my sleeves and take off your coat and people are, why
are you taking off your coat? I don't know, that's just what I do. I'm
nervous. I don't know what happens. I feel like I'm on a sand trap on the golf
course. I've just got to roll it up -- it's going to be difficult -- and I
start rolling it up and that's what it is. Just been very fortunate and
learned from a lot of people.  
  
Q. Noah mentioned that his visit to the campus happened in the summer
and he recommended for your recruiting going forward that that was probably a
good idea. Is that a plan?  
COACH HOPKINS: That's the plan. That's the plan.  
  
Q. History and tradition don't mean anything once the ball goes up and
the game goes on. But you've come from a program that's had a lot of history
and tradition itself. Where does that pay off in terms of prestige and that
sort of thing?  
COACH HOPKINS: I think we're trying to -- like the Carolinas and the Dukes and
the Syracuses and the great programs, that's what you strive to be. That's
what your goal is. You want to play against the best. Gonzaga. That's what you
strive to be. And you try to do it your way. And standard of excellence. What
they represent, playing for something bigger than yourself. The Carolina way.
The Husky way. That's what you're trying to be.  
  
And so to be able to have the opportunity to play against the best of the best
is -- you see what it's like. You see what it feels like. You see what it
smells like. You see what it looks like. That's how you learn, through
experience, and it would be an unbelievable opportunity for us to learn, to
play. Hopefully we can play well. And it's going to be a great, like I said, a
great opportunity.  
  
Q. Is there a point where you know you need to shut it off personally
before a game? You could prepare and not sleep for 24 hours if you -- someone
with your energy, I know.  
COACH HOPKINS: This is the best -- the best fatigue is after winning. I don't
care, we'll be up all night. The staff was up all night. They look like they
haven't slept in five days and all excited in practice. So, listen, we're in
March Madness playing against North Carolina. I mean, is there anything
better? And I told these guys, like, March Madness is an opportunity for
Cinderella and have a chance to play for a national championship. We didn't
come here just to get here. That's not our standard. That's not what we're
trying to do. We have got to have a game plan, go out play against the best
and see where we stand and hopefully we can execute a game plan and come out
with a win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee student-athletes Jordan Bone, Admiral
Schofield, Lamonté Turner, Grant Williams and Kyle Alexander as well as head
coach Rick Barnes. Questions for the student-athletes first?  
  
Q. Lamonté, I know you guys have said -- you guys have allowed 15 3s in
the last two games, and you guys have said guys are just hitting tough shots.
But do you think part of that is you guys allowing teams to get in a rhythm
early and kind of getting things going?  
LAMONTÉ TURNER: I think in those games our offense has taken tough shots, not
getting the shot we want and not making them work, kind of leading out to them
opening the floor and kind of driving a kicking, and them getting the
momentum. So I think it's our offense that kind of leads to stuff like that.  
  
Q. Grant, what are your thoughts on Tyler Cook, Iowa's power forward?
And what have you seen from him if you've watched him this year?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: Very talented. I've known him for a couple of years. Tyler is
very athletic. He's dominant in the post. He's developed his game a lot.
Tremendous respect for him. He's done a lot through EYBL and everything. He's
always been a talented player. It's exciting to play him.  
  
Q. Jordan, that was a good question about knowing other guys. Generally
with teams you match up against, how much do you know them because of AAU days
or playing with them somewhere, maybe in the same area as you did in high
school? Any team in particular that you play, how many times do you run into
guys that you know other than matching up with them during the course of the
year?  
JORDAN BONE: I ran into a couple of guys. I have a lot of guys that played on
the circuit with me in AAU days. I've seen a lot of familiar faces. I'm not
really sure how to put names with them. But I've definitely seen a lot of
familiar faces.  
  
So I just think it's really exciting to show how important AAU is and just
playing the circuit, getting that exposure. Now, just seeing everybody all
together on this large playing field of NCAA basketball, it just means a lot.  
  
Q. Jordan, now that you're back at this stage, have you at all thought
about or maybe it's distant memory, that last shot last year against Loyola?  
JORDAN BONE: I've gotten a lot of questions about that Loyola game. I mean, I
feel like moving forward from that. You know, it's definitely something that
you remember. I kind of use it as motivation during my offseason.  
  
And I feel like this team kind of uses moments like that, not just Loyola
specifically, but just tough losses and just kind of being in the trenches, we
kind of use that as motivation in order for us to be the team that we are
today. And I feel like it's very important to use moments like that as
motivation to make it better.  
  
Q. Grant, along those lines, unfinished business, I think, is a key
motivator for a lot of teams at this stage. How much do you feel that this
group takes that personally?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: I know for us, the type of competitor that we are, that we're
going to come in with the mindset that we're going to play every game to the
best of our ability. But there's always that extra motivation because we've
never been counted on, we've never been boosted up. Every time we have gotten
up, everybody wants to see us fall down.  
  
It's just a matter of being who we are and embracing that. We understand that
we're doing this for each other and not for anybody else. So that's the
motivation that we have.  
  
Q. Admiral, you've had a lot of -- obviously had the big shots last
night. You've had so many games this season where you've come up big down the
stretch. Is there one moment you can point back to in your collegiate career
that's helped springboard you into the leader you've become today?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: I think the biggest moment that helped me as far as
leadership would be the Georgia game two years ago, missing a game-winning
opportunity for my team, and just seeing the disappointment on our faces when
we knew our backs were against the wall.  
  
And I just thought that from that point on, I was going to do everything I
could to help lead and be an example of what winning looks like. And I just
think from there on, not just me, I think everyone sitting at this table did a
great job of just instilling in everybody in our program that we won't be
denied anymore from what we've been working hard for because we've been
putting a lot of hard work in I'd say from that moment and also Coach Barnes
running us a lot. But I think that was a big motivator for us, too, to stop
losing so we didn't have to run as much.  
  
Q. Kyle, how much fun are you guys having up here together, just as a
group, getting to experience the tournament and everything that kind of goes
into it? For some it's kind of the last go-around here. Just love to know your
answer on that?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: I'm having a great time, personally. I love these guys,
probably the funniest group of guys I've ever been around in my life. It's
always a trip. But, no, we're having a great time enjoying this. Some guys
it's their first time. It's great to have worked so hard that we got a chance
to be back here together. So I'm loving it, enjoying it. And I just hope we
make it last.  
  
Q. Jordan, how much more do you think you're prepared because of last
year and just for this moment --  
(Cell phone ringing).  
  
JORDAN BONE: (Laughter) That was my home boy. Sorry about that.  
  
To answer your question, I think we're very prepared. I feel like moments in
the past kind of helped us get to this point. Even yesterday, yesterday was
tough playing against Colgate. But I felt like they prepared as well for a
team like Iowa.  
  
They're very similar. Even though Iowa is bigger, much more physical, it kind
of gave us a taste of playing against Garza, that can hit the open shot,
playing against random motion offense, just being on edge. I felt like they
got us prepared for tomorrow.  
  
I feel like, all in all, we're just ready to attack tomorrow. We're ready for
this situation. We prepared. The preparation has been very important getting
up to this point. So at this point we just have to execute and do our game
plan.  
  
Q. Admiral, a guy like Luka Garza who can pop out and hit those shots,
how do you defend people like that? And maybe have you gone against guys like
that earlier this year that you can kind of compare it to?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: We've gone against a lot of teams that have what we call a
prototypical stretch 4, a guy that can step out and space the floor
offensively. But it's March. Like I said yesterday, seems like everybody's
percentage goes up at least 10 percent in March.  
  
So all you can do is really make the shots as tough as possible. And, you
know, the game is never perfect. And they're a talented team. Luka Garza, he
hit three yesterday, but his percentage doesn't say that he's a big-time
3-point shooter. But it's March, and guys are competing and players make plays
around this time of year. So you've got to respect everybody's ability to
shoot the ball, especially a team like Iowa.  
  
And their pure motion offense is great because they give a lot of, get into a
lot of different actions and space the floor and get their guys good shots and
good looks and move the ball well. Basically you just gotta communicate at a
high level. Nothing is going to be perfect, but you can't beat yourselves by
giving them extra possessions or giving them offensive rebounds and things
like that.  
  
So they're going to hit their shots. We're going to hit ours. And we're both
going to compete, and it's going to be a good game.  
  
Q. Lamonté, this time of year the officials are also officials that you
don't necessarily know from the SEC. Do you find that it is a different game
depending on the officials that you have?  
LAMONTÉ TURNER: Yeah, definitely for a guy like me that likes to get up and
pressure the ball, gotta get a feel of what these officials call, like, the
different type of calls they call, like hand checks and stuff like that.  
  
So at the beginning of the game, Coach always tells us to get a feel for
everything. That way you're not getting silly fouls and stuff like that. So I
think that's definitely big around this time of the year.  
  
And being older guys, you understand that different officials have different
type of calls and stuff like that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
COACH BARNES: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You've given up 15 3s over the last two games. How much of that is a
concern for you going forward?  
COACH BARNES: Some of those have been unbelievable shots. I don't think we
could defend it any other way than we did. They're going to make some of them,
but some of the shots that all you can do is just get as close as you can, try
to contest a shot without fouling. And some of those are really deep 3s. And
we've played two teams that have shot it great.  
  
But when you can win a game in the NCAA Tournament when a team makes 15 3s
like that and the crowd is pulling for them, I thought we showed the maturity
we needed to show. But us -- it's not that we're not trying to defend the
3-point line, it's not. You've got to give them credit. They're making the
shots.  
  
It's not like they're layups either; they're making shots from very deep range
and that's part of the game. And that 3-point line is a great equalizer in
some ways.  
  
Q. You guys are pretty much in the exact same spot you were this time a
year ago. How much more prepared do you think your kids are to handle what's
going to happen tomorrow?  
COACH BARNES: I think they realize, this time of year, how it's a matter of
executing, doing what you have to do and having a lot of respect for your
opponent, which I know they do. And it's about, again, this time of year teams
know each other. You know your own team. Every player should know his role,
what he has to do. And you want to see your players do what you've asked them
to do all year and do it at a high level. And know that it's going to be hard
because teams right now should be playing their best basketball.  
  
Q. You said you're not guarding the 3-point line, but maybe you're
guarding personnel more. Does it make it more challenging when you have four
shooters on the floor at a time like Iowa?  
COACH BARNES: Yeah, we played Auburn, they had five. So it's always a
challenge when you have to guard the 3-point line. And then you throw in the
fact that Iowa has an inside game, too, where they very much will play
inside/out. But if they get good looks at it, they're going to take it.  
  
I don't think they force a lot of 3s. And the last two opponents, they were
going to live on that 3-point line. I don't feel that Iowa feels they have to
live back there. But certainly our last two opponents that's what they were
willing to do, shoot 30, 40 3s if necessary. And that line is there, and
you've got to deal with it.  
  
Q. It's been there 32 years. Can you have imagined the evolution that we
are here today and talking about taking 35 or 40 of those?  
COACH BARNES: Again, I looked at last night when I was watching the tape and
they're experimenting right now in the NIT with moving that line back. And I
bet they made 10 of them yesterday behind that line. And so maybe we should
think about moving it back even further. But the fact is it's been good for
the game and it's helped our game. Teams go in it sometimes knowing they're
going to shoot 30, 40 3s.  
  
Q. Is there a mid-range game anymore?  
COACH BARNES: We believe in that. We do. We believe in that. And a lot of
people want to either shoot a layup or shoot the 3. But we still believe
there's a place for the mid-range game.  
  
Q. How important is Kyle in this particular matchup, keeping him on the
floor, of course, with Garza and then Kriener also, big athletic bigs?  
COACH BARNES: I think it's important. But I think all our front-line guys,
Kyle, Grant, I think Derrick Walker will have to be ready to play and John
Fulkerson. And Kyle actually played -- did a good job yesterday. He really
did. And we got what we felt like we needed to go with some offense and we
went with the small lineup that that's really one of our most efficient
lineups.  
  
But we need Kyle. We're going to need him tomorrow. And we're expecting him to
give us a great effort and do his job.  
  
Q. Looked like Iowa changed its defense a lot, plays, will work a lot of
zone. Just how important is it that you play inside/out, not get lured into
settling, like you say?  
COACH BARNES: I think it's important that we flow, that we play. Yesterday
they were back in there as far back as you can go. And I think that we've got
to work hard at taking the slack out of it, get the ball moving and do the
things that we do.  
  
And we've been good against zones all year, really. And we just gotta continue
to do what we've practiced all year and the way that we've played. But we've
got to get our post guys working better than they did yesterday.  
  
Q. Admiral had said that the springboard to him being a clutch shot-
maker and leader was the Georgia game in the SEC Tournament. Do you agree with
that?  
COACH BARNES: What did he say?  
  
Q. He said the springboard for him to be able to make big shots now and
lead the team the way he does was that Georgia game when he missed the 3. Do
you agree with that or what do you think about his growth as a big shot-maker
and leader?  
COACH BARNES: What I think of him is the time he puts in the gym. He's in
there working and working and working. He's worked as hard as any player I've
seen from the time that he started to where he was a very erratic 3-point
shooter and he wanted to shoot it, but he didn't know when he should shoot it.  
  
But he's put so much time in working on his shot. And he's one of those guys,
when it leaves his hand and he has his feet set, you think it's going in.  
  
Q. Yesterday you said you think the team was anxious. Do you think that
was just a matter of it being the first game of the tournament and do you
expect it to continue tomorrow?  
COACH BARNES: No, I think the hard thing in this tournament is just getting
started, obviously. And I think when you play the way we started out playing
and -- but we weren't really aggressive as we were making some shots early.
And then, I can tell you, they made some tough shots. I mean, it's not like --
we gave them some, where we broke down in transition.  
  
But the fact is you've got to give them credit. They made 15 3s. I'm telling
you they were pretty tough 3s to make. But I do think that we were a little
bit anxious, and maybe wanting to get back to where we have a chance to play
again today, whatever it may be.  
  
But I expect us now to come out and realize this is like playing a conference
game against anybody in your league where you know you have to be ready to
play and hope that we can play well.  
  
Q. Is it about finding your rhythm, you think, after a little lay-off?  
COACH BARNES: Yeah, we played on Sunday. We had three games in three days. And
we played three games -- I don't know how many hours -- we knew coming into
this we had to get our legs back and get, more than anything, get our bodies
back.  
  
And so we didn't do a lot coming into it. And I think some of it is getting
your rhythm back and getting back to playing. So, but now we know what we've
got to do, we've got to go out and execute.  
  
Q. I know that you're busy, always preparing for the next game, but this
time of year do you watch a lot of basketball? Do you watch a lot of other
games?  
COACH BARNES: I don't. Personally I don't because I don't want to get
sidetracked on anything. I want to stay really locked in. But I don't watch a
lot during the season, normally. I just don't do that because I'm just going
to -- because I tell our guys that we've got to stay locked into what we're
doing.  
  
I watch a lot of film of us. We film practice, and I do a lot of that all the
time. But I've got a great coaching staff that we're always -- they're doing
their jobs with scouting and they know what they need to do. But I just don't
watch a lot of it this time of year, maybe because I feel like I'm in this
hotel for a long time, I flip back and forth and all that and watch some here
or there.  
  
But I don't like watching a lot because I don't want to get my mind going in
directions and thinking about things other than what I should be thinking
about.  
  
Q. Do you think your players, are they basketball fans, do they watch a
lot?  
COACH BARNES: Oh, I think they watch everything. I think they're involved with
it. But yet that's part of it, too. It's a great time. It really is. And like
prior to coming here we were back there watching the LSU/Maryland game, like
that. But I don't have the patience right now to just sit down and watch a
game from start to finish unless it's got something to do directly with us.  
  
Q. I know you started your career back here with Gary Williams and Fran
Fraschilla and those guys, I think you were on that staff?  
COACH BARNES: Fran took my place.  
  
Q. That's right. I wondered if you saw this locale and took stock of
your career. You had a hell of a career and where you were when you were a
very young coach in George Mason and those places. How are you different now
in dealing with this circus than you would have been back then?  
COACH BARNES: Well, first of all, after our game yesterday, I thought back
immediately to 19 -- I think it was 1979 -- where Fran McCaffery and Sherman
Dillard and I were working the University of Maryland basketball camp
together. And so we've known each other for a long time. And one of the very
first players we signed at George Mason was Sherman Dillard's brother, Ricky.
And we've known each other for a long time.  
  
And coming through here, the year I was here, I've told people maybe the
greatest coaching job I've ever been a part of was watching Gary Williams,
what he did my time one year with him here. But you learn a lot. I think as a
young head coach you try to -- you sometimes can put a little more pressure on
your team than you probably need to.  
  
Q. Why?  
COACH BARNES: Because you want to win. And you realize, one, that it's not
something you ever take for granted. I mean, there's a lot of teams now that
-- the thing is to get to this tournament every year. That's got to be your
goal.  
  
And the way our business has turned into, it seems if you don't get there,
good things don't happen to you. Or happen for you. But I think you learn and
you learn -- I think as I've gotten older the biggest thing I've learned is to
trust my players more as much as anything and know that their hard work they
put into it, and you've got to let them play the game and you can't joystick
it all the time and think you're going to try to control every possession. And
as a young coach I was probably guilty of that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
North Carolina - 88, Iona - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina head coach Roy Williams and
student-athletes Nassir Little and Cameron Johnson.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Needless to say the second half was a lot different from the
first half. I thought the first half we were very tentative on the offensive
end and didn't do what we planted to do on the defensive end.  
  
They changed their game plan a little bit, and needless to say it worked.
They've been playing at a fast pace, but they controlled the clock and shot 3s
and made 10 3s in the first half. And our offense was not very good. The only
offense we had in the first half was Nassir taking the ball to the basket.  
  
Second half, Cam makes a big 3 the first possession and all of a sudden we
have a little more energy and passion about what we were doing defensively.
And we defended, got some turnovers and got some points off that. And they
missed some open shots as well. But I think we shot, like, 63, 64 percent in
the second half because we took better shots as well.  
  
But Nassir gave us a great lift off the bench and Cam did, like I said, the
first shot of the second half was really big, and he had a couple assists and
baskets later than that as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Cam, what did he say to you guys at halftime? And did he need to say
anything?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: He just said that's not the way we play; we need to pick it
up. And we received that message pretty loud and clear. We knew that the way
we played in the first half was unacceptable. We knew that wasn't us, and
that's what he emphasized to us, that we have to come out and play better.  
  
He had faith in us. That was important to us. And we just had to go out there
and execute and use our advantages.  
  
Q. Cameron, what did Iona do in the first half? They shot well, but what
did they do that made it difficult in the first half?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Making shots. It was -- really took them a long way. It took
us out of getting any transition opportunities. Made us play offense in the
half court. They slowed down the tempo, used a lot of the clock and hit a lot
of 3s.  
  
They kind of controlled that tempo. And we were swinging the ball around the
outside too much, not really getting it on the inside. And they did a pretty
good job of keeping us off the glass for the most part in that first half.  
  
Q. Naz, do you look at yourself as an energy guy? And even if you don't
do you feel like you've inserted some of that into the team in the first half
when you came in?  
NASSIR LITTLE: Yeah, for sure. I just look at what the team needs. I felt like
early on we was taking too many outside shots. And before the game Coach and
all the coaching staff was telling me to be aggressive and get easy buckets on
the inside and play inside-out. I think by doing that, opened up a lot of
things in the second half.  
  
Q. Nassir, just looked like in the second half you decided to push the
ball up the court and go to the basket, either a pass for a drive. Was just
what you wanted to do to try to change the flow of the game?  
NASSIR LITTLE: For sure. We did a scout and we knew they weren't the strongest
team in transition. I felt early on we weren't getting enough stops to take
advantage of that. So once we picked it up defensively we got easy buckets in
transition. Guys were being more aggressive taking it to the basket, putting
pressure on their guys, getting people in foul trouble, and that's how we were
able to get away.  
  
Q. Cam, coaches love to say the first four or five minutes of a second
half is the most important part of the game. Is that cliché because it's
true?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: It is true. It is true. We came out and we tied it up pretty
quick and it gave us some momentum and we rolled that way for the majority of
the half. So we came out, we called the play, we ran it. My guys hit a good
screen. The first one fell.  
  
Then Luke came down, got an easy basket and the stops started to come. You
just hope a team that hits 10 of their first 21 3s kind of cools off. And they
did that a little bit and we took advantage.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Can you just speak to the ball movement by your team in the second
half after only three first-half assists there?  
COACH WILLIAMS: For North Carolina to play a half and only have three assists,
that tells you right there that we're not moving very well. And we talked
about that. We had zero points off turnovers. We had three assists. Everything
was just an outside shot except for Nassir basically, and Luke had a lot of
things inside, but for some reason he was worried about getting his shots
blocked or something because at half he and Cam together were 3-for-16. And
you go back look at what they did in the second half, it was much more
aggressive and poised and confident in what they were doing.  
  
Q. What do you have to say about Iona guard Rickey McGill's performance?
He had 26 points and was really impressive from deep?  
COACH WILLIAMS: He's a four-year guy, four championships, four NCAA
Tournaments, and I congratulated him on that in the line as we were shaking
hands at the end. We knew that he's a good 3-point shooter, but the other guys
shoot more. But today he made his first one, made his second one and I think
he made six in a row before he missed.  
  
But I think he's a heck of a player. And scouting report said, you've got to
watch No. 0. He plays in the passing lanes and still gets two steals like
that. I think he had a heck of a game.  
  
But Tim changed a little bit and gave them the best chance to win by using
clock and spreading, and he was counting on his guys making shots and in the
first half they did. And fortunately for us we made more in the second half
and they didn't shoot it as well.  
  
Q. I know you prefer not to have gone through that first half. But now
that it's done, do you feel like maybe you can use that to your advantage, as
maybe let these guys know that they're not invincible and they need to come
out and play well?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't think that they felt like they were invincible.
Probably the thing I despise more than anything in basketball or in life is
somebody trying to be cool. And I thought in the first half we didn't have the
passion.  
  
And I don't think that they thought it was going to be easy. I just don't
think we had the passion to play. And especially in the defensive end when
they're spreading you, it's not easy. You've got to get there and you can't
let a guy stare down at your feet and pull up shoot a 3. You can't let them
drive to the basket and lay it up.  
  
It was a total breakdown on the defensive end and then they're making the 3s,
and we started looking at the score and I think perhaps got a little tight.  
  
But no, I told them in the locker room, every tournament's different. You
build your momentum once you get in the tournament. And some of you guys have
heard this before, but I was on the staff of a pretty good team -- 1982. And
the first game we played James Madison in Charlotte. And we blew them out, 52
to 50.  
  
And so it happens. And we had a guy named Worthy, a guy name Jordan and a guy
named Perkins on that team. We ended up winning the national championship. So
it's one game, but learn from this one game. We've got to have more passion.  
  
Q. Can you coach or uncoach tight?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No, I think what you've gotta do is kids have to have
confidence. I've always said, don't worry about anything; just lose yourself
in the game. And that's what we tried to get the guys to focus on and be
positive and lose themselves in the game, yes.  
  
Q. Obviously when they were coming out shooting a bunch of 3s early, you
knew they were going to make them. I guess the question is --  
COACH WILLIAMS: I did not know they were going to make them.  
  
Q. I didn't say that right. Once they started hitting a few and you see
that, what was the adjustment you made at halftime knowing that you could kind
of sense that they were going to shoot a bunch of 3s?  
COACH WILLIAMS: We knew they were going to shoot a bunch of 3s period, because
that's what they do. They try to open the court and try to drive and penetrate
and pitch for 3s. That's what his teams have done for ten straight games in
the winning streak, and they've done a good job of it.  
  
But they did a better job of it today because I think they shot like 40 -- 47
or something like that in the first half and that's pretty impressive. But in
the second half, you know, we just talked about playing with passion. We did
start switching the screens on the ball 1 through 4. 5 was the only one making
a hard edge. But they didn't really set that many screens, so that didn't
change it much. It's just that we had more passion and got to the shooters
more. But more importantly we didn't stand around on the offensive end. We
started moving and we got some stops and that got our breaks so we were better
offensively.  
  
Q. You're a No. 1 seed which is obviously an achievement, something you
want to be. Does that come with a little pressure that affected you a little
bit early on?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think so. And I think UMBC last year made it a little more
pressure. And it's part of the game. And I understand that and told them that.
But if you're a tough competitor and you invest yourself into the game, you're
not just worried about the score; you want to be concerned about how you're
playing.  
  
And I think for a couple moments there we were concerned about the score more
so than how we were playing. So I just tried to get us to focus on playing
better, playing better and doing what we've done all year long.  
  
Q. Second half, it looked like you really tightened up the defense in
the paint. Whenever Crawford went down the lane he always was being met by two
players. Was that the key adjustment on defense?  
COACH WILLIAMS: When you say it was a key adjustment, it sounds like it's
coaching. We did the same thing; we just did it better in the second half. The
only thing we changed was playing the screen on the ball differently in the
second half.  
  
And, like I say, they didn't set nearly as many in the second half as they did
in the first half. But we were trying to be in there to make it difficult for
somebody to drive off because if you're in the gaps and they drive and
penetrate, you just have to go one way.  
  
If you're out denying like we used to do, we were denying, you gotta get back
and then you go two ways. The game plan was to be -- to have them in there,
stopping people driving to the basket. We just didn't look like it was a game
plan in the first half.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Washington - 78, Utah State - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State head coach Craig Smith and student-
athletes Sam Merrill and Brock Miller. Coach, an opening statement?  
  
COACH SMITH: I want to congratulate Washington. I thought they played
fantastic. Really disrupted us. I thought we were really tentative in the
first half. And that was a lot to do with them. They really disrupted us on
top.  
  
We struggled completing passing. We had too many turnovers. Obviously we ended
up with 21 turnovers on the game, which is very uncharacteristic of us. I can
only think of one other game in which that's happened even remotely close to
that in the last two months during -- since we've won, what, 17 out of 18, or
whatever it was.  
  
But you've got to give them credit. I thought our guys really competed hard,
really fought back. They hurt us on the offensive glass the first half. It was
really a tale of two halves, but we came roaring all the way back. Our press
is really, really good. Caused them to get tentative and forced a bunch of
turnovers.  
  
Sam made a big 3 in the corner right in front of our bench that cut the lead
to one. And then we just almost got maybe a little overzealous with our press
and took some chances we really didn't need to. And give them credit, they
make back-to-back 3s on the next two possessions. And then I think we came
back and turned it over a couple times.  
  
But an amazing season. We're so proud to represent certainly Utah State, the
state of Utah and of course the Mountain West Conference. The Mountain West
Conference is a great conference. It's really a conference on the rise. And
we're really, really proud to represent them. And obviously we wish we could
have done it with a W.  
  
But this team, picked ninth in the preseason poll and getting an 8 seed, and
then just the way we did things, it was a historic season really from start to
finish. It was a program -- we didn't lose back-to-back games one time. To win
the regular season title and then validate it with the postseason tournament,
it was fantastic. First-ever in Utah State history in terms of winning the
Mountain West championship.  
  
So it's just the start of where we want to go and we'll talk about that more
later. But congrats to Washington.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sam, this was obviously just a really frustrating game. What did they
do to really take you out of rhythm? You just didn't have looks, especially
the first half?  
SAM MERRILL: Like Coach said, we've got to give them all the credit. Their
zone was really good tonight. And they made it really tough on us. We had
practiced against it all week, but like I said pregame, you can't replicate
the length they have and the athleticism they have.  
  
And they did a very good job not just taking away my looks but making things
tough for us as a team as well. So just gotta give them all the credit in the
world, for sure.  
  
Q. Brock, at the very beginning, from the beginning it seemed like you
were coming out with a lot of energy. But going into the half, that was
probably one of the ugliest points as far as things were going against you
guys. What did Coach say at the half? What was your guys' conversation like,
and what were you thinking would be the outcome of the game?  
BROCK MILLER: You know, us as a team, we've been in this position before where
we've been down going into halftime. And us guys, you know, we all came
together at halftime. And we just decided it's time to come out and really
just not be tentative like we were in the first half. And Coach made a big
emphasis on that.  
  
And obviously as a team we always believe we're going to win. We're always
going to find a way. And unfortunately it didn't happen for us tonight. And
credit to Washington. They came out ready to play and they really disrupted us
on our offense with their defense. And it happens sometimes where you lose
some and you win some.  
  
But I'm really proud of all of our guys and what we did this year was
incredible. And we're only going uphill from here.  
  
Q. That was a team with great length obviously and you can see that on
the video as you prepare for the game. But does reality set in the first
couple of minutes of the game and you realize it's going to be a little more
difficult for your shots to fall?  
BROCK MILLER: Oh, definitely. I mean, all those guys up on the perimeter are
very long, very athletic, and you don't realize until you're in the moment.
Again, they're jumping in passing lanes. So it definitely took us a quick
minute.  
  
But I think that second half we really fought hard and we gave it our all. And
we're going to be back next year.  
  
Q. Sam, you guys fought pretty hard back in the second half. What was it
like when Washington, they go 6-of-7 from the 3 in the second half. How much
did that hurt you guys in terms of make a push and then they hit a 3-pointer
kind of cut it back?  
SAM MERRILL: We cut it to one and then they hit two straight 3s and it was --
No. 11, I forgot his name -- but No. 11, who is a good player but hasn't made
a ton of 3s on the year. So give credit to him. He hit some big shots, three
big shots in the second half and got to the free-throw line a couple times,
too.  
  
So like Coach said, we had a couple of -- once we cut it to one they hit a 3,
and then we had a couple of turnovers, and they hit a transition 3. That was a
tough moment for us, for sure.  
  
Q. Brock, but both of you can answer, it's been eight years since you
got to the NCAA Tournament. You mentioned you wanted to get the tradition
going again. What have you taken from the experience here? I know it's shorter
than what you wanted it to be, but what do you take from this experience going
forward to next year?  
BROCK MILLER: This experience was awesome for us, and it can only go uphill
from here. We've got a lot of guys coming back next year. Sam and I both,
we're from the state of Utah, and we both grew up watching the Aggies. And
it's something special to be here in the NCAA Tournament and to have won the
Mountain West Conference tournament championship.  
  
And from here on out we're just going to keep competing and doing our best to
get back to the top again, get back to this tournament and hopefully a better
outcome next time. But definitely it's on our minds and this experience will
definitely benefit us.  
  
SAM MERRILL: Yeah, it's been a good year for us, definitely, getting Utah
State back to where Utah State basketball needs to be. But obviously this is
still very disappointing. We felt like this was a real opportunity to make
that next step for this program and couldn't get it done tonight.  
  
So our goals next year will be to do what we did this year, win the league,
win the Mountain West Tournament, and then get here again and win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach Smith.  
  
Q. Were you surprised to see them shoot the 3 as well as they did? They
have not done that anywhere close to what they did tonight all season.  
COACH SMITH: Yes and no. I mean, watched a ton of games on them. There were
certainly some games where they were on fire -- I forget the specific ones --
leading up to this game. At halftime they were 4-for-10, but they were
drilling us in the paint. They were 11-for-20 in the paint in the first half
and just had six offensive boards. They only had one in the second half.  
  
So we were really having a difficult time staying in front of them in the
first half, in particular, especially No. 5, who is obviously a very good
player, the Pac-12 Player of the Year, Nowell. We just were having a difficult
time, he was getting downhill, downhill , downhill. And they were just living
at the rim which opens up offensive rebounding lanes.  
  
And second half, obviously we got off to a great start, had to call a couple
of timeouts early. The press was very effective. You try to make the game a
little more Helter Skelter, and to their credit they made some 3s on us and
some of those were tough 3s. Some were wide open. But good teams make plays,
good players make plays. We've done it all year. And to their credit they just
made a few more plays than us.  
  
Q. Normally Sam and Neemias are huge weapons for you. They both kind of
had an off night. What's that like as a coach? What goes on in your mind to
kind of change that or was there panic?  
COACH SMITH: I don't think there was panic. Certainly they got us out of a
rhythm. They sped us up, without a question. I thought we looked a lot more
like ourselves the first 10 -- whatever, the first 14 -- 12 minutes of the
second half.  
  
Then we did a few uncharacteristic things, just taking some shots offensively
that we normally don't take. We tried to throw, I guess it would be an alley-
oop pass that was never there. And sometimes, that happens sometimes in these
moments.  
  
And certainly the first half I didn't have our guys set up in a position for
consistent success on the offensive end, I thought especially. I thought we
were way better the second half. We got downhill. We were in attack mode. We
shoot 16 free throws. We only shot four in the first half. We were way more
aggressive.  
  
And what people forget -- and I know our local guy, you've heard how young we
are, it's very rare we showed our youth throughout. And we had some glimpse of
that tonight. But I've coached for -- you walk in the locker room after the
game and some teams when they're done with their season they're hop-skipping
and jumping out of that locker room.  
  
And this isn't like an emotional -- it's a very emotional time, but this isn't
an emotional statement. I've coached for 23 years on really, really good
teams. I had a team that played in a national championship game. I loved
coaching those guys. I've been part of a lot of rebuilding, so to speak, where
you're doing some things for the first time.  
  
And I have never seen a team come together like this team has. Literally, if
you look back to where we were last April, May, this summer where we couldn't
throw a shot in the ocean, we're throwing the ball in the third stands of the
Spectrum on a routine basis. I'm not kidding. That's factual.  
  
And how far this team has come and just -- I wish, like, I just wish every
coach could coach a team like this. It's just -- it's just an amazing, amazing
group to be around. Not to get sidetracked, but that's what I do.  
  
I was 32 years old, I spent a full day with John Wooden. And just by -- the
late Don Meyer, who's one of the biggest influences in my life -- and he's
obviously passed away -- invited me to a coaching clinic in L.A. He does
coaching clinics all the time. And the plane ticket was like 600 bucks. I
didn't have any money. I was making, like, 25 grand. And my wife's, like, you
need to go, you need to go.  
  
We go, we land, we drive. Next thing you know we're in a residential area, and
Coach Meyer rings the doorbell and out comes John Wooden. I didn't know we
were going to see him. Spent the whole day with him. I'm 32 years old, just
got done being head coach for my first year. We had a great year. The year
before I got to Mayville, they were 1-27. We got to the national tournament,
lost.  
  
Any way, long story short -- I could tell John Wooden stories all day from
this day -- but I was, like, you always want to find your purpose as a person,
as a coach, what you value, what you believe in. If it's just about winning,
then I'm just not sure -- then it's kind of hollow.  
  
You better win or you're going to get fired. But it's kind of shallow. And I'm
32 years old. I had a full head of hair, and he was getting all these calls --
he had a phone, like, this big, like that. And you hear every voicemail --
Bill Walton would call, the late Pat Summitt called, Swen Nater called. It's
like a Who's Who.  
  
And at the end of every call, these former players would say, I love you,
Coach. And it was just like, that's what it's about. And so you go through
everything and this group, I mean, it's a band of brothers. They will be
forever connected, just their selflessness, the way they play, there's no ego.
There's no, "I need to get mine." There's just none of that.  
  
And it's just such -- even tonight when we were dead in the water, we just
kept fighting and chipping away and chipping away and gave ourselves a chance.
And we just couldn't get it done.  
  
Q. During halftime, what was it that you said to them? How did you
channel that brotherhood?  
COACH SMITH: Just rely on your training. The experiences that we went through,
that's why we play tough non-conference schedules. You go through, you learn a
lot about yourself. And you get in the league and playing and it's just
rigorous and rugged. And I mean every night out.  
  
So you've got to -- and then what's got us to this point all year and that's
-- certainly you have to have talent. But what's put us over the top is we
worked really, really hard. We have a gator mentality. We don't take
possessions off. We compete no matter what. But what really separates us is
our chemistry and just trusting each other. And we usually -- we played very,
very connected. Obviously they disrupted our connectivity just because their
active hands, their athleticism, all that, creating turnovers.  
  
And we're typically a team that really eliminates losing. And from the day we
got hired almost, I think it's one week short of a year ago now, our number
one thing is we have to eliminate losing to win.  
  
And I'm not going to talk about last year, but like we had to end possessions.
We're a top 5 rebounding team in the country. We've got to be able to protect
the paint. We're at the top 5 in two-point field goal defense in the country.
And to not turn it over and make your free throws.  
  
We go 16-for-20 from the line. We knew how to get fouled this year. And our
style of play lends to that. But certainly the one thing we didn't do to
eliminate losing was the number one key going into the game is we cannot allow
our offense to be their best offense.  
  
And with the football analogy, if you're throwing four pick-6s odds are it's
probably going to be a long night. And we threw a few pick-6s tonight.  
  
Q. I've seen a lot of Syracuse over the years, and John Chaney at
Temple. Can you put into words to a layman what it's like to -- you guys were
on a roll. I watched your Mountain West Tournament. You guys were really on a
roll. And all of a sudden this just unplugs you. Can you explain how a defense
like that can do that?  
COACH SMITH: First of all -- and Sam nailed it -- it's very difficult for us
to replicate that in practice because obviously just on our roster -- like we
know conceptually what they're doing, of course, but just our roster doesn't
lend to that.  
  
I said it tongue in cheek on one of the interviews the other day, like to
replicate Thybulle and some of those guys, like we should have had those
swimming pool noodles, like just to tip and deflect, because obviously in
practice those windows that we see are very, they're wide windows. And you
play against these guys and those windows are shrunk and just tipping and
deflecting.  
  
That's one of our goals, we want to tip and deflect like crazy. We did a good
job of that this year. It's just very, very difficult to replicate. Their
front line defense is incredibly -- it's good. They're quick to the ball.
Super active hands. Thybulle, obviously, is a game-changer on the defensive
end.  
  
And then once we got it to the back line defense, I thought we'd be able to
score and make some things happen. I felt like we had some really good looks.
Now part of it they speed you up, but I thought we just missed some --
literally just point-blank, point-blank, point-blank. And so some of that's
us. But a lot of that is them just getting us really sped up. We knew we were
going to be put in situations where we get to play two-on-one, three-on-two,
once we get past that initial line.  
  
But it's not very often that Neemias Queta goes 4-for-12. I'm not singling him
out, I'm just saying that guy's incredibly good. He's very talented. Just had
one of those nights.  
  
First or second play of the game we get it right in the heart of the defense,
two times, back-to-back plays, where Quinn Taylor gets it. We have a two-on-
one. And we could have thrown it up to Neemi for a dunk or even bounce passed
it, or he could have shot a floater. We turn it over. They tip it out and it's
going the other way.  
  
The next play, we ran that play about two plays later, same thing, Quinn kind
of -- he was trying to make the right read to Neemi. And he literally could
have walked to the rim. And it gets blocked. And so it is what it is. But it's
very difficult to prepare for. They do a great job with it. And you live and
you learn.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Iowa - 79, Cincinnati - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa head coach Fran McCaffery and student-
athletes Jordan Bohannon and Luka Garza. Questions.  
  
Q. When you were down 11 fairly early in the first half I think it was,
what did you think was the feeling of your team and was there anything you
wanted to accomplish personally to get your guys in a different mindset,
because you ended up in a different mindset?  
LUKA GARZA: I think the timeouts in that stretch when it was 18-5, those were
key. And everyone was communicating. It was a great feeling in the timeout. We
knew a couple of shots we missed. We missed a couple of chippies around the
rim, and we needed to get back and get some stops and rebound. They started to
get too many offensive rebounds.  
  
As a group individually I wanted to get inside and post up more and post
deeper. I thought in the beginning some of those guys were pushing me out of
the spots I wanted to get to. I think I did a better job of that through the
course of the game to get deeper because it's easy for them to come double or
poke me when I'm posting up 17 feet away.  
  
I tried to do a better job of that I thought as a collective group we all
tried to focus and string together some shots.  
  
Q. Would you both care to discuss the impact your zone had on them?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: I think we did a good job of just kind of getting them a
little hesitant. They're a really well-coached team and run a deliberate
offense. We knew that coming in. We started out man to start out the game and
they got a couple of easy baskets. We changed it up a little bit.  
  
I thought our press was really great tonight. They didn't know when to go or
not to go. So we did a really good job changing the pace of the game
controlling the tempo especially in the second half.  
  
LUKA GARZA: I thought we were communicating. They have terrific shooters in
Jenifer and Cumberland. And they were trying to run Jenifer to the corners and
try to get him some open looks. He hit a couple early when he was wide open.
We tried to key in on that, and we did a great job just moving around, just
making those shots tough for them.  
  
Q. What did you do to regroup after the tough stretch to end the regular
season?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: We worked really hard. It wasn't a lot of fun during that
stretch. We played really well in the beginning of the season, middle of the
season. That's life in the Big Ten. That's why we got eight teams in the NCAA
Tournament. I don't think we've lost a game in the NCAA Tournament as well.
That shows how powerful and strong this conference was.  
  
So a lot of it was just playing really good teams. And we knew that. And it
prepared us to get ready for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
LUKA GARZA: We just needed to stay confident with each other. We know what
we're capable of. We keep saying that but it's true. We know what we can do
when we play at our best. And it was great to see tonight even when they got
up we stayed composed and were able to get to play better.  
  
Q. Jordan, I'd like to ask you, what is it like for you guys to lean on
Luka in those tough situations?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: It's really easy to. He's come up big in a lot of games this
year. He was dominant down low tonight, or this morning, I guess. And we know
if we fed him the ball down low he was either going to get an easy basket,
draw a foul or kick it out.  
  
I thought he did a really good job of doing all those three things when he did
end up getting the ball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You point for the tournament, you look up and it's 18-5. What do you
say to them at that point?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think the most simple approach is -- the most logical one
is it was 35 minutes to go. So no time to panic. It could have easily been we
were up and we have to keep playing well.  
  
So we made some adjustments. We changed the defense. We changed some personnel
a little bit. You start pushing some different buttons. But I think the
critical thing is that the players maintained confidence. You don't start
screaming and yelling at them, blaming them because they didn't rotate and
block out. We talked about blockout; they had nine offensive rebounds in the
first half for 11 points.  
  
If I'm spazzing and yelling at everybody for that they're not going to lock in
on what we need to do with offense, what defense are we in, who is on the
floor for them, where is Cumberland, who do we need to get the ball to.  
  
So you just try to stay very business-like. Plenty of time, we're going to
continue to do what we do. Maybe call a different offensive set or alignment,
give them a little bit of a different look, because when you're matching up
this is what they do so well. They're pretty good at it. So if you stand and
you kind of run similar action, they're going to lock you up.  
  
So you've got to have more ball movement, more people movement, more movement
with a purpose to get better shots. And then we just needed to see it go in a
little bit there. Thankfully Isaiah made two early because we were really
struggling. It was the five that you're talking about, but eventually Luka got
going. I put TC back in after he had two fouls. He made a couple of buckets.
And Joe got a big one. We just sort of settled down. Then you felt like, okay,
we can attack this thing successfully.  
  
Q. Did you play a lot of zone this year?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: We did.  
  
Q. Why in your mind did it work so well today?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Well, sometimes you play zone because you think a zone will
work against a particular team. Sometimes you play zone to change up what
wasn't working. A man wasn't working.  
  
We felt like we could mix our pressure three-quarter court. We played a couple
different ways and then our half-court zones which we play a couple different
ways. So that would, at the very minimum, keep them in front of us so we could
see where they are. You're not guarding as much action. You can sort of
surround a painted area on a missed shot, helps you rebound.  
  
Some coaches would argue that it doesn't help you rebound. I think it does.
Keeps everybody there. And it put more pressure on them to shoot 3s. They're a
team that's pretty good at it. But tonight they were 6-for-27.  
  
Q. How much time do you spend this week coming into today that it might
feel more like a true road game being so close to Cincinnati?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Truthfully, not very much. The thing about NCAA Tournament
play, there's other teams represented here today that don't care who wins this
game. So the Tennessee people, the Colgate people, they don't care.  
  
I knew the Hawk fans would be doing the "Let's go, Hawks" cheer. I knew there
would be more Cincinnati people. But it's an NCAA game. I didn't feel like in
any way shape or form it was a road game to me.  
  
I coached in '09; we played Ohio State in Dayton. I remember like it was
yesterday and everybody from Louisville was rooting for Siena. So it's a
different kind of deal.  
  
Our guys were locked in. Every game in our league is a big stage. It's
national TV. It's an NBA arena. And we're used to being on the road. We just
played at the United Center.  
  
So the critical thing is to know and understand what do we have to do to beat
Cincinnati; what do they do well? What can we take away? What can we do to
exploit them? And not worry about who's in the 15th row yelling for one team
or another.  
  
Q. You never know how a freshman is going to respond. What is it about
Wieskamp that made him be able to be so poised?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think the thing that was impressive about him today was it
didn't start real well for him. A lot of times when that happens guys struggle
for 40 minutes. He has always done a really good job of figuring out what are
they doing to me? What are they doing to us? What can I do that's different
than what I've been doing? He's a very cerebral guy in that sense.  
  
And I think as the game progressed, you saw him become more confident in what
he was doing at both ends. He gets 19 points. Hits a huge 3. But -- huge shot
block at a very critical situation. He's just a guy that does a lot of things
to help us win. And you can count on him to make those kinds of decisions in
his head and not be a mistake guy.  
  
Q. Not that the NCAA Tournament always correctly reflects a league
strength, but what does it say about the Big Ten that you're 6-0 so far in
this tournament?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: We've been saying all year long that it's the most
competitive league in the country top to bottom. And you sort of expect Big
Ten coaches to make those kinds of statements. But the reality is we actually
believe that. And so I think it's proving it.  
  
Q. What you said before about keeping your poise on -- you're a hot-
blooded guy, a Philly guy?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: At times.  
  
Q. \-- was there a point in your career where you learned how valuable
it was to keep your poise under those kinds of circumstances, 18-5, that kind
of thing?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: Very definitely. One of my mentors, John MacLeod, he was the
best at that. And he would always say, when it gets sticky, you can't yell at
them. That's what he would say.  
  
So when you see me get hot blooded, there are various reasons for that, and it
happens despite what some people might think, very rarely. It doesn't happen
very much in practice. It doesn't happen much in the locker room, at halftime.
Oh, that coach went in there and yelled at them. No.  
  
But at crunch time and in key moments of the game, you can't lose your mind
and start yelling at them. It's only going to lead to more mistakes. At that
point you need to build confidence.  
  
Q. Three big scores in the second half underneath out-of-bounds, two of
them from out of a timeout -- a Garza 3, a Baer 3, and then you get a Garza
layup. Those go-to sets for you guys out of bounds or did that come out of the
timeouts?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: They're go-to sets for us. But the difference is you can run
certain action. But then you can move people around in that action. So it
might look different. So we ran a typically action but we moved things around.
And that's how Luka got the 3 in particular. He's not usually in that spot,
usually a guard or a perimeter guard.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Tennessee - 77, Colgate - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colgate head coach Matt Langel and student-
athletes Will Rayman and Jordan Burns. Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jordan, what was it like to have the kind of game that you had on
this kind of stage?  
JORDAN BURNS: It feels great. We came into this game knowing how good we were
as a team. And to be able to go out there and show people how good we really
are was great.  
  
Q. Will, what was the difference in the second half when you started to
make a little bit of a run, came from a deficit, got back in front? What were
the things that were working for Colgate at that point?  
WILL RAYMAN: It was pretty much just sticking to the game plan and forcing
them to take tough shots and getting rebounds. In the first half we let up way
too many offensive rebounds and that kind of messed up the first half.  
  
And the second half, we were getting those rebounds that we were missing the
first half and we were making shots. We were swinging the ball. We were
playing team basketball like we have for the past 11 games.  
  
Q. This is a big place. Nationwide Arena is huge. It's not Hamilton. But
the maroon you could visibly see. You could hear everybody. Were you aware
that you had so much support in the stands, and of course watching at home,
but right here in Ohio?  
JORDAN BURNS: Definitely, we knew we had so much support. We have the best
fans in the country. That's what we think. We pack out Cotterell Court as much
as we can, and we love these guys, all the people that come out and watch us
play. We definitely felt it tonight.  
  
WILL RAYMAN: It's great to see all those people coming out. I only knew that
the football team was going to be there, so to see that whole section full was
really unbelievable. And we're a small school, but we have a lot of people
that really care about the school. So it just shows.  
  
Q. Jordan, I just talked to your dad in the concourse. Everyone's kind
of looking toward next year already -- maybe a second back-to-back NCAA
Tournament appearance like the '90s. Your thoughts on that?  
JORDAN BURNS: Honestly, we're just going to get back to work after today.
We're just going to get back in the gym, work hard for next season and we'll
discuss goals and things at the end of the year.  
  
Q. It looked like you guys were just enjoying it so much. Can you just
talk about -- can you just explain the sheer joy factor of what that was like
being out there today?  
JORDAN BURNS: Yeah, of course. Our coaches at the time, playing with house
money, and he was just saying just go out there, have fun, we have nothing to
lose. It was great going out there with this big crowd and being able to stay
in the game and almost winning the game. It was amazing.  
  
We felt like coming into this game it was going to be a close one even though
most people in the country didn't. So we expected this. So that's why we were
really excited. And unfortunately we were unable to pull it off, but we had a
great showing.  
  
WILL RAYMAN: I mean, just personally I love playing basketball. I'm always
happy when I'm playing. And I know we all do. That's why we do this every day.
That's why we play at this level. Just like to be out there on the national
stage, this is it.  
  
Like this is what you dream about as a kid. This is what you watch on TV. This
is the best stage to do it in. And we were just all having a really good time
out there.  
  
Q. Jordan, it seemed like earlier in the game they were talking to you
while you were driving and moving around. What were they saying and what was
it like to see it as the game went on?  
JORDAN BURNS: The Tennessee players? I mean, that happens with a lot of
schools. It's just talking, getting into the game and things. We're
competitors out there. So guys on the other side, you want to try to get in
each other's head. And it was fun. It was all fun and games. It's during the
game, just during the flow.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible)?  
JORDAN BURNS: Just them. Nothing really drives me besides my team. They keep
me driving regardless what anybody says.  
  
Q. Jordan, growing up watching this thing and the "One Shining Moment"
and the montage and all that, and obviously you're probably going to be a part
of that, did you feel like you were going to have something special today? Did
you wake up out of bed and think this is going to be it?  
JORDAN BURNS: I felt like today was going to be a special day, definitely,
with my dad being able to see me play for the first time in a while. So it was
great having him here, having all my family here. So I definitely feel like
today was a special day. And it was, obviously.  
  
Q. Jordan, elaborate on the moment you had with your dad after the game.
You climbed over the press row area there to enjoy a moment with your dad.
Just tell us what that was like.  
JORDAN BURNS: I haven't seen my dad in a couple months. My parents -- my mom
and my brothers came up last week for the championship game. But he wasn't
able to make it because of work. Just being able to see his face and give him
a hug and tell him I love him was amazing.  
  
Q. You were without one of your best players, some kind of eye issue.
What kind of effect did that have on you guys?  
JORDAN BURNS: Honestly it didn't have much of an effect. Everyone on our team
is good enough to step up at any given time. We work for these moments, for
guys being out and stuff. So we were ready. If he wasn't ready to play,
another guy was going to step up and play tonight. And that's what happened
tonight.  
  
WILL RAYMAN: Exactly what he said.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH LANGEL: Obviously a fantastic NCAA basketball game. I thought the venue
was terrific. The hospitality has been unbelievable. I thought the fans and
the energy in the building was everything you dreamed it could be.  
  
Specific to the game, it kind of went as planned other than obviously your
heart goes out to Rapolas. He woke up with a bout of pink eye this morning. It
just wasn't happening.  
  
You have a mix of emotions; you're proud of your team and happy that we fought
so hard to make such an exciting game, but you're disappointed for the result.
And your heart breaks for Rapolas, who without him we wouldn't be able to get
there.  
  
It speaks to the character and the makeup of the team I gets to coach and
that's who they are. Jordan Burns missed five games with a pretty significant
ankle injury and the guys just kept moving forward. And they kept getting
better over the course of the season, and as a coach you want nothing more
than that.  
  
I gotta give Tennessee credit. They had all the pressure. Jordan joked that I
said we were playing with house money. But we dealt with that pressure going
into the end of the regular season and into our conference tournament. We have
one chance to get here.  
  
So as the game got tight and close, I thought Tennessee managed it really
well. Obviously Schofield stepped up and made huge corner jump shots. It ends
up being the difference in the game. We turned it over a couple more times
than we would have liked and gave up a couple more offensive rebounds than we
would have liked.  
  
But for the most part we got to show who we are and what we can do and made
some good plays to get some open shots and stepped up and knocked them down.  
  
Q. Down 16 in the first half and then without the services of Rapolas
Ivanauskas in the second half. To battle back and take the lead in the second
half and battle all the way down the stretch, does anything surprise you about
this team?  
COACH LANGEL: No, you've been with us every step of the way. And I think
you've seen the myriad of ways that this group has found a way to battle and
compete and it's been different guys in different moments. And they do it
together and they believe in one another.  
  
Again, I've never coached a team that gives each other more high-5s than this
group. We can do any shooting drill or be down 15 or up two or whatever,
they're just constantly there for one another. So nothing surprises me.  
  
Obviously I'm immensely proud of their effort, and I think part -- Rap
couldn't see great and we stuck with him because he's a huge part of our team.
But part of getting down was him being out there, he couldn't catch the ball
clean, couldn't see great. And in some ways the group rallied behind him and
for one another.  
  
Q. For the first 36 minutes they took open 3s and for the most part
didn't make them. And Bone hit one and Schofield hit three. How much of the
kind of the result is just them bucking that trend?  
COACH LANGEL: I think a lot of it. The game plan wasn't just let them shoot
3s, but obviously they dominate in the paint in the SEC, and they're number
one in the country for a stint this season because of their ability to do what
they do.  
  
So we knew if we just kind of played them, didn't pack it in a little bit and
change defenses and help and show them a crowd and give up hopefully some
late-contested 3-point shots that our chances weren't great. So that was part
of the game plan was to hope that they would miss enough for it to be close
enough for us to steal, and give those guys credit.  
  
Bone is -- he's a really talented guy, but he also runs his team. And I think
he and Turner to combine nine assists, just two turnovers is a huge part of
the game. And Schofield stepped up and made those shots, and Bone made a huge
one, too.  
  
Q. Was there a time during the game when you thought we could really
pull this off? And secondly with Ivanauskas's eye issue, what did you do to
try to -- was there anything you could do about it -- just pink eye and you
have to hope his vision clears somehow?  
COACH LANGEL: Our medical staff, they didn't think anybody thought it was
going to be an issue. He had his glasses on all through the morning and he
went to put his contacts in and he was just really struggling, struggling to
get his contacts in to see.  
  
I think they tried a variety of different things, medications and ice and
cleaning the lenses and all those things. And just, in the second half he
tried to warm up at halftime and just said he couldn't go.  
  
I think the other question you asked was did I ever think we were going to get
-- yeah, the whole time. As a coach that's what you think. Our staff worked
like crazy since Sunday to try and prepare a plan that our guys could execute
to win the game.  
  
And so when you're down double figures, you're searching for things to do. And
without Rap out there, we had to make some changes on the fly. But it also
gave us some advantages because they had -- with forwards and centers on our
guards. So it allowed us to drive a little bit more and create some passing
lanes and some ball screens/switching opportunities that, to be honest, we
don't usually use.  
  
And our guys stepped up and played great. They played their hearts out and
they made some shots. And again you're just trying to continue to hang in
there, hang in there, hang in there, and hope that you can get enough stops
and make enough shots down the stretch to steal a game like that.  
  
Q. Eight years now at Colgate. You've taken these incremental steps:
conference championship last year; you win the conference championship; you
get here this year. Can you call it a program now and a new culture in
Hamilton and at Colgate based on what's been going on and are you ready to
make the next step now in another year?  
COACH LANGEL: Yeah, I mean, our goal every step of the way -- I've been
fortunate to have a staff with me most of that whole time. And we've got
another assistant coach who played for us. So he's been with us most of the
time, is we're just trying to constantly get better. And so that goes to every
aspect of what we do, whether it's helping our players get better, our
recruiting efforts, whatever it may be. I'm really proud of how Colgate and
Hamilton rallied around. They're two really small communities. You're talking
a couple thousand people.  
  
And for them to show up here in Columbus like they were able to, it means a
lot to me personally. I do feel good about the program we've built. And I told
the seniors in our locker room, as they were exiting, they don't get to put
the uniform on anymore, but they should be really proud and hopefully will be
for some time of the program that they've helped build.  
  
And I hope -- one of my goals when I got here was that Colgate basketball
would become generational; that guys who wore the uniform in the '70s and '80s
and '90s would want to know these guys, and these guys, as they move forward,
would want to come back and follow the team and be a part of our program,
because to me that's what makes it special.  
  
Q. I don't know if bittersweet is the right word, but the moment for
Jordan afterward, he fights to the end of the game, makes those two 3s, and if
immediately goes to his family there. What was your kind of perspective on
that moment and did you have a chance to kind of say anything to him?  
COACH LANGEL: No. I didn't get to -- obviously you've been around our team for
a few days here. Jordan's a talented individual. And he's driven in a lot of
ways. And one of those things that drives him is his love for his family and
their love for him.  
  
I feel really good that I get to coach, not just Jordan, but a lot of guys who
come from those backgrounds, who their families give them to us to be their
Colgate basketball family for a little bit. And as important as that is to the
guys on our team, their families are always number one. And I think that's the
way life should be. Not everybody gets to have that opportunity. And it's
special in Jordan. It's a big part of who he is.  
  
But the same goes for just about everybody else on our team. So I feel very
fortunate to coach guys like that who have those relationships and care so
deeply about their loved ones.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Washington - 78, Utah State - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Washington head coach Mike Hopkins and student-
athletes Jaylen Nowell and Noah Dickerson. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH HOPKINS: Proud of our guys. We came out in the first half and Utah State
hit us in the face early. And our guys showed a lot of poise. David got us on
the board with his first 3. And then we were able to settle down about the
six-minute mark.  
  
And I thought our defense was really, really good especially on Sam Merrill.
He's one of the best players in the country. We had to make sure we limited
him. And I think he was scoreless in the first half, which was a big part of
our halftime lead.  
  
And obviously, offensively, in the first half, Noah Dickerson. When he's on,
he's one of the best big guys if not the best back-to-the-basket big guy in
the country. We shared the ball.  
  
And then second half, guys, they came out like any championship team as Utah
State, great coach, great players, they came right back. In this thing,
there's so many different swings. And they cut the game all the way to one.
Defensively, you know, we hold them to 26 percent, 30 from 3 and 81 from the
foul line. But they went to the foul line 16 times.  
  
But it's our defense, guys. When we're playing defense, high level, sometimes
our defense is our best offense. And we took every swing that they got and we
stayed poised and we stayed together and we came out with a win. Very proud of
these guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Jaylen, all the players in here yesterday were talking with such
respect for their top scorer. What did you guys do to limit him?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: Well, first off, Sam is a really good player. And we really
just made sure that wherever he was we had everyone know where he is. We were
talking. Every time he made a backdoor cut, every time he cut behind our
defense, we made sure we knew exactly where he was. That's kind of how we were
able to hold him to ten points.  
  
Q. Noah, were there any panic feelings when obviously your team was in
foul trouble there and your rhythm was broken up by that as well as your usual
rotation heading down the stretch?  
NOAH DICKERSON: Not at all. In practice we have so many different lineups, and
it's the next guy up, next-guy-up mentality. Jamal came in here, did what he
had to do. And Naz came in, gave us great minutes. And we are a great team and
we all do it together.  
  
Q. You just won a game in March Madness, not everybody gets to do. How
does it feel?  
NOAH DICKERSON: It feels really good actually. When I was a little kid I used
to watch this tournament all the time hoping one day I would have a chance to
play in it. And now I do. And it's just special, a special opportunity.  
  
Q. Jaylen, teams always look different. You can watch them on video all
you want. But once the game actually starts and the reality sets in as to what
they are, it becomes a different game. What did you see in the first five
minutes as you guys initially struggled that was much different than what you
suspected it would be when you were just watching on video?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: Well, they played a lot more physical than we thought they did.
They came out, like Coach said, they really punched us in the mouth with their
physicality. We were stunned by that, but we made sure that -- we just made
sure that we were able to continue to keep playing as hard as we can. And when
they pushed us, we just have to push back.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. You obviously were looking at video of Utah State much more lengthy
than the players were, but what did you notice?  
COACH HOPKINS: You know, at the end of the day, I've got to give our staff an
incredible amount of credit. These guys watched more film. They were so
prepared and ready for these guys. And these kids, it goes back to executing
your game plan. So when you see a guy like Sam Merrill, who -- he can shoot
it, he can pass it, he's intelligent. They're so well-coached. Their ball
movement is as good as anybody in the country. They've got shooters -- Brock
Miller, every time he got the ball I was a nervous wreck over there. He's just
an incredible shooter.  
  
And then Queta, what can you say about him? He's one of the best players in
the country that nobody knows about, and everybody knows about him tonight.  
  
And so we knew the challenge was going to be very, very difficult. And we were
able to just shut them down as much as possible. And Jaylen had said, and
Noah, we try to prepare them for anything, anything that they might come at us
with. And for us, we're a good team when everybody participates.  
  
And it's been a different guy every night. Today Naz Carter hit two big 3s
when the game was tight. And he's prepared. He works. And Jamal Bey had to
come in; we lost our point guard for the last eight minutes. They're pressing.
We haven't been the best team against pressure.  
  
And just so proud of the guys, because they were ready. They were together.
And they were poised.  
  
Q. Thybulle picked up his fourth foul. Was there hesitation as to what
to do there?  
COACH HOPKINS: Had to get him back in. He makes the game different for
anybody, and when you play against a team that has great ball movement, and
they get good offensive rhythm, you're going to be in trouble. And he disrupts
rhythm. He disrupts offensive rhythm. You gotta think about him everywhere
when he's on the court; he's blocking, he's stealing. I think he's the
national defensive player of the year. And when he's on the court there's a
different air of confidence with our defense. And just happy he was able to
stay out and not get his fifth foul.  
  
Q. And hit a big shot?  
COACH HOPKINS: And hit a huge shot.  
  
Q. How does your first tournament win at Washington compare to the first
one you had as an assistant at Syracuse?  
COACH SMITH: As a player or a coach at Syracuse?  
  
Q. As a coach.  
COACH HOPKINS: As a coach at Syracuse, my first year was '95-'96. We went to
the national championship game against Kentucky. And it was one of those
things as a coach your first time doing it. And getting that first feeling.
And when you're trying to build a program to where we were and where we want
to be, it's not only great for the seniors that stayed with it and have showed
the way for the underclassmen, but it's a way for the underclassmen, the next
one up, to feel the excitement and feel the crowd and to see what it's like to
play in the greatest sporting event on planet earth.  
  
And it's a feeling you never want to give away. And so this elevates where we
want to be. We didn't come here to get in the NCAA Tournament. The greatest
thing that makes this great tournament is you have a chance to win a national
championship. It doesn't matter if you're a 16. Doesn't matter if you're a 15.
Doesn't matter if you're a 14. You have a chance to win a national
championship.  
  
And I think -- I know our standard is going to be that's what we fight for.
That's what we do, when we're in the trenches, on the rowers, when we're
riding those hills and trying to build a team, that's who we are. And I'm just
excited to get that win and show those guys if we execute and we play together
we can accomplish anything.  
  
Q. You mentioned Noah being one of the better back-to-the-basket type
players when he's on. Early in the game he did get going. Was that by design
or was that something that kind of grew organically, I guess, within the game
plan?  
COACH HOPKINS: A week ago -- if you watched him last year when we played
Arizona with Deandre Ayton, he had 28 and whatever, the thing this year and
where he's sacrificed, where he's made us better is teams are double- and
triple-teaming him. He sacrificed a lot for the betterment of the team.  
  
And tonight they played him man-to-man. Early they doubled and we capitalized
on it because he's a great passer if he's willing to. And he did.  
  
And then when they played him man-to-man he's a problem. And having that
option, that weapon down there, he's hard to guard. And we're lucky to have
him on our team, I can tell you that. So, yes, by design. We play inside/out.  
  
Q. When Utah State cut it within a point, I thought Carter hit two
really big 3-pointers. Was that kind of by design, or he just had open
looks?  
COACH HOPKINS: At the end of the day, what was going to happen, we knew --
they do a great job of packing the paint. They're one of the best two-point-
field-goal percentage defensive teams in the country. They go in the boxes and
elbows.  
  
We knew they would double team. We knew we would get open shots if we were
patient and we moved the ball. And then it comes down to -- sometimes coaches,
in press conferences, we didn't make shots tonight. Well, we made them
tonight. Like you said, I thought that was a big part of the game, the two 3s,
and he stepped in, wide-open shots, and that's when we're at our best. Those
are the shots we make when we make 3s.  
  
So it was the unselfish passing and guys looking for each other. And Naz
Carter is probably one of the hardest workers on our team. And to see him have
those moments was pretty special.  
  
Q. Obviously you don't like to talk about yourself, but can you give us
one example how this experience is different than being an assistant coach in
a big game like this?  
COACH HOPKINS: Do you see my hairline? I lost a lot of real estate the last
two years and a lot of sleep. But you know what, listen, I've dreamt my whole
life of being in this position. When you dream it and you get an opportunity,
it's special, can't lie to you. But I've always believed and surrounded myself
with great people. My mom and dad stressed that my whole life. I did that with
Jen, Shaundell, the University of Washington, and coach kids I love to coach,
and just trying to give them everything I know and try to learn more to give
them more. And that's what it's all about. That's what makes college
basketball coaching so special. All these moments and then dreams do come
true.  
  
Q. They say the 18 inches you move over in a chair is the biggest 18
inches in sports, would you agree?  
COACH HOPKINS: I don't know. I've been a basketball coach my whole life. I
think that's the easy part. It's the organization, running a business, it's
doing all those things. Basketball, I get there, I'm a nervous wreck before I
go out there. When I go out there, I roll up my sleeves; I feel like I'm
playing. I've got four coaches and a staff that feel like they're playing,
too. We're aligned and we're together, and that's what makes it special. It's
just been an incredible run, and there's more to come.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Justin Jenifer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36831)

### [Trevon Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36951)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Iowa - 79, Cincinnati - 72  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Cincinnati head coach Mick Cronin and student-
athletes Trevon Scott and Justin Jenifer. Questions?  
  
Q. Justin, that moment walking off the floor, Coach Cronin grabbed you
and Cane and gave you a big hug, looked like. How tough of a moment, I guess
how thankful of a moment are you to share that with your head coach?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: I'm very appreciative. Everything that I've done throughout my
four years here is devoted to Coach. Like I said previously, he done stayed on
me all four years no matter what it was, if it was off the court or on the
court. Like I said, I'm very appreciative of what he has done for me.  
  
Q. Justin, you're up 18-5. At some point they switch to a zone. How much
did that affect you guys?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: We knew that coming into the game. We knew that we was going
to start off at man and they were going to go to zone. So we were prepared for
that. Some shots didn't go in and that's part of the game.  
  
Q. Tre, how much did foul trouble on Naz take you out of what you wanted
to do in the first half there and the second half as well?  
TREVON SCOTT: It affected us a lot. But in my opinion, it was plenty of games
where we had to go to different lineups like that and we came out successful.
So that's what's so frustrating about the loss. We didn't get it done today
like we usually do.  
  
But if Naz, if he would have fought through, played smarter, stayed in, I
don't know the outcome of the game would have been different. But he played
hard. He was trying. We just came up short.  
  
Q. Justin, once the three-quarter pressure, half-court pressure kind of
picked up, you guys were getting shots much later in the shot clock. Was that
a direct result of that pressure or was it something that you were trying to
do in the first half?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: Well, we was told to attack. When somebody presses you you're
supposed to attack, not lay back. It was like a 50/50. Sometimes we attacked
and sometimes we just laid back. And when we laid back it involved turnovers
and led to layups. And that was a big piece to the game. And that was a big
turn to them getting the lead.  
  
Q. You had such a great year. In some ways an unexpected year from
outsiders. To have an early NCAA exit, can you describe what that feels like
right now?  
TREVON SCOTT: It's tough. A lot of people doubted us. A lot of people said we
probably wouldn't have got to where we are at today. But we stayed together.
We had a great head man right here, Coach Cronin, in front of us, listening.  
  
But it's tough going out. Every team has goals and this was not part of our
goals. But the toughest part of it is losing Justin and Cane. We owe
everything this whole season to these guys. I appreciate you for everything.  
  
JUSTIN JENIFER: Love you, bro.  
  
TREVON SCOTT: Love you, too, bro. It's just frustrating.  
  
JUSTIN JENIFER: I'd say it's tough. I didn't picture that we were going to
lose this game today. I pictured my senior year still going on. But you know
at the end of the day, you know, it happened.  
  
And I couldn't be more proud of the guys even though that was with me through
the whole way. And as long as they believed in me I believed in them and
that's what makes us such a family.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach. You can make a statement.  
  
COACH CRONIN: I would like to congratulate Iowa. I thought that -- you know,
they were a Top 25 team most of the year. Obviously Fran's a friend of mine.
Whatever happened, happened. He had to miss a few games. That threw them off.  
  
They got a great coach. And I have nothing but tremendous respect for them and
their program and the way they do things. So I think it's important to make
sure that I point that out.  
  
So as far as today's game, guys, we're not going to win when we give up 79
points. I don't remember the last time Cincinnati has won a game where we've
given up 79. Some of you guys might be able to research it. Now, they're a
great offensive team. Somebody referenced it earlier, in the plus/minus, we're
plus-12 in the 20 minutes Nysier Brooks played.  
  
We didn't have the depth on the front line, obviously, to deal with their guys
on the interior. I thought that was probably the biggest difference in the
game, if you're going to ask me what the difference in the game was.  
  
Second thing is I thought we took some questionable shots that are out of
character for us. We played and got into -- got the game going at a pace that
we couldn't set our defense enough. And we got a little too concerned with our
offense. And whether it was their zone, their pressure or whatever the case
may be, we got our mind off of defense.  
  
We gave up a 3 on an out-of-bounds play. We're first or second in the country
in out-of-bounds defense. We usually are every year. We have to be because
we're not running around with lottery picks.  
  
So last thing I would say is you heard these guys talk. So that's what I'm
most proud of. You listen to Justin, I knew who he was four years ago. I've
done my job -- sit here listen him talk like that.  
  
Tre is unbelievable as well. Great kids. We had an unbelievable season. Had a
tremendous season. Obviously tough situation to have to play a team that was
ranked in the Top 25 in the first round more weeks than we were. And we won
our conference championship.  
  
But again I'm just a believer that the tournament's about winning it anyway.
You've got to win six to win it. So I would have the same thoughts if we lose
game 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5.  
  
Q. Did you think your guys didn't attack that zone enough --  
COACH CRONIN: I do not think offense had anything to do with our demise. We
shot -- I thought we shot too many 3s five, six feet behind the line. We did
take some shots that I thought were questionable.  
  
I don't think it was their zone that caused it. I think it was decisions by
us. And, again, it's a get-it-done world. We talked a lot about not taking the
bait on those shots and making sure that we threw one more pass and got them
in the closeout and try to beat them off the dribble.  
  
We didn't do a good enough job on that. But, again, they shot 54 percent for
the game, almost 55 percent. So we had some egregious errors defensively. We
let some of our offensive -- we won games we shot 26 percent from the field at
SMU.  
  
So stuff happens on offense. But I thought we let it affect our defensive
energy. But we did take some questionable shots.  
  
Q. Other than Brooks being on the bench at the end of the first half,
was there anything you saw that helped them close that lead going into
halftime?  
COACH CRONIN: We weren't going to shut them out. I think you've got to give
credit to people. I thought they made a few shots where they drove the paint,
stopped, pivoted two or three times and made a tough play.  
  
Obviously you can't converge too much because they've got shooters running
around the line. Those are hard plays. They made a few of those -- I think,
Bohannon's shot at the end of the half was a great example. Made another one
in the second half where he pivoted two or three times. I thought he drug his
pivot foot. Of course I'm going to think that; I'm the opposing coach. The
film will tell me whether I'm right or not. They're a great offensive team for
a reason. They have been all year.  
  
Q. You win 28 games. You win the conference tournament championship. But
you will be judged, and you know this, by what happened today. Do you have any
comment on that?  
COACH CRONIN: I judge -- just so you know -- I'm judged by the guys who were
sitting up here, that's who -- that's my concern.  
  
Q. You talked yesterday about not taking these tournament appearances
for granted, and your first appearance being here in Columbus. So as a coach,
a coaching staff, where do you go from here after, like you said, another
season where you win a conference but an early exit?  
COACH CRONIN: Back to work -- with a lot of pride, by the way. Back to work
with a lot of pride.  
  
Q. You obviously knew that Garza could shoot the ball. Were you
surprised they went to him as much as they did, especially when they were
down?  
COACH CRONIN: Not in the low post, I wasn't.  
  
Q. Outside?  
COACH CRONIN: A couple of the 3s that he made were pretty deep. I mean we
talked about he would shoot it -- I think he made 19 on the year. So, I mean,
we talked about he would shoot it if we didn't guard him out there.  
  
But his size, obviously, bothered us in the low post. He's a guy, if he
catches it deep -- I told our guys he's like the two big guys for Portland and
Denver in the pros; may not jump high, but he can really use his body and
hands around the basket and get it in.  
  
Q. Question about the crowd. Obviously playing so close to home, what
did you think of it --  
COACH CRONIN: We have great fans. Not a surprise at all. Appreciate all of
them. Hope everybody gets home safe. They've been great all year. I think we
were sold out season tickets this year. We have great support in our program.  
  
Q. You talked all week about wanting -- about you would love to take big
shots above anything else. And then yesterday you talked about watching Iowa
hit 3s on film. When they started hitting the second half, was that kind of
all those --  
COACH CRONIN: We had two minute breakdowns. Those are things you can control.
We didn't control that. So at the end of the day I take responsibility for
that.  
  
There were some things that we did -- I'm not going to mention names of guys
-- but we just had breakdowns. We fell asleep on some guys. The thing about
our defense is we're supposed to be in the passing lane. So if you help, the
guy has to go backdoor. We don't give up direct passes out for the 3. So that
was the breakdown.  
  
And we fell asleep on that out-of-bounds play, and we fell asleep just to let
Jordan Bohannon shoot one in our face. But they put 40 minutes of offensive
pressure on your defense. At the end of the day our defense wasn't good enough
today.  
  
Q. Anything you said to Justin and Cane there at the end that you're
willing to share?  
COACH CRONIN: I challenged those guys this summer when we started up. And
whenever our eight weeks started in the summer, I challenged them that there's
a difference between getting on the bus and getting on the bus to make sure
your team wins.  
  
And I don't think -- I learned this from my dad years ago as a high school
coach: you're never going to win with bad seniors. It's never going to happen.
Your seniors have got to be bought in, whether they're role players, scorers,
defenders, whatever, they've got to be the guys. And so I put the heat on them
and they met the challenge.  
  
I put the heat on them now in the summer because obviously they were just
getting on the bus. And their desire to win to make sure that this program did
not drop off, that we kept winning games, we did things the right way, all the
things I ask veteran guys to do on our team that Gary Clark and Kyle did the
year before; they did it all. They did everything I asked of them.  
  
So I just told them I loved them. Obviously they're not the most talented
players in the world. Okay? Cane got recruited by Sacred Heart. Justin is my
size. When I'm hugging guys that are almost my size, it tells you. For those
guys, they accomplished -- what their team accomplished would not have
happened if they weren't totally all in this year. That's been a trademark of
our program, from Justin Jackson and guys like Sean Kilpatrick, back further
and further.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

E.J. Crawford, Rickey McGill and Asante Gist. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH CLUESS: I want to congratulate North Carolina on the win. A hard-fought
game. Our guys were really excited to play in this game, and I'm really proud
of the effort that they put out and how hard they played for 40 minutes.  
  
I'm going to miss Rickey McGill a lot. We've gone through a lot over the last
four years, and I can't tell you how proud I am of him. And I'm also very,
very proud of the other two gentlemen up here, plus the rest of my team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Rickey, could you talk about that first half, the way you guys came
out?  
RICKEY MCGILL: We just came out ready to play. We knew they was going to come
out and try and get a win over us, try and beat us by a lot. So for us to come
out like the way we did, that was a big one. And then things changed.  
  
Q. Rickey, obviously last year a 16 beat a 1. How much was that on your
mind, especially after the first half, as well as you played?  
RICKEY MCGILL: We definitely had confidence with that. We all know UMBC beat
Virginia by 20. We came out, tried to prove the world the same thing, tried to
get the upset.  
  
Q. E.J., seemed like North Carolina tried to change their defense in the
second half to try to clog the middle, you were getting frustrated going down
the lane. And they put a lot more energy on their offense. What changed in the
second half?  
E.J. CRAWFORD: They just made an adjustment on me. And that's really what they
did, made an adjustment, yeah.  
  
Q. Rickey, Coach Williams was in here saying some nice things about you.
What did he and what did some of the North Carolina players say to you on the
handshake line?  
RICKEY MCGILL: They were just telling me, heck of a game. You're going to be
something special. Just keep going, don't ever quit.  
  
Q. Looked like a very emotional moment when you walked off the court for
Iona the last time. Your encounter with Coach Cluess, what was that like?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Like he said, me and him have been through so much, through
practice, through the arguments, through everything. I'm going to miss playing
for him. Just miss playing -- just miss playing for a great coach.  
  
Q. Rickey, just overall, the memories of four years, four NCAA
Tournaments, when you look at your legacy on this program, how do you feel you
were ultimately defined?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Just one of the hardest workers to ever come out of Iona. Not
to sound cocky or nothing, but from where I came from as a freshman to now
just shows how much I care about this game.  
  
Q. Rickey, how much of the idea playing in your final NCAA Tournament
contribute to your performance tonight, and what has these last four years
meant to you being at Iona?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Tonight, I just knew I had to give my all, all or nothing for
40 minutes. I knew I couldn't give up on my guys. I had to come out, give it
my all, try and get a win. For the last four years it's just a blessing. It's
just a blessing, man.  
  
Q. Asante, as you prepared for this game and saw videotape, how
unrealistic is that once you actually see the length of a team like
Carolina?  
ASANTE GIST: It was an adjustment for us. Our confidence is not like that. To
go against a team, they were packing the lane on us. It was difficult to
drive. Coach told us to move the ball. And we were going to get attack lanes
after a couple of passes.  
  
And it worked for us in the first half. And second half it worked for us, too,
we just couldn't make some shots and we couldn't get back in transition. And
they killed us on the boards; that was a big thing as well.  
  
I'm still proud of my guys how we played and I'm proud of us for the season we
had.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. What do you say about the team's effort in the first half on both
ends of the court?  
COACH CLUESS: It was terrific. I wish we could have done it for two halves. I
think they gave it everything they could on both ends of the court. In the
first half, couldn't have asked for anything more.  
  
Q. Second half, looked like North Carolina changed their defense. They
clogged the middle when Crawford would go down the lane, and they were just
much more aggressive on offense. Was there anything you could do or was it
just something you see happening?  
COACH CLUESS: You need to make shots. We had a lot of open looks. And I
couldn't ask for better shots. They didn't fall tonight. Some of our better
shooters, especially in the second half, missed wide-open shots.  
  
But on the other end they started playing on all cylinders and they started
attacking the rim much harder, got down the court in hurry. Tajuan Agee being
in foul trouble most of the game obviously was a hindrance to us because we
don't have a luxury of having a lot of depth and that really hurt us as well.
And all credit to North Carolina. They're a great team.  
  
Q. What did you say to Rickey when you took him out? And if you can, how
much did he mean to this program over four years? What are you going to miss
about him?  
COACH CLUESS: I thanked him for the four years and through everything we've
been through, watch his development. And I told him I'm there for him the rest
of his life, no matter what he needs, on or off the court, to help him out.  
  
He's meant a tremendous amount to our program over these last four years. He's
going to be the model when we bring players in and recruit players that I want
to use, how somebody came in not highly recruited, really didn't do much as a
freshman, and built himself up to the level he did and was part of four
championship teams and four NCAA teams.  
  
So what better way to, like, talk about a program and a team except using
Rickey McGill as an example?  
  
Q. I know in the past you told your guys don't die wondering. And they
don't have to wonder for the rest of their lives how they would have done. How
do you feel they did that?  
COACH CLUESS: I think they gave us everything they have. No one's going to say
this, but E.J. Crawford's had the flu for the last two days. Just the fact he
was out there playing was tremendous by him to come out and try to give us
what he could. He wasn't able to practice yesterday and that hurt our team.
And I feel bad for him because he's worked so hard.  
  
But they have nothing at all to be ashamed about. They should have their heads
high. Like I told them, we're extremely proud of what they did this year.
Iona's extremely proud of it. And hopefully anyone who watched us play enjoyed
what they saw.  
  
THE MODERATORK: I know you didn't have the second half that you wish you had,
but as you will look back on that tape for years to come, you'll see how hard
they were still playing in the second half. It's been a great story for us to
follow. Thank you.

### [Rick Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13674)

### [Jordan Bone](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34947)

### [Jordan Bowden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34991)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
Tennessee - 77, Colgate - 70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee head coach Rick Barnes and student-
athletes Jordan Bone and Jordan Bowden. Questions for the players.  
  
Q. Jordan Bone, how were you able to keep your composure when they were
making a bunch of shots and everybody in the arena was rooting for Cinderella?
How were you able to not panic?  
JORDAN BONE: I want to say first this was a really good team. They fought
super hard. And we couldn't appreciate that honestly any more.  
  
I feel like this team was prepared to come into this game. I feel like we
understood going into the game that it was going to be tough, understanding
that especially this time of the year is very important, it's very critical --
and towards when we understood that it was going to be a tight game.  
  
We just wanted to put them in long possessions, make them guard a little
longer and just execute what we do. We know we've been in tougher positions
earlier this year. So the key thing is just never get rattled, understand how
hard we worked to get to this point, so there's no reason to get rattled, but
more importantly just executing our game plan.  
  
Q. What made Jordan Burns so difficult to guard today?  
JORDAN BOWDEN: He was hitting tough shots. We tried to limit his touches down
to the end. And we had good defense on him -- Lamonté Turner was playing good,
tight defense on him. He was just hitting tough shots. And that's what we
tried to do.  
  
Q. Do you think a game like this, instead of having just a blowout in
the first game, could serve you well as the tournament progresses?  
JORDAN BONE: Absolutely. Like I mentioned earlier, they put up a tough fight.
This wasn't an easy game. We knew that it was going to be like that going into
this game. I feel like they prepared us well for our upcoming game against
Iowa.  
  
So we just have to understand, going into the Iowa game, it's going to be
another tough matchup. It's going to be very similar. And we have to execute
our game plan.  
  
Q. Coming down the stretch, nine of your last 10 opponents were NCAA
Tournament teams. How much do you think that helped you guys prepare for the
kind of competition you were going to see this month? Nine of the last 10
teams you played were NCAA Tournament teams. Just playing that kind of
schedule at the end of the year, how do you think that's helped you guys?  
JORDAN BOWDEN: It helped us a lot. We've been in tough battles the whole year.
A team like Colgate, like Bone said, they prepared us for Iowa. And
(indiscernible) just about us executing the game plan and doing what we do.  
  
Q. Could you describe what the emotions are like when you're playing
against Cinderella and everybody is rooting for them and against you?  
JORDAN BONE: I feel like there wasn't much emotions. We were excited to play.
I feel like on our end there was a lot of anxiety towards the beginning of the
game. We were kind of just ready to play because we didn't like the way we
ended the season and the championship game against Auburn.  
  
So we were all just ready to go out there and compete. We were very anxious. I
feel like the emotions, we've learned to put that to the side. We've learned
in many tough games, exciting games, as you would say, it's more about if
intensity over the emotion, intensity being just doing your job at a very high
level. So I feel like there wasn't a lot of emotion, there was just a lot of
anxiety towards the beginning of the game.  
  
Q. What do you say, because those guys played their hearts out as you
did, what do you say to those guys at the end of the game? This is the biggest
game they'll ever play?  
JORDAN BONE: Absolutely, man. Like I mentioned earlier, we just appreciate
those guys for coming to fight. It wasn't an easy game. Just shaking their
hands, I was just like great game, man, keep your head up. Way to fight. Way
to fight.  
  
Just a wonderful lesson, just to compete day in, day out. That's what this
game is about, just competing and enjoying the game.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask you about the 3 you hit, maybe four minutes left or
so from the right wing, obviously they had been playing off for a while. What
did that mean and what gives you the confidence to keep taking those?  
JORDAN BONE: Well, the entire coaching staff does an amazing job to give us
confidence to take those open shots. We've learned in tougher situations this
year that we have to work our game plan, we have to play towards our strengths
and when we do get the ball wide open we do have to shoot the ball with
confidence.  
  
So that's just a wonderful job by our coaches to give us the confidence to
take those shots. And I shot it with confidence and it worked in our favor.  
  
Q. Admiral had not been shooting well. He hits those 3s late. Grant, you
weren't able to get him involved a lot, has the big block. What about those
two guys and some of the plays they made late?  
JORDAN BONE: With Admiral, he's been in many games this year where he's
knocked down tough shots, big-time shots in a critical moment. And he did that
today.  
  
With Grant, I feel like it was kind of tough for him to get into the flow of
the game earlier. I'm not really sure what it is. But he kind of found his way
towards the second half, he started making the right plays, and we trust him
to do that. So we put the ball in his hand and he made those right passes,
made the right plays.  
  
More than that, it's just trusting those guys because at the end of the day
we're not the team that we are today without Admiral and Grant. So just
understanding that we have to give those guys the ball because we trust them
to make the plays, and they did that down the stretch.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BARNES: I think a game like today is what makes the NCAA Tournament the
NCAA Tournament. You get a group of guys from a league where -- I'm looking
out at my good friend, John Feinstein, you did a book or writing a book about
the Patriot League -- and he told me, what's great about that league is you've
got a group of guys who just love to play basketball.  
  
That's what it looked like today. They earned the right here. And what can you
say about Jordan Burns? He was terrific. Looked like he had a magnet on that
ball.  
  
But I thought they played really hard. We were -- and what Jordan said, I said
to the guys at halftime -- I thought we were anxious. I thought we were
showing too much anxiety.  
  
I think some of it goes to a year ago, we came in here -- and we talked to the
team about it last night -- when we had that big lead against Wright State, I
told the coaches when we started out the way we did, I said, this is not good
because I thought our guys just thought it was going to be that way.  
  
When they came back and got back in the game, they were daring us to shoot it
early. I didn't think we worked hard enough in the game to put the ball
inside. I didn't think Grant really fought for his positioning.  
  
But I did think we were good defensively. And I don't want to take anything
away from Colgate because I thought those guys played their hearts out. But to
get through this tournament you're going to have games like this. And
mentioned the crowd; we've been in big arenas. I don't think the noise of the
crowd is going to bother us.  
  
I do think that at the end of the game, we tried to get some movement back
into where guys know where their shots are going to come from. Like the shot
-- the play that Grant ran today at the end for Admiral's last 3 was the exact
same play we ran at Florida to win the game down there.  
  
And I thought the guys knew where they were going to be able to step in and
shoot the ball and they did it with confidence. Again, you've got to love
Colgate and what they do. And it was kind of what I thought they would do.  
  
I told the guys last night, don't expect it to be easy. Even if we get up,
which we did. And they fought back. We were really, some uncharacteristic
things that we did with our body language and things that we haven't done all
year. And that's where I know that there was some anxiety with our guys.  
  
But we were able to get it done you never take a win in the NCAA for granted
ever. The fact we got it done is we had to do -- we had to do that a couple
different times this year -- and Jordan Bone said it, they stayed with it.
They knew what they had to do and they did it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. You touched on it already. You sat there yesterday and predicted the
exact same thing, that they would pack it in dare you guys to settle. How
frustrating was it to see them continue to jack up the 3s and not work it
inside?  
COACH BARNES: It's frustrating because we know what it's done to us in all
five of our losses. But we don't mind taking them if it's in the flow of what
we're doing. It's just when we settle and we did that too much, too early.  
  
Q. Regarding Jordan Burns, what was most impressive about his
performance tonight? Is there a moment that's going to stick with you?  
COACH BARNES: He's better in person than on tape, I can tell you that. You
knew he was the kind of guard that controls the ball very well. He goes right
a lot, and as hard as you try to keep him from doing that, he still mixes it
up.  
  
He's got a quick release. We were switching on some ball screens and he took
advantage of driving guys down the lane. And he's a good basketball player. He
really is. But they have a good team.  
  
The second half, I thought, one of their bigger players didn't get to play
much because I think he had an eye infection or something somebody told me.
That probably helped them in the long run because they could really spread you
out then.  
  
But they're really well-coached, well-coached team. I thought they played with
great composure, great poise, and they fought. And, again, that's what makes
this tournament what it is. And we were fortunate to get it done. But our guys
got it done. And that's the bottom line.  
  
Q. Any message to Jordan Burns after the game?  
COACH BARNES: I told him he was terrific. I'd like to have him on our team
tomorrow. I shouldn't say that -- that might be called -- I didn't say that,
scratch that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: He's the kind of player you'd like to have.  
  
COACH BARNES: The kind of player. You've got to love a guy like that. And
you've got to love, I think he's from Texas because one of his former coaches
actually texted me today and -- a guy that worked for me at Texas -- and told
me that you're getting ready to play against one of my favorite players and
one of my favorite people.  
  
I don't know him, but for a guy that sent me that, I think it speaks volumes
because he wouldn't say that if it wasn't true. He was a star today, he really
was. He's been good for them all year.  
  
Q. Do you mind me asking who that coach is?  
COACH BARNES: Chris -- I'm drawing a blank on the last name. I'll give it to
you off my phone.  
  
Q. Bryce Drew was fired today. Do you have any reaction to that?  
COACH BARNES: Boy, it's tough, because you get to know these guys and you
realize how hard a job it is. And I've said it all year long. He had put
together a great recruiting class. A guy that he built the program around got
hurt five games into the season. The other guy didn't get to play -- I think
he missed most of the preseason. So right at the start of the year he had to
rechange everything he probably spent all summer last summer doing.  
  
But you hate to see it for someone that I respect as much as I respect Bryce.
And after three years, it's tough. And there's a lot of things that happened
to them this year that I think was out of his control, and in Darius Garland
going down, because they were a different team. I think he was rookie of the
week or player of the week the first couple weeks of the SEC season. And it's
tough. This business, after three years, it's very tough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Kenny Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34857)

### [Cameron Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30481)

  
_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina student-athletes Cameron Johnson
and Kenny Williams. Questions.  
  
Q. How important has Garrison been this season for you guys? And when
did you kind of see him start to grow into what he's become, as consistent as
he's become?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: He's been huge especially in ACC play. He's been the anchor of
our defense. And the way he's played the ball screen has kind of made our
defense a lot stronger because they can't attack off the ball screen the way
the teams have somewhat in the past.  
  
So his growth on defensive end has been huge for us. And I think it was around
after Christmas break is when he really started to turn the corner and his
defense really took off.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: He also provides a bit of an offensive presence down low.
He's been finishing around the basket well. He's been doing a good job on both
ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Cameron, how do you buy the sentiment that you have to be playing
your best this time of the year? And although you might not have won the
conference tournament, you guys -- do feel like you're playing your best at
this time?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Yeah, I think we're getting there. I think we've been
improving all year. So I think this is going to be the best products we put
out all year. But you have to. You have to or you'll go home. So there's a lot
more at stake. There's a lot more to play for right now. And you just gotta
embrace it and do your best.  
  
Q. Cameron, how is your health? You sat out Monday and Tuesday at
practice. Any update on that?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: It's good. It's March, everybody is feeling something. I'm
all right. My shin is a little sore coming off the ACC Tournament. And I'm
feeling pretty good now.  
  
Q. Did you practice?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Yeah, I practiced the last two days.  
  
KENNY WILLIAMS: Cameron is just old.  
  
Q. How much does playing in the ACC help you guys for preparing for the
NCAA Tournament?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: Well, three of the four 1 seeds are ACC teams. We've been
playing against the best of the best all year. It's a demanding schedule. You
play a lot of good teams night in night out, so you can't really take weeks
off. So that definitely prepares you for something like this.  
  
Q. Cameron, your thoughts on Iona, a team that struggled the early part
of the year but is coming to this tournament having won 10 straight games?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: They've won 10 straight, like you said. They shoot the ball
well. They like to get up and down. They have some guys that like to score the
ball. So we're just going to have to play our game. We'll have to do what we
do. From everything we've seen on film they've got some guys that can do some
things pretty good.  
  
They've got a good guard in McGill and a guy that can score down low in Agee.
We've got to go out there and play our game and rebound and defend and do
everything that Coach wants us to do.  
  
Q. Kenny, a lot of people say that you have to have great guards to win
in a tournament like this, experienced guards for that matter. In what ways
other than he's a freshman, but in what ways would you say that Coby is
experienced?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: He's a player. He hasn't played like a freshman all season.
Coby has played in big games. We've had a lot of big games this year. He's had
big-game experience. I know March is different.  
  
But knowing him, it's not -- the moment isn't too big. He'll just go out and
play his game. And that's what I'll tell him tomorrow; just go out and be you
and play your game and we'll come out fine.  
  
Q. Roy's never lost a game in the first round. How does he get you stay
focused or get you guys prepared for a game like this, especially when you're
a No. 1 seed playing a 16 in a theoretically very lopsided matchup?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: Coach is all about respecting everyone but fearing no one.
That's exactly what he told us. You step between those lines, especially in
March, you're going to get everybody's best shot. Everybody's playing for
their life. Everybody's playing for their season.  
  
So we have to take the same mindset. We can't go out there and overlook
anybody and think it's just going to be easy just because we're stepping out
there and just because we're North Carolina.  
  
So tomorrow we're just going to step out there and we're going to respect
them, but we're also going to play our games.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I'm just adding on to that. He emphasizes it. He emphasizes
we need to play hard and well. Iona has been in the tournament four years in a
row now, is what he told us. These guys, they're seniors.  
  
They've played in a handful of them. He emphasized that to us. And we've got
to go out there and play.  
  
Q. I'm curious about that experience with Coach Williams when he has
been in this situation so many times. Is he the type of coach that goes back
and says we had this type of game, we had this type of opponent, when we had
this team in '96 or '93 or whatever? Or is he a coach that's very much, we're
looking at the next game?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I think it depends on the situation. There will be times
where he'll bring up something that might have happened in the past, or
reference it. But most of the time he's kind of in the moment, kind of focused
on what the other team does, how we are going to attack them.  
  
And we've been watching film on Iona now and we've been preparing for them,
scouting them out, running against what they like to run on offense, defending
that. So we're pretty locked into this one. We know we can't get it any
further if we don't win this one.  
  
Q. Cam, you spoke about how this tournament run means a little more to
you because you weren't on the national championship squad from two years ago.
How much more motivation do you have going into this weekend?  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I have a lot. I can't sit here and tell you that Kenny and
Luke don't have motivation. It's also their senior years, and obviously they
want to be part of something, especially like another Final Four run.  
  
But for me, personally, I've never been there. So I'm really excited for this
opportunity, to shine, to embrace it the best I can and make the most of it.  
  
Q. Kenny and Cam, to build on what you were saying before about how
seriously you take this, what did you think last year when Virginia lost to a
No. 16 seed? Did you watch it and what was your reaction to it?  
KENNY WILLIAMS: We were actually all watching it in our meeting room at the
hotel together. And it's just something that you don't really expect it,
especially with a team like Virginia.  
  
But we told each other, let's not let that be us. And so we wanted to focus in
a little bit more going into our game. But we all were shocked.  
  
CAMERON JOHNSON: I'd say shocked was what it was. We were watching it in the
meeting room, like he said, and everybody was just, like, woah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Go ahead and start with a statement.  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: Same thing everybody else would say we're happy to be here,
thrilled to still be playing while some others are not. We had a good practice
this morning. A shoot-around is all we'll do this afternoon.  
  
Kenny, Luke and Cam have done a great job of leading our team, and Garrison,
Nassir and Coby, those guys have really done a great job for us helping the
seniors get from game to game. And Coby has been a scoring machine for us
several times and we've needed it every time, and he's been great and
listening to Cam, Kenny and Luke, and also understanding he's been pretty
doggone good himself.  
  
Q. What are you seeing from film on Iona? What are your impressions of
the team?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Every time I hear the word "Iona" it reminds me of Jim
Valvano, "Iona College." He said, "you own a college?" You have to be old
enough for me and Feinstein; we remember that.  
  
But when I watched them, I watched them play against Monmouth in the finals of
the conference tournament. Tim Cluess, good guy, he was Danny Green's high
school coach, so I've known him a long time. Not trying to act like we're
bosom buddies or anything, but I thought he was a really good coach then;
think it even more so now.  
  
We watched a part of that championship game, even watched part of the
championship game last year when they played. But playing them, for us, we've
got to understand they'll have five guys outside the 3-point line a lot, and
all five guys can shoot the 3-point shot.  
  
Earlier in the year it was 40-something percent of the shots they took were
3-pointers. The last four or five games it's been over 50 percent. So we
realize we've got to get out on the floor and cover out there, that means Luke
Maye, and Garrison, those guys have to get out and cover the 3-point line.  
  
They do like to play at a fast pace but so do we. We understand that part of
it. Trying to cover them on the offensive end with the 3-point shot and free
throw line are two huge parts of their offense. And it's the easiest way for
to you get beat if you give them free shots at the foul line or free shots
from the 3-point shots. That's the biggest emphasis for us.  
  
Q. Roy, did Cam, his shins was that a wear-and-tear kind of situation?
Or did something happen last week in Charlotte and was holding him out of
practice a couple days just a precaution, or are you concerned?  
COACH WILLIAMS: No, I'm not concerned -- well, I'm concerned, yeah, but it's
not something I've laid awake at night kind of thing. Doug and Cam and the
doctors have looked at it, taken X-rays or whatever it is they do.  
  
And I think it just flared up last week. I don't know if it was one specific
incident that made it happen. But we thought it was good. He's 23 years old. I
held him out of shooting practice. I told him when you get to be 23 you get to
hold out of shooting practices.  
  
And yesterday he did almost everything. Today he did everything and doesn't
seem to have any problems. But you're talking about a guy who has probably
handled pain for a longer period of his life than any basketball player I've
ever been around. So he does a great job of that. But I fully expect that
he'll play the way he's been playing.  
  
Q. For Coby, a lot of people say you need experienced guards to make
deep runs. What makes Coby different than other freshmen guards in this
tournament? And when he's not on the floor how does that kind of change?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know what is different from other freshmen guards in
the tournament. But we've played 30-something games. We're 26-6 or 27-7,
something like that. So he's played 30, 35 games. We held him out of one game
because, I think it was his foot. I'm not sure. Can't even remember that long
ago.  
  
But I like scoring point guards. And Coby is a scoring point guard. He's a guy
that scored more points in high school basketball in the state of North
Carolina than anybody in history. So I'm not going to get him and say, okay,
you can't shoot. That would be sort of silly. And I do some silly things but
that's not one of them.  
  
He has the ability to put the ball in the basket. He's a good shooter and I
think will eventually be a great shooter. He can attack the basket really,
really well. He has no fear attacking the basket. He's better defensively than
anybody ever even thinks about. He's won our defensive player of the game I
think the second most of anybody on the team. Garrison's won it the most;
Coby's won it second most. And he's a complete all around player.  
  
The kids nowadays aren't like freshmen were 20 years ago. Kids nowadays are
freshmen, they've been everywhere. I can remember when I started coaching we
tell a kid you come here, we're going to take you to Hawaii once every four
years. Every high school player goes to Hawaii now. It's no big deal.  
  
But he's extremely gifted, extremely competitive, extremely good. He's really
a good player. And really good players, even in their freshman year, even if
you go back to Pervis Ellison or Michael Jordan or what, some freshmen have
done some great things in this tournament, and usually they did it in the
regular season as well.  
  
Q. You said earlier in the week that the teams that have either won
titles or made really deep runs have always had really good weeks of practice
before the tournament starts. Wondering how your guys were earlier this week.
And you've never lost in the first round. How do you keep guys --  
COACH WILLIAMS: If we lose, don't let me know where you live. (Laughter) If
that's perceived as a threat, it's true, okay? (Laughter).  
  
Q. How do you keep guys focused and engaged in a game like this where
you're theoretically a pretty heavy favorite?  
COACH WILLIAMS: First part of the question. The team that came to mind quickly
when I started thinking about that and talking about it, because we've had a
lot of teams that really got better as the season went along and played their
best basketball at the end, but was the '09 team because I could never
convince them you have to guard somebody; they sort of thought we would
outscore them.  
  
But those last three to four weeks of the season that year they really
concentrated hard on the defensive end of the floor and really got a lot
better.  
  
This team, we just finished practicing an hour and a half ago or something
like that and we had a really good practice this morning. That doesn't mean
they don't screw it up and make a mistake, but that's the game of basketball.
But I think our practices have been good this year. I think a lot of it is
because we push so much. But I think a lot of it is because with Luke and Cam
and Kenny they sort drag everybody else along. It's an experienced group that
does that.  
  
And I think you have to play well -- excuse me, practice well. I've never had
a good team that practiced sorry every day and then played great. I've never
had that. But I think this team has gotten better as we've practiced all year
long, and particularly I'd say the last couple of weeks we've shortened
practice a little bit and perhaps they've realized that and focused even a
little bit more, or just that they've gone out and done their work.  
  
Trying to get focused on playing against everybody, regardless of who you're
playing in your seed is something I've thought ever since the first day I
became a coach. And my first couple of years as an assistant we had some bad
memories of those first-round games. I remember over in Raleigh, Black Sunday,
us and Duke both lost when everybody thought we were going to win, playing
close to home.  
  
So I've always tried to focus on now we're in the tournament, but if you're
looking down the road -- and this is corny -- I tell our guys all the time, if
you're looking down the road at what might happen, that's usually where you're
going: Down the road back home. And we try to focus on just playing this next
game.  
  
And I guess somebody could use it as ammunition, but somebody asked me
something a day or two ago about the tournament, I couldn't even remember who
our pairing was in the second round. And I was being truthful. I got one of
the two teams right. I didn't get the other one right. Somebody could probably
use that. But it really is, that we're trying to get ready to play Iona. And I
tell the guys come on now, if we play well, maybe they'll let us stay around
and play another one. But I think the kids are experienced enough to
understand that part of it as well, too.  
  
Q. Was there a light bulb moment for Garrison, especially on the
defensive end that kind of got him playing as consistently as he has been
recently?  
COACH WILLIAMS: He was okay last year defensively, but I think at the start of
the season, you look and you have Luke and you have Kenny and you have Cam,
and what can they do? They can all three score.  
  
Kenny is good defensively. The other a little bit of a liability sometimes.
You look and you have Coby as a freshmen who can score. But you think, well,
freshmen can't defend. And you look at Nassir and say, well, freshmen can't
defend.  
  
I think he saw that, because he's very bright. He says I have a better niche
with this team if I do a good job on defensive so coach can count on me.  
  
And I think the other thing is when you praise somebody, reward them, they
tend to do the same behavior over again and even try to do it even better.  
  
So when we talk about how well he's doing defensively and how dependable he is
and everybody should thank him for covering up for your mistake, I think he
likes those kind of things.  
  
And I even think something as simple as grading the tape and listing who is
defensive player of the game, he likes to see his name go up there, as
everybody does. But I think he has bought into it. I want him to score every
basket around the basket. If he goes out and shoots 3s, the next horn you'll
see it will be him coming out, because that's not who he is. But he
understands that. And I am really, really proud of what he's done for our
team.  
  
Q. Have you seen any extra motivation from Cam being that he's the
senior that wasn't on the national championship team from two years ago?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I'm sure Kenny and Luke talked to him about it enough that
he's probably got that motivation. They live together. So they talk about the
greatest time of their lives, best three-week stretch in 2017 that he didn't
experience.  
  
But I think Cameron is a youngster who has really wanted to be successful and
has worked extremely hard. As I said earlier, I don't know of anybody that's
had as much pain as he's had during his college career.  
  
He's very -- I almost call him an old man. But he's very mature about
everything he does and looking at everything, looking at the big picture. So I
think he's hungry. But I wouldn't be surprised if those guys say some things
to him away from me. But I know he's personally really hungry himself.  
  
Q. Tennessee, of course, is here. I wanted to get your thoughts on the
job Rick's done with that job as they make their move here in the NCAA
Tournament.  
COACH WILLIAMS: Rick's a good friend, a really good coach. A guy that I enjoy
being around. We were in Maui together last year, I guess, and they started
out poorly. And they got better and better.  
  
We played them in Knoxville. He's a guy from Western North Carolina that I do
really enjoy. And I've watched his teams. And Williams and Schofield, those
guys, they get after you, competing on every possession.  
  
And I gotta think Rick pushes them to do that all the time. So I think he's
done a fantastic job. And he's one of those guys that, when I see him, I start
grinning, so that's a pretty good legacy, too.  
  
Q. To follow up on what you were saying before about how much more
experienced players are before they ever get to you. How does that affect your
dynamic? Is it always a good thing? Is it sometimes a bad thing?  
COACH WILLIAMS: You know, I think it's good to have a little new enthusiasm.
Sometimes I call it youthful exuberance. I think it's good to have that on
your team and not just be, oh, we've done this before kind of thing. But I
also like the old guys to understand how lucky we are that you're still doing
it; that we're back.  
  
I loved -- I really did -- the only ones we have are in-house cameras, but at
my house, when we were watching the Selection Show, when they announced North
Carolina as the No. 1 seed, put our name up there, they jumped up. And it was
spontaneous. And I'm not of their generation. I tell them I'm glad I'm not.
I'm three or four generations away.  
  
But I watch some teams being announced -- it's not a cut to the way some kids
do it -- but I saw teams jumping up and everybody had their phone in their
hand taking a picture of their frickin' self.  
  
Come on now. Sometimes it's got to be being excited about your group. This
group, old guys like Cam, Luke and Kenny, or the young guys, Nassir and Leaky,
Coby, they were genuinely pleased, enthusiastic about what went on. I like
that. It's not a cut against anybody else. It's just I really appreciate the
way our guys handled it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State student-athletes Neemias Queta, Sam
Merrill, Abel Porter and Quinn Taylor. Questions?  
  
Q. Quinn, I counted six different states and three different countries
on your roster. Everybody always talks about the locker room and how important
that is. Can you guys kind of -- how did you bring that all together and is it
still a work in progress or who is in charge of the music and what have you?  
QUINN TAYLOR: The cool thing about -- just playing basketball brings people
together that you'd never meet kind of outside of basketball. And we're
fortunate enough to have people from all over the U.S. and all over the world.
And I think just our love for the game has really brought us together.  
  
And I think generally we just rotate through who has the music in the locker
room. But it's just a brotherhood and people that I'll consider brothers for
the rest of my life.  
  
ABEL PORTER: As far as that goes, I think it's been pretty natural. Sometimes
you can feel a team forcing being friends, but I feel like this year it's been
really big that we establish a culture, kind of reestablish the culture of
family and togetherness at Utah State. And I feel like we've done that really
well. I feel like it's natural as we come together.  
  
SAM MERRILL: I think it's been incredibly helpful as far as developing the
chemistry. I think because we all come from so many different backgrounds, it
keeps us away from developing any type of clique or anything like that. When
we're hanging around it's everybody together not groups of three or groups of
four.  
  
And fortunately we have multiple of our American-born players are bilingual.
That's helped. I assume it's helped with our Portuguese players and it's been
a fun experience getting to know each other.  
  
NEEMIAS QUETA: We're a group of guys that love to play basketball, and the
love is the same. We all love to play basketball and we all love to play with
each other. And I think we're just a group of guys that just -- we're not
worried about anything. We just love playing with each other and that helps a
lot. We don't have much egos. We just love each other and we love playing
basketball. That's it. It's simple.  
  
Q. Neemi, growing up in Portugal, did you follow the NCAA Tournament?
And if so, now that you're here, is this a dream of yours? What's it like for
you to be here?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: I've never followed it growing up. But last year, when I was
being recruited, I heard of it. And I saw it was pretty nice. It's really nice
being here and being a part of it. So I can't wait for it, and I hope we will
have a good game and get a win.  
  
Q. Sam, this group really -- you guys haven't been to the tournament. So
this is new for everybody. But at the same time is that kind of helpful
because you guys don't have to -- I don't know, maybe the pressure is not
there. And what's the feeling of the team now that you've been here, being
picked to finish ninth? We've talked about that a lot but maybe the
expectations were that you weren't going to be here?  
SAM MERRILL: Like we've talked about before, expectations preseason from those
around us weren't very high. But as a team we felt that we could really do
some damage. And we've always grown and grown throughout the season, but this
is obviously, hopefully, not a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for some of us,
but it's something that you have to enjoy.  
  
I think our coaching staff and us as a team have done a good job this week of
not trying to worry about the outside stuff as far as the media and all the
excitement around it, but trying to focus on Washington and our game coming up
and our scouting reports and prep. And practices have been the same that
they've been all year.  
  
As far as mentally, I don't assume -- I don't anticipate that we'll come out
really nervous or jittery. Fortunately we got to play in our championship game
on Saturday in the Mountain West Tournament, and that felt like it was a big
game, too. So we did a pretty good job there. So hopefully we'll do a good job
tomorrow as well.  
  
Q. Matisse Thybulle might be one of the best defensive players you've
seen all year -- blocked shots, steals, averaging three and a half steals a
game. Sam, what do you see from him when you look at him defensively? And how
do you try to get around a player that has that kind of a skill set?  
SAM MERRILL: He's a great athlete. And I mean the report says that he's about
6'4", 6'5", but his arms, you can tell, watching film you can see how long and
how athletic. He does a great job anticipating passing lanes and blocking
shots from behind.  
  
So they have a lot of good athletes and guys with length in their zone. So
we're just going to have to play the way that we've played all year, and we do
that by sharing the ball, by moving the ball, by trying to be smart, high IQ
basketball players.  
  
And he's going to make some plays. That's what this tournament is about. And
the best players make plays. But hopefully we can minimize what he does by
moving the ball and by not letting the ball stick and by doing things the way
we've done things all year.  
  
Q. This is a good introduction to the rest of the nation for your
school. Can you describe a little bit about your school and what brought you
there?  
QUINN TAYLOR: For me personally, coming to Utah State, Utah State had a rich
tradition in basketball. And something that each -- I feel like each one of
us, when we got recruited they showed us videos of the Spectrum, where we play
our home games, and it's just a crazy atmosphere. And it's something that you
want to play at a school like that where you have the community behind you.  
  
And then also, for me, being that I was going to go on a mission for my church
and Utah State deals with that. So just going into that situation with the
coaching staff that understood that, that I was going to go for two years and
come back also helped me choose to attend Utah State. And I definitely made
the right choice, and I've loved it ever since.  
  
ABEL PORTER: Utah State, we're in Logan, Utah. And it's an awesome school if
you ever look up pictures. It's a really beautiful just environment to live in
up against the mountains. But besides that it's a really great academic
school. And, like he said, really good at basketball.  
  
They had some really good years in the past where the fan base was really
behind it, selling out almost every single game. And I think we all saw that
and kind of wanted to be a part of bringing it back. And I think that's what
brought a lot of us to Utah State.  
  
SAM MERRILL: I grew up a Utah State fan. Both of my parents graduated from
Utah State. So for me it was an easy choice to go play at Utah State. I felt
like it was the best fit both academically, basketball-wise, of course, and
just being close to family.  
  
But for those that have been following college basketball for a long time,
Utah State used to be a regular in this tournament. And like Abel said, it's
been a few years, but we're excited to be back and we're excited to represent
our school and our university. And hopefully we represent them well starting
tomorrow.  
  
NEEMIAS QUETA: Utah State is a school that would be perfect for me because
they have passionate fans, good conditions, a good coaching staff and
everybody at the school cares about you. And I really wanted to go there.  
  
And having players like this working for me and helping me out, it's really
nice and having a good growth throughout the year with them is really nice.
And the fact that we made it here, it's really nice, too.  
  
Q. Quinn, you get a new coach your senior year. That can be challenging
or difficult. What's allowed this team to kind of have that seamless
transition to a new staff and have this kind of success?  
QUINN TAYLOR: Coach Smith in general, going into a coaching change, there's
always the unknowns. But just Coach Smith was the perfect hire. And our first
meeting with him, he comes in and I think it's six in the morning or
something; he just wanted to meet us real quick. And he's coming in, bouncing
off the walls. His energy, it's just something that's contagious.  
  
I think that's something he's passed down from that first meeting on to now.
And just the energy and culture that he's brought and just the way he coaches
and instills confidence in each one of us and the other coaching staff lets
you play basketball, I mean, how you're supposed to play. We've all been
playing since we were little.  
  
And he makes it so that we're playing the game and not thinking. And
basketball becomes a lot easier when you're out of your own head and you know
your coach believes you and you know your teammates believe in you. And it's
been a great year. The whole coaching staff has that mentality, but it starts
with Coach Smith.  
  
Q. Abel, could you tell us a little bit about how far you've come?
You're a walk-on, weren't playing very much and you've become a starter,
started pretty much the last half of the season.  
ABEL PORTER: It's been an interesting journey. I had spotty minutes in the
start of the season. And it's kind of been like that. This is my third year at
Utah State. It's kind of been that roller coaster, not really knowing what to
expect.  
  
But Coach Smith did a great job of meeting with me knowing -- telling me that
he has confidence in me and what he expected of me. And so I kind of just
stuck with it, just the same as I always have.  
  
And I'd like to say that a lot changed but really I think I just took
advantage of the opportunities that were given to me. I prepared the same way
for every single game, prepared the same way in practice, and luckily I got a
couple of opportunities that kind of paved the way for me to start and for me
to kind of get solid playing time.  
  
And so it's been great. But I have to give credit to Coach Smith for just
believing in me and giving me this opportunity.  
  
Q. Neemi, could you talk a little bit about your basketball -- how you
got interested in the game and if you had followed an NBA team, if any of them
were a particular hero to you? Can you talk about your basketball heritage,
how much you may have followed the NBA, whether you were interested in a
particular player?  
NEEMIAS QUETA: I grew up -- I never actually -- I grew playing basketball
since then. I've always watched the NBA since I was, like, 14. And since then
I watched it every year, every week, almost every day. I like a lot of
players, especially big men that can do a lot of things.  
  
I try to model my game like Anthony Davis, players like that. And it's hard,
but I'm working on it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach Craig Smith from Utah State.  
  
Q. I asked the players, and I'll ask you, you've got a locker room with
players from six different states and three different countries. So how much
of that is choice, how much of that is chance? You're the coach, obviously
first year. Some of it I'm sure you inherited. But just talk about that a
little bit. Everybody talks about locker room culture and how important that
is. So, have at it. Let us know what you've got.  
COACH SMITH: Well, that's a great question. And it's something you think a
decent amount about. But obviously it's my first year. I've been here for just
short of a year now.  
  
So at the end of the day, it doesn't matter where you're from, who you are; it
matters what you're about and what kind of character you have and how are you
going to represent. Recruiting is the lifeline of your program. And so you
better recruit people first. So whether that's a young man from Utah or
Oklahoma or Portugal -- we've got the Portuguese connection. We've got two of
the three players in Division I basketball, we calm them the Wonder Twins,
like the old "Wonder Twin powers, activate."  
  
But at the end of the day you've got to be able to identify young men that can
flourish in, for our case, in Cache Valley, in Logan, Utah, and that can
flourish in your style of play. So our style of play is different than Program
X. And so a guy like -- there's going to be guys that are going to be really
set up for success in our program that might struggle in a different program.  
  
That being said, there might be guys that flourish in a different program that
might struggle in our program. And so as a coach you've got to really identify
the types of players that are going to do well. It's easy to go spot a guy
that can run fast, jump high, but that doesn't mean he's going to be a player
for you.  
  
So you've got to dig deeper. It's like Nick Saban said, you've got to peel the
onion back seven layers. You go to the high school, you've got to ask the
administrative assistant, what do you know about this kid? You've got to go
ask the custodian, what do you know about this kid? Go ask the history
teacher, what do you know about this guy? And pretty soon things start lining
up.  
  
And my first day on the job at Utah State, got hired on a Sunday. On Monday I
met with the academic people. I met with the compliance people. I met with
strength and conditioning coach. I met with our athletic trainer. And you can
go right on down the line. Tell me about our team. Tell me about our program.
Tell me about this individual, this guy, this guy. And you do that and pretty
soon things start checking out.  
  
And day two, and part of day one, met with each individual student-athlete.
Tell me about the program. Tell me about academics. Tell me about strength and
conditioning. So you do your homework.  
  
And we've been so fortunate. I've been coaching -- I was just telling this
young man to my right about I've been coaching for 23 years. And I've been
very, very fortunate to be on very, very good teams. Coached a team that
played in the national championship game. Been on teams that have struggled.
Been on a couple of NCAA Tournament teams.  
  
And I feel like the luckiest man on earth to be able to coach this team
because going into the year we were one of the 50 youngest teams in the
country. We dressed 12 guys and six of them are freshmen, including the one
when we had the open walk-on tryouts, and he's one of the freshmen.  
  
So to be able to have this group come together and do what we've done, it's
been beyond magical to say the least. We were ranked number nine in the
preseason polls and we're a No. 8 seed in the NCAA Tournament. It's pretty
incredible.  
  
Q. When you took this job, what type of player did you think Sam was?
You've probably talked about it before, but for those who haven't seen him on
a national stage like this, why has he been so successful in your system?  
COACH SMITH: First of all, Sam is a young man of incredible character. And
he's like the all-American type of kid. The country's going to see one of the
best players in the country play tomorrow. Certainly getting ready -- when I
was contacted about possibly applying for the job, obviously I was doing my
research. And certainly Sam was a guy that really stood out.  
  
Sam was the one guy in our program that had some accolades coming into the
season. He was the third-team all-conference player last year. And certainly
watching the video -- even though our style of play is totally different than
the style of play last year, you could see, like, this kid, he's got great
feel for the game. He understands the game. Incredibly unselfish.  
  
And the common theme that everybody had said about Sam Merrill is all Sam
cares about is winning. Doesn't care if he's an all-league player or how many
shots he gets a night. Our first practice this summer, I said, Sam, if we're
going to get to where we need to go, winning the Mountain West, we need you to
be much more vocal.  
  
The rest of the year -- literally the rest of the year -- he's the most vocal.
He's so cerebral, so intelligent, we're very detailed with scouting reports.
Sam knows not only what the guy he's guarding is going to do; he can do what
the 5 man and the 4 man is going to do. He's yelling it out. He'll be guarding
this guy and yelling back at Neemi, "Neemi, watch the duck in." Whatever it
might be.  
  
You get into the season -- it's just so obviously, early on in the year,
because of our youth -- and we really struggled with the ball early, not
because we had bad shooters. I think it was -- like a guy like Brock Miller is
a freshman, so the speed of the game is going super fast for him. And once
Christmas past he got in a groove where he started playing like a sophomore.
The game slowed down.  
  
And Sam would come up to me -- because he had to carry so much of the load --
he'd say, Coach, I think we need to run this to get Brock going, or we need to
do this to get Diogo going. Or maybe a few more post touches for Neemi or
whatever it might be.  
  
He's so unselfish. And at the end of the day you think back to a game like New
Mexico, where we controlled at New Mexico. We started off the league 1-2. We
had won two in a row. So we were 3-2 in league play, and on the road to New
Mexico. They come roaring back. That's one of the toughest places in the
country to play.  
  
We were down one and we hold it for a last shot. We were either going to win
it or lose it. And we run a play for Sam and basically gets tripled team. And
one guy drops off and he gets double teamed. And a lot of times the best
scorer, no matter what, is just going to fire that shot up. And he makes the
right play, the right read and delivers it over his shoulder to Abel Porter,
who he had been playing with since fifth grade. And Abel makes a game-winning
3 with like .7 seconds to go.  
  
And he's done that continually all year. Guys love playing with him. We're No.
9 in the country in assists on the year. 62 percent of our baskets are
assisted, which is an incredibly high number. And it all starts when you have
a guy like that that's so unselfish.  
  
When your best player is your hardest worker, everybody falls in line. And I
could talk another ten minutes on Sam if you want. But that about sums it up.  
  
Q. I think I read where you guys, your roster has six or seven returned
LDS, returned from LDS missions. How much is that in terms of maturity and the
ability to trust that these guys know what they're doing?  
COACH SMITH: Certainly it's been fantastic because all those guys are just
incredible people, first and foremost. You know, obviously generally speaking,
they're a couple years older. There's certainly a sense of maturity.
Communication skills are tremendous.  
  
But like anything, we have training table on campus. And so you get done with
practice. Guys -- sometimes they don't want to go to training table. They want
to go home and eat with their wife if they're -- there are guys that are
married. So it's always different.  
  
But it's been, I could go right down the line. Quinn Taylor, he's one of our
two seniors. We always say he's like -- remember the old commercial, EF
Hutton? When EF Hutton talks, people listen. That's Quinn Taylor. We call him
the godfather or grandfather, either one suffices.  
  
But his leadership skills have been impeccable. I know he was just up here
earlier with Neemias Queta. So, Quinn, I don't know how many minutes he played
last year, right around 20 a game. It's hard to keep him off the floor. He's
so good that way.  
  
But what he's done certainly for our team, because he's a guy that every
single guy in our program has utmost respect for, no matter who you are, where
you come from. And then he's just been like such a big brother to Neemias,
just teaching him the in ands outs of the game, the ins and outs of the league
and it's been incredible that way. Certainly it's nice to have.  
  
Q. You mentioned you guys were picked to finish ninth in your league.
What was your first impression, summer workouts when you got a glimpse of your
team? What do you think your expectations were?  
COACH SMITH: From the get-go the goal was to get to the NCAA Tournament and
win when we get there. We wanted to get to the top of the -- Mountain West
Conference champions. We have a plethora of young men from Utah. A guy like
Sam, Brock, Abel Porter, grew up in the state of Utah where their dream was to
play basketball at Utah State.  
  
So inherently you have a ton of pride. Those guys grew up -- Sam talked about,
after we won the conference tournament championship, about being at the game
in 2011 when they cut down the nets. And he remembers it vividly. And so you
have -- I remember that Monday when I met with all these people, I met with
Sam's parents that night. And we were talking about the glory days.  
  
And so it's always impossible until you make it possible. And there's a quote
I remember: It's a funny thing about life, if you refuse to accept anything
but their best, you very often get it. So we had high expectations from day
one. And we talked about -- our guys started -- I suck with technology.
Although I'm good with Twitter -- or like Bill Belichick said, Snapface and
Instachat. I say that to the team all the time.  
  
But our guys started their own -- I don't think I've ever shared this before,
but our guys started their own, what do you call it, group text. That's what
you call it? So I just figured how to do a group text. I knew how to do it; I
didn't know how to name it. I did it with our staff in January. They're, like,
wow, Coach, staff. That's great.  
  
But on the top of it -- I think Sam started it -- and on the top, the name of
the group text, is that what you say, the name of it, the title, was Mountain
West champs. And so our guys, it was a very emotional win. We beat Boise State
in overtime. We were fighting a lot of sickness that night. That was our
fourth to last regular season game. Beat San Diego State at home.  
  
Then everybody was talking about Nevada the next game, but we had to beat San
Diego obviously to make that Nevada game mean something. Beat them, first time
in Mountain West Conference history that we had been a part of that, we had
beaten them.  
  
Obviously beat Nevada. First time we beat a ranked opponent since 2007. Now
everyone's talking about the hangover game. Are you going to have enough gas
in the tank. All that stuff, because we had a quick turnaround at Colorado
State. And Sam said something in the group text: Now it's here; let's give
everything we've got and stay locked in, so we can get what we said from day
one, in our group text, Mountain West Champ. So that was a pretty neat thing
that way.  
  
So our expectations, I've always believed as a person, as a coach, as a
father, in anything you do in life, why would you ever put limitations on
yourself? Like why would you ever limit yourself as a person in anything
you're doing? Why would you ever put limits on yourself in your program?  
  
And so our guys' buy-in from day one, I think what's helped us in a weird way
-- we are one of the 50 youngest teams in the country -- our local guys have
heard this over and over and over again, but we only had four guys in this
program that ever played or averaged more than seven minutes a game. And so in
some ways it hurts you because you lack some experience.  
  
But I think in some ways it's helped us because we just have this youthful
exuberance that we're going to conquer the world and nobody's going to tell us
any different. And so just the chemistry we've had, the camaraderie, and the
common goal has been incredible and that goes to these young men that were up
here and obviously all the other guys in our program.  
  
Q. Matisse Thybulle is one of the best defenders in the country and
really unique in what he does. What are your impressions of him now that
you've been looking at Washington?  
COACH SMITH: I've had to take a lot of Advil over the last four days because
he's a headache. I can't remember -- I think I heard this on a telecast -- but
we use a ton of football and boxing analogies in everything we do. And he's
almost like Deion Sanders in football. When Deion Sanders played, it was like
he eliminated whatever side of the field. He's so instinctive, so quick
twitch, so long, and his hands are just so fast, right?  
  
And for a guy to average playing zone over three steals a game with two
blocked shots a game is incredible. And he does it while staying disciplined.
He's not just running all over the place gambling and out of position. So he
dominates the game in such a different way that I'm not sure I've ever seen it
from that respect.  
  
So you gotta always account for where he's at. Their team forces 17.5
turnovers a game in the Pac-12. That's hard to do. And they're doing it mainly
just in the half court. So he's certainly a monster part of it. But their
whole team, Newell is player of the year for them. Dickerson was a first-team
All-League kid last year in the Pac-12. And David Crisp has had a phenomenal
season, senior year. I actually did a home visit with him and his parents when
I was an assistant at Nebraska. His mom can really cook. It was incredible
food. It was like wow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iowa student-athletes Tyler Cook, Nicholas Baer
and Jordan Bohannon.  
  
Q. Tyler, what's the excitement level back home?  
TYLER COOK: We're all super excited. It's a huge opportunity for us, something
that we've been working towards since we ended our season last year. And so
ever since we saw our name pop up on that screen, we've all just been excited
to get to work.  
  
And I feel like we've put forth a good effort in terms of preparing for this
game. It's a huge stage for us all. We're just super excited and blessed to be
in this position. And I think we'll take full advantage of it.  
  
Q. Nicholas, do you feel like you've been given the attention you
deserve with the season that you had, especially within the Big Ten?  
NICHOLAS BAER: Yeah, absolutely. We never get too concerned about attention or
anything like that. Obviously we have an opportunity to play in the NCAA
Tournament. That's something that we're grateful for and really looking
forward to this opportunity to play in Cincinnati and hope we'll be here for a
while.  
  
Q. It's Columbus, you knew that?  
NICHOLAS BAER: I did know that.  
  
Q. Jordan, your thoughts on what the team is doing right now, as far as
what level you've been playing compared with the rest of the season?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: I feel like we're really prepared to play at this level,
knowing -- coming from the Big Ten Conference and the teams we've played
against all year. We've played one of the hardest schedules in the country.
For us to be able to get on this stage, I think our past will prepare us for
these moments.  
  
We've played at Madison Square Garden and big stages already. I know what
we're capable of doing and I think we all have that same mindset.  
  
Q. You mentioned that Big Ten schedule. It's particularly tough on the
road. You feel like that eases once you get into a tournament setting where
you have a neutral site like Columbus?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: Definitely. Big Ten, we have eight teams in the NCAA
Tournament this year. So that says a lot about what it's like day to day in
the Big Ten. It's tough to even get a win at home against any Big Ten team.  
  
So traveling and away games is going to prepare us for these neutral-site
games. And I think our team's always done pretty well at neutral sites. We're
really looking forward until tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jordan, obviously besides this is a one-and-done situation, what is
this week like compared to say a big week in January or February in the Big
Ten? Can you feel a difference about what you guys are going about this
week?  
JORDAN BOHANNON: I think it's just all a culmination of our entire work we've
put in since last April. It sucks, last year we had a season that no one
expected even us, the work we've put in. We had a let-down. And we got to work
last April.  
  
So for us to have our name called last Sunday, it was really special, because
we know how hard we worked to get to this point. And we're just trying to make
the most of it.  
  
Q. Tyler, how about for you, does this week feel different to you
opposed to a random week in the regular season, and in what way?  
TYLER COOK: Definitely. I think the energy has been different. We're in kind
of unchartered territory for myself and Jordan at least. We haven't been to
the tournament yet in our careers. And I speak for most of us when I say that,
with the exception of Nicholas.  
  
But it's just been very exciting for us. When Jordan said, when we saw or
heard our name called on Sunday, we were all ecstatic. Once we got to work, it
just really felt different than the regular season, which it is. So I think
like the new energy that comes along with the postseason will serve us well.  
  
Q. Tyler, from what you've seen from the UC defense, how does that
compare to anything else you've seen or played against this season?  
TYLER COOK: You know, they play a unique style of basketball. You don't see it
too often. But just like we do in the regular season, we've got to watch film
and scout and do the best that we can and trying to figure out what we can do
to try to, I guess, lessen the impact what they do defensively.  
  
So our coaches have done a great job kind of putting together a game plan for
us. We watch a ton of film. Like I said, they've scouted to the best of their
ability. So I feel like after today, heading into tomorrow morning we'll be
prepared for them.  
  
Q. Nick, I believe you're the only player on this roster that's been to
the NCAA Tournament with Iowa. Just what do you remember from that experience?
And also, do you buy into the fact that some people say to succeed in the
tournament you have to have tournament experience? Do you buy that at all?  
NICHOLAS BAER: I wouldn't say you necessarily have to have tournament
experience. I know a lot of guys on this team it's the first time going to the
NCAA Tournament. But I think there's certain things you need to be able to do
in March that are going to be keys to succeed and to advance. And being able
to execute, like, under pressure and being able to stick to your defensive
rules, I think those are more important things than having the experience.  
  
This is obviously a very unique atmosphere but at the same time a lot of these
guys are preparing for this moment their whole lives, and that's why you come
to Iowa and that's why you play at this level is to play on this platform.  
  
Q. Tyler, I think I saw on an interview you did in the last few days
sometime that you may have played with or against Jarron Cumberland in high
school. Could you elaborate and share those memories?  
TYLER COOK: We don't have like a super close relationship or anything like
that. I met him in Chicago at the Nike Global games. I believe it was my
junior year at high school. We played on the same team together. It was me,
him, Myles, (indiscernible) Cassius, Nick Ward. He played well.  
  
It was the first time I saw him play and first time I met him. And from then I
knew he would be a really good player, which he is today. That's the first
time I've seen him play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach McCaffery, comments?  
  
COACH MCCAFFERY: We're thrilled to have this opportunity. Proud of our team.
Tremendous respect for Cincinnati and the job that Mick Cronin has done there
and the success that that team had. We played a long, grueling, 20-game
schedule in the Big Ten and accomplished a lot of great things. Proud of my
guys and looking forward to playing tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach Cronin mentioned this week that you guys are friends off the
court. I'm curious how that relationship started and what it's like.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: It started many years ago before he even got into this
business. I was at Notre Dame and he was a very young coach, and got to know
him then and over the years obviously we crossed paths. But we spent a lot of
time a few years ago at the Final Four when my son Patrick was sick. That was
in 2013 when he was diagnosed with cancer.  
  
We have a lot of mutual friends. We talk periodically and so we're on the
road. We spend time together, go out to dinner, that type of thing. Just a
coach that I have tremendous respect for -- how he does it. I think he is a
guy that has great respect for the game and has had an interesting path to the
success where he is. He grinded his way up. And that's kind of who he is.  
  
So I would say he's a dear friend in this business and somebody that I have
tremendous respect for.  
  
Q. Is it easier or more difficult to prepare for a coach that you know
that well?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I think it's about the same simply because we don't see a lot
of teams in that league. We don't watch them as much. I kind of follow him
because of my friendship with him and hope he does well. But it wasn't until
now that we really studied his program.  
  
I kind of know they defend, they rebound. They have a toughness about them
that's somewhat unique. But I've been really impressed with how they share the
basketball. Even with Cumberland shooting as many shots as he shoots, he gives
it up easy. He has 123 assists.  
  
So I think that's kind of the beauty of this tournament. You're playing teams
that sort of know you but don't know you as well because we're grinding so
hard with a 20-game Big Ten schedule.  
  
Q. Obviously the kids are excited and probably nervous and butterflies.
You've been doing this a long time. This isn't your first rodeo. Do you get
nervous, amped up and nervous for this weekend?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I don't get nervous coaching the game. I've done it so many
times. But I understand and appreciate that this is different. And it should
be. It's a tremendous accomplishment. Everybody wants to do well.  
  
Every coach, every player, every assistant coach who had that scout, you want
to do the best you can. You want to help your team advance. We're all trying
to do the same thing. So I'm understanding and respectful of that.  
  
We'll do everything we can to stay positive, because when you get out there,
the critical thing is going to be can you get to the next play, because
somebody's going to miss a shot, somebody is going to make a mistake, turn it
over, forget an assignment. You want that to be obviously limited and not be a
trend. Once it happens once, twice, three times, that can't happen when you
get here. So I think our guys are mature enough and intelligent enough to
understand that and after what we've been through, get ready for it.  
  
Q. Connor's had an interesting week. Just curious as his father and as
his coach in basketball you've seen him juggle the baseball, basketball thing,
and obviously it's got to be tough.  
COACH MCCAFFERY: I was just incredibly impressed with him. We got up after we
lost to Michigan on Friday night, and I didn't really know that he was going
to jump in the car and head up and play on Saturday. We got back in time to
see him. He played Saturday. Then he played a doubleheader Sunday. Then he
played Tuesday.  
  
He was at practice. He didn't miss any practices for us. And then to go
4-for-8 with two walks and two stolen bases and a couple of doubles, I was
really impressed that he was able to do that. But probably more so that he was
Academic All-Big Ten while doing all of that. So just couldn't be more proud
of him.  
  
And I remember, seems like yesterday that he was thrilled to be out there in
the layup lines when we're warming up in Tampa, 2008, and now he's playing.
So, it's really a proud moment.  
  
Q. In your experience entering this tournament, is there any different
way you have to approach it when you win a lot of games coming into the
tournament or you're in a bit of a downspout coming in?  
COACH MCCAFFERY: No, I don't think so. We've kind of done it both ways. I
think you feel better if you came in riding a winning streak. A couple years
ago I know we were 6-6, ended up 12-6 in the league and won our last six games
in a row and felt really good.  
  
But I think you look at the body of work and you consistently analyze where do
we have to get better? If we didn't win, what could we have done differently?
And then you're now shifting to a completely different team, from a different
league. But your preparation is very similar, very business-like -- grind,
watching film, get on the court in practice. This time of year I think if
you're going two and a half hours in practice, you're crazy. So we scaled back
practice time, make sure we have fresh legs, but at the same time focus on the
interesting or specific things that we have to do for that game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Colgate student-athletes Rapolas Ivanauskas,
Will Rayman and Jordan Burns.  
  
Q. Jordan, there was a story circulating that you took an Uber to get
here. Could you just go into detail about that whole experience?  
JORDAN BURNS: That wasn't true at all. Fake news.  
  
Q. You guys have obviously won a lot of games down the stretch. How
important do you think it is having confidence going up against an opponent
like Tennessee and just coming into this tournament in general?  
JORDAN BURNS: I think it's a big key for us. The confidence is what keeps us
going when we're on the court. In order to make shots and things like that,
you have to be confident. I think it's a very big deal for us going into this
game.  
  
Q. Rap, talk about dealing with Grant Williams and what kind of player
you think he is?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: Grant Williams is a fantastic player. We scouted him all
week. Really strong guy, really great in the post, really good in the duck-in
situations. It's going to be a tough situation it's not going to be just me
and Dana or anyone else. It's going to be a team effort. He's an All-American
and we have a lot of respect for him. And we can't wait to play him.  
  
Q. Jordan, what's this week been like for you guys? And just how
different is it than, say, a tough regular season stretch?  
JORDAN BURNS: It's just been fun for us to be able to make the tournament.
It's just really a blessing for us. We're having as much fun as we can on this
trip while still trying to stay serious and really compete during the
tournament. So it's just been really fun for us.  
  
Q. How do you handle the nerves of this week and what's at stake?  
WILL RAYMAN: Honestly, like, we're really just trying to play free. We know
that we're a really good team and we're just trying to soak up the whole
experience and play with as much confidence as possible.  
  
Q. With what's at stake, how are you able to do the Jedi mind trick to
make yourself feel that way?  
WILL RAYMAN: I don't know. Just every day in practice we know the type of team
that we are. Like, there's really nothing to be nervous about. We're playing
in front of a bunch more people than we do at Cotterell Court, but for us it's
the same for the team.  
  
Q. Rap, I'm curious, what's it like to be here these last couple of days
in Columbus? What's the experience been like, the magnitude?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: It's a surreal feeling. I can say it for all my teammates.
Just being here, being somewhere close to home, too, so my family can come
out. Just being in the hotel, seeing the Colgate logo and the March Madness
logo, it's stuff you grew up with. You turn on CBS, see all the college games.  
  
And it's awesome to be a part of it. Awesome and a blessing to be part of it.
But now that we're here it's time to get down to business and we have work to
do.  
  
Q. I was on campus on Monday. And this is all everybody's talking about.
What do you say to all your friends and classmates and teachers, people that
will be watching from home?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: Just thank you. Thank you for my professors for letting me
come here. But in all seriousness, thank you so much. We know we're going to
get a lot of good viewership back home around that area. We've been supported.
We've been understood.  
  
And guys have really been -- even coming out here, we have a lot of football
players coming out here to support us, just really, really thankful to them.  
  
Q. Have you looked at 15 seeds from the past -- Florida Gulf Coast,
Middle Tennessee -- have you looked at their storylines and kind of figured
out what their secret was?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: Not necessarily looking in depth with it. But I know just
looking at Middle Tennessee beating Michigan State and just great upset
stories. And it all could happen.  
  
Like Will said, we're playing free. We're not playing with nerves. We're
really happy to be here, but we also know we earned our way here. It's not
just a fluke that we're here. We know we deserve to be here too.  
  
Q. Jordan, especially with Bone at the point, Tennessee likes to go fast
and can speed it up. What's the key against that in trying to maybe slow them
down?  
JORDAN BURNS: Our coaches, they devised a good game plan for us. So basically
we're going to go in there do what Coach says. There's nothing new for us.
We're just going to go out there and play hard. They're another team just like
us. So we're going to go out there and play hard and leave it all out on the
court.  
  
Q. Will, you're the elder statesman in this group as far as wearing a
Colgate uniform. What's the difference and journey for you for the past few
years to get to this point with this team?  
WILL RAYMAN: I think it just shows that every single day since I was a
freshmen, our whole team has been putting the work. We attracted players like
Jordan and Rap who are really good players. And during league play we all
started to come together and it's been fun to be part of that.  
  
Q. Rap, you're the newcomer this year, the transfer that came in. How
has it been fitting in with the team and how is it that you've helped them get
to this point?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: It's a testament to Coach and these two guys here my
teammates. I didn't know how I would fit in. People told me they needed me
here and that I could contribute. But they took me in. They put their egos
aside. They put their stats aside.  
  
They were just, like, we just need to win. We want to win. We want to make the
tournament. That's a testament to these two guys. They've been really humble
and really kind in taking me in. So I'm really appreciative for them.  
  
Q. Jordan, I know that as well as you all shoot the 3 ball as a team,
there's also the turnover numbers kind of are what they are and they're pretty
high. How paramount is it, how important is it to kind of keep the ball, to
not let Tennessee get out and run by a team with that much athleticism? How
important is it to kind of take care of the ball?  
JORDAN BURNS: We've stressed that a lot in practice, the turnover margin and
things like that. It's very important because they can get out and run and get
a lot of easy points in transition and things like that. So basically what
we're doing is just planning on running good offense, moving the ball, and
making sure that whenever we're rebounding, things like that, we can get
defensive rebounds and offensive rebounds at the same time so they can't get
out on easy run-outs.  
  
Q. Rap, you mentioned watching this tournament when you were a kid. Back
then did you fill out brackets looking for the 15 seed or the Cinderella
story? And what's it like being that team now?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: Yeah, no, 100 percent, it's unimaginable. I remember
making all these brackets and always being around -- my little brother would
always beat me. Just picking out random teams, he would always get all the
upsets.  
  
No, just being here -- obviously I didn't make a bracket -- but just being
here, it's such a surreal experience, just being -- knowing that you've got
other kids watching our games on national TV and other kids that are like me.  
  
Q. Rap said he didn't make a bracket. Did either of you other guys make
a bracket and did you pick yourself if you did?  
WILL RAYMAN: No. I've just gotten a bunch of pictures, like, oh, Colgate,
Sweet 16, blah, blah, blah. It's just really fun to see all my friend picking
us.  
  
JORDAN BURNS: Same with me. Didn't make a bracket, but I got two brothers.
They both picked us to win the national championship. (Laughter). It's good.  
  
Q. Following up on that, I'm sure you were all March Madness fans when
you were kids. For each of you, what comes to mind? What's your favorite
moment from watching this tournament?  
WILL RAYMAN: My dad actually used to work for Newsday. I think the best part
is just seeing our name everywhere, like, seeing Colgate everywhere, and just
like trying to show as much exposure about Colgate because a lot of people
don't even know that. I feel like that's the best part.  
  
Q. When you were a kid?  
WILL RAYMAN: When I was a kid? Just filling out the brackets. Looking at the
newspaper, turning on SportsCenter. That's honestly the best thing.  
  
JORDAN BURNS: For me, honestly I don't even remember a time when I was
younger. I was really into football. So March Madness was just something I
turned on the TV and watched, got to see on ESPN. Filled out a couple of
brackets when I was younger, but that's about it for me.  
  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: For me, I have -- definitely pretty memorable. My cousin
played for Florida State when they won the ACC. So they went to the Big Dance
a couple times, went to the Sweet 16, got knocked out by a good VCU team.  
  
Watching him he was a big inspiration to me. Him playing, him playing well,
winning the ACC it's just inspiration for me because the ACC is run by those
two teams usually and they were the underdog that year.  
  
Actually today is his birthday, so I'll give him a shoutout. Happy birthday,
Deividas.  
  
Q. What's his name?  
RAPOLAS IVANAUSKAS: Deividas Dulkys.  
  
Q. Jordan, when basketball became serious in your life you envisioned
playing in the NCAA Tournament. Is it surreal a kid from San Antonio
representing a school from small Hamilton, New York?  
JORDAN BURNS: It's surreal still to this moment. Just growing up, when I
decided to stop playing football in ninth grade and just decided to focus on
basketball, thinking about making it to this moment was never really a thing.
I never really thought I was even going to be able to have this experience, be
able to be here with this wonderful group of guys with a great head coach and
great assistant coaches and things like that. This is something I could have
never envisioned. I'm blessed, really.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you go back, you were asked originally about this Uber,
can you elaborate on that. This was like a fake tweet? And what's the reaction
since then?  
JORDAN BURNS: I found out about it last night. My mother called me. And my
mother called me she was, like, wow, I know if you would have missed this
flight I know you would have picked up the phone and called me, right? I was,
like, yeah, mom, I'm in the hotel and things like that.  
  
I had a lot of little messages like, did you not make it? Like, wow, they left
you? Really? Like, that's crazy. After everything you've done.  
  
People are telling me all this stuff. It's funny. But it's just a fake tweet.
It's really hysterical.  
  
Q. Jordan, I know you all shoot the 3 ball at a pretty high clip and
have most of the season, especially the past couple of months. And Tennessee,
as good as it has been this season has sometimes been vulnerable from there.
Is that something you feel you can take advantage of if you play your game?  
JORDAN BURNS: Of course. I think everybody looking at this game says that if
we can shoot the 3 ball well we'll have a good chance winning this game.
That's our plan. We're planning on hitting shots. Planning on going and making
the right shots.  
  
So the 3 ball is going to be very important in this game and hopefully we can
knock down and come out with a win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. We'll start off with a general statement from Coach
Langel about the status of his team and how he's feeling at this very exciting
moment and then we'll take your questions.  
  
COACH LANGEL: I think the last week-plus has been a really exciting time for
us as I think back to when I was a first-time head coach eight years ago. I
didn't necessarily think about winning championships, but what I wanted for
the student-athletes that we were going to coach is to have a chance to have
the experiences that I was able to have as a student-athlete.  
  
And I think that this group has embraced that. They've built on the work that
a lot of other guys have done over the last handful of years. And what they've
been able to achieve this year for our school and our program is really
significant. So I'm extremely proud of their efforts over the course of this
season and the offseason.  
  
And I know they're super excited to be here and for the opportunity that we
have tomorrow afternoon.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Obviously the players are going to be nervous and amped and
butterflies and all that. But how about you as a coach, how do you deal with
it and how do you keep your focus on the biggest game of your season?  
COACH LANGEL: For me, I don't really look at it like the biggest game of our
season. For me that -- the last eight regular season games, if we were going
to have a chance to do what the group set out to do, be regular season
champions, we were going to have to win them all.  
  
And obviously to get to this stage, to win three games in whatever it was
eight or nine or 10 days, I think those games are the ones that you really
concern yourself with as a coach. Are we doing everything we can to prepare?
Are you, in game, making the adjustments you need to?  
  
Here, for this game, I don't think there's many people out there who are
expecting us to win. So in so many ways the pressure is off. I think what
we're trying to do as a coaching staff is we have the good fortune of having
been in our players' sneakers before. So just trying to share with them.  
  
There's going to be some nervous. There's absolutely some excitement. When the
ball goes up, it's a game, it's just a basketball game. So all this stuff that
is new for them, hopefully, will settle down early in the game and play the
way we've played all season and give ourselves a chance to be really
competitive.  
  
Q. Coach, for a lot of fans and young players, tomorrow will be the
first time they see Colgate play on the national stage like this. What kind of
feel do you want them to take away from the game after watching Colgate play?
What do you want them to know about Colgate basketball after watching a game
like this?  
COACH LANGEL: I hope that we're able to play the way we've played all season.
For me that's a group that really helps one another all the time. Again, their
belief in themselves as individuals and the group as a whole is significant
for me.  
  
I think on the offensive end -- and that's been our better side of the ball
all year -- is that we really share the ball. That we've got a number of guys
who are threats to make individual plays, but that we're at our best when the
ball's moving and we're sharing the basketball inside and out. And so I think
that that's what I'm hopeful that our guys are able to do tomorrow afternoon
for everybody watching.  
  
Q. We're going to do an interview with Pat Moore in a little bit. A kid
from Utica, went to Colgate, an alum, now coaching. What do you have to say
about your assistant coach?  
COACH LANGEL: I'm thrilled to have him as part of our coaching staff. It was a
joy to coach him as a player, again. When you inherit a roster you didn't
recruit any of those guys, no matter where you are. And from day one Patrick
did everything possible to help build the program that we were trying to
build.  
  
So for me, a big part of building a program was to try and find some
continuity, some continuity through the years, because I was fortunate enough
to play and then coach at two programs, Penn and Temple, with great history
and tradition. And a huge part of that experience for me was generational --
that guys from the past were still a part of the program.  
  
So to have Pat now as part of our staff, I think it's evidence that that
exists for Colgate basketball and I'm really proud of that.  
  
Q. Have you looked at any other 15 seeds in tournament history --
Florida Gulf Coast, Middle Tennessee -- Cinderella stories in the past for
your own preparation or have you discussed it with your players?  
COACH LANGEL: No. To be honest, I mean, I did go back and watch the Loyola
Chicago game against Tennessee from last year as well as other games. We don't
resemble many SEC teams. So as you try and find some ways to be competitive
against a team like Tennessee, you do try and find some common games, some
teams that maybe you can identify with how they play, how they manage the
game, how they were able to stay competitive.  
  
But I haven't gone back into the history. I mean, I remember watching them as
a kid, but I haven't gone back to study them in our preparation.  
  
Q. And I guess my last question is I was on campus on Monday and I asked
this of your players. This is what everyone's talking about on campus. What do
you say to the campus community watching at home?  
COACH LANGEL: I'm really thankful. I'm thankful for everything they've done
for us, especially in that tournament run. Our students were all on spring
break, the community came out, the campus community, the local Hamilton
community.  
  
For me it's what's really special about March Madness is that you're able to,
when you're able to get here, so many people are excited for you and are able
to join in the process. So to everybody back home, certainly thankful for
everything they've done.  
  
Q. When you look at a team like Tennessee, obviously without divulging
your game plan, I'm sure you have no desire to do that, but how do you weigh
doing maybe what it is you all do that got you all here versus trying to maybe
control tempo or do something to get them out of their game, because you look
at the stats and you all seem to put the ball in the bucket, too. I'm guessing
you wouldn't want to get out of your element and doing what you don't do
normally?  
COACH LANGEL: Yeah, my son's nine years old, and he's a basketball junkie.
He's watching the ACC Tournament, the SEC Tournament, all the possible teams
that we could play. And after Tennessee lost, he said, dad, we might play
Tennessee here's what we should do. Don't let any of their three leading
scorers ever touch the ball and we'll be good. So for everybody out there,
that's our game plan. (Laughter).  
  
I think your point is dead accurate. We've been at our best in transition. But
if you try and go up and down and play transition basketball with a team of
their caliber, you're running a big risk. So I think we've got to manage the
game.  
  
When we haven't done well, it's kind of like when Tennessee hasn't done well,
they lost the championship game, they turned it over, needlessly you could
say, a number of times. Some of the bigger games we played -- not that Penn
State, Syracuse, some of those games, not that they're quite the caliber of
Tennessee -- but we've turned the ball over.  
  
So you've got to manage the game. You've got to play within yourself, but
while also doing what you've done all year long to have that success. So a
couple little wrinkles here and there on both ends to try and help the guys
with what Tennessee will be. But for the most part you've got to try and go be
who you are and play the best that you've played all year.  
  
Q. When you look at last year around this time, you all made a pretty
good run in the postseason. Ran into Bucknell at the end there. When did you
know this team this season could be different? When did you know this group of
guys here could kind of reach this moment?  
COACH LANGEL: I felt really good about the roster that we were going to
return. We were able to recruit Rapolas as a transfer in the spring. There was
some conversation that we didn't know which direction it would go as far as
him gaining immediate eligibility.  
  
Even without him I felt we could compete for a championship in our league. And
when we did find out early in the season, that first game day, that he would
be eligible after having him in practice and working with him, I thought we
had a team of really legitimate size, not just for the Patriot League but for
any league. And I liked our skill and I liked our pieces.  
  
But you never know. You never know how a season is going to go, how that group
is going to come together. Tucker Richardson is a freshman. We thought he'd
really be good, but how he's able to handle himself with the other guys and
handle the game and grow up as a player and within the team, you never know as
a coach how those things are going to go.  
  
But going back to last season I felt really good about the team we would have
coming back.  
  
Q. All three of your players said part of the joy for them growing up
watching this tournament was the Cinderella or finding the Colgate that could
shock the bracket or shock the world. You've been there as a player before. Is
there any lesson you take from kind of being that team and what it's like when
the crowd gets behind you that you share with them or try to help them out
tomorrow?  
COACH LANGEL: Amongst other things, I think it's what makes March Madness so
special is that literally everybody stops what they're doing and turns on the
TV or has it on the Internet to see who's doing well. And it can be a
contagious thing.  
  
So we certainly -- I wasn't able to be a part of a team that won as an
underdog. We certainly fought hard and that's something that we've talked to
our guys about, some of the things that we learned as student-athletes, the
guys on our staff who were able to do that. But I do think that's something
that's an exciting part of the year.  
  
So when you're in their spot, they're dreaming about being one of those teams,
and you certainly try and channel that energy to play the best you can.  
  
Q. All three of them also said they did not fill out a bracket, but a
lot of their friends had Colgate advancing. Did you or did you leave that to
your son?  
COACH LANGEL: Someone told me we're in the Southern region. I had no idea.
Once our name was announced, it was -- I knew who we were playing; I knew the
other teams that would be here. I couldn't even tell you all the teams that
are still playing and who they're playing against or any of those things.  
  
I'm sure my son, Luke, filled out his bracket and hopefully he has Colgate
winning at least a game or two. But it's a fun time of the year for a lot of
people. As a coach, you're just trying, again, to do the best you can to help
your guys perform at their optimal level.  
  
Q. You left no stone unturned in recruiting players to your program.
Obviously the recruiting footprint is bigger in Knoxville than Hamilton, but
in a lot of ways Tennessee is unheralded, under-recruited, three-star-or-below
guys. Do you share any commonality with Coach Barnes in that aspect trying to
sell players to your program?  
COACH LANGEL: As I've studied this Tennessee team and talked to people across
the country, if I could share any common traits with Coach Barnes as a
basketball coach, I would be really proud.  
  
I think that the coach that he is, the job that he's done, not just at
Tennessee but everywhere he's been, is absolutely a footprint that I would
like to follow in.  
  
This group of Tennessee guys, they're a throw-back group. In today's day and
age, with all the analytics and everybody's 3 and D, and, like, they just play
really good basketball. They don't turn it over. I think they have the top two
guys assist-to-turnover in the entire SEC on one team. Like that unheard of.  
  
They're so good at getting into the paint. And again they have such a good
record because they don't ever beat themselves hardly.  
  
So the recruiting part of it, yeah, we've had to recruit a lot of guys who
didn't have a lot of other opportunities, just like maybe Tennessee doesn't
have a roster full of McDonald's All-Americans but yet is beating teams with
them.  
  
So in that way, I do think you're right that we have to find other ways to
build our programs. And we're certainly really proud of that.  
  
Q. You mentioned drawing on your experience. I'm curious when you think
back to the starts of those games you played, what were you feeling like and
was there anything that helped you settle in?  
COACH LANGEL: Yeah, you're nervous; you're excited. There's a sense of energy.
Again, our guys don't experience these things, press conferences with their
names in front of them and this size of arena and all the things that go into
the NCAA Tournament.  
  
So you're balancing enjoying the moment with getting yourself ready to play
the best you've ever played. Seeing the ball go through the hoop helped me
immeasurably. I remember we played Florida in Key Arena in Seattle and we were
able to make a couple shots early in the game. And I think there's nothing
more that helps a team better than seeing the ball go through the hoop.
Hopefully that can happen for us tomorrow afternoon.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Washington student-athletes Matisse Thybulle
and Jaylen Nowell as well as head coach Mike Hopkins. Questions for the
student-athletes first?  
  
Q. Matisse and Jaylen, after taking a look at Sam Merrill on tape or
sort of as you guys get into Utah State a bit, what jumps out at you about,
first, Sam and then how they run their offense?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: First thing for me is firstly how talented he is as a scorer
and just how he does it so effortlessly. He's able to put up big numbers and
it's not by forcing things or taking bad shots. He's a great team player.  
  
And also to add on to that their team as a whole plays really well together.
And it's cool to see, but, yeah, they play well together and they have a great
leader in Sam and a great scorer with him as well.  
  
JAYLEN NOWELL: He really moves the ball very well. He doesn't really force a
lot of shots. That's something you really need as a leader. He's been having a
great year and he's a really good player. He's been leading that team very
well this whole year.  
  
Q. Matisse, just how have you guys gone about shaking off the loss in
the conference tournament and then entering March where a lot of teams come in
really hot?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: I mean, it's always the next game. Win or loss, you can't
dwell on it. For us we moved on the second we got off the bus and we're
excited to be here and have this opportunity to play in March Madness.  
  
Q. It's been since 2011, I believe, since Washington's been back to the
tournament. You guys were in late elementary school, middle school maybe then.
Do either of you guys have any memory of that? And then your thoughts about
being the ones to get Washington back here?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: I do not remember that. 2011, I was probably 10 years old.
Probably somewhere in my backyard maybe, shooting. I don't know what I was
doing. Do you remember?  
  
MATISSE THYBULLE: No. I think for me and I know for Jaylen as well, it's
really exciting to be able to bring U-Dub back to this stage because I know
that Husky basketball has been known as a great program. And they went through
a stretch they were able to get out, play in March Madness for a little while
and it's been too long. And we're just really happy to be able to bring us
back.  
  
Q. What's your campus experience been like since Sunday? Obviously
there's a high level of excitement among the other students who are on campus,
and you guys are heroes for at least a few days, and hopefully more.  
MATISSE THYBULLE: It's been cool just to see over the course of the year just
how people have just banned together and supporting us, whether it's been from
professors to students to staff members. And it's been really cool to see how
people are getting excited again about our basketball team.  
  
Q. Matisse, what's the biggest difference you've seen from Jaylen when
he was a freshman coming in this season? What's the biggest development you've
seen in his game?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: That's a tough one. We've talked about it a little bit. When
Jaylen got to U-Dub, he was just a killer. He knew how to score. So his
freshman year was a lot of that. You saw that with his first game. Who comes
out in their college debut and scores 30 points? That's insane.  
  
And I think his biggest development is just being -- he's become a greater,
like a well-rounded player. He thinks the game at a way higher level. He makes
everyone around him a lot better now. Just to be able to see how far he's come
from that first year in just one year really has been really impressive.  
  
Q. I wanted to ask about Mike Hopkins. What have you seen him do in the
last two years to start -- maybe set his culture with the program? And he just
got signed to an extension. Where do you see that development potentially
going?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: Well, first, I would love to say Coach Hopkins has been one of
the best coaches I could ever ask for. And when he comes in day in and day
out, he works very hard on everything. He loves all of us. We love him. And we
just love coming in and working hard for him.  
  
And the first year was exciting. For him to come in and especially this year
with just the energy he gives us, he brings us all as a team, brings us
together even more as a family. That's really one thing that he really harps
on is that we're all family and that's what we've all been.  
  
Q. What's been your experience like, Matisse, with Hopkins? Projecting
forward maybe a little bit, where do you see maybe that culture and the growth
continuing to go?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: It's been good. We were joking about walking in here, about
how he's a player's coach. I think that's a huge thing. I think going forward
his ability to build relationships with his guys -- we've only been with him
for two years. But the guys to start off with him to see how their
relationships grow, going into their third and fourth years. And just to be
able to use that as a recruiting point going forward because we all know we
love him. And it's becoming more and more known throughout the country he's a
great guy and a better coach. And the family he's created at U-Dub has been
great and we can't wait to see where it goes from here.  
  
Q. He's got a ton of NCAA Tournament experience. What has that messaging
been like from him? And you mentioned him being a player's coach. From the
experience perspective, like, how has he messaged to you guys in Columbus?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: I think it's exciting to have a coach -- and I think more
importantly our coaching staff has a lot of experience in the tournament and
has had a lot of success. And being with people who have been here and done
that at the highest level, it's pretty special, because none of us players
have been able to play at this level.  
  
And to have that comforting force in our coach and our coaching staff, knowing
that they know what it's like, what to expect is pretty reassuring and, like I
said, comforting to have.  
  
Q. Matisse, Utah State's coach compared you to Deion Sanders and how you
cover the court. I'm wondering what is it about this defense that's allowed
certain things in your game or just natural things you have to blossom the way
it has?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: These guys. I mean, seriously, we play zone and these guys
load up the backside, so I'm able to go and make plays and try and chase the
ball around a little bit. And that's been, that's huge for me because just
trying to be disruptive, I have to be able to go and get out and gamble
sometimes and kind of put our team in some tough situations. And they do an
incredible job having my back.  
  
And honestly they make great plays out of that. So I think from my own
personal success a lot had to do with, one, Coach Hop, and, two, the four guys
I have on my back at all times.  
  
Q. When you were growing up, is that the style you had or is that
something you grew into when your body grew?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: Whenever my teams would press, they would throw me in the
middle of the zone and I would pick off as many passes as possible.  
  
Q. You really were Deion?  
COACH HOPKINS: Never played football.  
  
Q. What is the goofiest thing Hop as done hop, whether practice, on the
bus or team meal, whatever?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: That's a good question. There's so many highlights with this
man.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Feel free to protect your playing time at this point.
(Laughter).  
  
JAYLEN NOWELL: I don't know. That's a tough question. I could think of plenty.  
  
MATISSE THYBULLE: He has -- sometimes he'll go on his little tangents, rants,
and he'll start reenacting what us players did on the court and just kind of
making fun of us. One time he was frustrated at one of our guys because he
grabbed on the rim and got an offensive interference.  
  
And he was re-enacting that play in our film room. And like he jumped up and
punched one of the little ceiling panels and like shifted it so there was like
a hole, and it didn't get fixed for weeks. That was pretty funny.  
  
JAYLEN NOWELL: I've got one. We have this little bat that symbolizes our
"Tougher Together" saying. So like sometimes he'll get kind of angry and he'll
kind of pull it out, kind of point at us, like tell us everything we're doing
wrong.  
  
And one day he kind of pointed at us and held it up like this, so everybody's
kind of thinking, oh, he's about to hit somebody. But he kind of just put it
up and just walked out the room and didn't say nothing. And we're all like
looking around like, okay, what is he about to do? Is he about to go break
something in our locker room or is he about to come back and really start
swinging on us? So that's one. That was one that I could actually -- crazy.  
  
Q. Didn't swing on anybody?  
JAYLEN NOWELL: No, he didn't swing on nobody.  
  
MATISSE THYBULLE: One thing he does a lot -- we don't think about it anymore
-- he'll just drop and do push-ups for no reason. He'll just get really
excited and start doing push-ups.  
  
He's done it in press conferences. I think the first one in U-Dub, he dropped
down and did a couple. Push-ups are his thing.  
  
Q. Is there anyone on your team or their team, is there an X factor in
this game? Maybe somebody who isn't getting, who isn't on this podium who
isn't getting a lot of attention but could be a big difference in this game?  
MATISSE THYBULLE: I don't know. For us it's kind of -- we're pretty special in
the way it could be any guy for any game. And we've shown that like throughout
the season it doesn't really matter. We have guys who step up coming off the
bench. We have starters who step up who usually don't score that much. I think
that makes us a pretty special team because it can come from anyone at any
night.  
  
And as for Utah State, they have a lot of guys who aren't very well known. And
if you look at the numbers, they have some really, really talented guys. And I
don't think that a lot of people across the country know much about them. But
I know they'll start hearing about their names coming up soon. And I think
that us respecting the scout and just being aware of our coverages will help
us a lot because they've got some firepower that just isn't talked about much.  
  
JAYLEN NOWELL: Like T said, we have a team that really has a lot of guys that
can be on any given night. So everybody's going to come out and play hard and
that's one thing that we really take pride in.  
  
And for the other team they have a lot of guys as well. They're not as known.
But they won the championship for a reason. And they're a really good team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, your thoughts.  
  
COACH HOPKINS: Just so blessed and grateful to have the opportunity to be in
the NCAA Tournament. The last two years have been an incredible journey with
our seniors sticking with the program and really working hard and having a
really good year and getting an opportunity to play for a national
championship. It's really, really special.  
  
It's one of those feelings that not only now but for the future you want to
have for the rest of your life.  
  
Q. Matisse and Jaylen mentioned you've done push-ups at press
conferences, so we'll leave it up to you when we finish up with questions.
Just how important or maybe even awkward was it to get your contract done
during the season before the NCAA Tournament, maybe to get that out of the
way? Was the timing great or was this kind of --  
COACH HOPKINS: For me it's a simple -- I've always believed in surrounding
yourself with great people. And I have at the University of Washington. I'm
excited to be there for a long time. But this is all about the kids. This is
the experience for the kids to have an opportunity to hopefully finish out
what has been a successful season. It's not about me. It never has been. And
next question.  
  
Q. Do you think this sends some type of a message as to the school's
commitment to you and then your commitment to the school?  
COACH HOPKINS: Like I said, surround yourself with great people, and I'm with
an incredible university, and I love the kids that I coach. And just really
blessed and lucky to be there, to be the head coach.  
  
Q. It's been eight years, I believe, since Washington's been to the
tournament. Can you talk about what that means to you and your players to be
the ones to bring the team back here and how important that was when you were
back on campus and that sort of thing?  
COACH HOPKINS: I think I really believe in like the score takes care of
itself. And what does that mean? It means you surround yourself with great
people. I've got an incredible staff. And you just try to get better every
day.  
  
And you never know, people that ask me, is the speed of where you're at right
now, does that matter? Did you think it would be this fast? To be honest with
you, you just focus on how we're going to get better.  
  
And so to see these guys grow, especially the seniors, and our young guys, and
to keep getting better and to keep getting better, you never think about it
was eight years in the NCAA Tournament. Your goal is to get an opportunity to
play in the NCAA Tournament because your ultimate goal is a chance to win the
national championship. That's what March Madness is all about.  
  
So for me to have been a part of a whole group to get them to get that
opportunity and to feel that is really, really special.  
  
Q. You've been to 18 tournaments, I think, as an assistant coach. Is it
different as the head coach, finally, especially since you were going to be
the head coach-designate at Syracuse?  
COACH HOPKINS: I don't think it's different. The feeling -- Cam Dollar was a
national champion at UCLA. Dave Rice was a national champion at UNLV. So our
staff experienced it, and what you're trying to do is to lead these young men
to understanding what it takes to be successful and have a chance to be in
this tournament, and to see them walk in that locker room and seeing
"Washington" and seeing their name tag, and watching the tournament today,
which I think today and tomorrow are the greatest day in sport. And to be a
part of that, it's special.  
  
The one thing I've learned about being successful in the tournament is it's
special, it's great. But nothing changes. We talked about don't eat the
cheese. It's about focusing in and there's one truth: To win the game, you've
got to go out and execute your game plan. You've got to do it together. And
when we've done that we've been a successful team this season.  
  
Q. Curious, has there been any kind of messaging with people from
Syracuse, with Jim; and if so, what have those interactions been like? And any
thought you might have matched up with them going into this?  
COACH HOPKINS: You know what, obviously Syracuse raised me. It was a huge part
of my life. I know Coach Boeheim as well as I think anybody in the business.
And I know he's proud watching. But I also know he's preparing his team just
like we are. And I'm sure after the season we'll get together and review the
season and try to get better. But not a lot of communication other than I know
he's rooting for us and I know we're rooting for them.  
  
Q. Curious about how much you know about Utah State and maybe some of
the concerns you have facing Utah State.  
COACH HOPKINS: I think a lot of concerns, they're a heck of a team. Sam
Merrill is one of the best players that nobody knows about around the country.
We're talking about a guy who has got double the assists of anybody on their
team. He's the combo guard. And you're talking about a guy who averages over
20 points a game. He goes to the foul line. He's a great shooter.  
  
But not only that, if he's not open, he shares it. And there's not too many
players like that in the country. Neemias Queta, a guy almost averages close
to a double-double and averaging three shot blocks a game. I remember hearing
about him in the middle of the year. They were talking about this great center
at Utah State. Where did he come from? Who recruited him? Who did this?  
  
And obviously Craig Smith, he's done a tremendous job. That league is very,
very good. And to be able to win the way they did is a credit to them. And
it's going to be a heck of a challenge. And they pose a lot of challenges.  
  
Q. Is there an additional challenge for you being so west and coming
into the Midwest from just a time adjustment?  
COACH HOPKINS: No. I think these kids, they go to bed late. They've been
studying. We've had finals. These guys, just to have the opportunity to be
here and to play in such an incredible tournament and to play against the best
competition in the country, that's what you're trying to do and we have that
opportunity.  
  
Q. You've said a little bit about the contract situation. But aside from
surrounding yourself with good people and trying to get the players better,
what about this is gratifying to you from a standpoint of being a career-long
assistant at Syracuse and then making the statement with this team these last
two years; it's got to be a great degree of satisfaction for you personally?  
COACH HOPKINS: I think at the end of the day there's no question. It's all
about you're leading a bunch of young men and a staff to win. And to learn
what it takes to be successful in life. And they go hand in hand.  
  
And we've learned how to win. We've played together. We've played as a unit.
We've played for something greater than ourselves. Everybody sacrificed a
little of each other to have this successful season. And that's the type of
culture we're trying to create. So to see that and what you're selling every
day on a day-to-day basis and hammering and hammering it into these kids and
then seeing it work and them seeing it work and having success, that's what
it's all about. And just so proud of our guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Cincinnati student-athletes Cane Broome, Justin
Jenifer and Trevon Scott.  
  
Q. Cane, how do you handle the excitement this week and the nerves? And
what's your secret to get through a week that's bigger than any other week
you're dealing with in the season to this point?  
CANE BROOME: I think it's just wanting to play, keep playing. That's what we
keep in mind. It's not just about this week. We're trying to further our
season. So that's what we keep in mind every day. We said today in practice,
we didn't just came here to play one game, so that's how we stay on track and
not get too excited, try to win a tournament.  
  
Q. How do you avoid the distractions that obviously come with a week
like this with all the chatter out there?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: Just staying focused, not worrying about things we see on
social media and all the stuff we see every day and things that people talk
about, just making sure we stay focused and we stay as a team.  
  
Q. How hard is it to do that?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: It's very hard, but at the end of the day when you've got big
goals and big dreams to conquer and to get to, that's what it comes down to.  
  
Q. Trevon, a lot of people around this area maybe haven't seen you guys
play since that first game. In what areas do you think you guys have grown
most since the beginning of the season, that opener?  
TREVON SCOTT: We've grown in all areas, in all aspects from the first time we
played Ohio State. We made a lot of changes, individually and as a team. But
in every area you can think of in basketball as a team, we've grown in those
areas.  
  
Q. Trevon, having a tournament like you did in Memphis and making the
all-tournament team, what does it do for your confidence and what does it say
for your development this season?  
TREVON SCOTT: It's most definitely a confidence booster. I've got to keep my
head focussed, just keep the same focus I had while I was in Memphis, playing
hard and playing confident.  
  
A lot of the stuff I did in Memphis, it was from constant, like, reps I did
over the summer and throughout the season. And I mean I just gotta keep doing
what I was doing, just keep staying focused, focused on important things and
let the distractions go and just stay confident and I'll be fine.  
  
Q. Cane, you and Justin had a difficult senior day just as a team and
everything. Did you guys get together after that game, because obviously
things have gone pretty well since then? Did you get together after that game
and say let's keep our senior day going?  
CANE BROOME: Yes, it was a tough day, but everybody has tough days. I'm pretty
sure you guys have a tough day in the office. So we just had to come back to
the drawing board and we had better goals in mind. We didn't win that
championship but we knew we wanted to win another one.  
  
So Coach got on us about it and told us what we needed to do to fix ourselves
and told us that we would see them again in the championship. So we just
worked our way to that and tried to take it game by game. And once we got
there we just, as a team, stayed focused and mentally locked in. That was the
big change after that game, was just our mental focus.  
  
JUSTIN JENIFER: To piggyback on what he said, just after that game, it was a
rough day. We had that day. We can't just dwell on that game. We had other
games we had to prepare for and the conference tournament was coming up. So we
know that was a big stage for us, coming from our senior night not having,
like you said, a good game. So we had a bigger goal to get and we conquered
it.  
  
Q. Justin, coming into your senior campaign, March Madness, looking at
your first competitor here, Iowa, hopefully the first of many, looking at the
Iowa Hawkeyes, how do you match up against their back court?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: Following the scouting report. We always go in and come
together as a team, and we follow the scouting report. We feel if we follow
the scouting report and have Bearcat toughness, we can get the win. That's
what we did when we played Houston. If we play just like we did against
Houston and we keep that going, we can't be stopped.  
  
Q. Trevon, seems like down the stretch you've really picked up your
game, attacking the forwards and all that. I don't know, anything particularly
clicked for you or a sense of urgency. You're a junior, it's not like you're
getting old?  
TREVON SCOTT: Honestly, I just want to win, for real. I just want to win. And
I know doing things like that will, especially rebounding will help us win and
elevate our team. Like, me scoring will open up the floor for these guys also.  
  
So I was just trying to stay aggressive offensively and showing what I can do.
And also I like playing with Justin and Cane. This is their last year. So,
like, whatever I have to do to keep our season alive, so I can continue to
play with these point guards I'm going to do.  
  
Q. Did Jarron express his disappointment about not coming out to the
table with you guys?  
TREVON SCOTT: Nah.  
  
Q. Cane, talked about how hard it is winning here, compared to playing
at Sacred Heart. Three years in a row that you guys got to the tournament;
these guys it's been four years. Has it gotten harder or easier, are you more
appreciative after all these years or does it become more routine?  
CANE BROOME: It's inward pressure we've been putting on ourselves. Obviously
the last nine years we've got here in a row. It's more pressure now that we
want to further our status here. The last few years has been rough, coming out
of the second round.  
  
So I think that's more so our pressure we've been putting on each other --
let's be that team that make it. Coach has been telling us why can't you guys
be those guys that further it, especially me and Justin. We talked about it
yesterday. And I think that's more so what it is than actual pressure than
being at the tournament.  
  
Q. Cane, there's a lot of talk, just in March Madness you need elite
players to go on deep runs. What makes a player like Jarron so invaluable this
time of year?  
CANE BROOME: I think personally the way he gets fouled. Obviously it's big-
time games, the refs will be on their whistles. He has a knack for getting
fouled. He's aggressive, whether he's making shots or not. That will be huge
in this tournament.  
  
And I think he's one of the best players in this country at getting fouled.
And that in itself is going to help us in these games.  
  
Q. Justin, just what type of atmosphere or crowd are you expecting being
kind of close to home?  
JUSTIN JENIFER: It's the same. Basically like a home game. We call it -- when
they say, we was in Columbus we called it backyard basketball. Just having all
the fans wanting to come and support us is going to be a great atmosphere,
great energy for the game.  
  
Q. A little bit of a national question here. How do you guys -- how did
you guys handle your freshman-sophomore years in particular when it came to
seeing what's going on around the country in terms of transferring? Am I going
to stick this out? Do I need to look around? Did you look around? What got you
to not do what so many other of your peers are doing and stay? And what did
you see that made you want to stay as opposed to go? Did you even think of
going?  
CANE BROOME: I'm one of those guys. I can't really answer that question.  
  
JUSTIN JENIFER: Just trusting the process. Even though you come in as a
freshman, you come in thinking you can play all these minutes and stuff like
that. It don't happen that way. But, you know, sometimes you've got to look at
it and look in the mirror sometimes and know that it's you; that you've got to
work harder and go and step your game up, and looking at the older guys,
seeing what you need to do to go ahead and get better. So staying here I feel
as though was the best decision for me.  
  
Q. Can you talk about why you did it?  
CANE BROOME: Mine is different reasons. Like I had an interview with Justin
earlier this week. And as a kid I wanted to play tournaments like this. What
you see on TV. I was at a great institution, just a lower level. And I just
seen the opportunity to come be a part of something bigger than myself.  
  
And I just wanted to take that opportunity and do so. And I don't regret it
because I'm here with my brothers right now. And I think, to piggyback on what
Justin said, I haven't been here four years, but I had ups and downs here. But
I think more so as a brotherhood here, even with the coaches it's like a
brotherhood. We all stick together through tough times. And I think that's the
reason why Justin stayed, too. He made friendships here. And it's bonds you
don't want to break, whether you're playing or not. Like it's a bond you don't
want to break.  
  
TREVON SCOTT: I guess I'll say I didn't transfer. But did I have those
thoughts? I mean, at times I did. Especially coming in as a freshman expecting
to play, coming from high school, being the man on your team and coming here.
I redshirted. It was tough. But I didn't give up.  
  
I just thought about the players who did that before me and is successful --
especially from the UC program. Like Sean Kilpatrick, he was someone who I
kind of like -- I'm not going to say I looked up to -- but he was in the same
situation as me. And, I mean, he was successful. He redshirted. He was
successful. He went through hard times.  
  
And I'm like why can't I stick it out and go through hard times, make
something of it. And like they say, the friendships we made, the bonds we made
with each other and the program, like the history, it's like coming from where
I'm from -- UC is a historic program, a lot of great players come from there.
So I told myself I want to -- why can't I be another good player who gets
through this hard time and be successful.  
  
So I stuck it out. I wanted to stick it out with my brothers, and I wanted to
be successful. And it got me here to this point talking on the stage with
these guys and talking in front of you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH CRONIN: Well, it's been obviously a whirlwind week for us, winning our
conference title Sunday and trying to put that to bed, get the guys refocused
for this week. But we're obviously excited to be here. This is what it's all
about. It's why we play the regular seasons, why we play our conference
tournament, to get a chance to be on the big stage.  
  
Every kid growing up who plays basketball dreams of playing in this
tournament. So we don't take it for granted. Try to make sure our guys enjoy
it and embrace it and, most importantly, get ready to play tomorrow. So we're
extremely excited to be here.  
  
Q. How long was the bus ride? And how surprised were you to see or did
you think it was possible that you would be here in Columbus?  
COACH CRONIN: Bus ride was a little longer than usually takes me to drive it
in my car. My last trip was -- downtown's really nice. My daughter plays club
volleyball. So that's an all-day event. If anybody doesn't have a daughter
that plays club volleyball, it's an all-day event.  
  
I've walked around, beautiful day in May. It was at the convention center so I
got to see downtown. To be honest, my father is in charge of all that stuff. I
didn't even know Columbus was a site. Glad to be here.  
  
I also don't know what region we're in. I know we play Iowa and I know
Tennessee plays Colgate. And I mean that. We've been really busy the last
couple of weeks. And like I said, right now my daughter is in club volleyball
and we've got a lot going on. But Columbus is a great city. We're happy to be
here.  
  
Q. How do you control the distractions? Obviously there's a lot that
goes on in this week. And how do you keep things -- I'm sure you want to keep
things as normal as possible. But how do you go about doing that?  
COACH CRONIN: I think it's a great point. I think that you've got to realize
there's a game at 12:00 Friday and that's really what matters. And you've got
to have your mind on that.  
  
So Coach Knight said a long time ago, the mental is 4-to-1 to the physical. If
you don't have your mind in the right place, you're not going to be at your
best. And you're going to have to be at your best. Anybody can win games in
this tournament. Everybody -- obviously we play Iowa. Fran's a good coach, a
good friend of mine. They've got a great team.  
  
We talk about it a lot. You that hope your veteran guys understand that. We've
been through some distracting things this year with the opening of our arena.
The Crosstown Shootout is always a distractive situation with all the talk
that goes around it. So hopefully our guys will be able to be focused.  
  
Q. At this point do you still get nervous yourself? And how do you
temper that and handle that?  
COACH CRONIN: I don't know if -- I wouldn't say nervous; I would say excited.
If you're not excited to do what you do, I think no matter if you're a
basketball coach or you're reporting at USA Today, you probably need to try to
change your job. Because you only live one time. And I'm getting a little bit
older. I believe in that now.  
  
You've got to be excited about what you do and appreciate it. So, not nervous.
Extremely blessed and excited to be here. I don't take it lightly. Don't take
it for granted. Last time we played here -- when did this building open?  
  
Q. 2000.  
COACH CRONIN: We're pulling in, my dad said, you're playing in a building you
haven't played in. I said, you're wrong. First game in 2004 with Murray State
was here.  
  
I didn't even remember that until we were pulling in the tunnel today. I was
thinking back -- I was riding in here with my former president, Dr. King
Alexander, he's the president now at LSU, so I get a chance to say hi to him,
thank him for hiring me.  
  
So just really excited and appreciative. Always nervous. Then when I watch
Iowa make 3s on film I get a lot more nervous.  
  
Q. I think there's some people around Columbus who probably haven't
watched you since the opener against Ohio State. How much has this team grown
since that opener and how does that maybe compare to other years as well?  
COACH CRONIN: They don't watch Cincinnati up here? I'm teasing. I understand.
I understand. The answer is experience. We were very inexperienced in our
roles. Jarron Cumberland had played, but he hadn't played the star. Cane
Broome had played but, like, now he really understands that when Jarron's out
of the game or getting rest that he's got to be aggressive. Justin Jenifer
wasn't looking to shoot open shots whenever he could get them. And we weren't
running things to get him open shots until this year.  
  
Obviously the rest of our guys weren't really ever in the game. So last year
when we played in the NCAA Tournament, Keith Williams and Nysier Brooks did
not get in the game against Nevada, and they've been starters for us.  
  
The only way to grow is to get experience. I've tried to be sure I injected
that I believe in what they could become from the time we started spring
workouts last year. I think that's important. You have to make sure your guys
know you believe in them.  
  
I tell them all the time, the most important thing for young people, you've
got to believe in yourself. But you gain experience and that helps you get
better. And it's a hard thing for a guy, for a guy like Nysier Brooks, the
first time you're starting at this level. And to be as consistent as he and
Tre Scott have been for us. So the growth as players is the answer to your
question.  
  
Q. Is that different now entering into March where they haven't had
that, Jarron really came on at the end of last year at this stage, and maybe
does that give you an added element that's almost like invaluable because some
of those guys haven't had experience at this stage?  
COACH CRONIN: Tough to say. I would say of all the added elements and the
things that may go on Friday, I'll take made shots over all that stuff. You
can split atoms all you want, try to dissect what's going to happen. These
games -- it's why it's called March Madness, why it's the greatest event in
sports in the world because anything can happen whether it's UMBC or what
happened to us last year.  
  
Anything can happen at any time. So we've talked about since the end of the
regular season is playing in one-and-out environments, and that you have no
margin for error. And you have to know that when you're tying your shoes to
get ready for the tournament, that if you lose you're out.  
  
And that was our mentality going to the conference tournament. It worked well
for us. So I think that you've got to believe that you can win the tournament
or at some point in the game you may have to give up because you think, well,
we're not going to win it anyway.  
  
So I think the teams that have any advantage are the teams that think they can
win the whole tournament. And that if they don't win it that they're not going
to feel like they accomplished their goal. You might look at me and say you
guys at Cincinnati are a 7 seed, but I think that's the mentality.  
  
I don't want my guys ever walking around thinking that they can't win the
tournament. Whether we're playing Iowa or whoever is No. 1 in the country this
week, I don't know.  
  
Q. Ninth straight year for you here. Do you feel it's gotten easier or
harder?  
COACH CRONIN: I feel like I'm getting older. I think it's hard every year. You
should never underestimate how hard it is to win and never take winning for
granted. And I say that not -- fans are always going to want more. But I think
for the players, my thing is that what they accomplished this year, I want
them to know that they've done a great job.  
  
And although we expect it and we work extremely hard to sustain our success,
you can't take it for granted. And you've got to make sure that the people on
your staff, the guys that come off the bench, our managers, that everybody's a
part of it. Because everybody doesn't go to the tournament every year. We know
this.  
  
So you have to appreciate it and you have to make sure that everybody that's a
part of it knows that they're contributing. And probably getting better at
that as I get older. It's definitely not a one-man band, I can promise you
that.  
  
Q. How much of a dilemma is Iowa's grain-fed beef. They have some big
dudes?  
COACH CRONIN: Their strength?  
  
Q. They have big guys, 250 pounds-plus. You guys are strong, but you
don't have any 250-plus bodies?  
COACH CRONIN: I don't know what Noz (phonetic) weighs, but I don't know. We're
not in a sumo wrestling match, so I think how the game is called is big,
important. I think footwork is important. I think you've got to play smart. I
think the games are usually called a little tighter starting today. And the
games get real physical in conference play in February.  
  
So what we've talked about is making sure that we don't pick up cheap fouls
battling for offensive or defensive position in the low post, regardless of
who they're battling against, whether it's Garza or Cook, whomever because I
think it will be a little different. I don't think it will be quite the way
conference games tend to get real physical late in the year. I think it will
be back to more free-flowing. And I don't want them guys getting cheap fouls
in the low post early in the game.  
  
Q. Based on the numbers, looks like your rebounding is a priority for
you guys, right? How do you balance that with Iowa's transition game in terms
of crashing the offensive boards and your ability to do that?  
COACH CRONIN: That's a great question. We would never change that. I get asked
that a lot by younger coaches and people that talk about, what's your theory
on transition defense. It's called get back.  
  
And I have people -- there's a lot better coaches than me, and they rebound
two guys and they run to certain spots. I worked for -- Coach Huggins will be
in the hall of fame, and Rick Pitino. We rebound the ball, obviously your
point guard gets back.  
  
But with Iowa, I think the biggest key is you've got to find shooters early.
That's what you're alluding to. You've got to find shooters early with them.
But we will not not rebound because of that. But people do try to score on us
-- we're used to people trying to score on us in transition because of our
half-court defense can give people problems at times and it's tended to be
pretty good. So we're used to that.  
  
But it will definitely be a challenge but we will not rebound because of that.
Hopefully we won't have to. We'll make a few shots. It will be nice.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Iona student-athletes Asante Gist, Tajuan Agee
and Rickey McGill as well as coach Tim Cluess. Questions for the student-
athletes?  
  
Q. Tajuan, going back to the MAAC championship you said it was a dream
for you growing up to play in the NCAA Tournament. Now you're a day from that
dream becoming a reality taking on Chapel Hill. What are you feeling right
now?  
TAJUAN AGEE: I was excited to get the opportunity. But now it's time to buckle
down. It's time to lock in. Tomorrow's game day. We're going to treat it like
any other game.  
  
Q. Rickey, to you, what was your coach telling you when you guys were
7-15?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Just keep your eye on the basketball. Keep sticking together.
Don't give up. Don't ever settle for plays. Don't ever take a play off. And
just play your best and give it your all.  
  
Q. Rickey, last year it was Duke. This year UNC, Chapel Hill. What does
that mean to you to take on two, not only a ACC powers but national
powerhouses?  
RICKEY MCGILL: It means a lot. It's a big stage. I'm going to come out and try
to get my team the win.  
  
Q. Your coach has sort of a larger than life personality. How does his
personality impact you guys and the way you play?  
RICKEY MCGILL: He comes every day prepared to work. He tells us to go hard
every day, keep getting better, keep getting in the gym.  
  
TAJUAN AGEE: He works hard, night in and night out, whether it's film or
studying a different team or just letting us know what spots are open on the
floor against different teams. So that work ethic rubs off on us. And we just
come in and try to work hard and as hard as he works every night.  
  
ASANTE GIST: Like my teammates said, it's a lot to do with work ethic. He
instills that in us to play hard in every possession. And we just try to come
in practice every single day and do what we have to do in order to come
together to be the best team we possibly can.  
  
Q. Rickey, as one of two players on this team that's been on this stage
before, what's the message been like in the locker room with these guys
getting them ready for what lies ahead on this stage?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Just give it your all. All or nothing. We've got to play for 40
minutes just like they gotta to play 40 minutes. It's a big game for us,
bigger than any other game we've played this season. Just gotta come out and
try to get a win.  
  
Q. Going back to when you guys were 2-9, if I would have told you guys
you were about to play UNC, Chapel Hill in the NCAA Tournament, would you guys
still believe it during that tough stretch?  
ASANTE GIST: We always thought we were a good team. That never was the case.
We always knew it was just minor things we had to get together. And we always
had each other's back.  
  
This team has always been resilient and always had each other's back. We never
looked and said, oh, we can't do this. We always felt as though if we just got
on the same page that would be a scary sight. And now we're here. So we're
just trying to go out there -- we're not going out there just to be here;
we're not happy to be here. We want to get a win. That's what we all tell each
other on a consistent basis.  
  
Q. What have you seen from UNC on tape? What challenges do they pose?
And break down what you see on the court.  
TAJUAN AGEE: They're a fast team. They like to get up and down. But we like to
get up and down. So it's going to be a challenge that we want. It's a big
game. We know it's a big game. We are ready for the challenge, though.  
  
ASANTE GIST: Like Tajuan said, they play fast, they're kind of big. They're
bigger than us, but like he said, we want the challenge. So we just have to
come out and play our basketball.  
  
That's what got us here so we're not going to change how we play. But we're
going to go out there and do what we have to do and hopefully we come out with
a win tomorrow.  
  
RICKEY MCGILL: They just touched on everything that I was going to say. I
agree with them.  
  
Q. Rickey, what are your impressions of freshman guard Coby White, and
how much are you looking forward to that matchup?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Just try and stop him. I know he's a good player. He's been a
good player all year for North Carolina. Now it's a big challenge for me just
to come out and try to get a stop.  
  
Q. Asante, just more specifically, what are you guys doing better now
than when you were struggling so much?  
ASANTE GIST: A lot of people don't know, this team didn't come together until
school started, so chemistry was our biggest problem in the beginning. It
hadn't had nothing to do with talent. We always worked hard. It was just our
the chemistry.  
  
Now I feel as though we're moving the ball a lot better. We're shooting the
ball way -- a lot better. So, and we're also playing defense very well, too.
So that's a big emphasis that Coach gives us on a daily basis. And that's
really what it is.  
  
Q. Rickey, he mentioned chemistry. How much of that is chemistry that is
being your team in the locker room together, learning about guys that just
came together and how much of it is actually on the court?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Chemistry definitely was a big problem for us at the beginning
of the year. As he said we didn't really have a team in the summertime to gel
together. As the year went on we just had to keep fighting, just keep getting
better as a team, and just keep gelling together, keep getting to know each
other. And that's what we did and now we're here.  
  
Q. As you started to win games, could you feel yourself getting better
as a team? How did the winning the game sort of improve your confidence as a
team?  
ASANTE GIST: We always, like I said, we always felt as though we were a good
team. As time goes on, we could see even games we were losing, we could see
that we were getting better. It was just certain things that came down the
stretch that might have made us lose the game or little things that we need to
get together.  
  
But, like I said, we always felt as though we were a good team. And once,
Coach always told us, once we started clicking it would be, like, a good one.
So that's what happened down the stretch.  
  
TAJUAN AGEE: I always felt like winning fixes a lot of problems. So as we
started to win, we started to gel, we started to become more of a brotherhood
than a team, and I think that helped.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Is that easier said than done?  
  
RICKEY MCGILL: Yeah, winning, it takes a lot to win, everybody playing against
a different team every day. So you just gotta come out and give it your all.  
  
Q. You find it difficult, there's so many questions here about
chemistry. And it's kind of tough, you throw guys in a room. You guys be
friends. It has to happen organically, right?  
RICKEY MCGILL: Right. That's really what happens. We all were new to each
other since this school year. So we just had to learn what each other could do
and just play as a team, play Iona basketball.  
  
Q. Tajuan, did you watch the game last year when UMBC beat Virginia? And
what did you think of it, a 16 seed beating a No. 1 seed?  
TAJUAN AGEE: Of course I watched it. I've always been a big fan of March
Madness. Of course I watched it.  
  
But I think a 16 beating a 1, it happened before, it can happen again. So
we're going to come out and we're going to play our hearts out and we're going
to give it our all. And hopefully we can get it done.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. It's time for an opening statement from Coach
Cluess.  
  
COACH CLUESS: We're excited to be here and playing against North Carolina and
their storied program and coach and really excited for the challenge. My
players have worked really hard for this all year and I'm really happy for
them because hard work paid off for them.  
  
Q. One of the themes that we really got from your players was that
during that initial struggle with a losing record in the first half of the
season or so, that you really gave them the belief -- this could be a special
group. Coaches don't always do that.  
COACH CLUESS: I firmly believe that. I think we went through a lot -- two of
our first 11 games were on the road. We played at home on Nov. 6 and not again
until December 30th. So we had a lot of learning about each other, doing a lot
of growing up to do. But I liked the pieces we had.  
  
More importantly I liked how they came to practice every day even after tough
losses and injuries and all that. They worked their tail off every day. And as
a coach you're kind of looking around, is the shoe going to drop if we don't
win soon? And they never gave up. I really did believe at some point if we got
healthy we'd have a chance to turn it around.  
  
Q. What has been your message to your players ahead of this game,
especially for the guys who are playing in their first NCAA Tournament?  
COACH CLUESS: To enjoy the moment, to go out there play really hard, worry
about each possession and don't look at the big picture right now; look at one
possession when you're in the game. And play Iona basketball for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. When you look at UNC, what challenges they pose, obviously the speed
is what the players said. Anything else that stands out?  
COACH CLUESS: They have a lot of challenges obviously for the size of our
team. But their speed getting back, first of all, offensive rebounds that try
to limit them from getting too many of those. We can't turn the ball over.
We've again good as of late. If we can do that I think we can get good shots.  
  
We have five guys out there that can stretch and knock down 3s so we're
confident in the way we're playing offensively right now. And we have to play
a top-notch game, but I expect nothing less from our guys.  
  
Q. Many moons ago you coached Danny Green in high school. I was curious
if there were any good off-the-wall Roy Williams recruiting stories when you
first ran into each other that you could share?  
COACH CLUESS: In all fairness, the first time I met him we had just won the
Beach Ball Classic. I met Coach Williams and had my boys and my wife with me,
and he was a gracious, terrific man to meet. And when I just ran into him
today, it's the first time I've really talked to him since that day. And he's
the same exact way.  
  
I love how hard he works with players -- I thanked him for making Danny Green
a pro because we entrusted Danny with him. I knew it was the right spot for
Danny because Danny was the kind of young man who would work really hard and
just listen to his coach, and I didn't know any coaches better in the business
than him, in all fairness.  
  
So I don't have any of those other kinds of stories, but it was tremendous
Danny was there, and it's a tremendous honor and privilege. But, boy, am I
looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. A lot of players talked about a need to build chemistry. What kinds
of things did you do to help build chemistry?  
COACH CLUESS: That's a good one. Sometimes adversity builds chemistry. Sounds
a little crazy but it does. Sometimes you find out what their true beliefs are
individually and what they're looking for out of it when things are bad. So
not only can you get a read on players when things are going well, but I think
when things are going back you have to try to figure out what makes each other
player tick and then how to bring it together. The players themselves have to
want to bring it together.  
  
Early on, in fairness, they were fighting each other a lot. I think that
chemistry grew to where we want to win and we're going to do it the right way.
And our senior leadership in Rickey McGill and E.J. Crawford as a junior
started like telling guys you've got to do what we're asking you to do. You've
got to work harder and continue to develop and don't worry, it's going to be
okay.  
  
We've been through some tough times in our program before and found a way. I
think they helped start the belief and it got infectious within our team.  
  
Q. What are your impressions of UNC freshman Coby White and the matchup
problem he possesses?  
COACH CLUESS: He's terrific. He gets down the floor in three to four dribbles.
In about two to three seconds he's down in the other end makes place for them.
And our job is to get back on D and slow him down and build a wall in front of
him and not just let him have his way the whole game.  
  
I think Rickey McGill and Tajuan Agee and E.J. Crawford and Asante Gist and
Ben Perez and anyone else we play is up to that challenge. I think we know
what we have to do whether we're capable of it is whether or not we'll have a
chance of doing it in this game. And I think we're capable of doing it.  
  
Q. You have a lot of guys who maybe aren't going to get recruited by
North Carolina. What do they get out of playing at Iona and what do they get
from playing in this?  
COACH CLUESS: Iona gets a lot of things. First of all, people around the
country get to know who Iona is, not just our basketball program but our
school. It helps our enrollment. It helps our applications. For us,
recruiting-wise, it helps us recruit on a broader base because more people
know about who we are and the success we've had and our style of play. And if
you want to have a chance to play in the NCAA Tournament, Iona is a school you
should be looking at.  
  
If you want to do some special things get a great education, I don't know if
you saw the piece on the Final Four for that academic piece that came out,
Iona made it to the Final Four (indiscernible) if you take all the programs in
this tournament. And so I think we bring a lot to the table.  
  
Q. I have to get your thoughts on this, what did you think about the
year that your alma mater had this year in basketball?  
COACH CLUESS: Which one?  
  
Q. Hofstra.  
COACH CLUESS: I'm just kidding with you. I thought they did a terrific job.
Joe did a terrific job. They were terrific. I thought they were beating North
Carolina State the other night. I was rooting for them. They were close to
getting in the tournament. I wished they'd won that championship game. But
they've really turned the corner with this program over there.  
  
Q. You've been on this stage five times before. Is this one more
rewarding than the ones before it given what this group has gone through?  
COACH CLUESS: I think you can sit there when 2-9 and I said it to my players
-- and I meant it -- just imagine what the story would be if we go from 2-9 to
getting to play in the NCAA Tournament. And you are looking at yourself and
everyone's looking at me, like, are you crazy? And part of me is, I'm saying
to myself, am I crazy?  
  
But reality is when you do that and come back, and you can look back from
where we were to where we are now it feels like it's been several years, not a
few months. And I'm proud of these guys because I've never coached a team that
was seven games under .500 and won a championship. In fairness, in my
30-something years of coaching, it's never happened.  
  
To me, it was special because it was something brand new that the players
really worked hard for. My assistant coaches worked their tails off to give
these guys this opportunity. So I'm so proud of all of them and so happy for
all of them to get this moment.  
  
Q. We sensed from hearing from them that they didn't want to give up
because you didn't want to give up.  
COACH CLUESS: My father and mother did not raise me to ever give up. And that
goes for my whole family, brothers and sisters. We were born one way, to fight
a tough fight and fight through life's adversities. And I truly believe that's
what makes you strong and I think you find out what you're about at those
points. And you have to try to help people along the way and guide and lead
people. And that's what we're supposed to do as coaches.  
  
Q. Sounds like an old Iona coach?  
COACH CLUESS: Yes, I was fortunate enough to know him.  
  
Q. What's it been like to see where Rickey McGill develop from where he
was as a freshman to where is now -- four MAAC championships, (indiscernible)
tournaments? What has it been like to see him develop as a player and a
person?  
COACH CLUESS: Again, I'm going to go to work ethic on it. Being raised with
the work ethic I was, there's nothing better to me than to see somebody
working for everything they've gotten. He played sparingly as a freshman.  
  
You know the story about us saying he maybe should look at another school at
the end of freshman year because he wasn't working up to our standards. And
Rickey took the challenge of starting to work harder and got better and better
and better each year.  
  
And that's what we're about, our program is about guys who want to work hard
become special, guys who want to become college graduates and a chance to play
professionally and enjoy their college experience. And he really has done it
to the fullest and he really represents Iona basketball.  
  
Q. Scott just got picked up by the Lakers a couple hours ago. To have
Scott, MoMo, A.J. and now Rickey, how much of an accomplishment is it for this
program to turn out such a great lineage of point guards?  
COACH CLUESS: I think it's an accomplishment for them. I'm glad we're a part
of it. But they're the ones who put in the hard work. We may lead them but
they're the ones who had to get in the gym and put all those hours in, plus
the hours on their own and all the training that goes with Kelly Shaver, our
strength and conditioning coach.  
  
I'm really happy for Scott. Again someone who is kind of fighting, fighting,
fighting for that opportunity over years, had injuries, never gave up. And
here he is, he'll be playing with the Lakers for the next ten days and
hopefully more.  
  
Q. You made reference to the way you were brought up and the work ethic.
Can you describe that household, what that was like and --  
COACH CLUESS: Honestly, it was the best thing that anybody could ever dream
of. Youngest of five siblings. Two parents in the house that worked their tail
off. They were never able to go to college or anything like that. They worked
to put food on the table for their families. They were the first generation
here.  
  
Myself and my siblings were the first ones to go to college. Everything was
about working hard and doing your best. And really competitive. Everyone, not
just my dad and my brothers and my sister, my mom was ultra competitive.  
  
Everything we did, there was a winner and loser. Every time we were sitting
down at the table for dinner, there was some kind of game going on that was a
challenge and we were being challenged.  
  
And my father would have great stories. But he would make up facts that we
knew were made up and he would just tell you go to the library and prove it.
Now I could swear I thought my father worked in a library because I heard that
line so many times. But he just wanted us to be able to stand up for ourselves
and find our own beliefs and fight through things.  
  
And I remember going home to him, like in today's day and age, if things
weren't going well on teams or something like that, and I complained one time
to him about it. He goes, "Get better. I don't care. Get better." I'm, like,
"You're right."  
  
And I think I've taken that philosophy through my family. And I was fortunate
to have Coach Morris from St. Agnes High School have that same philosophy. I
was underneath him for four years as well. I think that built the person I am.  
  
And obviously I think you know a little bit more about my family history,
going through those things, I had people because of basketball I'm here today,
because some people in my life helped keep me on track through those hard
times. And this gave me an outlet. And I also do believe that I'm here for a
purpose. My purpose is to help young men have better lives.  
  
Q. What did they do, what did your folks do?  
COACH CLUESS: My dad was an engineer for Sperry Rand for about with 56 years
for the same company. And my mom took care of everyone in the family. We
always had a grandparent, aunt or uncle, someone who didn't have a place to
stay were living with us. We had nine or ten people in the house with one
bathroom. You had to learn a little bit -- little different skills there, a
little patience sometimes.  
  
Q. You mentioned how you want your players to enjoy the moment. How do
you get your players not only to enjoy the moment but also realize at the same
time that we have a job to do tomorrow?  
COACH CLUESS: I think we have not changed how we work at things. The same way
we're preparing for every other game. And everything we did this year was
about the game in front of us. It was never about down the road, what we could
be. It was about what's happening in the game in front of us, how we're going
to get ready for it, how we're going to warm up for it, what we need to do in
each four-minute segment and each play.  
  
Our whole thing to my players is that worry about the play you're involved
with, not the previous -- learn from the previous one, but don't dwell on it.
Don't get upset about it. Don't look at the referees. Don't complain about it.
Make the next play.  
  
If the ball is on the ground, dive on it. Sometimes something that simple,
taking a charge, diving on a loose ball, getting a 50/50 ball, takes away a
lot of the adrenaline that flowing in a pregame situation like this.  
  
Basketball is basketball. If you're focused, once that game starts, you really
don't see anything beyond the court. Like I wouldn't be able to tell you
tomorrow if there's one person in the gym or 20,000, because once the game
starts, it's all about what's right in front of you. And I think our players
have learned to focus much better in that way as well.  
  
Q. Because of all your preparation as a coach, can you enjoy the
moment?  
COACH CLUESS: I am enjoying it. We had a little more time, a few more days
than normal to prepare for this. And I think I'm just enjoying my family being
here again and all the coaches' families and seeing it through their eyes as
well. Some of my coaches have very young children. It's the first time they're
going through it. So to watch their expressions as they see different things,
it's great.  
  
And a lot of my players have never been here before. So I'm getting to live it
all again through their eyes and I just love it.  
  
Q. You've obviously given a lot of credit to your staff and the players,
but do you feel like this is your best coaching job of your career?  
COACH CLUESS: I'm not the one to judge that. All I know is again I don't ever
give up on what we're doing. And I'm going to tell you there's one point in
the season where I came home and I was kind of dejected with the work ethic in
practice. We had a game coming up in two days. I half jokingly, half maybe,
you know what, I don't know if I'm going to watch that film tonight on this
team because I'm so mad at these guys; they don't care.  
  
My son turns to me and says, "Dad, it doesn't matter what you think's going to
happen, you're going to do your job just like you always have." I loved that
response from him. Like, boy, he's been around me for a while.  
  
And of course I did that. But it was great to hear from another voice saying
you're going to do your job because that's what you always do and you are
going to give it everything you have. This way, they will too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Columbus, Ohio_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Tennessee student-athletes Kyle Alexander,
Admiral Schofield, Jordan Bone, Grant Williams and Lamonte Turner. Questions?  
  
Q. Kyle, you weren't able to play against Loyola in the second round.
Does that give you more urgency this time around? Everybody is looking forward
to it, but do you think you in particular are ready to go?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: Yeah, it's unfortunate last year that I wasn't able to play in
the second round. I'm excited regardless. I'm a senior this year. I'm excited
regardless, I'm ready to go. I'm ready to play.  
  
Q. Grant, how much do you guys think as a team you benefit from being
through all this? This is not the first time any of you have sat up there on
this stage, not the first time you've practiced in an open arena? The whole
process, how much do you think you benefit from the experience?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: We're definitely fortunate. We're blessed because not many
people have a chance to do this once but we're doing it twice. So we're ready
for the challenge. We're capable of anything that's thrown at us. And we're
just ready to get out there and play.  
  
Q. Admiral, how are you a better basketball player because of what
happened last March, how it happened?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: I would just say I'm more motivated. But also it gave me an
opportunity to go through the NBA process. So I learned a lot about the game,
a lot of things outside of the game that helped me for this upcoming March.  
  
But the biggest thing it taught me how much I loved my teammates, I missed my
teammates. And it really gave me motivation towards doing something special in
returning. So I think it made me better as far as being a leader and
understanding what we want to get done as far as our goals.  
  
We've been in great positions this year to win championships. We haven't
finished, but at the same time we have a great opportunity to win another one
this year.  
  
Q. You mentioned after Sunday's loss that it was going to stick with you
and obviously it hurt. How quickly were you able to flush that? And what was
that process like to move forward quickly?  
JORDAN BONE: Like I mentioned, it's tough to get past a loss like that,
especially being in similar situations with the same team competing for a
championship, and we failed against the same team twice. That's a hard pill to
swallow.  
  
But I feel like, just being a mature team and understanding that we're in a
good position because we do have more basketball left, we do have another
opportunity to go out there and compete, I feel like that kind of made it a
little easier to get past those losses.  
  
Like I said, it was a hard pill to swallow, because of the situation we were
in. But we have another opportunity to go out there and do what we do. So I
think that, like I said, it just shows the maturity of this team and the
perspective that we have for this game.  
  
Q. Kyle, this group, this unit has been together for pretty much the
past three years, but for you and Admiral, this is going to be your last run.
So this is going to be the last time you all can go through this together. So,
I mean, where is the sense of urgency for you, Admiral, and for all of you to
make this last run your best part of your season?  
KYLE ALEXANDER: It's a good point you mentioned for me and Admiral. After all
this is done, we're done. We're seniors and it's the end of the road. So the
urgency is there because we're not trying to have this end anytime soon. We're
trying to be with this group as long as we can.  
  
So definitely there's a sense of urgency there. And I wouldn't want to be here
with any other group of guys, because I love this group of guys.  
  
Q. Admiral, as you take what you take from that loss to Auburn, but when
you come back to the tournament again, is there anything you change with your
routine, your approach, knowing that you've been here, done that in terms of
the first weekend and all the buzz it gets?  
ADMIRAL SCHOFIELD: Well, you can't change what got you here. And, I mean, just
because you lose doesn't mean what you did was the wrong thing as far as
process-wise. It just means that you didn't execute in the moment.  
  
So, for us, it's just being able to adjust as far as it's really win or go
home at this point. And we want to have a lot more opportunities to be
together, play with each other. So for us it's just being locked in for 40
minutes and focusing on each game that's in front of us and not taking any
opponent lightly, but also respecting the game and playing with the passion we
know we all have and the love we all have and having fun out there.  
  
So for us it's just really being locked in 100 percent collectively on a
consistent basis every night, every film session. Really cherishing every
moment that we have in the hotel rooms and the free time that we have, but
also understanding that we're here on business as well. And we're here to
accomplish our main goal, and that's to win a national championship.  
  
But can't do that without winning the first game and the game after that. So
we have to take it step-by-step and understanding that this process is just
like any other process. There's levels to it, there's steps to it. And we've
just got to understand that consistency and consistent buy-in and lock-in to
the game plan and to each other is what's going to get it done this year.  
  
Q. Lamonte, how important was that SEC Tournament for you in terms of
getting all the confidence back, and was there a point where it wavered down
the stretch in the regular season?  
LAMONTE TURNER: I think whenever a shooter isn't making shots you're
confidence wavers a little bit. But my teammates did a great job of keeping me
up and making me realize that I do more than just score for us. So I just
tried to find another role, tried to do other things to keep me going. But as
far as confidence, yeah, I think making shots and getting going in the
tournament definitely helped me.  
  
Q. Jordan, what do you remember about last year, the way it ended in
what Dallas and how that felt? And I'm sure you guys thought you were going to
be around longer than that first weekend?  
JORDAN BONE: Yeah, just a lot of pain, a lot of regret from that last game. I
feel like this team still feels that, I mean, it's something that we can look
back on as motivation to not get that feeling again.  
  
But I feel like that was just the start of something special, honestly.
Everything happens for a reason. So just having the right mindset, the right
perspective of why things happen, I feel like that shows something about our
group. It shows something about certain individuals, how they bounced back
from that moment.  
  
But it's been tough, man, it's been tough. I'm just moving on from that. But
we have to use that to not get that feeling again. So we're just excited to
play, and hopefully we can take this thing further than we did last year.  
  
Q. Grant, has it been a long week since Sunday in the way that ended?
Have you guys been eager to get here and get going?  
GRANT WILLIAMS: As competitors, we're just ready to play. That's how the team
feels. We're ready to get going. But we're doing everything we can to prepare
and just understand that now it's a time where one-and-done, and you have to
come with the right mindset every single day, every single game.  
  
And we've done a good job of staying focused and we're locked in on our
opponent. We understand what they do. We just have to go out and execute what
the coaches have scheduled for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BARNES: Well, obviously we're excited for our program, we're excited for
the university and our players are excited to be back in this tournament
again. It's something that you begin every basketball season with hoping to be
a part of what is really, arguably, the best sporting event in our country.  
  
Again, our guys have worked hard just like Colgate and all the other teams in
this tournament. If you're here at this time of year it tells you that you've
had success start to finish, but certainly you've had success to get your way
into the tournament. And we're excited to be a part of it.  
  
Q. I know you've touched on it from time to time in this season. But do
you feel like this turnaround would have been possible without Kevin Punter
being a part of this program your first year here?  
COACH BARNES: I don't know how to answer that other than the fact that I know
he's a big part of what happened that first year, because when we went in, we
wanted to establish a culture of -- the fact that a group of guys that want to
have a great work ethic. And he was the first guy that really, once we talked
about how we saw that and what we thought that meant, he bought right into it.  
  
And I've said many times that I'll always be thankful and blessed that Kevin
was there when we got there, because he went above and beyond. And then by
what he was doing when Admiral came in and then Kyle came in and Lamonte, it
just -- he was the leader of those guys. And when he left, those are the guys,
along with our two walk-ons, Lucas and Brad, that have continued to build that
culture. And the next class with Grant and those guys were the ones that we've
just kept building.  
  
Q. How much of a benefit is it to have everybody back from last year?
It's not new for any of these guys, the attention, the hype, the pressure.  
COACH BARNES: Well, it's a benefit if they understand that you take nothing
for granted, that you understand that this time of year everybody can play.
And I think they do understand that. I really do. And we've been through a lot
this year as a team and a lot of good things have happened, obviously.  
  
But you can say that about every team in this league. But I'd like to see the
fact that we've been here, but it only works for you if you make it work for
you.  
  
Q. You've had this unit for pretty much the past two years, but after
this tournament, this team won't look the same. So have you started to sense
some urgency from the guys, maybe knowing it's their last ride? They actually
need to go out on top or at least as far as they can go?  
COACH BARNES: We start every year talking about that every year is a new team.
This team is not the same team that we had a year ago this time. And you're
right about it. This time, again, we'll graduate some key guys to our program,
not just guys that have had success on the basketball court, but guys that
have really put a lot into building this program.  
  
But they understand, I do think they understand it all. And I think they
realize how difficult it is. They know that everybody can play. But the fact
is, again, I think most coaches this time of year would be surprised if their
teams aren't excited, on edge, ready to play. And certainly hope that we're
there.  
  
Q. To prepare for Colgate, what concerns you? What jumps out at you
about them?  
COACH BARNES: One, they're a well-coached team. They rely on shooting the 3,
but they can do some other things. They have some size, they have length. They
look to really try to take advantage of your help defense, too. They can mix
some defenses up with you. And there's no doubt they're going to pretty much
pack it back in there, I'm sure, and hope that we settle early.  
  
And so they won 11 in a row, which tells you that they played their way in
starting way back before their tournament and the way they're playing good
basketball. And, again, their length and the fact that they can shoot the
ball. They're going to shoot it a lot from back there. So we're going to have
to be able to guard the 3-point line.  
  
Q. You've been through this tournament 23, 24 times. I mean, that's a
lot obviously. And you mentioned not taking it for granted. But as a coach
what do you maybe not take for granted or do you maybe change some things
about your routine about this first weekend, given all the buzz that it
creates?  
COACH BARNES: I think, one, you want to go with the formula that has gotten
you here. I think, is when you start doing things that maybe the players look
at you differently and think that -- I think, coaches can get players too
uptight. I do. I think coaches could also maybe let players get a little bit
too loose.  
  
I think the key is to be who you are and what's got your team here and players
be that. But I think we all want to come into this tournament with energy. You
want to have the legs that you need to compete, the way you'll have to compete
each possession.  
  
And there's no doubt early in my career, I think, I probably got my team a
little bit too uptight at times. But we've had teams that just fought to get
here, was a great achievement in itself. And when you're fighting -- because
it is something you don't take for granted, because you think about the 68
teams here, and then the teams in the NIT.  
  
If you're playing this time of year, one, you've got to feel good about it
because there's a lot of teams that took inventory early and aren't playing.
But what you want to do, you don't want to look back when it's all said and
done and not think that -- you gave it your best shot.  
  
Q. Lamonte, do you feel like he kind of found his swagger back in
Nashville with a big shot against Kentucky and had a nice game against
Auburn?  
COACH BARNES: He started making some shots, but what I hope he realizes, and I
think he does now, he can affect a game whether or not he's scoring or not.
And I will say this about this about him and other guys on our team, when
we're really locked in defensively our offense flows much better. We play that
way.  
  
What you don't want him to do is get back where he forgets about his defense
because he's affected games for us from the defensive end. But I do, again, he
obviously shoots the ball better than when he went through that period there
where he couldn't make a shot. So we're glad that happened. But yet I wanted
him to come into the game with the mindset that he's really had the last month
of the season.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan 64, Florida 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will take an opening statement from Coach Mike White and the
Florida Gators.  
  
MIKE WHITE: Tough loss. I thought we did some good things, especially early
second half. Got away from us. We didn't make the best of decisions
offensively. I do think we played really hard in the second half. Left it out
there on the floor. No regrets in that regard. Just playing from behind for
the second 20 minutes I thought we expended a lot of energy, had some faulty
rotations as we tried to turn those guys over and to run and jump situations
they handled they the pressure really well.  
  
A big factor in playing from behind is that you're playing the top-ranked
defensive efficiency team in the country. We saw firsthand how tough,
physical, connected that defense is. They are terrific. I'm not going to sit
here and say we played poorly. We did some good things, just didn't do enough.
They guarded at a really high level as they do. We wish them the best. Tough
to finish coaching of these three seniors, of course these two to my left,
KeVaughn Allen is back in the locker room. He's done some big things in his
career, been a part of a lot of wins, three NCAA Tournament, a lot of big
shots.  
  
Jalen Hudson has scored a lot of points throughout his career, playing the
best basketball of his career late this year, really rededicated himself,
became more of a leader, played really, really hard in this past month, much
improved defender and rebounder, in my opinion. I'm biased, of course.  
  
Kevarrius Hayes here to my left plays as hard as anybody in the SEC. We
watched him progress to the tune of scoring at a much higher level than ever
before in his career. Should have been an all-league defensive player, in my
opinion, and these three guys have all had absolutely zero issues off the
floor. They have represented the University of Florida in a first-class
manner, and I hate to see their careers come to an end because they were
playing very well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Jalen and Andrew, can you speak to their defensive aggressiveness
especially during that 14-0 run between the two halves? Couple things they
made you do uncharacteristically, like Andrew, a couple of jump passes. Is
that what they make you all do?  
ANDREW NEMBHARD: I think it was not that they made us go. I just made some bad
decisions making jump passes, but it was more my bad decision for me, I think.  
  
JALEN HUDSON: I just thought they were super disruptive on the defensive end
and they really played their principles and it was hard for us to get into the
lane and shake them at all. You have to credit them for their defense tonight.  
  
Q. Can you guys expand on the perimeter? Was it anything specifically
they did or cumulative for the whole game that was exhausting?  
ANDREW NEMBHARD: I think it was just how disciplined they were on defense,
setting down driving angles and not letting us get our shots off easily, good
ball screen coverage, but just overall their defense throughout the game was
pretty consistent.  
  
JALEN HUDSON: I can see why they're No. 1 in college basketball for defense.
They were super solid. Everything we tried to run or the mistakes they made
they had to cover them so fast and they had the 7-footer and even when you did
get in the paint it was tough and he was blocking them. And on the perimeter
we had to take late shots that altered our shots, too.  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: Kind of what they said, defensively they were sound, didn't
let up in any categories and when we made a mistake, they took advantage of
that, 7-footer in the paint. Just hard to get around that especially when you
work so hard to break through to get into the paint in the first place.  
  
Q. Kevarrius, through 20 minutes you guys were close. Did you feel like
you were in a good place through the work you had done?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: Yeah, I felt very confident with where we were. We were
making some mistakes, but, again, we were still hanging around. Feel like if
we fixed those mistakes and played a little harder on defense. We could
possibly put ourselves in a better position, but unfortunately it wasn't the
case. We were missing a lot of shots and then again, made some defensive
mistakes that they capitalized on and made us pay for.  
  
Q. I know it's only been a couple of minutes for the two seniors but can
you reflect on how you will remember this season and maybe the bigger picture
how you remember your time at Florida?  
JALEN HUDSON: Just that we never gave up. We fought. At one point in the
season there was a lot of uncertainty and we never laid done. We never sat
down. We just found a way to win and we all came together. We all banded
together. I will never forget the way we came together and how we were able to
fight and how we maxed out when we decided to and I will never forget that.
That was important to me.  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: This season has had a lot of highs and lows and there was a
time where even being in the NCAA Tournament was not even in the question for
us. But we managed to find a way, banded together and made it here. I would
say my time at Florida as a whole, enjoyed about every moment, all the games,
experiences that I've had, all the relationships that I've nurtured with my
teammates and hope to continue that beyond this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Mike, there was a sequence they went on that 14-0 run but then they
went on a stretch where they went almost seven minutes without a field goal
and the one that broke it although it wasn't a field goal was the late shot
clock foul and the three-point shots. Can you expand? I think it happened
three times?  
MIKE WHITE: That was our third one. You can't foul jump shooters. It's one of
our defensive no's in our program. I would say in most programs, written up on
the wall, talk about every day. It's stressed every day. We watched it on film
and we talked about it several times in this quick prep that they draw fouls
on jump shots, both Poole and Matthews. We got to be more disciplined in that.  
  
Q. Mike, at halftime how did you feel about what you had done through 20
minutes and what were the adjustments you wanted to make in the second half?  
MIKE WHITE: I told our guys going into the locker room at halftime if you were
to have told me this morning that we would be down four and here your defense
clips, I would have been thrilled. We watched our clips and watched some of
the mistakes we made in the first half. It was too many. It was faulty ball
screen coverage, faulty rotations, couple of missed block outs, lack of
tracing of the ball a couple times and then there were probably a few more
that I can't think of right now and we were down four against one of the best
teams in the country.  
  
So that was a challenge to our guys. Let's wake up defensively. We came out
early second half, gave up a basket immediately, gave up I don't know how many
early second half, but never seemed to find a defensive rhythm there until
three, four, five minutes into the second half and then we played them evenly
for a while. We got into a rhythm there defensively and we were hovering
around 6 or 7 from behind and had a couple of empty possessions and we freaked
out a little bit offensively and they'll do that to you.  
  
We talked in the pregame and said there are going to be some dry stretches in
this game and I'm just telling you that and I know you don't want to hear
that. They're terrific and just like you guys talking to my team, just like
you guys are terrific defensively, teams will go through dry spells. I don't
know outside of Kentucky that we've seen a team that's this sound. We've got
to maintain composure and continue plugging away, stay the course and we
didn't do a very good job of that.  
  
I would say, what, midway through the second half, maybe seven, eight minutes
left, where we had four possessions where we had a couple of shots blocked and
a couple of turnovers just trying to do a little bit too much. As good as they
are defensively, another thing that our guys can learn from Michigan, you
know, every game, win or lose, we like to think that we've got a lot to learn
from, and with these guys as good as they are defensively, offensively I
thought they were very, very sound. They do what they do. Their roles are very
well defined. I was incredibly impressed.  
  
It's hard to appreciate how good Zavier Simpson is on film. Incredibly
impressed with his toughness, accountability, leadership, the way he barks at
his teammates, the way they respond to him. The guy just doesn't make any
mistakes. He is out there plugging away, playing the game, offensively and
defensively, really, really good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Jarvis Omersa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37080)

### [Amir Coffey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32947)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan State 70, Minnesota 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we are joined on the dais by the Minnesota Golden
Gophers. We will take an opening statement from Coach Richard Pitino.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Congratulations to Michigan State. They're a really, really
good team. To go on to the Sweet 16, obviously Coach Izzo with what he's
accomplished, it's a testament to that program, how consistent they are. They
have some really good players and obviously very well-coached. Obviously we
felt like we could give it a go with Murph early, when we shot around he
looked pretty good and I think he may be got off it a little bit and tried to
give it a go during that warm-up and he didn't look good at all.  
  
So being done Matz and Eric and Murph was not ideal. We talked about we are
going to have to play unconventional, play four guards, turn them over and
play fast and we cut it to 9 and Cassius took over and we ran out of gas. It
stings, but I'm really, really proud of what our guys did this year. It's the
second time we've won a tournament game in 29 years. A lot of these guys in
the locker room, Jordan Murphy and Dupree McBrayer, went to two NCAA
Tournaments in three years and proud of these guys. Excited about these guys
moving forward.  
  
Q. Richard, obviously with the Nate Mason injury and Akeem Springs, and
then you get here and no Jordan Murphy, Curry or Matz, do you feel snake
bit?  
RICHARD PITINO: A little bit, yeah, but you try to create your own luck. We've
had some injuries at the wrong times, but we're not going to complain about
it. I do believe that things will even out at some point. But, yeah, I think
two years ago we had the same thing happen with Akeem and Nate getting hurt
and to go into this the second leading scorer in school history, the second
leading rebounder in Big Ten and leading rebounder here a little bit. So
hopefully it evens out.  
  
Q. You went up to Jordan Murphy with 2 minutes left in the first half.
Was that to give him a check and he was going to be able to come and talk
about the curtain call at the end?  
RICHARD PITINO: I talked out and watched him warm up. He didn't look good
before the game. It's hard because you keep asking him, during the day, how do
you feel and he says I feel so much better than yesterday, because he's such a
tough kid. But they got off to a 11-2 start, not to blame Murph, but he
couldn't laterally move. But it got us a little bit and he's such a tough kid
and he's like I'll just stand. This is not ideal, Murph. It's almost fitting
with him that he hasn't missed a game his whole career, started every game but
11, still didn't miss because he played today. But it almost felt like a
heavyweight fighter continuing to fight through it even though he's bruised
and beat up. That was him until the end. I wanted to get him that moment, you
know. That was special for everybody. Very thankful to the fans who showed up.
They were awesome. We didn't have a lot left in the tank, but I am
appreciative of the love that they showed Jordan and those guys.  
  
Q. For both of you, talk about the emotions, what Jordan Murphy went
through, and what were you thinking after the game?  
AMIR COFFEY: Really just feeling for him. The way he's fought over these years
and everything he gave to the program, not being able to play in a game like
this, in the tournament from an injury is pretty tough. So, you know, just
feeling for him. It's just tough.  
  
JARVIS OMERSA: Murphy has been to hell and back and then back again and came
back. He's fought through it all and in the long run he will get what he
deserves. He's just a tough kid.  
  
Q. Amir, you emptied the clip in these last few games, left it all out
there. What do you think this year as a whole did for your development as a
player?  
AMIR COFFEY: Just kept working throughout the year, trying to get better at
everything. I mean, really just developing everything, shooting, dribbling,
and then just otherwise just mindset things, how I carried myself in the games
and just figuring out ways to affect the game and to do what I could for my
team.  
  
Q. Amir, talk about the run that you were able to go on to cut it to 9
and what happened after that with Cassius?  
AMIR COFFEY: Yeah, I think we had a smaller lineup in for our five. We tried
to push the tempo a little bit and get them scrambling and it was working. We
cut it to 8 or 9, and we had the momentum, crowd got into it and Cassius hit
some big shots. That really killed us. We had it going a little bit and
Cassius just came through for Michigan State and hit some clutch shots for him
that stopped the run.  
  
Q. Coach, it looked like you were talking to Tom over there. Can you
talk about that?  
RICHARD PITINO: He was asking about Jordan, tough blow, a guy that I respect
versus LSU. I think he has a team that can make some noise and continue to
advance.  
  
Q. How would you sum up this year and where you feel like the program is
and where it's going?  
AMIR COFFEY: I mean, I think we did a lot of things that people didn't believe
we could do. Like Coach was saying, for the last 10 games we weren't favored
to win one of them so just staying resilient and blocking out all the outside
noise and playing our game. What were we preseason for Big Ten?  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Toward the bottom.  
  
AMIR COFFEY: We were in the bottom. Nobody believed in us but our coaches and
our players. So I think we really changed people's minds and we just kept
fighting all year. We won a lot of big games, won two games at the Big Ten
tournament, came to the NCAA Tournament and got to round 32. So I think we
definitely took a step forward this season.  
  
Q. Coach, does it feel any different year-to-year when you have to say
goodbye to a senior class? Is this group unique in anyway way?  
RICHARD PITINO: With Matz and Brock they weren't here as long, but they gave a
lot to the program. Jarvis Johnson was one of the my early recruits. Didn't
play that much, but he was one of the first to believe in me. And these guys,
to continue to believe, bounce back, have a great season next year and then go
into their junior year with high, high expectations and all those things that
happened and then come back and bounce back again, go to the tournament, win a
game, you know. With what Dupree, even the injury he dealt with his junior
year, losing his mother. Jordan Murphy being 6'6" and being the second leading
rebounder in Big Ten history. It shows the heart of those guys. It's
difficult. That was emotional and you hate to see it send like that. Rarely
does it end well in sports, but I'm proud of those guys. When you are young
and building a program and you see guys go through a program, you know, four
years they get better. They get stronger. They get smarter, you know. You're
proud of them. They are really good representatives of this program.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about at the end of the Big Ten tournament and even
tonight running out of gas. Obviously injuries play into that, but is building
greater depth one of the next steps for this program?  
RICHARD PITINO: You lose three guys in the front court you only get so many
scholarships. You want to have depth, but, you know, you kind of all hit in
the wrong spots. So, yeah, you're going to continue to recruit, figure out
what the needs are, continue to build off it. Really excited about Tre who
we've got signed is going to be a terrific player, Marcus and Payton, two guys
sitting out, really good. We have really good young talent. So, yeah, we're
going to continue to build that depth, but, you know, hit at a hard time.  
  
Q. Coach, what did that moment mean for you when Jordan walked out on to
the court and embraced you?  
RICHARD PITINO: That was hard. That was hard. That was emotional. The hardest
thing was that he couldn't play in the game trying to go to the Sweet 16. He
has done so much. Never once has he ever embarrassed the program, never once
has he ever not been about the team, been a great representative for himself,
his family, and obviously for our basketball program. He's a special kid. I'm
going to miss him. He's somebody that I consider family. I appreciate
everything that he's given me because he's laid it all out there, every ounce
of sweat. He's put it on the line for this program.  
  
Q. Coach, as you look to the future, what do you feel like those needs
are?  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, obviously Jordan Murphy, losing him, that's hard to
replace. As hard as tonight was, hopefully it helps build Jarvis' confidence.
He hasn't played a lot, but I do think he can take that performance. I think
he did a lot of great things. He played great defense. He played hard,
rebounded the ball well, obviously continued to build off that. Daniel and
Gabe, Daniel is going to be a really, really good player. He's put only a
little bit of weight and he'll get there. But all these young guys like I feel
like this program, you know, we've taken hits with injuries and I hate using
excuses, but we have. We can't let it derail us. We gotta bounce back and get
back in this thing again next year and I think these guys have the character
to do it.  
  
We'll continue to see what we can add in the spring. When you win like we did,
when you have guys who got better, you have local kids who have had a great
experience there is a lot to sell. I know these guys in the locker room,
regardless of our facilities and all the cool things we can sell these guys in
the locker room can sell a really good experience and that's the most
important thing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Thank you, guys.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan State 70, Minnesota 50  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we are joined by the Spartans of Michigan State.  
  
TOM IZZO: Thank you. I'm proud of these guys. We just played 5 games in 8 days
and it took a toll on some of us. There were stretches where we were good and
bad but couple things happened today that were bizarre. You know, we beat a
team by 20 when we had 22 turnovers. I thought Aaron Henry did a good job on
Amir Coffey. He had 25 points but he took 20-some shots. It was good to get
Nick back in the fold here a little bit. It's not easy to do what he did, and,
you know, Xavier was Xavier. Matt McQuaid was Matt McQuaid. Cassius was a
little rusty, a little sore.  
  
So and to play that many games in 8 days when you are already beat up is hard.
One of the timeouts I told him he's got to take over and like a true all-
American did. He took over and had about as good of a two-minute stretch there
as you could and a 9-point lead went to 16 and we starting cruising. Getting
back Nick is going to be big for us. He had 9 and 7. Xavier had 7 or 8
rebounds. Kenny had 6 or 7, and we outrebounded them bad. And yet I want to be
fair to Richard and his team. We all love Jordan Murphy. He's a tough kid,
best rebounder on the planet and it was sad not to see him play to himself. I
think we deserve credit for the start we had and we were sloppy, but man,
another championship weekend for us and we move on to the next one and I can't
tell you how excited I am.  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time, questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Cassius, when Izzo told you it was time to take over how do you do
that while keeping within yourselves? You answered with a three-pointer and a
couple of floaters. When you have that green light how do you do it and stay
solid?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: It's about your energy level and your approach, focusing on
the task at hand. You've got to make big plays. I've got to be who I am for
this team. That's my role for this team. That's what I've been doing all year.
I don't try to do too much. I don't try to put the world on my shoulders, but
I try to make plays to the best of my ability.  
  
Q. Xavier, Nick, when you see Cassius go on that run to push it back to
16, what's your reaction to that in the moment?  
NICK WARD: It was big, you know, because they went on a little run, but
Cassius went on a scoring spree, you know, and just put us up big.  
  
XAVIER TILLMAN: For me, that's just typical Cassius. That's just what he does.
Whenever we need him to score, whenever we need him to distribute, whenever we
need him to just lead vocally he does whatever we need him to do, and that was
just another day in the park.  
  
Q. Cassius and Nick, where are you healthwise and how bad do you need
rest? Few days off sound good for you guys?  
NICK WARD: I'm just getting back in the swing of things. I'm was out four
weeks, so I'm just excited to be on the court. I'm starting to feel like my
regular self again. So I'm good, personally.  
  
TOM IZZO: You're not.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: I'm just happy to be in the tournament grind and I knew it
was going to be a grinder weekend, but I was okay in the games. I made it
through the games and I feel like I did pretty decent. Now we got some time to
get back home, get some treatment and get a little rest and by next go-round I
will be fully ready.  
  
Q. Xavier, Sweet 16 for your team, your first one for a lot of your
guys. Your thoughts about getting that far?  
XAVIER TILLMAN: I'm just excited more so because my freshman year it didn't
end the way I was hoping to. So I'm just excited we were able to advance past
this pointed and more excited for our program because we haven't been able to
do that for three years, to break the curse feels pretty good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much. At this time we will take
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Tom, five games in eight days, right? Your energy and focus the way
you guys came out, were you surprised by that?  
TOM IZZO: I was surprised for the first ten minutes and then as all coaches
would be, you know, disappointed. We had 11 turnovers at halftime and talked
about it. So one thing about my team they listen well. We had 11 turnovers the
second half, too. That part was disappointing but the focus early, the
execution early, we got our fast break going. I'm a little concerned because
he's struggling.  
  
I mean, Nick is, if I am to be honest with you, that wasn't the best I've seen
Cassius play and if he can do that not playing his best that bodes well. But
we're going to have to get him some rest these next couple of days. They had
five games in nine days. We had five games in eight days. At this high level
when you're playing the teams you're playing, for what's at stake it's both
mentally and physically grinding, you know, and I don't know, it was tough.
Yet I was happy that Cassius answered the bell, you know. But we had some
other guys that played pretty well. Matt McQuaid and Aaron Henry were I
thought really good, probably should have had them up here. They probably
played as good as anybody.  
  
Q. You guys all but shut Gabe Kalscheur down. How were you able to keep
him from getting any good looks at all? Early he tried to force it and after
that it was almost nothing, how were you guys so effective?  
TOM IZZO: We put Aaron on Amir Coffey and if you think about putting a
freshman on their best because we thought Matt McQuaid could stay with him and
Gabe Kalscheur has been on fire, and them two, they were in the Big Ten
tournament and with the injury that Murphy. I don't want to take all the
credit because I told Richard before the game, you know, being one of the
elder coaches in this league, it's fun for me to see some of these teams, the
job he did, you know, and they almost pronounced him dead there in the middle
of January. When you can bring your team back from something like that and he
had a lot of injuries and I know what that's like, that speaks volumes of the
coach. I give him a lot of credit and I give us some credit.  
  
But we were really focused early and we lost some focus and some of it was
Cassius and he said he was worn down and I always tell him when the head goes
the body follows. He's our head. When he got back on the horse, the rest of
the guys did. It's pretty cool that he's got that much impact on our team.  
  
Q. Cassius obviously had those 7 points in a row, but he had a steal and
a deflection that led to another steal. How was he able to impact the game on
that end of the floor?  
TOM IZZO: That's what I said. If you watched him it's hard to self-evaluate
and hard to see yourself if you're playing and we were sitting on the bench
and it looked like he was hardly moving. You know, and I guess I will be
transparent which sometimes gets me in trouble but we'll do it anyway. He was
hurting, you know. He just was worn out. I said, well, here is the way it is,
my man, we got, you know, 20-some minutes left. If you're worn out you'll get
a lot of rest. If you're not worn out you got another week or so and you'll
get a lot of rest any way.  
  
So how about we get after it and try to prolong this because it's like I tell
people sleep is overrated you know you can do it for a million years later on.
And that's what I told Cassius. I just love the fact that he responded. He
wouldn't have responded like that two years ago if you ask me. He responded
and I know how he felt. Yet I also know what he did. It was pretty impressive.  
  
Q. Tom, I think it's 14 Sweet 16s for you in 22 years. Does it feel like
some of the other ones? How does it feel now?  
TOM IZZO: This one feels better. We were disappointed in '16. We had a real
good team and we had a loss to a team that played better, Middle Tennessee,
and the next year people said we didn't play well. We had injuries to our bigs
and I thought, last year, so many issues. But I look at these guys and these
guys have won 60 games now in two years. That's a hell of an accomplishment
and getting back to the Sweet 16, there's nothing like playing when it stays
daylight longer. You come out of those practices now and the sun is still
shining. It's the greatest feeling in the world.  
  
Q. It seems like Nick Ward has to learn to play again and the team has
to learn to play around him again. That's the next thing to work on, I
imagine?  
TOM IZZO: Think about it, since Nick has been back, we had two practices
before the Big Ten tournament and now we have 1 and a half practices since
then and now we go back Sunday, probably take the day off Monday and then
Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday get practice and that's going to be good for him.
I think the guys were good and they wanted to get the ball into him. They know
he's been hurting. He's averaging 17, 18 points a game and it's taken away
from you and you want to get it all back in one possession.  
  
I thought he was really good early and then all of the sudden he started
forcing a few things and then he settled down late and that was a big step to
keep him in there late. So I'm happy for Nick. It's be not easy to do what
he's trying to do. It's not easy for our team. We reinvent the wheel 15 times
this year and now maybe we don't have to reinvent it. We just have to firm it
up a little bit and do a little bit better job of getting these guys to feel
comfortable with each other. Why we turned it over like we did, I mean, I've
never seen Cassius throw hook passes into guys' arms three times or Kenny sit
there and throw it into guys' arms. They either had hellaciously long arms or
my guys were in a fog there a little bit and maybe a combination of both. I
give them credit.  
  
But, you know, even when they bounce back and cut it to 9, not as easy as you
think then to get back off the carpet and do what we did either, you know? It
has been a brutal eight days and I'm just proud as hell of my team for doing
it and the way everybody is responding and now looking forward to going
Washington D.C. That will be a treat. I guess we got LSU. That's been
determined and another challenge.  
  
Thank you, and let me say this: They told me when I got here that this was a
heck of a place to hold one of these, not the biggest city and this and that.
But it was awesome and whoever was in charge of the weather, probably you,
hell of a job. Thank you.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan 64, Florida 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: Like to welcome the victorious Michigan Wolverines. They will
advance to Anaheim on Thursday. We are joined by student-athletes Jon Teske,
Jordan Poole and Charles Matthews. At this time, Coach, congratulations. We
will take an opening statement.  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: Florida has had such a great year. They really had us confused
in the first half because they kept changing defenses on us. Their 1-3-1 was
really good. We had what we thought were good looks. They were probably a
little bit from distance that we couldn't knock down. Fortunately we were able
to get stops so they couldn't set the defense in the second half or we found a
new plan that worked much better. We only scored 64 points, these guys holding
them to 49 points is incredible and that's how we won the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. For all three of you, you guys have been playing great defense all
year, including the two games here. When it did that become a point of pride
for you guys to play defense that way?  
JORDAN POOLE: Me personally when I got on campus they made a major emphasis on
defense, Coach Ya came in and I think that's what turned everybody around,
everybody brought in and guys from last year on the team still and bringing it
to the team this year is something that we have bought into and something we
pride ourselves on.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: I think that the pride part of it started last summer when
guys were in here playing one-on-one from sunup to sundown. JP was playing
one-on-one, D-Bo, we was playing one-on-ones, and nobody wanted to be the guy
that was embarrassed and talked about the day after on that's what started us
locking up.  
  
JON TESKE: It starts beginning of practice and you don't want to get scored on
and it's the pride part. We don't want to let our brothers down and keeping
each other accountable and just D-ing up.  
  
Q. I don't know how many times Florida players had good looks to the
basket and they significantly altered their shot or passed it out. How nice is
that?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: It's huge, and last year we had Mo and he wasn't blocking
those shots. He will tell you that, I'm not Blake Griffin, bro! Just having
him down that helps us to pressure the ball and we know if we make mistakes,
he's behind us and can cover it up.  
  
JORDAN POOLE: Being able to have Jon back there to save us, I got beat earlier
tonight on the backdoor and Jon was able to wall up and being able to have him
as our anchor is definitely huge.  
  
Q. They came out, hit six threes in the first half and then shot 3 of
14, 21% in the second half. What changed defensively? Did you smell blood in
the water? What happened?  
JON TESKE: They got a couple of easy looks. Couple of ball screens thrown over
the top. We were just trying to shut that water off. Six threes in the first
half is a lot for us. We only give up two or three a game and we don't let
that happen.  
  
JORDAN POOLE: Like Jon said, we felt like we needed to make a change and they
were getting shots because they were getting open looks and able to capitalize
on that and having them make tougher baskets and the 2 point percentage is
something that the stats showed they weren't well at and I think it was huge
to contest them and not let them get threes in the second half.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: We wanted to shut off their water. They were getting open
looks and our coaching staff did a great job of recognizing that and we just
followed the game plan.  
  
Q. Jordan, last year in the second round you had that game winner
against Houston, this year 19 points. What is it about the second round? Were
you thinking about that going into the game?  
JORDAN POOLE: I'm just excited to go to California. Being in the position
where we win this game we went to LA last year and now I think we go to
Anaheim, I think that was really about it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, perhaps just your perspective on the difference in defense in
the second half, especially 5 and a half minutes without them scoring a point
at a point where it had gotten down to 7. Anything change? Intensity? What?  
JOHN BEILEIN: They have three guys on their team that we talk about they can
get their own jump shot. We have a guy in our league. Carsen Edwards at Purdue
is like that. They have three of them. They're so quick and what happened is
they were on running great ball screen action and we only had a single tag and
it was so high we kept missing it and gave them really good shots. That was a
big difference, gave them really good shots.  
  
Second half, the kids adjusted and did a great job with it. They didn't get as
open is the simple answer. They did not get as open and it was changing. We
did a couple of different things and tried to change up. Andrew Nembhard is so
talented we had to continue to give him different looks. He's just a freshman.
We had to give him looks that he had to discern.  
  
Q. Coach, they all three said "shut the water off" talk about that. Is
that something you guys talk about or did they make it up on the fly?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think we mentioned it, but it's not a catch phrase with us.
But it is something that we're really proud of, our defensive numbers and
there is all the analytics out there, but I think we're one of the very top 10
in the country if not 1 or 2 in DER, et cetera. Charles and Zavier, Jon
protects the rim, Charles and Zavier are "on" guys. Iggy and Jordan are
growing defensively. It's not just the coaches. Those two are on them all the
time to make sure they buy into this idea, you can win scoring 64 points,
right? If you hold them to 49.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
JOHN BEILEIN: There is no question. Charles came off and gave up a three. He
was so upset with himself. Andrew Nembhard hit the 3 behind that scene he
should have never gone behind that screen and he was upset with himself and he
was telling everybody we can't give them anymore threes and they didn't get
too many open ones.  
  
Q. John, playing defense the way you have not just in the tournament but
over the whole season obviously takes buy-in from the players. Did you have to
do a sales job to get them to play this way? Or was it easier than that?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think our 33 wins last year was the sales job. They knew it,
right? We had a team with veteran players, Muhammad-Ali was a really good
defender and Duncan Robinson became a good defender. People used to pick on
early and he got so smart with his defense and they saw it firsthand that that
a team could beat really good teams last year, really good teams, with
defense.  
  
Q. Obviously you build the season to peak for these moments these couple
of weeks. Assess the performance of these first two rounds. The scoreboard and
everything would say that it may be went close to script. Would you agree with
that?  
JOHN BEILEIN: You guys are scripting it. I'm not. I thought Montana was a
terrible match-up for us. I think they had all those shooters. They were all
over the place. We continue to, but that's how I think all the time. I'm
always thinking what could happen in this game.  
  
This team with that jump-shooting team and the changing and in defense.
Really, how much can you prep? You walk through. You can't do it at game speed
and that 1-3-1 was very much like the one we played at West Virginia and
Richmond. It was very good, but we couldn't do it live yesterday and I'm
pleased with the way we did it. Was there a script? No, at this time of the
year everybody is good. Anybody can beat anybody.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about that 1-3-1. It seemed in the first half you
got good looks, shots just didn't fall. Did you do something differently in
the second half?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I thought the looks were good, but they were a little deep. We
settled. Maybe we could have got, we have some guys that have the dog fences
on there. They get to the NBA line and they stop instead of shooting no
further than they needed top. But we changed just the geometry of our approach
and changed it several times just to keep giving them different looks and we
discovered during that time when we went to spot A or B they went man-to-man.
This helped us out. The first half had we saw it three possessions all year
and saw it 10 in the first half. It was really the secret to our success at
West Virginia in particular because nobody sees it that played that way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the Gators basketball team, Andrew Nembhard, Noah
Locke, Keyontae Johnson. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Keyontae, a lot more presence inside, you guys had a lot of points in
the paint. What do you attribute that to?  
KEYONTAE JOHNSON: We just try to go inside first and then go out and hit
threes, but Kevarrius was getting offensive rebounds and getting put-backs and
fouls and I feel like he was a big part to the inside paint.  
  
Q. Andrew, you guys have a tough task against Michigan coming up. What's
the mindset of you guys heading into this match-up?  
ANDREW NEMBHARD: The mindset is locking in. We know they're really good
offensively and defensively, so we have to lock in on our personnel, know
their sets, what they're trying to do. I know they have a lot of shooters, so
trying to make them bounce, score twos and limit turnovers for sure.  
  
Q. For you guys, what was it like your first NCAA Tournament experience?
Was it what you expected and have you gotten used to the glitz and the
glamour?  
ANDREW NEMBHARD: Yeah, I think it was what we expected. SEC tournament I think
was a good preparation for us, quite similar to this tournament, a lot of
hype, a lot of media around. I think we handled it well.  
  
NOAH LOCKE: Just like what he said, I feel like the SEC was probably good
preparation for us. It's much more media than SEC, but I feel like we were
pretty much prepared for it.  
  
KEYONTAE JOHNSON: I also feel the same about the SEC tournament. We play in a
lot of big games, so I try to treat every game like a regular game, not think
about we are in a tournament, just try to play as hard as I can.  
  
Q. There was a moment yesterday in which things could have really
crumbled as the lead got whittled down and down and down. Who was the most
important, whether that was Coach or someone in a huddle in a timeout, who was
there to keep things calm when there would be a chance for everybody to get
rattled?  
KEYONTAE JOHNSON: I would say Andrew. He was keeping everybody in check and
trying to keep everybody good, so we weren't like, we had been in these
moments before when teams make a run at the last minute. So Andrew was telling
everybody, we good. Just next play and do our thing and we just took it and we
got the win.  
  
Q. Did you say anything in particular?  
ANDREW NEMBHARD: He was just trying to say stay together, but a lot of guys on
the bench were preaching together, so it wasn't just me. Everybody on the team
came together.  
  
Q. Guys, Big Ten, SEC, both tough conferences. When you look at Michigan
on tape do they do anything different than some of the teams in the SEC or
just one of the better teams you played this year?  
ANDREW NEMBHARD: I think they're probably the most, like, overall probably the
best overall team we've played all year with a high offensive end and defense
efficiency. I think they're a little different in that they play a slower pace
than the fast SEC teams and the size is a little bit different than some of
the SEC teams. I'm not sure that would change our approach or anything for us.  
  
NOAH LOCKE: I feel like they're probably one of the best shooting teams,
shooting three-point teams we're going to play. They run a lot of sets, too.
We just went through a few of their sets and it was a lot that we had to take
in. We can handle it. It's nothing we can't do.  
  
KEYONTAE JOHNSON: I felt like they were a good three-point shooting team. I
would probably say they shoot really well. We looked at the scout and their
guards and bigs can shoot it. So I would say they are probably way better, not
way better, but better overall on the offensive and defensive side.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
Pleasure to have Florida head coach, Mike White. Coach, opening statement?  
  
MIKE WHITE: Thank you. Just excited to be here, excited to play against a team
as prestigious as the Wolverines. Huge opportunity and a challenge for us, and
a team that is good year in and year out throughout the country and the number
one defensive team in the nation as well. Extremely well-coached, prepared,
tough, disciplined. It's going to be a very tough challenge for us, but we're
excited about the opportunity.  
  
Q. Mike, where did you think you saw Jalen Hudson turn the corner from
what was obviously a pretty struggling first half to first two-thirds of the
season?  
MIKE WHITE: You could probably help me with this. I remember it was a press
conference next door to the office when we talked about the fact that he had
just come off his best two practices of the year. Right? And you could
probably put your thumb on it quicker than I could, but we had planned on
giving him more opportunity that next game and I'm not sure he played great
that next game, but he played. It might have been a road game, if I'm not
mistaken, could it have been at Alabama, maybe? I'm not sure.  
  
But it was midway through the conference season. He earned more minutes and in
that game he played really hard and he played with a renewed level of
intensity and urgency. Then it was either the following game, one of the next
couple of games where he broke through a little bit offensively. From that
point on he brought it in practice every day and started, you could hear his
voice more in practice and in film sessions. He took more ownership, started
trying to help Hayes lead a little bit. He's locked in, day in and day out and
leading where he was vocal on the court in the practice we just concluded. So
just a different side to him about halfway through the conference season. He's
been very good since. He's playing well.  
  
Q. Do you think some of that has -- you always talk about don't let
defense bleed into offense. Do you think when he started making shots that
kinda helped him turn that corner even more so?  
MIKE WHITE: I don't know whether it was him making shots or the fact that he
was really locked in and playing at an intensity level that allowed him to get
more minutes, which allowed him to get more shots and allowed him to score
more. It's like the chicken or the egg, which one comes first?  
  
I don't know which one is a bigger factor, but I think it all correlates. I
know he's in a much better offensive rhythm than he was earlier in the year
and I know he's playing harder as well. It's a really unique situation. It's a
story, you know, of perseverance, the adversity that Jalen Hudson had early in
this season is very unique. The guy was preseason National Player of the Year
candidate. So I can't imagine the things that were going through his head, the
things that he was struggling with. But he continued to remain positive and
continued fighting, and here he is, you know, with a chance potentially to
continue to advance, you know, in the NCAA Tournament. It was very important
to him late in the year. He became pretty vocal, communicated with myself and
our staff and our team that he really wanted to play in the NCAA Tournament.
That was very important to him. So I'm happy for him.  
  
Q. I believe I saw you seated in one of the media rows for the first
half of the Michigan game last night after the victory. I'm curious if there
is anything that your eyes as a coach tell you when you watch your next
opponent that tape might not?  
MIKE WHITE: First and foremost, the size of Jon Teske. His size. Their level
of communication on the court, especially defensively. Their attention to
detail. Their discipline. Their skill level. The fact that they all pass,
dribble and shoot it. I've seen these guys play so much on TV and we all like
watching Michigan play and they're a little closer to us than most programs
because of Darris Nichols and his background of having played for Coach
Beilein. We like to think we've learned a lot watching these guys, but in
person those would be the first things that stuck out.  
  
In addition, I would say the strength that some of these guys, especially
Teske and Livers, I was very familiar with Isaiah, having tried to recruit him
myself.  
  
Q. As the lead was dwindling, in the second half, what did you end up
being most impressed by amongst your team of finding whatever moment, whether
that was huddle or on floor or something to plug the hole in the dam, so to
speak? Who stepped up in the way they needed to?  
MIKE WHITE: Hayes tried to lead as he always has, especially in the last two
or three months. This has become his team. Andrew Nembhard has become a great
leader as a freshman and his voice was heard throughout the second half trying
to pull guys together, demanding effort and poise from his teammates at
timeouts. We never found a great defense rhythm really until the last couple
minutes of the game. So I would say overall the fact that despite having a
long scoring drought and having two or three shots, I think, if I'm not
mistaken, I've moved on to Michigan quickly, but just roll around the rim and
couldn't find a way in for us to settle us in, the free throws and the field
goals that we scored late in the game, you know, the poise to keep plugging
and convert those. I guess those were most important and those were what got
us the win so impressed that we just kept pluggin', didn't allow. We had a
stretch there where we didn't value the ball at a very high level, but then
late in the game we slowed down a little bit, even when we weren't getting
stops, we slowed down and gave ourselves a chance and obviously converted
enough very late.  
  
Q. Is it as simple as consistency then that will be the big difference
if you're able to win tomorrow? Because the starts to both halves last night
were very strong. But is it just maybe a more balanced 40-minute effort? I
hate to boil it down to something as simple as that, but that might be it?  
MIKE WHITE: I don't know that we were inconsistent. Obviously, we were. I
don't know that it was us losing edge and intensity and focus as much as it
was Nevada changing what they were doing and speeding us up. We tried to
control tempo and I think for the most part we did. We definitely did in the
first 20 and early in the second half but when they started running and
jumping at us and making us play faster, making us play downhill and making
basketball plays by having two on the basketball, it just changed the entire
outlook of the whole game. It changed the tempo. It changed our level of
confidence, their level of confidence.  
  
So I think that was pretty unique. I don't know that we'll see any of that in
tomorrow's game. But do we need to be consistent for forty minutes to beat
these guys? Absolutely. We're going to have to play our best game of the year
to beat Michigan. We're going to have to be consistent offensively and
defensively on the glass, going to have to play with great confidence and
great focus.  
  
Q. Simpson has been a guy whose passing has helped drive the motor for
that offense, especially in the Big Ten tournament, carving apart zones.
What's the strategy to neutralize his passing and play making ability?  
MIKE WHITE: He's had a great year. He's more than 3-1 turnover ratio, plays at
a great tempo. He's tough with the basketball. He's strong. Again, they really
space you out. They run great actions, and he's a guy with the ball in his
hands a bunch who is responsible for, you know, the pass leading to the
basket. We've got to have great focus of course on him and he demands that,
but the guys that are finishing those passes are equally as important. We've
got to be there on the catch with shooters, our ball screen defense has got to
be great. Our base principles will be tested in terms of just simply staying
in a stance and being alert and communicating. All of those factors that help
you succeed defensively.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Michigan's size. Nevada came at you with a lot
of size, yet you guys seemed to handle it. There was a point of emphasis
heading into Nevada? Did you adjust for that and are you going to do the same
thing against Michigan or just play your game?  
MIKE WHITE: We're just going to be who we are. We have been undersized all
year. Keith Stone went out with an ACL, and we had another four-man transfer
for us at Christmas. Keyontae Johnson became our 4-man by necessity. He's not
a 4-man. He's a wing and we don't another 4 off the bench. So Keyontae's back-
ups are our guards as well. This group has become really, really scrappy and
they haven't made any excuses. They continue to battle. We'll do so tomorrow.  
  
We've consistently played really hard, defended with intensity, fought,
battled, haven't always made all the right plays, but defensively for the most
part and on the glass, our guys give it their all, led my Kevarrius Hayes.
That said, I do think Nevada did hurt us with their size at times especially
on the offensive glass. I believe they had 19 offensive rebounds if I'm not
mistaken. Size, again, will be key tomorrow. Hopefully we can neutralize it
with just making big plays, getting two-handed plays, getting loose balls,
playing physical, but playing clean as well. Especially on the interior.  
  
Q. He said last night that he still isn't 100% healthy, but Charles
Matthews looked the part. I think Coach is trying to build his physicality up
after being out. Do you try to tire him out? What are the perils of trying to
do something like that? How problematic is he no matter what his health is
at?  
MIKE WHITE: Really good player. We're not going to concern ourselves at all
with how healthy he is, how good he's feeling. He's a good offensive player,
good defense player, active, athletic. He's got a lot of experience. We're
going to run our stuff and try to defend him at the highest level possible,
but I can't imagine that's a big factor in the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome to the dais our student-athletes from the University of
Minnesota, Dupree McBrayer and Amir Coffey. Questions for our student-
athletes?  
  
Q. Amir, when this team was sort of at its low point late in the season,
7-10 in conference, from that point on you seem to have taken your game to a
new level. Did you feel like at that point the team needed someone to lift it
to get where it needed to go?  
AMIR COFFEY: Not really. I just knew we had to stay the course and keep
playing and, you know, we didn't really change anything. For offensive schemes
or defense schemes, we just kept playing hard. Some of those games we were
losing they were like 1-2 point games and we were close, but we had to
overcome those losses and push through.  
  
Q. Amir, playing Michigan State, good thing or bad thing? What do you
remember about that first meeting?  
AMIR COFFEY: I mean, we're going to be ready for anybody that is put up
against us, so I would say it's a good thing. We're happy to play Michigan
State or Bradley. The first time at their place, our offense just wasn't
clicking. They had some good defense possessions on us and on the defense side
we weren't rebounding very well. They had a lot of second-chance points and we
were pretty bad in transition. So we're going to sharpen up on those three
categories and be ready for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Guys, the Big Ten hasn't had a match-up like this in the history of
the NCAA Tournament, especially this early and since it's expanded to 64
teams. After the conference schedule, first of all how much of a grind was 20
games for you guys; and second of all, do you think it's fair that the Big Ten
should be matched up this early in the tournament?  
AMIR COFFEY: I mean, we don't really try to get into that. However, the NCAA
Tournament does the seeds and the match-up is how they do it. We have no
control over that. We just have to be ready for whoever we are matched up
against. We try not to get into that.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Same thing as Amir said, we're not worried about who we
playin', or like, how the seeding was. We're just ready to go out there and
play hard.  
  
Q. Dupree, Coach Pitino talks about how this team doesn't really have a
pulse. Is that something that this unit takes pride in, it doesn't get rattled
too easily, you're not too overly emotional?  
DUPREE McBRAYER: I would say he's the one who is usually getting on us about,
like, showing emotion and stuff like that. We don't get fazed and I think that
really helps us because even though he gets on us and we're sitting there calm
looking at him, like, with a blank face. I think that kinda helps us in the
games.  
  
Q. Amir, for you specifically in the first Michigan State match-up, was
there anything they did to slow you down or was that just an off-night and
what has to be different in the rematch?  
AMIR COFFEY: I thought they were connected on the defensive end. They did well
with the ball defense and guarding smash actions pretty well. So they were
doing things like jumping to the ball and helping the helper. They just played
solid that game. And I was off that night as well. So they just did a good job
the first time.  
  
Q. Amir, with a lot of ups and downs this season what have you learn
about the resiliency of this group as one of the leaders of the team?  
AMIR COFFEY: Just how resilient we are through the highs and lows. We have had
some good points through the season and we've also had some low points. We
went on a losing streak three or four games and everybody stayed confident and
stayed the course. Just that, having that factor with our team really helps
and I think it's one of the reasons why we got to this point.  
  
Q. Amir, I was wondering when you guys are playing a Big Ten team
obviously how is the prep different in this short turnaround? I know you only
played 'em once, but it's a program you guys are familiar with versus prep for
Louisville or other NCAA situations where it's a team that you don't have as
much familiarity with. Can you go deeper because you are familiar or could you
compare and contrast?  
AMIR COFFEY: I would say on the Louisville prep we focused a little more on
personnel and player tendencies because we've never played them before. With
the prep like Michigan State, you can focus on what they're doing in their
schemes because we already know all the players and what they like to do
already. So I would say that's the biggest difference. But it's really the
same, go over plays, watch film and get ready for the game.  
  
Q. Dupree, you guys played in Chicago three games. Where is the fatigue
factor coming out of a long stretch of games like that back-to-back-to-back
coming out and getting ready for a NCAA Tournament?  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Coach gave us some time off, two days. We were able to
prepare. Got good reps in. Was able to take everything game like, so there is
not really any fatigue.  
  
Q. As a team yesterday, you guys really kind of had maybe your best
shooting performance of the season, particularly Gabe. Is that something that
you guys sort of think about for tomorrow? Is it just totally new game, new
slate?  
AMIR COFFEY: I would say it's a new slate. We gotta get past the last one, who
shot the ball well. But it might not be like that tomorrow, so go into the
game focusing on what we need to do and hopefully we shoot the ball like that
again. It would obviously help us, but if we're not we gotta find different
ways to score.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Same thing he said, new slate. Hopefully we shoot the ball
that well tomorrow and if we don't we have to find a way to impact the game
and make points.  
  
Q. What would you guys have in your mind about how you thought fans
would travel yesterday? When the crowd really got behind you, even for that
early game, what did that feel like? What are you hoping for tomorrow maybe
now that there is another chance for folks to make the 3 and a half hour drive
down?  
AMIR COFFEY: I mean, personally to me it kinda felt like a home game, just
because of the simple fact that we had so many fans there and they were loud
and active the whole game. So shout out to them for making that drive for us.
They gave us a lot of energy. It was a really good turnout. When we got our
seeding and found out we were playing here we were very hopeful that they
would come out for us and they did.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Yeah, definitely felt like a home game. The place mostly felt
like a lot of Gopher fans and we're really thankful for their support and
hopefully we get the same crowd tomorrow.  
  
Q. Amir, did you ever have a conversation with Coach Pitino about
increasing your minutes to the point where you were really going to be playing
full games here down the stretch? And do you embrace that as part of your
skill set to be able to play 40 a game?  
AMIR COFFEY: I mean, he didn't really mention it to me that I was going to
start playing the full game. I think it's something that he just tried out,
and I think it really just goes on a game-to-game basis. So if I come out or
not it's just whatever helps the team, but there was no conversation there.  
  
First time playing for him it was tough at first, just getting my fatigue
right. But after a while I kinda got used to it. After the second or third
game I kinda got used to it and just gave the team what I had.  
  
Q. Amir, being someone that grew up in Minnesota and having the chance
to win an NCAA Tournament game yesterday, what does that do for you and kind
of the pride of being from Minnesota?  
AMIR COFFEY: It was really cool. Especially for the other guys from Minnesota
on the team. You know, just being from Minnesota and having it across your
chest winning an NCAA Tournament game, especially in front of all of our fans
that made that drive for us. It was a special feeling.  
  
Q. Amir, obviously your dad played for the Gophers. What was his
reaction after the win and what did he say to you?  
AMIR COFFEY: He was excited, obviously. I looked over at him a couple times
during the game and he was yelling and on his feet. He definitely had high
energy. Just told me what I could do better, gave me tips on my shot and just
was excited for myself and my teammates and said to keep going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thanks very much. Best of luck tomorrow.  
  
Pleased to welcome Coach Richard Pitino.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Obviously excited for our program and our players to be able
to advance in this tournament. Being here two years ago was great, and, you
know, as a program you're always trying to move forward. So to be able to
improve on getting to the tournament and advancing is huge. I loved the way
that we played. Obviously we won, but I thought we played very, very well in
every phase yesterday versus Louisville. Our guys battled and now we gotta be
ready, obviously, because Michigan State, terrific, terrific team who is
playing as good as any team in the country. They've got Cassius Winston who is
probably one of the best point guards in the country and a lot of really good
pieces around them, and obviously Coach Izzo does a terrific job. So it's
going to be a tough job for us, but we're excited for the opportunity.  
  
Q. Coach, what have you seen differently from Michigan State in the
paint with Tillman obviously replacing Ward as far as their go-to guy
inside?  
RICHARD PITINO: Ward is still a factor. They've got a lot of depth.
Unfortunately, they've dealt with some injuries. But they're still going to be
who Michigan State is. The bigs are going to run court, duck you in early,
pound the glass. They're relentless, you know. They're physically relentless
and that's been the consistent theme with that team every single year that
we've played them. So there is not a whole lot of drop-off.  
  
Q. Obviously this is a unique situation having Michigan State in the
second round. Is it actually a benefit for you just having the short
turnaround time and being able to prep for the game because you know their
team so well already?  
RICHARD PITINO: I would rather place somebody else and not know them. I guess
from a prep standpoint it's easier, but just because we know who they are,
obviously we know they're very, very good. I'm not sure it's an advantage,
necessarily, but from a short prep time, these guys know what Michigan State
is all about. We got a lot of respect for how they do things. It's important
to get rest. When you play a physical game like we played yesterday it's
important to get rest. But watching the film and putting together a game plan
on the court as well as in the film room is important.  
  
Q. What's the difference in your team between now and the one we saw in
East Lansing in February.  
RICHARD PITINO: That was not a very good team at the time. We were struggling,
allowing them to get out on the break. Cassius was very good. McQuaid was very
good. Nick Ward really hurt us down low. Curry went down with calf issues.
Playing at Michigan State is very, very hard. But we've got some confidence
going now, beat Purdue twice in ten days. They're a terrific team, went in and
beat a surging Penn State team and beat a Louisville team yesterday. So
probably a confidence factor, feeling those wins, tasting them, offensively we
played well and defensively did a lot of good things.  
  
So I think more than anything playing in the middle of the Big Ten versus the
NCAA Tournament, probably mentally these guys are more locked in and feeling
great about where they are and also understanding the challenges that lie
ahead.  
  
Q. Richard this will be your 24th game against a Big Ten opponent, same
with Michigan State. I'm curious with the 20-game schedule and the way the
brackets fell out, do you think it was fair or just, I know you guys can only
do what the Committee gives you. But should the Big Ten have been matched up
this early and also with a chance to have a 25th game if Maryland gets through
for one of you guys?  
RICHARD PITINO: You're not going to hear me complain. I don't care who we
play. You're never going to hear me complain about that. We're going to play
who is in front of us. Michigan State is a terrific team. In order to go to a
Sweet 16 you're never going to play easy games. We take what we get. We're
excited to be in this tournament and obviously excited about an opportunity to
go play for the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. Kenny Goins have been a player for Michigan State who has been a
pivotal role player all year. He's struggled as of late, but how do you game
plan for a guy who has been in so many different roles throughout the years?  
RICHARD PITINO: Testament to him that he's gotten so much better. Works his
butt off. Obviously his story is great, can shoot the ball, last night didn't
shoot as well. But he's a much better shooter than that. The things they will
put you in, run pick and pops, run ball screens, dive him, lift the 4 man up.
So you've got to be ready to guard him. And a three-point shot that's part of
their offense and they're going to rebound it. For him he's very versatile,
tough, and he has the ability to stretch the defense. So it's a tough match-up
for us.  
  
Q. Given the extended run in the Big Ten tournament this is looking at
the fifth game in a really short period of time. How comfortable are you
energy-wise with where your guys are at and what have you done to keep them
fresh with this unique situation?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, I mean, obviously with Matz who is going through the
concussion protocol and Jordan Murphy who had back spasms yesterday and guys
playing major minutes. Amir Coffey didn't come out. Dupree played a lot. Rest
is important. As a coach, you've got to make sure that whatever you do with
your team benefits the team not necessarily you as a coach. Coaches sometimes
like to make themselves feel better on the practice court where it may not
always be beneficial for them. So with one day off, you gotta get rest. It's
very, very important to keep them off their feet and make sure they are
getting rehab and all those things and also understand what the game plan is.  
  
Q. Richard, watching your team since you played Michigan State earlier
in the season, you guys have evolved. You're not the same team. I'm curious
how has Michigan State evolved or have they stayed the course?  
RICHARD PITINO: They're always pretty good. You know, I mean, they've been
pretty consistent since I've coached against them. They've got the certain
pillars or the way they want to play. They don't deviate from them a whole
lot. Cassius is so rock solid with everything that he does. Nick Ward on and
off with injuries. Those younger guys are getting better. Henry is an X factor
for them on the glass. They've been good for a long time. Coach Izzo is one of
the best for a reason. They are a good basketball team and they beat Michigan
three times and Michigan is a really, really good team.  
  
Q. Coaches yesterday found some spotlight for heated interaction with
Aaron Henry. What's your take on how that unfolded from watching the video of
it? Could you comment on what your reaction to basically the national reaction
has been? There has been some negative and positive, but there has been a lot
of it, regardless. What's your take on that?  
RICHARD PITINO: I can tell you this, I'm not surprised that there is outrage.
There is outrage with everything that goes on with everything that any of us
do, so that's not a surprise. As for Coach Izzo, I've coached against him for
six years and I've never seen a group of players that play harder, respect and
love more than Coach Izzo. He's going to be hard on them, but every single
player when he talks to them, arm around them. He's tough on them. He should
be tough on them. He's in the Hall of Fame, and I didn't see too much of all
of that. But I know his players love playing for him. I was at Michigan State
when they had the National Championship team with Magic Johnson and all those
guys that came back, and I don't know how many missed that. That's a testament
to Coach Izzo. Those players are lucky to play for him. Every time I coach
against him I learn something from him, so I have 1000% respect for him more
than any other coach I've ever faced.  
  
Q. Richard, just being from in the locker room now and on Wednesday
seems like your team has a good camaraderie off the court. In your opinion,
how does that translate on the court and do you put much stock in the whole
team chemistry thing?  
RICHARD PITINO: It's important from a chemistry standpoint to have off the
court a respect level for each other as human beings and obviously as
teammates. It's important but you've got to develop that on the court, too.
That's just as important as being friends, hanging out together. There's got
to be a chemistry on the court in the heat of the battle, when adversity hits
being able to talk to each other, being able to push each other, being able to
address something on the court the right way talking to each other and you're
probably going to do. You're going to be better at that if you like each other
and respect each other. Winning helps that, having good kids like we do also
helps that as well.  
  
Q. Richard, certainly Izzo is not going to let Gabe take open looks.
What is the counter to how you expect Michigan State to defend him?  
RICHARD PITINO: You know, Louisville has got a terrific defense and
offensively I thought we executed very well. We rebounded the ball well. It
all starts with us with our defense. If we can defend we can rebound and it
allows us to get out on the break. That's been kind of the ingredient for us
all year. When we've been good we've been able to defend. It's all about
execution. We're all going to know everything that we're doing this time of
year. It's just a matter of how hard do you cut, how hard do you screen, how
well do you move the ball and share it?  
  
Q. Richard, the last seven games are arguably the best stretch of Amir's
career. Looking at the big picture how have you seen him develop the last
three years to get to where he is now?  
RICHARD PITINO: Just been a normal, natural progression. Everybody is in a
rush to skip steps. For Amir he was An All-freshman player in the Big Ten.
Played the most minutes in the league for a team that was a 5 seed in the NCAA
Tournament, and last year he was playing well and unfortunately he had season-
ending surgery. He's healthy and he's reliable and what he's attacking the
right way he's tough to keep in front and tough when he's getting to the
basket. He's played a lot of games forty minutes. That's hard to do. He's
quietly a fierce, fierce competitor.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke about Gabe's professionalism and work ethic. How
have you tried to use that as an example for other guys or has it inherently
rubbed on off on them?  
RICHARD PITINO: There is no better peer pressure than seeing somebody like
Gabe when you break for practice and you can either go to the locker room, the
training room, you can shoot half court shots, mess around with your teammates
or Gabe Kalscheur will go straight to the corner and do a shooting routine,
doesn't matter. He did it today. Doesn't matter where we are, when we're
playing, what game we played the night before, that does not affect him. When
he shoots free throws and he does his free throw shooting routine. Every free
throw he points up to the sky for whatever reason. He does that when he is
practicing. He is methodical in his approach and you see what he did last
night. I would hope that would motivate our guys. It would motivate me.  
  
Q. Obviously we know yesterday Jordan is going to play regardless, but
how is he doing healthwise; and Matz, if he doesn't play what do you like from
the guys off the bench?  
RICHARD PITINO: Matz is going through the concussion protocol, so it's day-by-
day there. We don't really know. Jordan has improved. He was struggling,
laboring through that second half. We got a lot of treatment for him. We
didn't go full-go today in practice by any means, but we held him out. But I
would anticipate knowing the way I know Jordan I would be very surprised if he
doesn't play.  
  
Q. When you first started recruiting Gabe Kalscheur what were a few
things that stood out about him?  
RICHARD PITINO: The ability to hit shots. I know he played on a really good
AAU team and he would have games where he would hit five, six threes. I did
see kind of like that business-like approach, which I really liked. He's a
good person, cares about being a good person, cares about winning.  
  
Those are guys that the more I'm in the Big Ten you win with guys like that.
Guys that are smart players, take this thing seriously, not afraid of contact,
not afraid to guard the best player. I mean, it's kind of amazing because he
didn't have a lot of high, major offers. But he was a guy that we identified
with, we didn't care about rankings or anything like that and we wanted him.
He's been a great player, had a really good freshman year.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about how even keeled this team is. You have used the
phrase that they didn't have a pulse?  
RICHARD PITINO: Did I say that?  
  
Q. I think so. And guys like Amir are competitive. Do you think that
even keel approach is a form of competitiveness and how do you see it play
out?  
RICHARD PITINO: I think it's a strength. I do think when you're in the Big Ten
and you're playing 20 league games and you're in, like we talked about, all
the outrage in today's world you can't get too high or too low. You really
can't, because it's going to happen. There is no running from that part of it
in our profession today, especially with social media. So you need to be able
to, if you lose two or three in a row in the Big Ten you just gotta move on.
You've got to learn from every single game that you play in. Guys have had
nights where they haven't hit shots and they've stayed the course. You have to
do that. It's a long, long season.  
  
We're playing our best basketball now and I think a lot of that has to do with
kinda the mentality of the team. They really don't get too high. They really
don't get too low.  
  
Q. Just how do you see your bigs, whether it's Daniel and Jordan or
whoever else off the bench matching up against Xavier Tillman, Ward and
Goins?  
RICHARD PITINO: It's not easy. They're big, strong, physical, and you try to
game plan for it, but when you don't have that on your roster it's hard to
see. So obviously playing against them opens our eyes a little bit. But there
is not a lot of front courts with that size and that physicality and as
relentless as they are. We're going to have to do a great job on those guys.
That's extremely important when you're playing Michigan State.  
  
Q. Coach, winning an NCAA Tournament game hasn't happened much in the
last 20 years. What does that do for the program moving forward and obviously
having kids on the team from Minnesota having big moments like Gabe and Daniel
and Amir?  
RICHARD PITINO: Yeah, when you are building a program, winning, facilities,
all that stuff is great, but at the end of the day winning is what sells your
program more than anything. From a recruiting standpoint when you see a guy
like Gabe Kalscheur and Daniel and Amir and Jarvis and Michael, those are five
kids playing in a NCAA Tournament game and helping us win and advance, that
sells more than anything else. Their families are in the stands, and, you
know, they're excited about it. You see an arena that's filled with Gopher
fans. That's what playing college basketball is all about. You see these
players are getting better and getting that exposure. That's a dream come
true. To hear Gabe Kalscheur I get chills and I'm not just saying that, but to
hear Kevin Harlan calling that, that's special even for me. Winning helps and
you need to be able to capitalize off that success and continue to get good
recruiting classes.  
  
Q. Did you do anything to commemorate the win or do you have any well
wishes that you would like to speak of?  
RICHARD PITINO: I went to dinner. Is that something? I went to dinner with my
wife and my brother. No, other than that, just move on. It's a great win, you
know? It's a great win. But in this tournament, it's like anything else, I
told our team you got to the tournament which is a goal. Are you just happy to
be here or would you like to make some noise? Obviously they showed the
ability to do that versus a really good Louisville team. Now you've got your
one game away from a Sweet 16. You've got to beat a really, really good
Michigan State team. So, no, I didn't do anything besides get a bite to eat
and watch film and try to find our guys a way to beat a really, really good
Michigan State team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome Matt McQuaid, Cassius Winston and Nick Ward.
Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. For all of you playing a Big Ten team in the NCAA Tournament probably
not something you guys were necessarily expecting. How is the prep different?
How do you guys expect the game to go considering it's a team that you're more
familiar with?  
NICK WARD: To be honest, we played them earlier this year. So we do know a
little bit about them and of course they're a Big Ten team. So it will be a
little bit of a challenge, so we have to come out and play hard.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Like Nick said, we played them before. So we probably know
their tendencies a little bit better and they probably know ours better and
it's not going to come down to X's and O's. It's going to come down to who
plays the hardest.  
  
MATT McQUAID: Playing each other earlier in the season they're a different
team now and they're good. We just gotta be ready.  
  
Q. Nick, curious how you're conditioning? How do you feel it's coming
along? Do you feel like you're making progress? Secondly, how are you doing in
terms of catching entry passes? Has that part been an adjustment in your
recovery?  
NICK WARD: My condition has come along. I've made great strides. Last week
wasn't the best. This week I'm starting to feel normal and stuff like that. As
far as catching the ball it is a bit of a challenge. Catching hard entry
passes was my thing for a while, but since it's on my left hand it has made it
challenging. But it's something I have to get used to.  
  
Q. Nick, for you personally and also for Kenny and X, going up against
Jordan Murphy and Daniel Oturu, how do you think you match-up against their
bigs?  
NICK WARD: Well, you know, their bigs are very talented and rebound and work
hard. That's something we all do. And we just the got to know their tendencies
at the end of the day and box out. That's a big part of our game plan, you
know. In order for us to win we're going to have to contain them on the boards
and contain them as best we can.  
  
Q. Matt and Cassius, Amir Coffey has been playing more of the point the
last few games since you guys have played each other and he's put together a
string of games where he's really put the team on his back and carried
Minnesota to the tournament. From a defense standpoint, how do you make
adjustments on a guy who has suddenly gotten hot or has become a lot more
successful at finding his game?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: I think this is a better question for Matt and those guys,
the stoppers. Like I said, he's been playing really, really well and doing a
lot for that team. You've got to watch the film, watch his tendency and just
try to make it as uncomfortable as possible for him. He's a good player, so
he's going to make things happen. But if you put him in uncomfortable
situations you got a better chance.  
  
MATT McQUAID: He's a big reason why they're playing so well and watching the
film and executing the coach's game plan is the main thing in stopping a
player like that and trusting each other on the court and having each other's
back.  
  
Q. Cassius, your coach yesterday was praising your leadership more than
your play. He was saying it was as well as you've ever led. Can you talk about
holding players accountable and being a buffer between the players and your
coach?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yes, I've grown a lot in that area, being more comfortable,
being vocal, and like I said, my teammates, they trust me. So I wouldn't steer
them the wrong way. Took a while to gain their trust and things like that. So
I wouldn't steer my teammates the wrong way and Coach trusts me, too, to give
'em that message and stuff like that.  
  
Q. You probably have heard the reaction that Coach got nationally for
the moment yesterday on the floor with his passion coming out. Everybody who
plays for him comes out and just says that he's one of the best leaders that
you could possibly have. Explain to us why Coach Izzo's style works for you as
a basketball player as you try to lead and grow in yourself?  
NICK WARD: Well, you know, Coach, him yelling yesterday was a sign that he
wants the best for you and he wants to push you to be the best you can be on
and off court. That's something we harp on in this program and something we
build around, just making players into young men.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Coach is filled with passion and emotion and love, you know,
those are the main things that make him as great as he is. When he's getting
after you or when he's yelling it's never out of harm. It's never out of hate.
It's literally him wanting the best for you and him challenging you and
pushing you the best you can be and it's worked for years and years and years.
He's a great coach and even a better person. Him yelling, he is the first one
to yell and he will be the first one to cry when something bad or good
happens. It's all emotion and it's all him caring for you.  
  
MATT McQUAID: Like they said, it's a lot of love and you feel that when you
get here and talk to him. He's got a passion that's crazy for this game and we
all had the same goal and that was to win the game yesterday and you could
feel that in the huddle. We just wanted to win.  
  
Q. Guys, question for all three of you, Cassius you spoke yesterday
about needing to settle into the tournament, the confidence and the nerves and
everything that comes along with this tournament. Talk about where are you now
compared to where you were 26 hours ago, nerveswise.  
NICK WARD: I feel like this isn't our first rodeo. We know what to expect, you
know, and we're experienced guys, you know. We got two juniors and a senior up
here. I feel like our mindset was just to win the game yesterday. That's the
whole mindset of the tournament is to survive and advance.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Like I said, the first game is always going to be difficult,
just the rhythm of it, the pace of it, the referees, all the type of stuff
you've got to adjust to and I feel like now we got that out of the way we can
focus on the game of basketball, focus on our opponent at hand.  
  
MATT McQUAID: We had to take it one game at a time; and like Cassius said,
everything is important and now we just got to get ready for a good Minnesota
team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, gentlemen. Best of luck tomorrow.  
  
Welcome head coach of the Michigan Wolverines, Tom Izzo. At this time we will
have an opening statement.  
  
TOM IZZO: We are excited to be here. I don't know if I'm as excited to play
another Big Ten team. We just did it for 20 games and we just did it for three
in the Big Ten tournament, but that's the way the schedule it. Everybody asked
me is it easier to prepare for a team, we were two completely different teams
than we were a month and a half ago. We didn't have Kenny Goins in that game.
We did have Kyle Ahrens. We had Nick Ward full go and he played very well on
the other side of the coin. Amir Coffey wasn't a shadow of the player he is
right now, and Gabe Kalscheur is playing much, much better. Murphy and Oturu
are playing better. We have only played once. It was a long time ago and the
prep feels brand new. I'm proud of where we are. I'm excited for Richard
because he went through hell there in early part of the Big Ten season with
some injuries of his own and he got that team back playing and they're playing
as good as anybody in the league. That was proven in the Big Ten tournament.  
  
Q. Tom, you have long said since you started you wanted to build a
program and earn respect. Richard Pitino just said every time he's coached
against you he's learned something and there is no coach in America that he
has more respect for. Your program has it, but so do you. As an elder
statesman in the game are you able to appreciate that appreciation and
respect?  
TOM IZZO: What a kind way of saying you old man, elder statesman. That's
pretty good. I gotta remember that. Richard, hey, same boat, I remember going
against his dad and learning things from him. But I have watched his career
because it's not easy to do what he did at his age and kinda go through the
tough times of the job, but he's survived them. I think that's the greatest
part. You know, he's not only survived them, but he's got his team playing the
best its playing. Who doesn't love a kid like Murphy? If you're me you
definitely love him because he can be rebound with anybody in the world. He's
set some records. He's a tough kid, yet a humble kid. I recruited Amir Coffey.
I know how good he is. Unfortunately, for us he might be playing at the best
level. It's great to go against people that, you know, players that you admire
and a young coach who is coming into it and setting these standards that he's
set coming off the canvas like they did early on when they struggled a little
bit early on and now playing their best basketball. So hats off to him, too.  
  
Q. Given the make-up of Minnesota's roster, why has Gabe Kalscheur as a
freshman developed into such a match-up problem for a lot of teams?  
TOM IZZO: Because it's hard. Who do you guard him with? You've gotta guard.
Amir Coffey has become a point forward and Amir Coffey and Dupree McBrayer, if
there is one thing that's changed on this team they're getting into the paint
a lot, and they can see over people, 6'7", 6'5", they're athletic, long. They
shoot good enough, but they can get into that paint and look over people and
if you get into the paint you gotta help at all, they've got two true Big Ten
big men that are rebounding the ball. They're physical down there. So I just
think in general, Gabe Kalscheur, if you double down, he's a spot-up shooter.
If he penetrates the guards are big enough to find him. He moves pretty well
without the ball. I watched him in AAU tournaments and the kid can flat out
shoot it. He had 17 against us the first time, but you can just see everybody
is becoming better because those freshmen become sophomores at this time.  
  
Q. I know that you were real close with the late Flip Saunders and you
have had talks with Ryan. Has he's gone through a tough year? Are you speaking
to him and are they late night conversations like you had with Flip?  
TOM IZZO: Not as late as with Flip. He used to watch what was that, QVC, or
whatever it was, I think he bought cheap watches and cheap coats there. Flip
was a special guy. I got to know Ryan early on through Flip and when he played
at Minnesota. I'm so impressed with what Ryan has done. I talked to him the
day he was being offered the job. I was up in Minnesota earlier in the year.
We scrimmaged Gonzaga and spent some time with him over at the hotel. It's a
sad deal, a really sad deal, because not only one of the great coaches in the
profession but one of the great guys. I remember going up there for the
funeral and the coaches that flew in, Popovich, Doc Rivers, they had games
that night and they flew up. That's respect beyond respect. With Ryan, I
watched the first night what he won his first game and got his little shower
and everything, and I said how was that? He said, I had my suit on. I said,
trust me. Enjoy it. Hope it happens a lot because it never happens enough!  
  
He's doing a great job. It's not easy to do what he did. I see that team. I
read some of the comments by some of those players, and if he can hang on I
think he's going to be a star in that league before he is done. I really do.  
  
Q. What are some of the challenges associated with defending someone
like Jordan Murphy and how big of a challenge has he been over the years?  
TOM IZZO: God, he's a rebounding machine, you know, and I love rebounders.
Every time we play him at the end of the game, I guess I secretively would be
trying to get him to transfer immediately because I love the kid. He's humble,
he's got no ego, he doesn't talk it, he just is does it. Who doesn't love a
kid like that? What he's done a better job of is putting the ball on the floor
a lot better. He never used to be able to shoot the ball over his left
shoulder. He was a right hander who shot it over his right shoulder which was
weird. I think he's developing and his game. I think Richard and he both
deserve credit for that. But he is a lot different and I think a better player
than the one we faced a month and a half, two months ago, whenever it was.  
  
Q. I know there was a lot not to like yesterday but in terms of, it was
a win and you're moving on. So what did you like in terms of items or moments
or observations that you saw that can help the team however far the rest of
this tournament run goes?  
TOM IZZO: Well, I liked the way that we sucked it up, you know, I mean, it was
a tough week with the three games and the travel. A lot of people have to do
something like this, but it was hard. I think Kenny Goins, you know, he played
like 39, 40 minutes in those games in Chicago and had to play a ton of minutes
last night and I thought struggled a little bit. But I thought Cassius is
feeling better. The toe is better. The knee is better. Still got fatigued a
little bit, but I think healthwise he's better and Xavier came on.  
  
I think a big key for us right now, because we need a lift, too, is getting
Nick back. Nick came back when he probably wasn't ready to come back. It
wasn't anything that was going to damage his hand. I just mean physically
ready and conditioning. He got the approval to go and it was like playing.
Nick has played very well against Minnesota and I was hoping to get him a few
more minutes last night. When you play those smaller teams they got guys that
can pick and pop and shoot threes or put the ball on the floor. Now we're
getting back into more traditional teams and I'm hoping to get Nick in there
more and get a real rotation so Kenny and X get a little more rest. On the
perimeter we are what we are. There might even be times we can move Kenny
around to different positions. So we'll see. I liked the competitiveness. I
liked the fact that we dealt with some adversity and handled it. I like the
fact that Cassius really took over the game again like a good point guard
should. Matt McQuaid hit a couple big shots. Aaron Henry made the big post
move and a couple of free throws and I had to love the fact that you go 26 for
27 or 25 for, whatever we did from the free throw line. It was a couple years
ago when we were a disaster. So I think our coaches and our players deserve a
lot of credit. They've worked on it. They made all their free throws and Kenny
apologized to them for missing that one and didn't bother me any.  
  
Q. Tom, you talked about Kenny playing a lot of minutes. I believe he's
4 for the last 18 from three over his last three games. He said yesterday that
his shot felt flat. What are you seeing from a fatigue standpoint or
mechanically about his shot?  
TOM IZZO: I think there are two things when your shot is a little flat means
you're not getting enough lift with your legs, but I also think people are
playing him different and without Nick in there you can press up on the
perimeter because you don't have to worry as much down low. So a combination
of things. Kenny still found a way to get 9 rebounds and do some things and
that stretch for him, what he did was one of the reasons we won the Big Ten in
the Big Ten tournament. I think just being here a day and getting through that
first game, last night's walkthrough, today's walkthrough there is a little
bit more of a freshness to this team. I think we will be ready to go. We're
going to have to be because they're playing their best basketball of the
season.  
  
Q. Tom, you always talked about player-coached team being better than a
coach-coached team, what does it mean for you that Cassius can project your
message and help the young guys?  
TOM IZZO: Cassius has grown a lot. I always kid him because his freshman year
wasn't a walk in the park or all roses either, but who's was? It's amazing the
calls you get at this time of year from former players and everybody,
freshman, that's why you're called a freshman. You don't know anything. You
have no idea what it takes to win because you've never been at this level. So
I always believed that leadership, and I think Matt McQuaid and Cassius
Winston have done a phenomenal job. My whole thing with him is let's take your
defense to another level and your leadership to another level and he keeps
answering the bell, you know?  
  
I get proud of people when I see a change, especially change in an area that
maybe as a lot of people say, well that's his personality. I've always said,
you gotta change your personality, too, if you want to be a great or elite
player. I think Cassius is really working on that. So I'm proud of him for
that. He came in to a huddle one time when he made some mistakes and a couple
of turnovers and that 7-8 point lead went down to minus 1 for us. When people
take blame that is such a beautiful thing nowadays. He's just turning into a
good leader, a great player, and able to do some things because he is the even
keeled guy on my team. You know, there is nobody like Cassius. He's learning
how to use that to his advantage.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on the Big Ten going 6-0 so far at March Madness. What
does that say about the conference and the toughness?  
TOM IZZO: It's one of the rare times in my whole life that I ever pull from my
in-state rival for a little bit. I have to do it because I don't think the Big
Ten sometimes gets the respect it deserves, you know? I said all year I
thought ours was the best conference top to bottom and you can argue that a
million different ways and there is no way to prove it. One way to prove it is
to just keep winning and when I see all those Big Ten teams winning, I just
watched Iowa before I came here and I had my Hawkeye jersey on, especially
when you've been in the league as long as I have and I'm the guy who has been
here the most years. It's not only part of my job, part of my obligation. I do
feel my school is Michigan State, but I have a sense of ownership for the Big
Ten, too, and I think it's been great. That's the only part that's
disappointing, that we gotta face each other in the second weekend, at least
us and Minnesota do. But I hope the league keeps winning.  
  
Q. Tom, I know you've talked about how Minnesota is different than the
first time you played 'em. What about you guys? You were coming off a losing
streak and busting out. How different is your team since then?  
TOM IZZO: It is different. Kenny is back and he wasn't there but for a couple
of minutes of that game. Kyle is not there and he played in that game and
maybe the biggest difference was I think Nick had 22 or 20 points. And Nick is
pretty good defensively, especially on a good post player. Now, I think a guy
like Murphy or Oturu are both better at putting the ball on the floor than
they were early. We're both different. If they shoot the ball like they did
yesterday, that makes them a lot different than they've been all year, you
know? They've been a low 30s shooting team from the three and they're just
shooting the ball better right now or at least did yesterday. Like all of us,
everybody is a little inconsistent, you know? They played so well a couple of
games. Then they played a game or two that they weren't as good in and we've
done the same thing.  
  
I thought it was a big win for them yesterday. I thought, I know how good
Louisville is. We played against them and I thought pretty much Minnesota
dominated them, definitely over half the game.  
  
Q. I was in between you and Bob yesterday when you guys were talking
about the exchange with Henry. Were you surprised at all by the national
reaction? I guess those of us who are around the program more often were less
surprised by what happened.  
TOM IZZO: You know, it's funny. I learned in the last couple of years about
sound bytes, and there is a 10-second sound byte in a two-year relationship. I
just think that people don't understand that coaches, at least this coach,
relies on relationships with his players. I think more than any coach in the
country. That's an egotistical or selfish statement or self proclaimed. But I
think it's been earned. The number of players that called me last night that
had already called Aaron, and that thing was, I won't say it was nothing, it
was nothing. The 10 seconds, you gotta appreciate that there is a year and a
half of recruiting. There is a year that he's been there now. There is hours
and hours and hours spent on what did you want to accomplish? What do you need
to do to accomplish that? What do you need to do to help our team win? If you
don't do those things what do you think my job is? So a little bit surprised.
This day and age doesn't. To me it was ridiculous the way it blew up. I would
publicly thank the many, many people that just saw it as ridiculous. People
reacted. It's nothing to do with anything with me, with Aaron. I was thinking
of benching him, but I decided I'm going to start him anyway and we're going
to move on. He's a great kid. That has improved so much, but for us to be a
championship team for us to move on he's got to continue to improve even more.
He understands that. I understand that. My players understand that. I hate to
say it, that's all that really matters to me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.

### [Isaiah Livers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35185)

### [Jordan Poole](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35155)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please welcome student-athletes from Michigan, Isaiah Livers
and Jordan Poole. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Isaiah, Coach talked yesterday about how you stepped up the last few
games or so. Has there been a change in your game or you're just taking what
you see?  
ISAIAH LIVERS: Nothing really different, Coach B. just really believes in what
I can do and the confidence I have to have when I'm out there playing for my
guys and for myself and for the coaching staff. They believe in a lot of
things I do and I just gotta go out there and play aggressive.  
  
Q. Defensively Florida has mentioned that they are wanting to try and
throw a lot of different looks at everyone here this week. They did so against
Nevada a couple times, especially down the stretch. What do you guys know
about the overall defensive challenge they provide?  
ISAIAH LIVERS: The defensive challenge they bring to the table is they change
defense. They can go from a man-to-man, 1-2-2 press. They have a lot of
different looks that they can do, so that's different for us.  
  
JORDAN POOLE: Yeah, they have a lot of different defensive schemes being able
to go against a defense team like that we need to be locked in on our
offensive flows and our offensive sets, being able to have X at the top in the
point guard position and being able to call those out and identifying them
early should really help us.  
  
Q. I know we came back last week, but what does it do for the whole team
with Charles being involved in the offense again like he was last night?  
JORDAN POOLE: Being able to have Charles back brings a different dynamic to
the team, having a leader and a guy who has been able to provide so much on
the offensive and defensive end, being able to have him on the court gives us
a different type of feel and aggressiveness. Being able to have the
performance he did yesterday shows what we're capable of.  
  
ISAIAH LIVERS: It's harder for teams to scout when you have an extra weapon on
the floor like Charles and what he brings to the table. Jordan was talking
about his leadership and another voice out there talking is helpful for young
guys like Iggy or us two because having another leader who has been through it
already.  
  
Q. You guys have been through this process before. What are the couple
most important things about this in-between day when you have short
turnarounds? You've got to focus on the next opponent coming and you've got to
rest and you've got to mix all those things together. What's the most, whether
it's physical or mental frame of mind? What's the important thing about a day
like today?  
JORDAN POOLE: I personally believe it's rest, only because you're coming off
scouting a team for an entire week or not even an entire week, just trying to
figure out you know who you have to play and this in-between day gives us time
to rest our bodies physically. But mentally we have to be locked in and
prepared to go against an entirely new challenge, so the dynamic of mental and
physical. I feel like rest is the key, but you can't mentally rest because
there is so much you have to do in order to face a new team.  
  
ISAIAH LIVERS: I agree with Jordan, a lot of mental preparation between that
one day. You change from one team to another who does something totally
different than the team before did. You've got to shift your mind and also
your body because you just played the day before so that's also key.  
  
Q. For both players, the Florida coach and players talked about how your
size is going to be a problem with them bringing a smaller lineup and small
ball approach. Is that going to present a problem for you guys?  
JORDAN POOLE: I feel like our preparation for Montana really helped us. I
think that a 6'5" man yesterday, Jon did a really good job on him yesterday
and having guys who are able to play different positions, I feel like is a
strength of ours. So even if they do go small ball lineup we are able to
switch-up our personnel and have different dynamics in order to guard them.  
  
ISAIAH LIVERS: I have a lot of confidence in Jon Teske guarding them because
that guy can go 1 through 5 without a problem. He did it yesterday. I think he
will be just fine.  
  
Q. Both Coach Beilein and Coach Izzo talked about how the short
turnaround was taxing from Sunday to Thursday. Did you guys feel that?  
JORDAN POOLE: Me personally, I remember last year after the Big Ten tournament
we had a week after and we had to come and prepare for March Madness and being
able to go with the momentum and go while you're ahead and continuing to have
positive energy throughout the week I feel like is a strength of ours and
being able to stay locked in and not have too much downtime or too much out
time is helping us.  
  
ISAIAH LIVERS: I also agree. I like the short turnaround. Like he said, stay
locked in. You don't got to shake any rust off and wait a whole week like we
did last year playing against Montana. I just agree with Jordan.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
Happy to welcome Michigan coach, John Beilein. Questions for Coach? Thoughts
on tomorrow's game?  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: I wish last night I had congratulated Montana on their season.
Being a mid-major coach for so long, it's hard to get to that point. We just
had one of our better defensive games of the year.  
  
We have great challenge and opportunity right now with Florida. They've got a
great mixture of some really good talent but some seniors who have had really
great careers there. They've had a lot of success in the postseason, and they
had a great win yesterday over a Reno team that was in the top-10 earlier in
the year. Really have a great coaching staff, one of my former players, Darris
Nichols, is on their staff, and I'm probably as close to him as I am any of my
former players, and I have a lot of them. Darris is one of my former guys. I'm
sure it's going to be a great game. The Florida people have done a great job
and are running a great program.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot has been said about Iggy throughout the year. In
addition to his precociousness as a freshman. He seems to play his best when
his stakes are the biggest. Does he get enough credit for that?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I was asked that same question, another Lithuanian from Toronto,
was Nik Stauskas. Nik came in to the big stage and he loved to play the game
and it was a bit of a stage for him. Iggy has that. He will not be doing this
to any players tonight. He usually does it sometimes to the crowd. He made a
mistake there, but he is a really good kid who looks at me every day and says,
he really loves this part. He loves college basketball. He really loves being
part of Michigan.  
  
Q. In terms of setting up an offensive approach for this game, what's
the biggest challenge of a team like Florida that really wants to throw a
whole bunch of different looks at you? Coach White mentioned that specifically
throughout the week and he showed it during crunch time in the Nevada game.  
JOHN BEILEIN: That is the challenge. You just said it. Sometimes they change
defenses in the middle of a defense. They throw the ball in and they are in
zone and they may change it in the middle of it. You have to play with heads
up. The shot clock is ticking and last night we couldn't run a lot of stuff
because they were pushing us down and icing us the whole game. We have to
adjust, but they're going to try to keep up off balance. If they saw the way
we attacked the press yesterday they'll probably press the heck out of us and
we've got to be ready for a whole lot of things in that we do see that
occasionally in our league, but it's still always needed with new players.  
  
Q. I asked you yesterday about Charles and his development back and you
said when you play the 1-2-3 you don't have a lot of time to evaluate what he
needs to do to improve as he recuperates. But then you said if you had that
period of a day or two days you could figure a better strategy out. Now that
you have this one day, what did you think that Charles can still do as he gets
from that 90% level to probably something closer to 100?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think he will be more comfortable today with the different
things because we were trying to pace him to get ready. It's just a comfort
level right now. If we're fortunate enough to win this game then we can get
more specific because we were just getting back to square one a little bit
about, all right, putting him back in a ball screen, back doing some things
that he's done well at times this year. He's getting more and more comfortable
every time he gets out there and we really need him on the floor for his
defense and all the intangibles he brings to us. But as you saw yesterday he's
a really important part of our offense.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about getting Charles involved and Iggy is a
stalwart in the offense, but is it a point of emphasis to get Jordan more
involved?  
JOHN BEILEIN: All those guys, we look at the match-ups and who is guarding
them and what we've seen from that. It's tough to dial up four guys, right?
It's really tough to do that. A lot of people play through one, two or three
players, but everyone else gets residual affect. Jordan is one of the guys we
will choose at times and it depends on the match-up or what style of play they
have.  
  
Q. John, you and Izzo have had similar success in recent years. You're
both going for win 30 this season tomorrow in a conference that hasn't lost a
game in this tournament yet. Can you talk about different coaching styles and
different ways to get to the same end and any reaction you had to what
happened yesterday with Michigan State and Tom?  
JOHN BEILEIN: No, I think that Tom's record speaks for itself, how really good
they've been. We talk about this the whole time in our great state of
Michigan. We have two elite programs within the state. If you look at the
especially the last decade the number of Final Fours, the number of conference
championships that we have had in combination, Duke and North Carolina are the
only ones that are even close, and the rivalry that we have. We both are very
are different. I don't know enough about what he does in practice or whatever.
I've never been an assistant of his or gone to a practice, obviously. So I
don't know how our styles contrast. I do know our style and it works. His
certainly does, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Florida 70, Nevada 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome the victorious Florida Gators and their head coach,
Mike White. Coach, opening statement?  
  
MIKE WHITE: Thank you. What a game, my goodness. We did enough in the end. The
Wolf Pack were terrific. They continued to fight. They made great adjustments.
They sped the game up. I thought we did a great job of controlling tempo. The
biggest key to the game I thought it might put us if we played well enough to
put us in a position of success both offensively and defensively, 12 or 14
minutes in the game, anxious to watch it. They did a great job of changing
their defense, pressed us in both the half court and the full court and sped
us up. They got downhill in transition offense. Now we know firsthand, we saw
it live and up close, why this team has won so many games these last couple of
years. It was a big win for us. Nevada is terrific. We did enough down the
stretch led by these two seniors, had enough poise and toughness, few
possessions there late where it could have got away from us. We lost a little
bit of poise at times but did enough, made some huge plays down the stretch to
obviously survive and advance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Jalen, you guys held Caleb 5 of 22 in shooting. What did you do to
make him so offensively inefficient?  
JALEN HUDSON: We just tried to slow him down and both the Martin brothers are
really good in transition. So we were just trying to slow them down in
transition and make him take tough, contested shots.  
  
Q. Kevarrius, what do you think happened in the last 15 minutes that it
almost got away from you guys and how did you feel like you were part of the
turnaround?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: I felt like we didn't pay attention enough, felt like we got
a little bit of a lead, a little too casual, reminded the team it was far from
over. We had to stay locked in, in the moment and we had to stand together and
eventually we dug ourselves out and could do enough to finish the game.  
  
Q. Jalen, obviously Nevada made a couple of huge second half comebacks
in the last year's NCAA Tournament. They made a run at you. What do you think
made the difference this year that they weren't able to do that?  
JALEN HUDSON: It was really just a team effort. I felt like during that
10-minute stretch six or seven minutes of it they were controlling the tempo
and they were able to speed us up and we were making jump passes which are not
allowed in the program. So that stood out and took us out of character and we
were also in the bonus, too. They were starting to foul and it helped us get
to the free throw line and stop the clock and get into our defense and we ran
a zone at them, and us playing the 13 slowed the clock down as well. So it was
good for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, talk about the switching to the 1-3-1? Had you seen anything
on tape that decided if it was close you would break that out? Describe what
you did to implement that switch late because it threw them off?  
MIKE WHITE: Sure. What we saw on tape was just how dynamic they are
offensively. You've got a little bit of time here where you want to sharpen
all your tools, if you will, leading into the NCAA Tournament, of course, and
we worked on the three or four different zones this week in preparation just
knowing that, again, we wanted to be able to throw everything at them. We had
decided to run our 13 much earlier than that, but we had to score to get in
it. We just couldn't score. I had to remind, I've got a great staff and
actually one of them suggested it early and then the other couple guys kept
saying we got to get into 13 and we had to remind each other we had to score.  
  
They did a great job of speeding us up. They made us play a little bit faster
and if we had just been able to convert one of those floaters, contested
layups, one of those, and they've got great length. Obviously you're not going
to get many open looks against them, but we had a couple that rolled around
the rim there which might have been able to help us settle in a little bit and
change defenses on them.  
  
The run was fantastic. I mean, their effort in the second half, the way that
they played, they were terrific. I think that the average viewer would
probably attest most of it to their offense but they were out in transition
because they were getting stops. They were playing with a crazy amount of
energy, running and jumping both in the half court and the full court and it
was a great adjustment. Obviously, again, we did just enough. We were very
fortunate to hold on.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys for the first 10 minutes were getting outrebounded
10-2 and then the next 10 minutes you outrebounded them 12-2. How did you
change the intensity and get after the 50/50 balls?  
MIKE WHITE: I'm not sure we made a big adjustment there. First media I
remember talking to our guys and they talked. Our seniors have taken good
ownership especially late in the season led by Kevarrius and Jalen here
lately, understood that we were getting beat up on the glass led by Jordan
Caroline. He is as good of an offensive rebounder as we have played all year.
He is just a handful. We understood once the ball went in force a few times we
settled in. Sometimes that can happen for you. You play with a little bit more
pep in your step with the lead when you are in a decent flow, getting some
stops and getting some scores.  
  
Q. Coach, did you feel like this was a new level of a resolve that your
team showed down the stretch? They did make it interesting, but they got
within two and your guys still held them off.  
MIKE WHITE: Yeah, I would say, playing in the SEC and then playing the
nonconference schedule that we played, it seems like we've had, I'm just
guessing off the top of my head, 15 games like that where late in the game,
you know, it's a 1-2 possession game within a couple of minutes, whether
you're up or down. We had a stretch during the season where we lost those
games. Continued to play really hard and lost some composure at times and then
we went on a stretch where we won some of those games and then we had the home
game against LSU and we lost a heartbreaker. Then we were able to win a
heartbreaker against LSU in the tournament and then lost one to Auburn. We've
been here in these situations. These may be unique where you are up big where
you make that type of run but you used the word "resolve" I believe. This team
has been pretty good in that category and gotten better throughout the year.
This team early in the year I thought had a little bit of toughness. I think
this team now possesses a lot of toughness, and mentally we've probably made a
bigger improvement than the physical level of toughness in that it's more
important to our seniors late in the year and our freshmen have grown up a
lot.  
  
Q. You're going against Jordan Caroline and Caleb Martin and you hold
them to 9 turnovers and 7 made field goals. Why were you so effective against
those two players?  
MIKE WHITE: You know, we've been really good defensively all year. I'm looking
at their offensive numbers and we have had a lot of performances like that.
This team, we have struggled to score at times. I think slowing the tempo
helped us a lot, and if they lived in transition offense the whole game we
would have been in trouble. They're so electric playing downhill. Jalen said
it by setting our half court defense it gave us a better chance to guard these
guys. Our guys have active hands. They have gotten more competitive throughout
the year. I thought we contested a lot of shots but they missed a few,
especially late in the game. I thought both the Martin twins had a few open
looks and sometimes it's a make-or-miss game, and we were fortunate that they
did. Beyond that, I don't know that we did anything really special. I would
say probably more than anything it came with the preparation and level of
respect that was necessary to guard these guys. Our guys, when you watch film
on these guys and you show personnel our guys were like, wow! They knew we had
our not hands full. They knew we would have to guard at a really high level to
have success tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, 3:44 mark of the game, final media timeout. Describe what the
huddle was like and how proud of your guys are you that they were able to
finish it out?  
MIKE WHITE: Really proud. We looked a little disconnected there for about six
or seven minutes. When the run started we looked like we could stymie it and
we would be fine. All of the sudden they cut it to maybe ten and they looked a
little different. When it was in not single digits, there for a little while.
That's probably the mark there, probably the last media. I didn't like the
body language. I was very concerned with our level. We talked about toughness
and focus. I thought we were just watching the clock and hoping a little bit
and we had been there earlier in the year. I don't know what the score was at
the last media, but I know we got a couple of stops there and converted a
little bit, whether it be a field goal or two. I don't quite remember, but I
know we converted some at the foul line late that allowed us to change
defenses and I thought we did a pretty good job in our zone late in the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations. Thank you, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan State 76, Bradley 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome the Bradley Braves. We will have an opening statement
from Coach Brian Wardle.  
  
BRIAN WARDLE: It's a tough loss for us. But I told the team, very proud of
them. They're toughness, their competitiveness in this game, I don't think
there are many teams that could have beat us today. I thought we might have
ran into one that could. They did everything we asked game plan-wise. We were
aggressive. There was just around the six minute to four minute mark where we
had opportunities with some good looks and they didn't go down and they closed
the game out and made some big plays and big shots and we just didn't. We've
been doing it all year. Making those big shots and big plays, especially the
last couple of months. It just didn't fall our way today.  
  
But the leadership, the aggressiveness, the toughness, it was on display and I
told these seniors who I'm so proud of, where we've come with this program and
these seniors. I told them they've left this program in a much, much better
place and our goal is to continue to improve and hopefully get back on this
scene again and get this opportunity again because I think these guys deserve
it. Very proud of them.  
  
Like I said, Michigan State is a very good team. They were composed. Game was
tight with six minutes to go and they made some big shots in key moments and
we just weren't able to connect on those same shots. But overall just proud of
how our guys competed and executed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Elijah, you had a big first half and capitalized on that in the
second half. What was working for you against that physical Michigan State
defense?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: I think my teammates were finding me and I was getting to my
bread and butter which is down low, just trusting in my shot and just
executing the plays.  
  
Q. For any of the players, Michigan State is known to be a very physical
team. You guys held your own. You mentioned toughness. Was that a point of
contention going into the game, a point of emphasis or is that just the way
you play?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: We're a very tough, physical team, too. So we came into the
game knowing it was going to be a physical battle and we prepared for it, and
I think my guys did a great job of being physical.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: That's our identity. We pride ourselves on being tough and
playing defense and we play in one of the toughest conferences in the country,
so we have been prepared for this moment all year. Wish we could have got some
shots to fall down the stretch so we could have pulled the win out.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: It's what we do every day. We talk about compete,
defend, rebound and that's what we do each and every day. We did it today. We
were physical. Just didn't fall our way.  
  
BRIAN WARDLE: For our program I think the lesson we learned with the guys
coming back is we gotta play with an urgency every single game. I thought
today, like I said before, there weren't many teams that were going to beat us
today. Unfortunately, we had that 15 seed and playing a really good Michigan
State team. But if we can put it together for a full season and not have any
lulls and take care of business, the Valley prepares us for this. Mississippi
Valley prepares us for this. This is consistent in Valley play all year. So I
thought our guys were tremendous today in that aspect of the fight in their
heart.  
  
Q. You guys came into this 15th seed playing a No. 2 seed. There is
another game tonight that's going to be that situation. Do you have any advice
or thoughts about that?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: Advice I would have? I don't know who is playing, but execute
your game plan and go out and play your basketball. At the end of the day it's
all basketball. Once you step between those lines doesn't matter what's on the
front of your jersey. Just play hard.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: Same advice. All guys put their pants on the same way. You just
go out and do the best you can to get the best result.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: Stay true to yourself. What you do is going to help
you stay true to the game and just be true to your teammates.  
  
Q. Different setting to play on in the tournament. How would you
describe the feeling of the arena? What did you feel here?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: It was a great atmosphere out there. We had a lot of fans
travel from Peoria, Illinois and we are thankful for that. It was a great
atmosphere playing in a big crowd and a big setting like this. It was great. I
dream about this. It's what I wanted when I came to college and for me to
complete that goal, it was just a dream come true. We will be back here next
year. So looking forward to getting back to work.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: The atmosphere was great. Our fans do a great job of traveling
and supporting us regardless of the circumstances. Hats off to them. I enjoyed
it. It was a dream for all of us, I think. It was a blessing to be out there
today.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: Yeah, it was a game in a big arena. We played a lot
of games in neutral venues and our fans travel super well. They were there
with support and they helped us.  
  
Q. Biggest take away from when you guys first walked on to campus in
Peoria to winning the Valley Tournament title to where you are today, in terms
of trusting the process, trusting Coach, trusting each other. What's one thing
you can take away from that entire process to where you are today?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: One thing I can take away is staying level headed, just staying
true to who I am and just going to my bread and butter, what I worked on all
off-season and what I will work on now. Staying true to it.  
  
DARRELL BROWN: I mean, I think the main thing for me, D-Lo and his group, they
won five games in the year before I got there and my freshman year we probably
within 13 games or something like that, and last year we won 20 games and lost
a heart breaker in the semifinal tournament. Putting in hard work, we got to
where we wanted this year. We got to the tournament. It was a dream come true,
and like Eli says, staying true to who you are, putting in the work that got
you this far and working to get back here.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: No shortcuts. Nothing that we did was simple, years
of hard work, years of believing, years of trusting and just staying together.
We couldn't have done this without everyone being together and helping each
other out. Seeing where DB has grown, Eli has grown and the rest of my
teammates, it's lovely to see because the position the program was in was very
low when I arrived and now as a senior leaving and the position it is now is
just a dream come true.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the D-Lo affect after the conference
tournament and D-Lo got to the line 10 times even though the shots weren't
falling from the field. Talk about how he was able to get to the line and
causing trouble for the other team?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I told the guys in the back room, I'm going to miss D-Lo
flipping and flopping in practice. But he is relentless and competitive in
attacking the rim, attacking the glass. He just doesn't stop. He just keeps
going and going and going. I think it's contagious. It's contagious. All these
guys have something that's contagious and that's what they brought to the
team. Darrell's work ethic is contagious to the team, and Elijah's enthusiasm
and his ability to lead is contagious to the team. D-Lo's affect is what it
is. We're going to lose leadership and a lot of toughness with this senior
group.  
  
Q. Coach, you have great ties back to Michigan State. This team all year
has not necessarily been pretty but resilient. Now that you've played them can
you give us what your scouting report was and what you were thinking,
please?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Well, it's a team that's improved and matured throughout the
year and has very high level of play. I think that's one thing that we've
shown all year, that no matter who it is on the other side of the floor, we
can compete with anybody.  
  
Our game plan, we wanted Winston shooting mid-range jump shots. I thought they
were hurting us on the ball screens a little bit. I liked our aggressiveness
in transition, and I liked how we attacked when we created misses and
rebounded the ball. I like a lot of the shots we took in the second half and
the looks we got. We just weren't able to get it. We probably didn't get to
the offensive glass as much as we would like, but give Michigan State credit
there. They're disciplined in blocking out and offensive rebounding. But at
the six minute mark a few shots fall for us and they don't for them. We could
be sitting here with a whole different outcome and that's basketball. That's
momentum and that's those game-changing plays. We've made a lot of them all
year, just not today.  
  
Q. Coach, can you quickly talk about the pace of the game? There was a
lot of fouling and traverse. Were you trying to slow it down or did that just
happen?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I think we wanted to get up and down, and so did Michigan State.
We had opportunities in transition. I thought we capitalized on a lot of them.
I'll go back and watch the film. It just became two defensive teams getting
back and in transition and getting half court defense set. Making the other
team run a lot of clock and I think there were several times where it got
under 10 seconds. We knew it could be there and we had to foul and let the
game open up. Give Michigan State credit, too. I haven't even addressed the
free throw shooting they had. They shot the daylights out of the ball on the
foul line and give them credit for shooting 25 out of 26.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Jordan Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32946)

### [Gabe Kalscheur](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36835)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Minnesota 86, Louisville 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Glad to welcome the Minnesota Golden Gophers. We will have an
opening statement by Coach Pitino.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, great win for our guys. I just thought we played really
good defense when we needed to. We showed great toughness and grit down the
stretch. Obviously they were really pressuring us and sending us to the free
throw line. We hit some big free throws, but you can't undersell it. That's a
terrific win for our guys. Louisville is a great team. That staff does a great
job. Chris does a great job, so being proud is probably a bit of an
understatement for these guys. It's a special win.  
  
Q. Gabe, you played almost the whole game. Jordan, you had a little bit
of a break. I know you guys are used to that right now with all of the
injuries. But do you feel like you're ready to go in a couple days for another
game?  
GABE KALSCHEUR: Yes, for sure. We just gotta come, be ready for Saturday.
We're ready.  
  
JORDAN MURPHY: Yeah, I think I'm going to be ready to go, 100 percent. There
is no way I'm missing it.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Telling be fine.  
  
Q. For both players if you don't mind, seemed like neither team was
having much luck scoring early, but then all of the sudden it looked like you
were getting everything you wanted. Did you figure something out? What
happened at that point?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I just think we were able to get stops and that's what gave us
a lot of confidence going down the stretch. Once Gabe saw that the ball went
through the hoop for him and Amir and Dupree that's when our offense really
started to flow.  
  
GABE KALSCHEUR: I felt like we eased into it after the first five minutes and
then we started to get confident at the end of the game.  
  
Q. Jordan, can you walk us through the injury and what you were dealing
with?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I think it happened like early in the second half. My back just
locked up on me. I mean, I don't know what else I can do about it, but for now
just get treatment and take care of it. It just happened down the stretch and
just had to keep playing through it.  
  
Q. Gabe, y'all make not even six threes a game and you cashed in eleven.
Can you talk about what you saw from the Louisville defense today?  
GABE KALSCHEUR: I felt like they were giving it to us at the end in the middle
of the game. I feel like we got confidence during the game as well. I felt
like Dupree, once he hit his, everybody was feeding off each other.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
GABE KALSCHEUR: He was hitting, too.  
  
Q. Gabe, that first three, was that the key? You didn't seem to shoot a
lot early, early on, and then you make that one and it just flowed from there.
Was that first one the confidence booster?  
GABE KALSCHEUR: Yeah, for sure. Once that first one hit I felt confident. The
first two were unsure, in and out, but after that I just kept feeling
confident.  
  
Q. Jordan, early on, especially, Louisville seemed to aggressively
collapse on you and Daniel. How much fun was it watching Gabe and Amir and the
guys take advantage of that?  
JORDAN MURPHY: Man, I love when we take advantage of the collapsing defense
and when they're huddled in on me in the paint. I found Gabe in the corner a
couple of times and he got some good jump shots. So it was fun being able to
see that, having confidence and smiling a little bit and having fun.  
  
Q. Jordan, with the amount that Louisville shot threes was there a sense
going into this game that you guys were going to need to shoot a decent amount
yourselves to keep pace almost? Because you got involved as well.  
JORDAN MURPHY: I don't think there is a necessary, like, sense of urgency to
shoot threes. I think overall we needed to score the ball, put the ball in the
hoop and stop them as well. They definitely didn't shoot that well from three
today. So credit to our guys for playing defense and credit to our guys for
hitting the shots.  
  
Q. I know nobody wanted to play into the Louisville match-up before the
game. Now that it's over are you happy you won it for Richard?  
JORDAN MURPHY: Like I said earlier, two days ago, this wasn't really about
getting a win for Coach P. It was about getting a win for our team in general
and making sure we advance to the next round. I think that was what makes him
happy and that's what makes our teammates happy.  
  
GABE KALSCHEUR: What he said. It wasn't about Pitino. It was about advancing
to the next round.  
  
Q. Guys, there have been games where you have definitely struggled
shootingwise. What changed today? You guys got hot and you weren't just good,
you were great at times. What changed from the games where you do struggle to
a day like today where there's times you can't miss?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I think it's all confidence, honestly. I think it's all
mentality and once we have the right mindset going into the games and we're
confident locked in, I think there are very few teams that can stop us and you
saw that today.  
  
GABE KALSCHEUR: Yeah, it's just confidence and forgetting about that one you
missed and going onto the next. Confidence is a big key.  
  
Q. For Gabe, how confident were you? By the time the fourth three went
down you back peddled and were strumming like a guitar. Have you done
something like that before? Is that a regular thing? Or did that just come out
of your body?  
GABE KALSCHEUR: I haven't strummed the guitar.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Did you do that? Did you really do that? Act like you've been
there before!  
  
GABE KALSCHEUR: I've seen the arrow before.  
  
RICHARD PITINO: He can do whatever he wants if he hits five threes.  
  
Q. Gabe, just branching off that. You haven't been in this situation
before. It's your first NCAA Tournament. Did this feel any different to you
than any other big games this seen and how do you feed off that?  
GABE KALSCHEUR: It's a big atmosphere and a big stage. We've been here, Big
Ten tournament. I just eased into it, another big game. Felt good.  
  
Q. How would you guys sum up the significance of this one given the fact
that it's the first win in the NCAA Tournament for the program since 2013?  
JORDAN MURPHY: Obviously means a lot to us and it means a lot to our state and
our fans and our program as well. So it's really significant to us, been in
this position two years ago where we lost and now just being able to redeem
that loss and win and keep moving and advancing and then going into the next
game with a good mindset I think it's a pretty positive thing.  
  
GABE KALSCHEUR: Very big for us and our community and our fans. Just big that
we're advancing and moving on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, obviously you gotta be proud of the shooting performance, but
how proud are you of the defense performance as well?  
RICHARD PITINO: I thought the defense was great. Jordan Nwora, I thought we
did a really good job on him. That's a tough offensive team. They put you in
binds. I thought where we started to build the lead was we got stops. We got a
little tired at the end, but for the most part when we needed to we got stops.  
  
Q. Coach, Jordan's game is so consistent. I feel like you know what
you're going to get out of him, but one of the keys is if Amir is on his game
you guys are tough to beat. How early did you get a sense that he was really
feeling it today?  
RICHARD PITINO: Amir has been pretty locked in over the last month. When he's
good and understanding where his shots are coming from, he's terrific. He's
playing forty minutes a game. He's very, very durable. He's playing great
defense. He played great defense on Nwora. He was locked in early, you could
tell. If you're not locked in now, there is probably a problem.  
  
Q. Richard, they came into the game with a significant advantage as far
as three-point shooting. You guys beat them at that time. Was there an
emphasis, or did it just happen?  
RICHARD PITINO: I think it just happened. It wasn't anything that we
necessarily saw. It's a confidence builder. Gabe is a great shooter. Murph
chipping in with two. That's an addition, but we stuck with our offensive flow
and I don't think it was anything necessarily that they did. We were just
confident with open shots.  
  
Q. What was your reaction to the crowd and how did that help you guys?  
RICHARD PITINO: The crowd was awesome! The crowd was absolutely awesome. When
I meet people I try to explain to them about Minnesota and how much pride our
fans have, not just for men's basketball but for the University. When I took
the job everybody was saying, oh, you work at the U. The U? I just left Miami.
It's special all across the board. That crowd carried us. It was a big-time
performance from them and hopefully we see them in a couple days as well.  
  
Q. Gabe's game, as I said before, looked like he didn't want to shoot
that much early on and then he makes that first shot and it just sorta
steamrolled from there?  
RICHARD PITINO: And he drove the ball a couple times in crucial moments got
that "and one" knocked down free throws. He had eight rebounds. That's
remarkable, and he's a terrific three-point shooter. He has a beautiful
stroke. He's one of those guys, he deserves success. Doesn't matter what you
do that guy doesn't take the day off. He sneaks into the gym. He's a throwback
and he deserves success.  
  
Q. Seems like you guys did a groat job of handling the ball screen
action. Do you think that played a big roll in the team defensive success?  
RICHARD PITINO: That's important. They have great pick-and-rolls. They can
shoot the ball well, so I thought from a scouting report standpoint the guys
were locked in and did a very good job there.  
  
Q. With three minutes left there was a three-minute review on the shot
clock situation. I know you were asking okay wrap this up, wrap this up, with
you guys in the point of advantage, I guess, how were you trying to make sure
the guys stayed focused and locked in with that long of a stoppage at that
point in the game?  
RICHARD PITINO: You know, just stay poised. That happens. We're used to that.
Those reviews can happen from time to time, stay composed, give them the next
play, what we're going to do if it's their ball, our ball, et cetera.  
  
Q. When you consider Murphy's durability over his four year career is
there any doubt in your mind he's going to be good to go for Saturday?  
RICHARD PITINO: Absolutely no doubt in my mind. He'll find a way even if we
tell him he can't.  
  
Q. I know you don't want to talk about Louisville, but are you going to
get a nice gift out of your father for this? Are there any emotions you want
to speak to?  
RICHARD PITINO: I'm truthful with it. I'm not being diplomatic. It was really
about that. It's very hard to get to the tournament, especially in our league.
We had five new players. We had some ups and downs. The focus was on
preparing. It didn't matter who we played. I'm proud of our players. I'm proud
of our University that they can be a part of this. They can come drive over to
Des Moines, so it's not really anything extra. That's always been my
mentality. I try not to get too high. I try not to get too low.  
  
Like I said, I was not being diplomatic. I got respect for Chris Mack, his
staff. They do a really good job. That was the focus. How can I help my team
beat a really good team?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Eric Musselman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30554)

### [Jazz Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36765)

### [Cody Martin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35052)

### [Tre'Shawn Thurman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36766)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Florida 70, Nevada 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the Wolf Pack of Nevada.  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I give Florida a lot of credit. I thought they played really
hard, controlled the pace of the game in that first half. We missed some
crucial free throws down the stretch. Guys had a good year, but we weren't
good enough today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Cody, this game looked similar to the games against Texas and
Cincinnati. You guys got into a big hole then made that push. Why were you not
able to get over the hump like you were then?  
CODY MARTIN: We just didn't get the stops we needed. Like he said, we missed a
lot of crucial free throws we needed. But realistically the problem was we
didn't start off in the first half and that seems to be what we do all the
time and this time we just couldn't get over the hump. A good team slows the
pace down and unfortunately this time it didn't work.  
  
Q. Cody, you mentioned pace and Florida had the reputation of being
slower than you guys. Was there anything they did that surprised you, any
frustration, or were you prepared for that?  
CODY MARTIN: We're always prepared because our coaching staff does a great job
of making sure we know them better than anybody and at the beginning of the
game in the first half we were moving the ball really well and that's on me.
I'm the point guard who has no assists. I mean, I got to do a better job of
moving the ball. We had four assists as a team to their 10. I mean, that's on
me that I gotta control the pace better and control the tempo, make sure we
get our teammates involved. I didn't do a good job of that. Nothing surprised
us, honestly. We knew what they were going to do and unfortunately we had a
lot of mental breakdowns. Like he said, didn't make free throws and just
didn't get off to a good start and tried to come back as usual and it just
didn't work.  
  
Q. Tre'Shawn, you guys seemed like you were able to speed them up over
the 12, 14 minutes. What did you do to be able to get back in the game and get
back in transition offensively?  
TRE'SHAWN THURMAN: We made an adjustment to trap them when they had the ball.
He's a good point guard and we had to pick randomly to trap him at random
times.  
  
Q. Seniors, how would you like to be remembered? And Tre'Shawn, being
from Omaha, did you have a big fan following here tonight?  
TRE'SHAWN THURMAN: Just a hard-playing dude, I guess, gave 'em my all. Every
time I stepped on the court I gave 'em my all. I cared about this team and I
cared about winning. As a senior that's what you're supposed to do. You're
supposed to come out and play and put your heart on the line for the guys in
the jersey next to you. You're supposed to care and I cared and I cared about
the Nevada fan base and I cared enough about my teammates to play every game I
could. The following was great to see, I guess.  
  
CODY MARTIN: I mean, I hope on our way out people understand and think that we
represented our community and Nevada the best that we could and not only on
the court but off court, having character guys, being good kids, you know,
putting other people first besides ourselves. I hope people understand how
much work we put in and how much we sacrificed to get to this point, and there
is a lot of people that helped us get to this point. Unfortunately we didn't
get as far as we wanted to, and at the end of the day I'm not satisfied with
how it ended. But I'm really glad we got to go this far with this group of
guys. I had a lot of fun throughout the season. Couldn't ask for a better
team. Couldn't ask for a better coaching staff. They gave me everything. I
just want them to know that, you know, as a team and as a whole we tried to
represented Nevada the best we could.  
  
Q. Jazz, how would you describe this season? I know you guys came in
with a lot of goals and you were able to achieve a lot of them but not all of
them. How would you sum up this year?  
JAZZ JOHNSON: It was a learning experience especially for a guy like me who
has never been here. I had the opportunity to learn from a lot of good
players. I never thought I would meet guys like this and I'm blessed to have
the ability to learn from these guys and from this coaching staff. I know,
like I said, it's a big learning experience and we all got a lot better this
season. Like Cody said, we didn't get as far as we wanted. But we made a lot
of memories and we will be brothers forever.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you notice in the first half that gave your guys a
bit of trouble? Take us through the first few moments of the second half where
a bit of a run came and then Florida started to go back on their march?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Yeah, we just didn't make a lot of shots. Some guys that
normally score the ball for us had off nights and when you shoot some of the
percentages that we did, you're going to struggle and not win games. So we
tried to junk it up defensively and our guys executed that defensive game plan
great to try to speed 'em up. We had 'em on their heels a little bit and a
couple of calls happened and momentum shifted and changed and we got beat by a
team that outplayed us tonight.  
  
Q. Cody, nutty things happen in this tournament every year, but given
the season you had this finish really doesn't seem to fit. I wonder if you
find it especially shocking that it ended like this?  
CODY MARTIN: I would say more irritating than anything just because there was
a lot of goals that we wanted to accomplish that we didn't meet. You kinda
just gotta live with that. But, I mean, at this point it is what it is. You
can't really dwell on it. I know our team and our coaching staff put in a lot
of time, a lot of preparation to even get to this point. But it just sucks
that it got cut short. You know, you wish you had possessions back. You can't
get that done. At the end of the day, you know, you can sit there and, I mean,
I hope we can all say that we left it all out there on the line and gave 110%.
If that isn't the case then that's an issue and it is what it is. I'm proud of
our guys. I'm proud of how they fought. I'm proud of how we fought. I wished
we would have started off a little bit better, but like Coach said they just
happened to outplay us.  
  
Q. Coach, I know it's hard to sum up a six-month season as we all sit
here and I know you think it's a special group and I was wondering if you
could tell us right now what you think of this group?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Twenty one teams I think that have been to three straight NCAA
Tournaments and you can look up the names of the programs of the 21 and we've
come a long way in a short amount of time, and I'm proud to coach these guys.
Things weren't going well. We struggled and they fought back and got within a
possession of the game, and I'm proud to coach these guys. We got a lot of
guys in that locker room that are really hurting, a lot of guys that are
tough-minded people and they will be successful in life because of their
toughness and competitive nature. I think a lot of these seniors have won a
lot of games for our program and given our fans a lot of good times and
tonight we came up short. So it hurts and stings.  
  
Q. Cody, can you take us through your day? We heard you were getting a
couple of IVs. You guys had 5 assists last game and 4 assists in the game
before that. What happened to you guys the last couple of weeks?  
CODY MARTIN: I think we got stagnant as a group, including myself. We have to
try to make sure our team is involved and for me to have 0 assists is kinda
ridiculous and I don't look at stats and stuff like that, but when I look at
that, it's irritating. I don't know what I had the game before or the game
before that. I don't look at stuff like that, but if it's like that, it's
irritating. I don't really like to talk about it because I feel like it's
making excuses. So, yeah, I got some IVs. I just wasn't really feeling well.
We just didn't play well enough.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys came into the season with a lot of expectations and
you did a lot of great things, winning 29 games. How do you think you will
think about this season over the off-season in what you were able to
accomplish and how you fell short in reaching your goals?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think our record is going to go down as one of the best in
school history. Tonight it hurts. It will hurt tomorrow and a week from now.
But to have 29 wins and whatever, 29-5 whatever it is, we had a really good
year. We didn't advance in the tournament and there are a lot of good teams
that won't advance either and there are a lot of really good programs that
aren't in this tournament that have great facilities, that have great budgets,
that have great everything. It's hard to make this tournament. It's hard to
make this tournament back-to-back years as an at-large, and we've done that.
Now I've got to get with Jazz and some of the sit-out guys and look forward to
next year. I look forward to coaching those guys and start working with them
and working on depth charts tonight for next year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Best of luck in the future!

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Chris Mack](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20746)

### [Khwan Fore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32961)

### [Christen Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36127)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Minnesota 86, Louisville 76  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have an opening statement from Coach Chris Mack.  
  
CHRIS MACK: Hats off to Minnesota. I thought we were the better team. The last
couple of minutes in the first half and the first couple of minutes in the
second half, they delivered quite a punch. Goes from a 1 or 2-point game to 10
very, very quickly.  
  
We were playing uphill from there. It's really a tough feeling, you know, to
end your season so quickly in the NCAA Tournament. I am very proud of our
group. They exceeded a lot of people's expectations. It's sorta hard to see
that in the moment, but to get a group that was picked 11th preseason in our
conference and to represent our conference in the NCAA Tournament, I don't
take that lightly. I thought our guys, our three graduate transfers, did a
tremendous job of showing leadership and being every day guys and bringing
some excitement back to Louisville basketball. As I said before, Minnesota was
the better team, and hats off to those guys.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Khwan, this is a team that doesn't make a lot of three pointers. What
was the scouting report going against guys like Gabe and them?  
KHWAN FORE: Keeping a tight floor, helping each other out once they try to get
it into the paint. They knocked a couple of threes down. We was living with
it, but we started to press up and they just kept making shots. Just what
happens.  
  
Q. Christen, whenever you guys pulled within 7, what was going through
your minds? You guys were pretty pumped up.  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: Just trying to make a comeback. We dug ourselves in a big
hole. We was just trying to turn the game around.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Same question to you, Coach. They don't make six threes a game, they
make eleven. Were you focused on collapsing in or were they just making
shots?  
CHRIS MACK: I wouldn't say collapsing in, but coming into the game we felt
like their strength was in the paint. Oturu and Jordan Murphy are medal
leaders. They make big shots, scoring around the basket and that was a big
challenge for our team. Obviously Kalscheur shoots big, and for Jordan Murphy
to make two in a game, hats off to terrific player. Good players rise to the
occasion in those type of situations and he did that. That's why they're
moving on. But tough thing when you know their identity is built around the
paint and they make some shots like they did today. But they earned the
victory and we weren't quite good enough.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Matt McQuaid](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36910)

### [Cassius Winston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34730)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan State 76, Bradley 65  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will go ahead with questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Cassius, congratulations on the victory. Take me through the second
half. How did you guys get it going? I know team rebounding was better the
second half. Was that a point of emphasis?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Yeah, definitely. Just the first game is always tough. You've
got to get used to the atmosphere, the arena, things like that. First half,
that was a really good team, also. They were solid in a lot of areas. So
second half we pride ourselves in dominating games and do what we do best,
that's rebounding and getting stops. We knew if we did those things we was
going to come out on top.  
  
Q. You had a big three-pointer coming out of a timeout that gave you
guys separation. What was the process there and take me through that
scenario?  
MATT McQUAID: Coach saw something throughout the game and he called it in the
huddle and Aaron went down, pinned his name and I came up and hit the shot.
Cassius gave me a good pass.  
  
Q. Matt, in a tight game when the other team is scrapping and standing
with you, you have Cassius out there leading things, controlling things.
What's it mean to have a guy like that you know you can lean on?  
MATT McQUAID: Means a lot. He does so much for this team. The way he leads and
controls the game, just his passing ability and his vision, along with the
scoring ability. It gets everybody on the court open and you've got to be
ready for his passes.  
  
Q. Cassius, you talked about the first game can be the toughest
sometimes. What's it feel like? You've got one out of the way and the way the
other team pushed you today. Sigh of relief or momentum now? What's it like to
survive this game?  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Definitely feels good to be advancing, you know? I think
Coach said at the end of the game even after all that we're still one of the
last 32 standing right now. We know there is a lot that we can improve, but
that's our plan to get better and better each and every step of the way and
now we got a chance to get better and that's always a good thing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations, guys. Coach, we will get an opening statement.  
  
TOM IZZO: These guys probably did a better job than I did. I felt like we were
ready to play. I just felt like, in all honesty, Bradley played well the first
half. They made shots. I think we covered real well. We missed shots. Kenny
Goins really struggled. I thought he had some great looks. Then we had some
bizarre lineups, and Conner and Gabe are not household games right now and
just because of foul trouble we had to play with them. But you know, we wanted
to get Nick Ward more minutes, and we got him some. But because of some
defense coverage and that it made it harder. He's just not quite there yet,
not all his fault, a little bit ours. He was productive getting to the free
throw line and scoring a bucket and getting 5 rebounds. So I thought we got a
little more out of him. We were 7, 8 up that was the first time I saw Cassius
collapse, you know, the guy has been going so many minutes in that
Sunday/Thursday turnaround. I felt he couldn't go. We had a turnover. They had
a rebound. He let his guy go right around him the way we told him he was going
and hard to get mad at him when he's doing everything he can for me and
playing every minute of the game. It's just the situation we are in. I thought
in general Bradley play better than I've seen them play this year, and that's
a great tribute to Brian and his team and what they did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Izzo?  
  
Q. Coach, with all the adversity, how proud are you of your players to
hold their composure, break away with a lead in the second half and survive
and advance? How important was it for the team to hold on to that composure?  
TOM IZZO: First of all, thank you for the question, because usually the
questions are leading to, I'm a tell-it-like-it-is guy. I'm not giving my team
enough credit. I know what we've been through from that Friday, Saturday,
Sunday, get home and what we've gone through. You say it's an excuse, you
don't say it. You're damn right, I'm proud of them. I am. We're still going to
grind it. We're going to push it. We are still going to make mistakes. We
didn't show mental toughness. I thought we were worn down. It's going to be
good to go back to the hotel and look at some things. I am proud. Matt McQuaid
and Cassius Winston just wouldn't let us lose and that was the two guys that
talked the most in the huddles. Xavier struggled and then came around late and
rebounded the ball really well, and in all honesty, Kenny just struggled. But
he, too, played forty minutes in Chicago. Excuse. Reality. Whatever. I'm proud
of this team until I get back to the hotel and then it's going to be dog-eat-
dog until Saturday and then get back at it.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Bradley played well particularly in the first
half. Is there anything specifically that they did better than you thought
they could do?  
TOM IZZO: They cut so hard and they've got really good athletes, those guards,
Dwayne Lautier-Ogunleye and Lundy, you know where they're going. They drive it
right. There is nobody making any scouting reports there. It's simple, yet we
couldn't stop 'em. We couldn't do that. I felt bad for my assistants. They did
a hell of a job on the report and we didn't follow it as well. I think some of
it was we've just had some bizarre line-ups in there and we're trying to
change things because of who we think we could have in the game and that's not
a great coaching job on my part. Instead of staying with what we do and plug
another person in, but trust me there are some things we had to change and it
makes it hard on Nick because we're changing in the middle.  
  
So now we're going to play a team that has a couple bigs, that's more of a
conventional team. I think that's going to be better for us in a way because,
you know, I love the kid. Everybody loves Brown, but I thought Childs played
really well today. He posted us up. He scored on us. I thought he did a very,
very good job. I thought we did a decent job on Nate Kennell, and I don't know
what Brown ended up. But that kid is a load to cover. Very good.  
  
Q. Tom, at one point in the second half you got after Aaron Henry going
into a timeout. Saw what he did but wondering why that made you so angry?  
TOM IZZO: You think there was one thing that would make me that angry, you
don't know me very well. There was a bunch of things, you know, and, hey, he's
playing a lot of minutes, too. He's tired, too. When you are a freshman now at
this time of year you don't make mental mistakes on things we're telling a guy
which way he goes or not running back. There are some things Aaron didn't do a
very good job of and yet, you know what? I did get after him and he did
respond and he did make a couple of big buckets and he did make a couple of
big free throws, but that's not good enough. This is one-and-done time. The my
bads are out the window. If it's my fault because that guy played better and
it's my bad because I walked back and didn't sprint back, then it is your bad
and you're going to hear about it. So that's what it was.  
  
Q. Tom, after the thing with Henry you knew you had to stick with him
because you don't have much of a bench and at the end of the game did you call
to feed the ball into him and when the ball found him in the post. Did you go
to him even though you challenged him because you knew you would have to
challenge him at some point or you knew you would have to go to him?  
TOM IZZO: We challenged him and we said if he's going to down screen, Matt
McQuaid hits the one, and we said the next time we will slip and get it to you
in the post because they would sorta jump on Matt McQuaid. It sorta happened
that way and he made a couple of big plays in there which is capable of doing.
I get a kick out of you guys. Get after somebody because you're trying to hold
them accountable. I don't know what kind of business you're in, because if I
was head of a newspaper and you didn't do your job you would be held
accountable. That's the way it is.  
  
Q. You guys were minus 6 in rebounding at halftime. You were plus 15 in
rebounding in the second half. How did you make that happen?  
TOM IZZO: No, no, it was a love fest! We said, hey guys it's okay if we got
rebounded by another team and we said that's okay. But if we could do a better
job that would be great because then we could win. That's what we did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Travis DeCuire](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35012)

### [Ahmaad Rorie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35016)

### [Sayeed Pridgett](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37003)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan 74, Montana 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: Like to welcome the Montana Grizzlies. Opening statement from
Coach?  
  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: Whew! That's a good basketball team we played tonight. You
know, I think more importantly than this game, I just proud of my team. You
know, our seniors led us through tons of adversity this year. The way they
helped me lead this team to what it is now. The level of expectation is way
different than it was five years ago. The emergence of the underclassmen to
get us to this point was huge. I think it's unfortunate we couldn't get the
ball in the basket, 27% is never enough in these types of games and someone
has to make shots.  
  
But I credit the Michigan defense. They did what they do. They make it very
difficult to get good shots and I thought for a while we were doing the same
thing, but then it just kind of snowballed on us a little bit and it got away.
But we wish that team the best. I'm proud of mine. From there, I will answer
questions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes first?  
  
Q. Ahmaad, how did you want to be remembered as a Grizzly?  
AHMAAD RORIE: Just knowing I gave it the best effort every game. When I came
here I was complacent. I didn't have good study habits, basketball habits, and
Trav, all I can do is thank him, honestly. Known him for a long time. From the
same area, and he pulled me in when I was a sophomore and told me from the
jump just to, it's all about your reputation. I was kind of a guy that didn't
care about reputation. Just wanted to play basketball. Didn't care about
school, but I think I've improved in that regard, graduated, got a degree and
working on another one in media arts. The kind of guy who improved off court
and now basketballwise I feel like I've grown a lot as a leader.  
  
Q. You guys were down double digits the last three minutes and you
stepped on to the court after the last timeout and it was the last few seconds
or minutes you were going to play with Bobby and Mike. What was going through
your head and what were you saying to each other?  
AHMAAD RORIE: Definitely with them being part of the senior class and me,
they're two guys that I've loved to compete with. So just tried to tell them
let's go out there and fight, give it our best shot, no quit. They're two guys
than don't miss practices, don't miss games. They work hard all the time. So I
feel like myself and the rest of the team owed it to them to work hard and try
to go out there and cut into the lead, not give up. That's why I tried to pull
the team together and then just try and do that. It's been an honor to play
with them and be a part of the senior class with them.  
  
SAYEED PRIDGETT: Me being out there with those guys and telling them that this
game didn't make their legacy. Just trying to let those guys know just because
we lost by however many points, this is the best the senior class that we ever
had in Montana. Just trying to keep the confidence in those guys and let them
know we will always be brothers. It's a family.  
  
Q. Sayeed, talk about the seniors and what you learned from them?  
SAYEED PRIDGETT: These guys taught me a lot, honestly, and I only wanted to
score and Ahmaad told me you're not always going to be the person who is going
to lead in scoring. Sometimes you're going to be the hot guy and sometimes you
need to do what the team needs you to do, and Bobby and Mike had faith in me
that I could make shots even when I didn't have it in myself.  
  
Q. Ahmaad, how did this year feel compared to last year as far as your
level of comfort at the NCAA Tournament having had this experience last
year?  
AHMAAD RORIE: I feel like last year we came out and kinda just wanted to enjoy
the process. We're here. We made it here, but I don't think our full focus was
on winning. This year we kind of flipped the switch and said we want to win.
They're a beatable team, but we have to do all the right things to beat them.
We came up short but we fought. Last year, I don't feel like we fought. We
weren't fighting and having a great effort, but everybody fought tonight and
it just not didn't go our way. We actually felt like we could come out and
compete. We weren't just happy that we were here.  
  
Q. Talking about you guys fighting, you kept up full court pressure on
the defense. Talk about how that speaks to your ability to fight through
adversity and keep going?  
AHMAAD RORIE: Yeah, um, you know we have this year in practice. We get up and
down a lot, a lot of guys, you know, even when you're tired you have to guard.
Trav is honest about that, fighting to the end, end of practice. We run for
free throws and our practices are really tough. We knew that and came together
and we knew how much we were down the fight we wouldn't give up. We wanted to
do that. We want to go there for each other and on national television if we
were going to go down we weren't going to go down without a fight.  
  
SAYEED PRIDGETT: I feel like Mike and Bobby were being aggressive and I felt
like that was greatest thing about Coach because it let the guys know that we
were going to pick them up full court just to scare them a little and let 'em
know we are still here.  
  
Q. Sayeed, what was your offensive approach tonight being guarded by
such a big guy like Jon Teske? What did you try to accomplish tonight?  
SAYEED PRIDGETT: I knew I was faster than him, so I tried to get him in the
lane and close out, get penetration for the other teams and make plays for
everybody else if I didn't have anything. So tried to use my speed against
him, honestly.  
  
Q. Travis, can you talk about the situations being switched this year?
You were up 10 last year and this year you guys didn't come out shooting very
hot. How did you keep the team on track and keep them focused?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: That's one of those tough timeouts, right? We just got off to
a rough start in terms of how we were playing. I don't think we were on the
same page offensively. A lot of tough shots, not a lot of patience. So a lot
of the conversation was playing together, staying together, staying focused,
scoring off of the defense if we can get some stops. Once you get a basket
your confidence tends to increase and it took a while to get that going. Once
we got a spark we had a little life in us, and I thought we were decent coming
out at halftime. But we had another cold streak, made it tough.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Michigan's defense. I know you watched a lot of
film. Was it more or less what you expected or when you see it in person is it
a different animal?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: We faced it a year ago, so watching film I saw the same
things. There's a lot of openings to take advantage off because they do what
they do. They have rules like any good defense they guard certain things a
certain way and so on offense you try to manipulate those things. We did that
early, and we got shots leading into the game. But the problem is we didn't
make those shots. When you watch Michigan State against them, they got those
shots in the second half. They were down and they started making shots to get
back in the game.  
  
For us, we just gotta make 'em, right? But on the flip side of that, for them,
they're a very physical basketball team and they adjust well. So once we
started knocking a couple down, they took some things away and changed how
they defended those actions which forced us to change. So it's a game of
adjustments. I think Beilein is probably one of the best in the country at
making adjustments. Once again, this happened last year. We got some things
going and it was gone and then we had to find something else and then it was
gone. Eventually if your team can't continue to adjust as quickly as they do
defensively then you go into ruts and that happened to us early and late.  
  
Q. Coach, your guys talked about legacy. What kind of legacy do you
think the senior class left at Montana?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: There have been a lot of good senior classes, so if you
compare them basketballwise, it's argumentative. But for my group, we were
about more than just basketball. We've been fortunate to have 100% senior
graduation rate. None of our guys have gotten in trouble off court. You don't
read negative things about our team, our guys.  
  
So with the consistency that these guys have had for four, five years as
seniors in this program, I think their legacy is that they're the best senior
class in the history of Montana basketball because of what they represent and
how they represent it. The way the community supports them and embraces them
proves it. There have been some kids that have won more games. Maybe there's
one class that might have three rings as opposed to two, but my group is the
only group that's 100% graduated and no issues off court.  
  
So I think they represent all those things Ahmaad talked about which is
growth. To me, that's what's more important than winning games is the growth
of these young men. When I sit across from their parents there is only one
thing I promise, is to be fair. If I'm fair and I treat them all with the same
amount of respect I want in return from 18-22 years old they mature and
they're men because they're not quite men when we get 'em. That's the most
important thing with our job, and I think that all of my seniors are walking
out of the door as men.  
  
Q. The senior class has been with you for most of your time as a coach
at Montana. What did you learn from them and what are you going to take away
going forward in your career as they leave and go on to other things?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: I have coached for a long time before moving on to Division I
and then before being a head basketball coach. At high school level you don't
get to recruit your kids. You just coach who is in the hallways, and kids
might transfer in or whatever. But you pretty much have whoever goes to that
school. In junior college I had a taste of recruiting kids in my community
that could represent me as players. So I had a slight taste of what that is,
but I always dreamed of the Division I level having an opportunity to go into
different communities and pick the kids that I think would represent me the
way I wanted to be represented and play basketball the way I think it should
be played.  
  
For me, I finally got that. So this class is that. They're the first group
that I actually brought in. This is the first team that's 100% mine. I enjoyed
last year a lot more than this year, but I'm more proud of what this group
achieved this year than last year because of the adversity they have been
through and because of that I feel like these guys are ready to move on with
their lives. It won't be easy and they will hit speed bumps and they will see
more adversity, but I think they're ready for it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach.

### [Charles Matthews](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34355)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
Michigan 74, Montana 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'd like to welcome the Michigan Wolverines, Coach Beilein,
with an opening statement.  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: Thrilled about this win, watching Montana and playing them again
I thought last year's team was very good. It's tough to compare great to
great. I thought this team had more weapons offensively. They were a great
three-point shooting team and there is a reason why they ran through the Big
Sky and won it. We were fortunate we were able to defend the three-point game
and defend their isolation match-ups, et cetera, and really proud of these
three guys and the whole team and how they bounced back after losing a
championship game late Sunday and here we are playing Thursday and they
bounced back like champions like they are.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Charles, you certainly looked more comfortable out there than you did
last week. Perhaps just for you describe what the recovery process has been
like and how tonight felt different from last week; and then for Zavier and
John, describe for me what difference a 100% Charles Matthews means to your
team?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: Dealing with any injury can be tough and understanding it's
a process to get back to where you were before it happened. Like I said, I had
a great group of guys around me. Our athletic trainer was tremendous helping
me with rehab and the coaching staff did a great job of supporting my as well,
and I was able to take my time and get back to where I wanted to be.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: It's always good having Charles back. His presence means a lot
and great to see his baskets fall through tonight and he communicates a lot.
He's a great leader on both ends of the floor and we know he's going to give
his best.  
  
JON TESKE: He's worked hard to get back to this point, his presence on both
sides of the ball. We really feel that when he's in there. He's worked hard to
get back to this point.  
  
Q. What does this game mean to you guys moving forward to have gone
against a tough defense team? They did force eight steals.  
JON TESKE: They're a great defense team. We had a couple of silly turnovers.
Give credit to their pressure. We knew coming in that might be a problem and
we coughed it up a little bit. But we were talking about sometimes the
toughest game to kinda get over and to get this one under our belt feels good.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: We knew they were going to have great pressure. They have
great guard play. They are decent size all over the court and they were active
on the ball and off the ball as well. We just wanted to get the jitters out of
the first game and keep our head focused.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: This weekend always seems to be the toughest, for all teams,
just the nerves of the tournament. Montana is a great team, being able to
switch their positions and they present defensive challenges, and they were
definitely tough on the floor. But we were able to win.  
  
Q. Zavier, Charles was active all night you seemed to find him a lot
especially early. Was that a point of emphasis or how the match-ups
dictated?  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: I just play honestly with our offense and coaching staff they
put us in a great position to find others. With me being a point guard it's my
job to find others and early on Charles was open. He was knocking down shots
and feeling it. His body language was great and it's always good to see that,
but it's nothing with Charles. I just try to find whoever to get them easy
points to get their rhythm going.  
  
Q. Charles, Zavier is giving you credit. Talk about what Zavier means to
you on the court?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: We just found out that he set the school record. The first
guard to have eight 10-assist games in a season. So that's a huge testament to
what he does. I feel like so many times he kind of gets I don't want to say
undervalued if he's not having an offensive game. But he means so much to us
and none of these big nights that we have would be good without him. So we
really appreciate him as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. John, you touched on this at the start, but quick turnaround. How do
you feel about your team's energy and focus at the start and throughout the
game?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I was a little worried. We had a logistics meeting on Monday and
the faces were way down, and realized that, but, you know, mine was, too. And
Tuesday's practice was just okay. I thought when we got here and you get to a
nice city like this and we had practice, we had a really good practice
yesterday where I think everybody was focused. We got another chance. Some
teams lose a championship game and they don't get to go to a tournament.
They're smart kids and they hate losing just like their coach. But we bounced
back and we had six losses all year and we have bounced back and won after
every single one and that's an important quality to have for a good team.  
  
Q. Incrementally what have you seen in Charles' health improvement? The
tournament last weekend was one thing. The difference between Sunday and
Thursday, what did you see?  
JOHN BEILEIN: It's hard. In the tournament you're in the mix of things, so you
play one, two, three. It was really the fist time he had really played. You
had a game, couple days off, okay, here is what we gotta work on, and you
could work on it. We just had to keep going and by the third game he still
wasn't himself.  
  
So we played Isaiah more. He played great. But the last two days we tried to
get the ball back in Charles' hands, make him make decisions to just get him
back. Basketball is a funny game. You're two weeks off. It's really different
to step back on and be yourself.  
  
Q. John, speaking of decisions, what do you think of your team's shot
selection tonight? How do you like your flow on offense?  
JOHN BEILEIN: We had probably two of them that were a little crazy, right? But
other than that I thought it was pretty good. We've been, you know, as the
year went on we've been getting better, not at the pace that I wanted it to
be. But it is getting better. These kids, sometimes you have to fail if you're
going to focus even better in the future. But I thought today was pretty good.  
  
Q. Coach, your guys mentioned that, like, it's the first game, they've
gotta ease into it. Is that something you have been harping on?  
JOHN BEILEIN: We showed them and we had a really good team last year, we
showed them the first four minutes of last year's game where the first media
timeout we were down 10-0. And we showed them the fouls that were being called
because they don't believe the coach when they say they're going to call these
in games. As the Big Ten went on and every probably league comes on they stop
calling the fouls that they did earlier in the year. The NCAA is a new year.
We were able to show them that and we only sent them to the foul line 14 times
and they had the appreciation that this is a fresh start. I loved the way we
came out in the game and a little blip to start the second half, but then we
responded to that, too.  
  
Q. Coach, not so much in this game, but Isaiah had the big game in the
Big Ten tournament. He did have a big game today. Is seems like he's taken a
step forward in the last handful of games. Do you see that?  
JOHN BEILEIN: He's become a more versatile player and he was taking, where he
was settling for jump shots way too much. We've been working on it. How to get
two feet in the lane, land on two and finish in crowds. Everything was a jump
shot or a fade-away, reminds me of D.J. Wilson, who is with the Milwaukee
Bucks now. A lot of it was the fade-away, not getting your body in there and
Isaiah is doing that. Plus he's playing the 3, the 4 and the 5 for us now. And
that's really good against a team like this. If you only have bigs you're
going to have trouble with this team, right? Because they're going to take you
off the dribble and having him be able to go and switch the ball as a 5-man
today was great for us and our freshman wouldn't be able to handle Austin
Davis as well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA MEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: DES
MOINES](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+MEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+DES+MOINES)

  

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Mike White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30535)

### [Kevarrius Hayes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33121)

### [Jalen Hudson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28465)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome the student-athletes from the
University of Florida.  
  
Q. Jalen, I'm curious what it's like for you to match-up with the Martin
twins. Obviously, you guys go way back.  
JALEN HUDSON: I'm excited. I actually won the last match-up against them when
they were at NC State and I was at Virginia Tech. I know they're going to be
super competitive and honestly I consider them family. I'm just excited to see
them. It's been a long time. I'm excited and looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Looking at the season, there have been any number of times in which
you guys could have gone into a mental bad place, roller coaster, ups and
downs, big wins, frustrating losses. How have you guys been resilient enough
to get here and with this fresh start of the tournament even though it's one
and done what kind of energy do you have to make a run like any team could?  
JALEN HUDSON: All these post-season games are considered new seasons. So right
now we're 0-0. I don't count the SEC Tournament for now. I'm excited to get
our feet wet again in another postseason game. As far as the season, we're not
looking back at all. During the season, obviously we have ups and downs. But
like you said, it's a fresh start now, especially in the NCAA Tournament. Just
looking forward to getting our feet wet and competing and playing hard and
some of us for the last time with Florida across our chest. So just excited to
compete.  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: We have been able to stick together by drawing close to one
another, relying on each other as far as moving forward, all the frustrating
losses, you know, rough times, I feel like we just want to be able to overcome
all of that because we all have a positive mindset. Coach talks about learning
from the losses and then even from our wins, kinda keep building on the
positives and fixing the things we do wrong. Like he said, it is a new season,
0-0, coming out the right mindset and coming out and play the way we play.  
  
Q. Curious what you think of the Wolf Pack. There will be several guys
on each side with a lot of experience in this tournament so it could be a fun
match-up?  
JALEN HUDSON: They're a very experienced team. Obviously, they have had a lot
of success. They are a mid-major team though. I don't think they've seen a
team like us in a long time. I know they had a match-up with USC and I think
it was another high major team they kind of had trouble with. So I'm just
excited to bring our SEC vibe to the game and see how they kinda can match-up
with that. Obviously they're a very good team. I know the Martin twins well.
They've played at a very high level in the ACC at NC State. I don't know the
other guys, but I know they can play and a bunch of them have transferred as
well. So I think it will be a good match-up for both teams.  
  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: This team has a lot of experience as far as a lot of seniors
and transfers and it will be interesting to go up against them. I know they're
talented players from the perimeter down to the post. I feel like it will be a
good way to test our strengths and some of our weaknesses right now and just
kind of give it all we got. The Martin twins are very good and they've got a
lot of three-point shooters. We're going to stick to what we do, play our
principles.  
  
Q. Kevarrius, you're playing some of your best basketball. You're
averaging over 11 points. What do you attribute that to?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: Staying the course, working on it a lot, just trying to get
shots just about every day, anytime I can. It's kind of starting to show and
pay off a little more, the confidence to hit the mid-range shot like I did in
one of our games. Just kinda keep building on that. I feel like I always play
hard in every game. So that's never going to go away. I'm just going to keep
building on that.  
  
Q. Kevarrius, do you think there is something about this team playing
better given the rotation has shrunk a little bit? You guys, all five starters
averaging over 30 minutes a game last week in the SEC tournament and Mike says
you all are playing your best basketball right now. Is there a coincidence
there or is this the best lineup for you guys right now?  
KEVARRIUS HAYES: I feel like we owe that to our chemistry, how we are off
court. It's starting to transition on the court, understanding each other's
play style and playing around our strengths and even then our bench is
actually really good. When they come in they keep up the energy, and I feel
like that's what we do very well. We keep the energy going. When we have a lot
of energy in our games we send a snowball after of that even when something
goes wrong we can band together. Everybody has the right mindset as far as we
all like want to win, and the starting five set the tone as strong as we can
and we build off of that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, guys.  
  
We have Florida head coach, Mike White. Coach, welcome to Des Moines.  
  
MIKE WHITE: Thank you. Great to be here. Appreciate you all's time. Exciting
to play in the NCAA Tournament as always. Anything can happen in this
tournament and our guys are excited to be here. We're coming off an SEC
Tournament in which we won a really close one and lost a really close one. But
feel like we're playing our best basketball of the year and we certainly hope
that teams against a team in Nevada who is coming after a great tournament in
their own right last year in this tournament and has had another terrific
season, a highly ranked team all year, a team who we're going to have to play
really well against to have a chance. Excited about the opportunity.  
  
Q. Coach, what are going to be the keys to beating your opponent
tomorrow and what's your biggest concerns? Have you ever been to Iowa
before?  
MIKE WHITE: I will answer the first ones first, because I might ramble on the
second one. Keys to the game? Defensive transition is important against these
guys. A lot of things are important against these guys. Live ball turnovers
and floor balance, it's all the same category. We're coming off a game in
which we would have given ourselves a better chance against the Auburn Tigers
to potentially play in the SEC championship on Sunday, if we didn't have 19
turnovers, uncharacteristically, like we did. We have got to do better than
that against Nevada. Isolation defense has gotta be huge. These guys can go
get it. They're great at drawing fouls. They're great at playing downhill.  
  
Then for us, not only specifically to these guys, but they are terrific
defensively, but for us going into every game, offensively we have to figure
out how we're going to score. How we're going to score. These guys defensively
are very, very efficient. Again, we've got to value the ball at a high level
and those are just a few keys, a few factors. But there's a bunch. This is a
team that is as old as anybody in the country. They've done a great job with
balancing that and managing that roster. They are as big as anybody in the
country, an incredibly long lineup. They've got a good mix of shooters and
handlers. They seem to have a bunch of guys that can pass, dribble and shoot
it.  
  
They go at you. Coach obviously knows how to go at you with his background in
terms of picking on certain guys at different spots on the floor and putting
guys in position to be successful offensively, and they're tough. They're
physical. They battle you. They're really good.  
  
Have I been to Iowa? First through fourth grade I lived in Dubuque, attended
St. Columbkille Elementary as we just talked about behind the curtain. Fun
time in my life, and my siblings lives. We loved it here. My father was the
Athletic Director at Loras College right down the road. It was a great time.  
  
Q. The whole roller coaster word is a horrible cliche, but parentally to
this team it might actually be something that close to fits. There has been a
lot of chances for the team to really get down on itself, up points, down
points, winning streaks, losing streaks, following those. How has the
resiliency of this team impressed you to get to where you guys are today?  
MIKE WHITE: Very much so. It's been a really odd year. This team was 12-11.
Went through losing streaks, winning streaks. We've been through different
guys starting. We've been through seniors going off. Seniors having slumps.
Freshmen trying to figure it out. Freshmen leading us to victories.  
  
It's been unique to say the least. We've had several opportunities having lost
some very close games to lose interest, if you will, lose a little bit of
fight. But instead it was about the next practice, the next play, the next
timeout, the next film session and obviously won our share down the stretch,
playing our best basketball of the year, won enough close ones. You wish we
could have back some of those close ones that we lost and we might be sitting
here not having to play Nevada.  
  
That said, it speaks to, you said s resiliency, toughness, character, you
know, we have our flaws as a team, but collectively this team has got a lot of
character in that we just kept plugging, kept work and anything can happen.  
  
Q. Coach, Nevada and you guys both have a lot of experience on this
stage. What have you learned from the past couple of years about what it takes
to succeed on this stage?  
MIKE WHITE: I think the last thing I said was anything can happen, and I'll
stick to that. We know everyone has a clean slate and that have been ten teams
that have made big runs in the NCAA Tournament and there was an 11 seed who
came in last year and beat us on our home court and ended up going to Final
Four in Loyola who was an 11 seed.  
  
That said, just like the SEC tournament, you can make a lot of noise. Who
would we play next? None of that matters. This is about the first possession
against Nevada and lock in on these guys, the scouting report, the film
session tonight, the next film session tomorrow, trying to get a great shot
versus a stifling defense, trying to get a stop, trying to get your second
stop. That's it. Playing in the moment, moving on to the next play, playing in
the game, locking in on the Wolf Pack. Hopefully we're competitive enough down
the stretch to where we've got a shot. That's it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Brian Wardle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30352)

### [Dwayne Lautier-
Ogunleye](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32673)

### [Elijah Childs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36624)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: I would like to welcome the Bradley Braves, our student-
athletes, sophomore forward Elijah Childs and senior guard Dwayne Lautier-
Ogunleye. Questions for our Bradley Braves?  
  
Q. For either of you, you guys sit at 0-5 in conference play. What are
the biggest things that change for your team to turn things around?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: I think one thing is staying with the game plan, staying
together as a team, encouraging each other day-by-day, staying in the gym,
keep working hard. As Coach says, stay with the game plan and keep level
headed, and we knew we would come out of this slump. It's just a matter of
time and that's what we did and we got the job done.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: Kinda what Elijah said. We had a meeting, spoke about
the season as a whole and if we still wanted to pursue and keep going and
finish off strong and everybody was committed to our work ethic and we were
committed to a change and win the first game and keep our momentum rolling to
where we are now.  
  
Q. When was that meeting, Dwayne, and who led it? Was there a certain
point that made you think, okay, we've got to get this turned around? Second
thing, in addition to just the attitude you took, did you guys start playing
at a faster pace or make defense changes around that time?  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: After we went 0-3, we sat down and spoke. But there
was a big meeting after the fifth loss. The seniors came together as well as
the rest of the players and the coaching staff and we sat down and said this
hasn't started the way we wanted to, but we have time to change. I don't think
we made major adjustments. We concentrated on the little things. We're a team
that defends, rebounds, and breaks well on off. We tried to remain true to
ourselves and maintain our identity, and once we got things clicking it
started rolling and the confidence grew and once the confidence grew everybody
started playing their roles even better than they were before and that's what
really helped.  
  
Q. Can you please tell me what stands out to you each individually when
you watch the Spartans on tape scouting them?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: Just the way they run the offense. They play at their pace.
They don't beat themselves. We've got to come in and execute our game plan and
play at our pace and do what we do. Just another thing, offensive rebounding
and rebounding on both ends, everybody gotta box out and rebound, and if we
can play a half court game I think we will be in great shape.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: Yeah, their bigs run really well the floor, which is
something we were impressed with. They're physical. They rebound, but they
play a lot like us which is kinda cool. We ought to match-up really well. They
do a lot of things well. They compete. They defend and they rebound. It should
be a good game because it's two teams similar to each other playing against
each other.  
  
Q. Dwayne, if you could tell the story of how you made it from London to
Bradley, how that happens? Elijah, there are players from seven different
countries including the United States. If you could describe what it's like
and maybe what you learned about different cultures or things that maybe
surprised you or how it's helped you grow or expand your viewpoint?  
ELIJAH CHILDS: I think it's been pretty fun playing with international guys
not from the U.S. I've learned a lot about them and I learned their style of
play and our style of play and going over there, I took an overseas trip. I
think I learned a lot and learned how things operate and how things go over
there. It's been fun playing with these guys, and I love 'em like my brother.
We can make a run in the tournament.  
  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: My story is kinda funny. I played for a team in
Bristol and they had a couple of Americans on the team. From word of mouth,
one of my teammates spoke to people in America because he knew I wanted to
play college basketball. I don't know how it managed to happen, but word of
mouth ended up getting my name to Coach Drew Adams when he was leaving New
Mexico and just got hired by the Coach Wardle at Bradley. He messaged me on
Facebook, said he liked the film and he wanted me to come on a visit with my
mother. I came on my visit, maybe a week after we actually spoke. I loved my
visit and I committed before leaving Bradley. The coach said they wanted to
change the program from the ground up and said I would be a part of it from
the start and I was sold on that and to be able to take the program from where
it was my freshman year until now is incredible.  
  
Q. Dwayne, this week in practice Kenny Goins talked about you guys do do
things scrappy like they do. Is there a sense of excitement this is going to
be a physical, bang-it-out battle, is that kind of like what basketball should
be. Do you enjoy that aspect?  
DWAYNE LAUTIER-OGUNLEYE: We thrive on it. We are a group of competitors. We do
it every day in practice and this is exciting. This is what March basketball
is all about. I grew up in London wanting to be a part of this and now to be
able to play a game like this is just exciting. We are all pumped and ready to
go.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
We are joined by the Bradley Braves head coach. They won the Mississippi
Valley Conference Championship. They will be making their ninth appearance and
first since 2006. They will play Michigan State. Welcome Head Coach, Brian
Wardle.  
  
BRIAN WARDLE: Thank you. We always enjoy coming to Des Moines and have had
tremendous hospitality and we're excited to play in the NCAA Tournament,
excited to be back after 13 years and excited for the program. Couldn't be
prouder of our group. We've had a great group of practice. I think the focus
is at a high level. We know we're up against a great challenges against a
great time, a great coach. I know our guys are excited in getting out and
showcasing what Bradley is about, but more importantly what Missouri Valley is
about.  
  
Q. Brian, Michigan State and you are both gritty teams, grind-it-out
teams, you do the little things. As a coach, is it fun to compete with people
who mirror you and play that same kinda game?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Absolutely. I would say we mirror Michigan State in a way. I
have a lot of respect for Coach Izzo. I had Mike as my coach at Marquette. Tom
Crean who came from the Tom Izzo tree, and a lot of what we do is man-to-man,
rebounding is an emphasis for us. We like to get up and down when the
opportunities are there and push it and then we will try to execute in the
half court. It's a great challenge. The competitor in me is excited about the
opportunity and I know our guys are, too.  
  
Q. Coach, you had an extra week to prepare over Michigan State. Do you
see that as an advantage or a detriment?  
BRIAN WARDLE: It's hard to tell. I called a lot of coaches especially from our
league that have had success in the tournament with our time gap between our
tournament and the NCAA. Asked them what were some of the things you did? What
did you try to do? I thought our game plan as a staff was pretty accurate on
what most teams did. We tried to do as many things as game speed as possible.
We scrimmaged a little bit, but we also got the rest. Will we be rusty? I hope
not. We had a great practice this morning. It was intense. It was up and down,
and I think it's been important that we scrimmage a little bit to try to stay
as sharp as possible. But this time of year I know players want to play. They
don't want to sit around very long at all. Once you get to January that's
their mentality. Keeping them engaged and sharp, I think we've done a pretty
good job of that. But tomorrow will tell.  
  
Q. Coach, I know that the situation with Dave Reynolds was resolved over
the weekend. But I kinda think we need to ask on one level, why did you think
that you had that perception of what the local coverage there was like? What
do you think you ultimately learned from that entire situation as you try to
move forward with how you work with everybody as the years go on?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Well, I had a great talk with Dave face-to-face on Sunday, and I
apologized to him for not handling the situation very well.  
  
We had a great talk, and we're excited to meet after the season and work some
things out and continue to build our relationship. I learned a lot. I think
what's important is that when you talk to your team, we've built this program
on, you know, high character young men, accountability, responsibility,
discipline, unselfishness, being honest communicators, and we've grown the
program every year and improved it every year.  
  
I think in the classroom, in the community, and on the floor, one of the
things you teach your kids a lot is what's hard for them is when you make a
mistake you've gotta admit it. You gotta own it and then you've got to teach a
lot of young men now if apology is necessary then you've got to apologize and
own it and then you've got to learn from it and grow and move on. That lesson,
I tell my kids all the time, I've done it before and I did it on Sunday again.
I think hopefully we've all learned that you own things, you move on, you
learn and you grow and you keep moving forward and you try not to repeat
mistakes.  
  
Q. Coach, obviously none of your players have played in the NCAA
Tournament, but this is a first for you. Who do you look to in preparing for
something like this?  
BRIAN WARDLE: Well, you reach out to your mentors and you talk to, like I
said, I talked to other coaches about the preparation side of things. A lot of
them said just really enjoy it. Especially for your student-athletes, for your
young men, enjoy the moment. We fear none, respect all. We're coming into
compete now and we're coming into play. But I want these guys to enjoy the
moment out here, enjoy the media, enjoy the hotel, enjoy the Bradley fans that
will be here and take in those memories, because life is about memories. You
forget the games. You forget your stats. I tell 'em all the time when you get
to my age you forget all that stuff. But you remember the bonding, the hotel,
your teammates, all the fun stories in practice, on the bus, and I said try to
soak all that in as much as you can because that's what it's all about.  
  
Q. Brian, when you watch Michigan State on film can you give us your
initial thoughts? I know we talked about them playing like you, but your
initial thoughts and breakdown?  
BRIAN WARDLE: When you call other coaches and you know what Michigan State
stands for, you know what their identity is, that's why they're a great
program. They have that strong identity. They're very good in transition. You
gotta get back and you gotta rebound with them, right? You have to rebound
with them. Then everyone talks about the toughness, the physicality, all of
that I hear. But when I watch on film and I studied them Sunday night and the
last two days, they're a very smart team. They do not beat themselves.  
  
I love how they're all stars in their role. You look at their team, no one
goes outside their lane. They stay in their lane. They do their job and they
do it very, very well. They don't try to take crazy shots from three if
they're not a three shooter. They do their job in their roles and that's why
they're consistent, I think, even through some injuries. That's why they're a
really good program.  
  
Q. You know, there's a real international flavor to your roster this
year. Besides learning how to become a team on the floor, what has the whole
cultural learning been for this particular group of players and how has that
kind of impressed itself upon you, I guess this year, too?  
BRIAN WARDLE: It's been great for all of us. We had a chance to go to the
London and Netherlands this summer and Delo and Luuk's home. Having guys from
different diversities, different cultures. We do presentations in the
summertime every year where everyone talks about their home city and family
and all the traditions they have with their family just to get educated on a
whole different side, really way of thinking in a way and a way of living and
I think I say great for our guys to experience it. For example this morning,
we were having breakfast. Luuk is the last one to finish his meal. The whole
team laughs because Luuk is a slow eater. When Luuk came to me, he goes, why
is everyone in a rush here? I like to take my time. We take our time over in
the Netherlands, so things like that for our guys to experience and talk about
is a lot of fun for our group.  
  
Q. I was just talking to your point guard and obviously we were talking
about Michigan State's point guard and that match-up. How do you assess your
teams are both led by point guards. What do you think Darrell can do well
against a guy like Cassius?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I think Darrell has done a great job all year and done an
unbelievable job of not only having the pressure of having the ball in his
hands a lot, just getting double teamed, getting bigger, always getting the
best defender on him during the game. For Darrell, though, we gotta get out in
transition. He is a weapon on the floor. You can't measure a person's heart. I
think he has a huge heart and a huge work ethic. He has all the intangibles
you want in a point guard. He can change a game in a minute or two. There are
not many guys that can do that, but Darrell is that for us. He is a constant
threat on the floor. He can rally off three or four three-pointers, and he's
done that for us all year. If we can set good screens for him, get him going,
then the rest takes care of himself. For Darrell, it's all, gas no brakes. I
say that all year. When he has the gas pedal down the whole game and never
lets off, he's going to be productive.  
  
Q. Coach, Lugman stepped up in that game against UNI. Who is going to
step up like he did?  
BRIAN WARDLE: We are at our best playing as a team. We have unselfish kids.
Whoever is hot at the time that's who they will be talking about in the
huddle. Let's get him the ball, let's get him the ball. Everyone was saying,
let's get L the ball. Lugman hasn't been a threat all year, but that's who was
hot. Whoever is matching up against us and is doing well, that's who we will
attack.  
  
Q. Coach, you have a close draw to Peoria. How well do you think they
will travel here and how will that benefit for you?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I think you will see a lot of red tomorrow. We are hoping. You
just never know in the selection process where you fall, but a lot of our fans
were hoping it would be here. It's a four, four and a half hour drive for us
and it's not too far and we got a lot of fans in Chicago. It's a 5-hour trip
from there. I think you will see a lot of Braves fans, and we call 'em the Red
Sea. But you will see a lot of Red Sea fans in the arena tomorrow.  
  
Q. Obviously, the fact that you guys were down so much in the
championship game in what's essentially a tournament game. How do you think
that translates, if tomorrow you do get down against a team like Michigan
State there is no fear in this team. What are those processes like?  
BRIAN WARDLE: I think it's a resiliency we have had throughout the year. It's
a connected, committed group to each other. We've matured a lot as a group.
It's become a player-lead team, I always say that. Leadership and getting from
a coach-led team to a player-led team, there is no doubt we did that. But we
do not want to be down 18 to Michigan State tomorrow. Let me make that clear,
and we do not want to have 15 points at halftime like we did because they're
too explosive of a team as we all know. Down two, three, four possessions our
group is going to battle. We have shown that all year. We have heart. We have
toughness, and even if the shots aren't falling we've got to stay committed to
the defense and the rebounding. If we can do that, we can play with anybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, wish you the best of luck tomorrow. Thank you.

## March 20, 2019

  

### [Richard Pitino](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25315)

### [Jordan Murphy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32946)

### [Dupree McBrayer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32984)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome senior forward Jordan Murphy and
senior guard Dupree McBrayer. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. For each of you, your thoughts on where the team is at right now and
what's going to be important tomorrow against Louisville?  
JORDAN MURPHY: I think our team is in a good place, confident going into
tomorrow. We're still figuring out our game plan and stuff like that and
figuring out our plan of attack. Obviously, it's a very important game to us.
Means a lot to our young guys and our older guys going out in a good way. I
think that's about it.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Still figuring some things out on how we are going to guard
and stuff, but we feel really good about tomorrow.  
  
Q. The angle in our town is Rick Pitino and Richard Pitino and all of
that. Does that cross your consciousness in Minnesota? Does it even come up?  
JORDAN MURPHY: No, not at all. We probably see those headlines all the time
and we take it with a grain of salt and pass by it. It's not something our
team is focused on. It's about our team versus Louisville and that's it.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: I've been telling the guys from day one it's not about the
Pitino family. It's about Minnesota versus Louisville and knowing that our
coach came from Louisville and it's just Minnesota versus Louisville. We will
be fine.  
  
Q. In the absence of other questions, how much contact have you had with
the senior Pitino? How much has he been at your practices? Have you learned
anything from him about basketball? Take all the other stuff out of it.  
JORDAN MURPHY: We really haven't had a lot of contact with him. Obviously, he
got a new coaching job overseas. So we haven't had a lot of contact with him
this year. Obviously, you see him tweeting all the time and giving us his best
regards. So I think that's about the most part, but we appreciate his support
wherever he is at.  
  
DUPREE McBRAYER: Before he got his job over in Greece he was able to give us
pointers, and that's about it. He's in Greece, and like Murph said, we see his
tweets giving us his best regards. We thank him for his support.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, thank you very much.  
  
At this time, we have Richard Pitino, University of Minnesota Golden Gophers.
They are making their second NCAA appearance and second in the last three
years under Richard Pitino. Coach?  
  
RICHARD PITINO: Excited to be here. The grind of a regular season is a lot,
and the goal is obviously going to an NCAA Tournament. So that in itself is a
great accomplishment. Proud of our guys to be able to bounce back from a lot
of things out of their control last year to get back to an NCAA Tournament
with five new players, starting two freshmen, playing one of the toughest
schedules in the country and obviously one of the best conferences in all of
college basketball.  
  
To be here is great. We move on to a new season. Celebration is over and now
it's time to go compete for a championship and play a really, really good
Louisville team.  
  
Q. Richard, of all the teams you could have played in the first game
here it's Louisville. What was your reaction when you saw that team in the
bracket opposite you?  
RICHARD PITINO: Well, I was wanting to know where we were playing. Location is
important to me. Then I wanted to know what day we were playing because we got
a little injury with Matz. I was hoping that we would play Friday. But other
than that it was more about okay, how does Louisville play? It's get to work.
Watch film on them. Put together a game plan.  
  
You know, all that other stuff didn't even really cross my mind to be honest.
It was doing my very best to put ourselves in a position to play a really good
Louisville team, a very well-coached Louisville team.  
  
Q. With Jordan Murphy, how has he picked your brain over the years to
try to become a better player, and how have you seen him do that?  
RICHARD PITINO: Jordan is a thinker. He's not one of those guys you yell and
scream at. He's analytical. You more need to talk to him about his game. Every
big guy in the country has an identity crisis. They want to be outside. They
want to be shooting threes. They want to do those things, and Murph did can do
that. He can shoot threes, but he knows where his bread is buttered. We've
talked about that. And we've told them not to deviate from where he is. Do
great at what you're good at. Obviously, with Murph it's a process of me and
him communicating all the time about where we can put him in a position to
succeed. He's a real coachable kid.  
  
Q. You picked up things from your dad along the way coaching in the
tournament. Have you picked up X's and O's or mentality? This team is good at
relaxing at this time of year. Was it more strategy or mentality you picked up
along the way?  
RICHARD PITINO: I would say the coaches you are around. The X and O part you
are going to do what you feel comfortable with, but it's that environment that
you take from and the culture that they build and the way they are at times
like this in March. I've been lucky to be around it, obviously, growing up my
whole life. As an assistant coach I was in several tournaments as well. You've
got to make it about the game. You've got to enjoy this. You've got to enjoy
the exposure and the spotlight being on your program. You've got to enjoy
these open practices, be in front of fans and to do these things. But then
you've got to make it about basketball. That's the biggest things. You've got
to execute. You've got to go tough. It's a single-elimination tournament, and
playing at this level in the Big Ten tournament we were able to get two wins
in single-elimination games. So I think we understand that part of it, but
we've also got new guys that haven't been here before. So that may be a new
adjustment period throughout the course of the game as well.  
  
Q. Your dad is not known for holding his tongue, but he has not tweeted
about this game. He has not texted as far as I know about this game. Has he
been asked to be quiet?  
RICHARD PITINO: Not by me. We spoke. Normally he would listen if I told him to
be quiet. I think you know better than that. No, I spoke to him once. He's in
Greece. Not easy to get ahold of people in Greece. We didn't talk much about
anything other than he asked about Matz, how he's doing, asked about the team.
At the end of the day my focus is totally on helping our team be put in a
position to succeed, not a whole lot else more than that.  
  
Q. When you talk about the job and I know you and Luke Murray are
friends. The job that they've done and that the staff has done and you knew
the guys and the job that Chris has done this season?  
RICHARD PITINO: It's been really good. Whenever you're bringing in fifth year
seniors. Do they have a true freshman on the roster? They don't. Obviously,
with them coming in here and scrapping together a pretty good roster,
obviously Jordan Juarez one of the most improved players in the country.
Offensively what they run is tough. Defensively very good and what Chris Mack
did at Xavier is phenomenal. I've got a lot of respect about what they do. I
think Chris does a terrific job. Luke is one of the best up-and-coming
assistant coaches in the country. I wouldn't be surprised if he gets a head
coaching job at some point soon. He is really, really connected. So all those
guys do a great job. I think Chris will win big there.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned mental toughness. Is this team tougher mentally
than any of your past teams and if the answer is yes, why?  
RICHARD PITINO: I think some of 'em are. You know, anytime you get whether
it's the Big Ten or any of these power conferences you need to try to stay old
to the best of your ability. It's hard to do with transfers and deflections
and so on, but when you got Michael Hurt, Jordan Murphy, Eric Curry, Dupree
McBrayer, guys like that who have played in the NCAA Tournament and who have
finished in the top 4 in the Big Ten, played on the road in the Big Ten, went
undefeated two years ago. Those are the guys that need to be the voices. The
other guys need to follow suite from there. That's what being part of a
winning program is about. You need guys in your locker room to step up and I
think we've got really good leadership in there. They don't get real
emotional. They're not too high, they're not too low. I try to be that way and
I think the personnel is as well. They go about their business. They're not
about a beat your chest type of team. You make a three you're not going to see
a bow and arrow. They're just going to get back on defense, and that's the way
I like it. They're a fun group to be around.  
  
Q. Coach, update us on Matz?  
RICHARD PITINO: We held him out yesterday, slowly coming back, getting a
little bit better. That will be a game-time decision, but he got popped pretty
good in that Purdue game. So we've got to make sure we're careful with him and
do what's best for him.  
  
Q. Jarvis has a unique role on your team. Talk about that?  
RICHARD PITINO: We did a military team building thing in the fall and you do a
bunch of team building exercises, and Jarvis, they've done the program for
seven or eight years and at the end of it they give an MVP t-shirt to the best
leaders and at the end of it Jarvis was one of the two best leaders. Crazy
good quality leadership. Played off and on. You would never know it. He is on
the bench, not afraid. We talked about vulnerability. Russell Westbrook is one
guy. He is not afraid to compete, and that's Jarvis. He is not afraid to be
emotional and pour himself into the team. He came in that game versus Michigan
and everybody was exhausted and he was like the Energizer bunny, because he
plays so hard. So I think his future is bright.  
  
Q. What has Matz meant to the team this year especially with Curry going
down?  
RICHARD PITINO: Curry does down right before the Purdue game and Matz hadn't
played a lot. He played in the nonconference and did some good things. But
with Curry going down Matz comes into the game with 7 blocks, 9 rebounds, 6
points, and changed the game. That's what being part of a team is all about,
being ready to go, not feeling sorry for yourself when you don't play. He's a
terrific, terrific kid. He's been a valuable member of the team. He's never
pouted and never felt sorry for himself. That's what being a team member is
all about, being ready when your number is called. It's crucial. We will
hopefully have him back tomorrow and I don't know if we will or not, hopefully
he gets healthy more than anything.  
  
Q. I know earlier this week you said this isn't about you versus
Louisville, but as you get closer to the game how do you control those
emotions and make sure they don't seep into your preparation?  
RICHARD PITINO: As you get closer, more and more it's about the game. It's
been that way from day one. I think when you see Louisville pop up you are
more about okay, what am I going to say to the media? How am I going to lie to
the media? I think you have to be prepared for those questions. But from an
emotional standpoint when you play in the Big Ten there are so many emotional
games. I learned that. I'm only 36. As a young head coach you have to keep
your emotions in check. I think I do a pretty decent job of that but that ball
goes up and I'm watching film and I'm watching Louisville play, it's not about
who the name on the front of the jersey is. I'm watching a really good team
Louisville, a well-prepared team with a lot of talent, and how can I put
myself into a position to beat them and I know it's going to be difficult.  
  
Q. For Johnson, it's been a complex path over the last four years for
him. He had a big moment on senior night. What has he brought to the team?  
RICHARD PITINO: Jarvis Johnson was an important recruit for me when I got to
the Twin Cities. He was a fringe guard. We thought he would fit us well. The
cool thing about Jarvis is he signed with a third year head coach, to believe
in me and when he's been here he's provided unbelievable leadership. He is a
voice in the locker room, regardless of the fact that he plays and he talked
about the right things. He's been appreciative. His family has been
appreciative. You don't always get that as well, so he's been a very, very
valuable member of our program and unfortunately hasn't been able to play. But
we all see the big picture and we are happy that he's going to be able to
graduate.  
  
Q. NCAA was asked if anybody in the room said, "Is this a good idea to
match Louisville and Minnesota," chose not to comment. What is your thought on
that? Should this game have been played or should they have found a way to
match you with somebody else?  
RICHARD PITINO: I don't have a whole lot of opinion on it because when I'm
sitting there Selection Sunday I'm looking around. I'm excited about the fact
that I know we're in the NCAA Tournament. I'll play whoever. I'm excited.
There is not one part of me that isn't 1000% honored, appreciative, humbled by
the fact that we're in the NCAA Tournament. It's a hard tournament to go to,
only 19% of our college basketball teams get to go to it. So you never are
going to hear me ever complain about anything that we play. Like I said, I got
tons of respect for their program. Their coaching staff does a really good
job. So I'm going to be very, very excited tonight leading up to this game and
tomorrow. Doesn't matter who we play. I'm just grateful for the opportunity.  
  
Q. You mentioned Jordan, but also Steven Enoch and Malik Williams and
other guys that can step out and hit the three. How do they affect the game?  
RICHARD PITINO: The way that they play is a coaches dream. We've got five guys
that can step out and shoot. Malik can knock down a shot. Enoch is so big down
low and the fact that he could hit a three is a different dimension as well,
and anytime you have pick-and-pop and pick-and-roll, I think we've got really
good personnel. I think Chris does a good job of putting them in the right
spots to put you in a bind and make you make decisions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Welcome student-athletes from Nevada Wolf Pack, Caleb Martin,
Cody Martin and Jazz Johnson. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. For both the Martin twins, what's your first memory of Jalen, and how
well do you know his game going into the contest?  
CALEB MARTIN: We're really close with Jalen, our first memory is playing an
AAU team loaded with him and I forget exactly we met, but I just know that our
coach used to call him a primadonna all the time, because he has to get going.
He is at his own pace. He's a relaxed, chill dude and it would take him a few
minutes to get going in the first half, but once he did he was really smooth.
He was dabbing lose balls and really gritty, so they didn't understand how
Jalen worked at first. That's our guy. As soon as he saw the name pop up that
we were playing us, he sent me emojis, me and Cody, and I've been talking to
him throughout the year and that's my boy. I got a lot of love for him, but
whenever we play we can't be friends.  
  
CODY MARTIN: Same thing, remember him from AAU, feels like forever ago. He's a
pro. He's got size. He's athletic. He can really play, can shoot the ball
well. I don't know, I think it's going to be really, really fun and it's going
to be really competitive and we haven't got to see him in a while. The last
time we saw him was going through the process of the NBA workouts. It's been
nice to keep in touch throughout the season and we got a little text and it's
going to be good to see him and once we get on the court all that goes out the
window. Somebody's gotta win.  
  
Q. For Jazz and either Cody or Caleb, Jordan Caroline, how is he as a
teammate, to hangout with, something about his personality?  
JAZZ JOHNSON: I'm really close with Jordan. He's goofy, an incredible
teammate. He's really all about the team trying to make sure everybody is
good, morale is high. He's the jokester on the team, him and Trey. But he's
overall a really fun guy to be around.  
  
CALEB MARTIN: Really good dude to be around, really funny, see him on the
court, get-after-it type of dude and really play-angry type of guy. But off
court he's a good dude, man. He's one of the best teammates I could ask for
and just really goofy, like Jazz said, brings a good vibe, a good energy.
Really good dude to be around. Couldn't ask for anything better, honestly.  
  
CODY MARTIN: When he's on the court, he looks mean and aggressive, but he's a
lot more outgoing than people think. A lot of people don't get to see the
other side of him, rather than being on the court, just what they see on TV.
He's outgoing. He's funny. Love having him around. He's always a good time.  
  
Q. Seniors, how have your past NCAA Tournament experiences, how will
that help you this week and what's it like with your last chance going around
this time?  
CALEB MARTIN: Always being in a tournament like this, it's always good to
experience this no matter how it goes from previous times being here. It just
helps you with knowing that the main thing coming to this tournament is
keeping your composure. You just don't know how the crowd will be or how the
game will go or anything like that because everyone is playing their best at
this time of year. You can expect guys that you might not expect to be playing
well can come out and be a spark for other teams and same thing for your team.
Guys who might have had a slow start to the year could be one of the biggest
factors of advancing to the tournament.  
  
It's one of those things you expect the unexpected, at least try your best to
and keep a level head no matter how the game is going.  
  
CODY MARTIN: I think the biggest thing learning from my past experience is
don't make it bigger than it actually is and just realize that it's just
another game and you've been playing basketball all season. I think sometimes
when you build it up in your head and you try to play different you do things
different and you approach it different, rather than the same thing you've
been doing all season. Because at the end of the day we're all going out there
with the same teammates. You're playing the same steps and the same way. I
think it's having a consistent approach so you don't try to do too much.  
  
I think a lot of our experience and how old are guys are is going to play a
big part in how we do consistency-wise and having that experience on our side
and understanding that consistency is the biggest thing for us and having that
mindset and that approach will benefit us in the long run.  
  
Q. For the twins, you are on a team with a lot of transfers. You
transferred yourself, a lot of experience. What's it like being on a team with
so much experience and so many players who came from other schools?  
CALEB MARTIN: Like you said, experience in college basketball is everything. I
learned that quickly my freshman year at NC State getting to play in the
tournament, we got to go to the Sweet 16 that year, too. So I got to see how
much experience played a role in advancing to this type of tournament and
winning games in general. One thing I will say for our team even though we do
have a lot of experience it's a lot of guys' first time in this tournament. So
when it comes to this tournament we don't have that much experience and things
are played a little bit differently and guys on other teams play a lot better.
It's one of the things we're learning on the fly. It's a lot of guys' first
times here, so it's one of those things we're going to have grow up and learn
really quickly how things are going to go from the tip and you don't really
have too much time to prepare.  
  
So just trying to, you know, I think our staff does a great job of preparing
us to the best of their ability and they do a really great job of letting us
know the realm of things, what's going to go on, and I think we will be
prepared really well for it.  
  
CODY MARTIN: I think experience is going to be really, really good for us. We
have a lot of older guys that's been in a lot of games, played in a lot of
games.  
  
I think, you know, playing obviously in a tournament like this is huge. But I
think it ties back to just being consistent and having the same approach and
just understand that it's basketball at the end of the day. Our team and our
staff approaches every game like it's a championship. So us being in an
environment like this, obviously there is a lot more eyes and people watching.
But at the end of the day we're playing basketball. It's a lot different from
having a freshman who has been in there and throwing them in a fire like this
than older guys who have played basketball for a long time and have a lot of
games under their belt and throwing them into an environment like this it's
nothing new. It's basketball at the end of the day, and we just, you know,
play like we've been playing all season and just try to figure out a way to
get it done.  
  
Q. Jazz, how is it for you coming into a new program and have you been
able to fill the expectations that you had for yourself?  
JAZZ JOHNSON: It's been a really fun experience, honestly. I had a lot of
questions coming in, obviously and you know a lot of doubts but, you know,
through working hard and staying in the gym and talking to my teammates,
talking to Cody, Caleb, Jordan, guys who have obviously been through it. It's
really just an eye opener. Especially, you know, being in a tournament like
this, I ask a lot of questions not as of recent, but during my sit-out year
and throughout the season I would ask Cody and Caleb and JC a lot of questions
about the tournament, what it's like and like they were saying, we do have a
lot of older guys. I think the biggest thing is just for, you know, for the
guys like me who it's our first time it's important for us to learn as much as
we can and try to get that experience through talking to them, instead of, you
know, because we didn't have the be opportunity to be in the tournament
ourselves. So a lot of it comes from being curious and asking those hard
questions in order to figure out what it's really like.  
  
Q. Cody, obviously this team doesn't have one big-time scorer, but six
guys that score 8 points per game. You're the defensive anchor for this team.
Who is the guy that you have to stop when you look at the head of the snake to
defend them? 1CODY MARTIN: Like you said, there is not one person you can key
on because at the all score the ball really well and they share the ball. They
do a great job of actually everyone getting a touch, everyone being able to
have that green light. So that's what kinda makes them dangerous, so there is
not one person we can key on. It's going to be a team effort on our part. It's
not going to be one person that we can single out and try to double team or
whatever the case is. We're going to have to play and a lot of them are really
great scorers and they can go one-on-one ball a lot of times.  
So it's going to be our job as a group and a whole to be able to help each
other out at the same time. Just realistically just have the same principles
we have had all season when it comes to playing defense and they do a great
job of rebounding. They're a really great team, so we're going to have to be
prepared when it comes to their offensive game and we're going to have to have
to play all thirty seconds and make sure we end it with a rebound.  
  
Q. Jazz, a very good defense team in Florida, top 15 in the nation. What
do they do so well on that side of the ball that has given SEC opponents
troubles?  
JAZZ JOHNSON: You have to credit Hayes, one of the top shot blockers in
history, and he's down there and they do a great job of packing the paint and
to hold teams to 63 points a game. For them to be in the SEC that's a major
accomplishment. It's just really important that, you know, we key in on what
we can do and we figure out what we can do to score because that's what makes
them who they are. They play defense and they make sure they crash the boards
and rebound and they defend at a high level.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen. We're pleased to welcome head coach Eric
Musselman of the Nevada Wolf Pack. Coach, welcome to Des Moines.  
  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Thank you, appreciated it. Well, we're excited to play a
40-minute game tomorrow against a really well-coached Florida team that has a
lot of weapons and I think our guys are in a good physical spot right now and
we look forward to the challenge.  
  
Q. You're undefeated in the nonconference, beat some good teams then you
go to New Mexico and get thumped. How did you turn that around and what was
the mindset there?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Well, we did get thumped, and it happens in college
basketball. It happens in the NBA. It happens in the NFL. It happens in
college football. That's the one game that we felt like, you know, we weren't
in the game so to speak. Our other losses we felt like a couple missed shots,
block out here, we could have won. But that was the one game we played really
bad.  
  
I think for our guys they did a phenomenal job. There was a lot of preseason
hype and our guys it did an incredible job in nonconference. We got to
conference play, played in a lot of sold-out buildings. It's been a learning
experience all year for all of us because court stormings has been the thing
the last year and a half when we have lost. It happened last year at Wyoming
and you know some of our guys, the coaching staff, it's been new to have that.
But I think our guys to be 29-4. Look everybody in college basketball has a
goal. How do you get to the NCAA Tournament? Doesn't matter if you're coaching
in the Big Ten or playing in the ACC it's how do you get to this tournament.
We're here and we're looking forward to playing a really, really good
basketball team tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jordan Caroline was telling us he feels like a 10 out of 10, very
fresh. How crucial were those six days off for the injury he was dealing
with?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think Jordan is in a great spot from a physical standpoint.
He was held out, like I said, off the Mountain West for precautionary reasons
because of the fact that he did feel like he had a lingering injury. So we
felt that was the best decision at the time because we certainly would not
have wanted to come into this situation minus a player of his caliber.  
  
Not always easy decisions, but I think as a coach, as a program, you've got to
make the best decision for a student-athlete and then you always think long-
term and short-term goals and you gotta think about what's in the best
interest of everybody, so that was in the best interest.  
  
Q. Continuing on Jordan, what has he meant to your program through his
career and the players were talking about how he's kind of goofy, maybe keeps
people loose. How important has that been?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: Jordan is one of the first players I recruited the first year
at Nevada. He sat out and it was a player development year. Some of the things
we talked about on his recruiting visit were, how do we improve his perimeter
skills? How do we improve him as a three-point shooter? He came to us as an
undersized five man at his prior university and this year he's been a small
forward for us. There's not many players in the country. Last year, 24 hours
from now he was guarding Mo Bamba and fronting him at his size and battling
for rebounds, and now he's a small forward for us. So he's made a dramatic
shift in his game from a versatility standpoint as is Cody Martin. A year ago,
Cody Martin was our starting power forward and now he's our are starting point
guard. I'm really proud of the development that a lot of our guys have had in
a very short time frame.  
  
Q. Your team has had a lot of transfers. Why have you made that a
cornerstone in Nevada?  
ERIC MUSSELMAN: I think, number one, it's the nature of our society. My son
played on about fifteen different AAU teams. Guys are unhappy with their
roles. They go to a new AAU team. Guys are playing at three, four different
high schools now. When many of us in this room were growing up, nobody
transferred from any college, not a student, and not student-athletes. Right
now there's already 320-some guys in the portal as of this morning and we're
still playing basketball. I don't think it's just Nevada. I think you look at
some great, historical programs that now have grad transfers or transfers. But
we had to find a niche. We wanted to be as good as we could as quick as could
but yet have sustainability. So we took kind of an NBA format. We looked at
high school guys kind of as draft pick and transfers as like an NBA free agent
as we tried to put the pieces together. Sometimes it gets lost, the freshmen
that we brought in because Lindsey Drew and Cameron Oliver were part of our
first class and they were freshmen and we rolled with them and played them a
ton of minutes but certainly our roster is full of transfers.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome the student-athletes from Louisville,
Jordan Nwora and Christen Cunningham. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Christen, is this what you envision the when you decided to come to
Louisville? The projections were 11th in the ACC and all that. Did you think
the NCAA Tournament was attainable?  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, my number one goal when I came to the University of
Louisville was to be able to compete for a national title and I thought we
could make the tournament from day one. So it feels good to finally achieve it
and be here.  
  
Q. This may sound like a simple question, but how did you guys get here?
Not many expected you here in March. What is it about this group that has
allowed you guys to make it here?  
JORDAN NWORA: You know, getting here I think it's just us working hard and
being tough, so really just working hard, being tough, listening to what Coach
Mack and the coaching staff has preached to us all year and because of that
sticking together and because of that we won a few games and did well in the
ACC which got us here.  
  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: I would say similar. We were a resilient group. We had a
really tough schedule. We knew that coming into the year, but we took the
motto of being stronger together and unbreakable and we used being 11th as a
chip on our shoulder for motivation and knew what we wanted to achieve.  
  
Q. Coach Mack is known for using negative motivation to fuel you guys.
Has the whole Minnesota-Pitino angle been played out in practice or privately
among you players and with the coaching staff as a source of motivation?  
JORDAN NWORA: No, we haven't really talked about that at all, actually. We're
just worried about playing Minnesota. Coach Pitino was here and now it's Coach
Mack and we know that Minnesota has Coach Pitino's son, but we haven't talked
about that. Minnesota is our focus going into tomorrow and doing our best that
we can to win the game.  
  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: For sure. It's kind of a sexy story line for the media,
but as far as our program is concerned, we are worried about beating Minnesota
and advancing. It's not about any name that's associated with the school. It's
just about players going out there and making plays.  
  
Q. What is the biggest thing that stands out about Minnesota to you
guys? What do they do really well? They're a team that's won a few straight.
What stands out to you?  
JORDAN NWORA: Probably their big guards. Coffey is a really good player, and
obviously Jordan is a great player, too, double-double machine. They can beat
you up in the post. We're going to have to be physical with them, too, and
just do our best against that.  
  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, they're a really physical team. Bigger guards and
some really physical guys in the post. So we understand what they bring to the
table. We just gotta match their intensity in the paint.  
  
Q. I know you're not supposed to look ahead, but you've already beat
Michigan State. When you saw this bracket did you think this is a really good
route for us? Really good draw? Either one?  
JORDAN NWORA: I mean, everything is going to be tough, no matter where you are
in the bracket. Every team at this point in the year is going to be good.
They're here for a reason. Right now we're not even looking ahead to Michigan
State. Michigan State has to play Bradley first, so we're not even worried
about that. Worried about playing Minnesota. They're not going to be somebody
we're going to go in and trounce by 20. We've to play hard and do our best to
beat those guys first, and then we will worry about the game after that. It's
going to be tough regardless of who we play, but right now we're just worried
about getting past Minnesota.  
  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: I don't think we have looked ahead to Michigan State at
all. Obviously, we played them earlier in the year. But I would probably say I
know we're a much different team that played them and I'm positive they're
probably a much different team as well. But like Jordan said, we are focused
on Minnesota. Gotta take it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Christen, what did you anticipate your role to be when you
transferred to Louisville? What were you looking to provide on the court?  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: I knew right away I was going to be a guy who would come
in and provide leadership for this team. They had a lot of talented players
but not a lot of experience. So that was one thing I wanted to come in and do
is try to be a leader on and off court. As far as on the court just be a
playmaker. I got a ton of great players around me, really talented. I knew it
would be my job to put them into position where they could be successful.  
  
Q. Jordan, you are the most improved player in the ACC. What do you
attribute that to?  
JORDAN NWORA: Just a lot of hard work in the off season, Coach Mack and my
teammates pushing me and being in the weight room over the summer and also
this summer playing overseas, boosting my confidence, being able to do well
over there translated to being able to do well, here, too. From there, just a
confidence thing, keeping that and staying in rhythm.  
  
Q. There are so many teams in the NCAA Tournament, but you guys get the
first game of the day. Does that up the ante knowing that all eyes are going
to be on you guys to kick this off?  
JORDAN NWORA: I think it ups the ante, kicking this thing off. But like I said
earlier, we're already hyped enough for this first game. A lot of guys, it's
their first time being in the tournament, and we just wanting to out and show
everybody what basketball is all about.  
  
CHRISTEN CUNNINGHAM: It's definitely cool to be the first game of the
tournament and everybody is going to be watching. But also the flip side is if
we don't bring it we could be the first team out of the tournament. So we are
going to use it both ways. But, yeah, it's something we are looking forward
to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
We are joined by Louisville head Coach, Chris Mack. Coach, welcome.  
  
CHRIS MACK: Thank you. Glad to be here, and obviously a big challenge here
tomorrow against a very physical opponent in Minnesota, and, you know, it's
odd to be the first game of the tournament. But that's how the draw works. So
we're excited to be in Des Moines and start off the tournament.  
  
Q. Chris, this is the first game of the tournament. There are a lot of
people that think this match-up was designed for ratings or story lines or
that. As you process all that, A, what do you believe along those lines; and,
B, have you used some of the perceptions about it as motivational fuel for
your players?  
CHRIS MACK: I haven't even talked about it with our players. I just feel like
it's such a special experience to make the NCAA Tournament for a few of our
guys for the very first time and only time in their career. So to focus on
anything other than trying to be at our best against a really good Minnesota
team I think would be robbing them of the experience of being here.  
  
You know, I don't mind, and I understand why media are going to ask about it.
But here is the thing: I took over for a Hall of Fame coach. I get that. He's
a terrific coach. I asked him his advice on Louisville when I took over the
program, and he was nothing but gracious to me. But this is about the players
and the coaches' experience in the tournament and that's it. It's no more than
that. I think the Committee could have probably had a little bit more self-
awareness so we don't have to be up here answering these type of questions and
focusing on the student-athletes and the coaches' experience and the fan
base's experience, but, you know, I can't control that.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of people haven't seen you play very much this year.
They're going to see you play tomorrow. For people who aren't familiar with
your team, how would you describe this particular group, what they've done to
get here?  
CHRIS MACK: That's a great question. I feel like we're a resilient group.
We've been through a lot. I think we're a very together group. Sometimes that
may not come out on the floor in terms of making the right play or being at
our best, but the intention has always been clear with our group. We are a
very, very together group, a close-knit group. It's no secret that when I took
over there wasn't the greatest light around the program. I told our players in
the very beginning when I met with them that they weren't the cause for it,
but they could certainly be the cure for it. I think anybody that's watched us
play this year, I've asked our players to be this way. I want fans or people
that watch our team to say, wow, those guys play hard. They play together.
They play the right way. We haven't been perfect, but I'm really proud of our
group because they've done that all year long and that's all you can ask for
as a coach.  
  
Q. You've acclimated yourself to the Gophers. How much has Jordan Murphy
stood out and to be 6'5 " or 6'6" to be able to produce?  
CHRIS MACK: He's that short? I haven't been next to him, so I don't know that.
But he looks like he's 6'11" on film. He's very, very strong. I think like all
great players he knows who he is. He has an identity in terms of how he plays
and he doesn't try to get outside that identity. You know, you hear him in his
interviews. You can tell he's really smart. He would be a great leader. I
mean, to be where he's at in the history of the Big Ten rebounding the ball
says a lot about the type of player and the will that he has. We're going to
have to do it collectively. Some teams in the Big Ten have put their 5 on him.
I've seen him seek and destroy 4's and 5's, so we have to be able to do it as
a team. He jumps out on film. Like a lot of teams that make this tournament,
he's not their own threat, not even close. He's just a part of their machine.  
  
Q. Not to look ahead, but the first Michigan State game was kind of a
breakthrough for your program. I think people perceive that you were further
ahead maybe than they expected. In your own mind, did you see this potential
that early? What told you that this had the makings of a tournament team?  
CHRIS MACK: Yeah, this will have nothing to do with who is on the other side
of our pairing or bracket because we're not naive enough to think that we're
going to get past Minnesota. We're focused on trying to play the Gophers. I
really had this belief in the summer when I worked with our players I saw
their work ethic up close, their skill level. I saw the strides they were
making, and I think they all, and I'm talking about our players, they all
became a little bit more believers in themselves when we went to New York and
played in the Barkley's, and even though they didn't win two games I remember
Mike DeCourcy saying if Louisville doesn't play bad and doesn't get decimated
by Tennessee or Marquette, which was a valid point from an outsider's
perspective early in the season.  
  
But we played Tennessee tooth and nail and the last five minutes couldn't
score against their zone, and then we had Marquette. We had control virtually
up to the last two games and I don't feel like anybody in our locker room felt
like we played perfect in either of those. So when we left we felt like we
could have done the job, should have done the job. Now we have to figure out
what we need to do to win those type of games.  
  
Q. Chris, you have so few players who have done any of this at the NCAA
level. They haven't been through any of the trappings of the tournament. What
kind of a challenge is there beyond that?  
CHRIS MACK: It's basketball, and we try to be the same people whether we're in
the practice facility at Drake today, at the Yum! Center or Chapel Hill,
doesn't matter, you could point to all kinds of teams. UMBC last year I don't
think they had ever been to a NCAA Tournament. It's not a rock in a sling
shot. It's basketball. We have to be prepared like we are every game, and then
we have to try to go execute that game plan to the best of our ability against
a really good team.  
  
Q. When your team has been good, it's done some pretty special things
against some really good teams, maybe not for forty minutes. When you look at
that, is that kinda the upside for this team? Are they that much above their
heads or is it a matter of them getting to that more consistently?  
CHRIS MACK: I tell our team all the time that we don't have to be perfect.
Nobody that we play is going to be perfect. It's not going to require a
perfect effort to win or a perfect game plan. It's just our effort and our
energy and our resiliency. Those things have to be perfect. Those things have
to be perfect. You might miss a shot, might miss a free throw, turn the ball
over. But our effort and our energy needs to be better than our opponent's,
and it needs to be consistent each and every night. That's hard. That's hard
to do for a long stretch of games from October all the way through now. That's
very difficult. A lot of teams can't do it. I think our team has done a great
job of that. We're not always, again, perfect, but I think we've done our
part.  
  
Q. A lot of the teams that are seeded 1 or 2 are familiar to you,
ridiculously so --  
CHRIS MACK: I would like to thank Kenny Klein for that scheduling.  
  
Q. What is the value at this point in the season for having gone through
that gauntlet?  
CHRIS MACK: I know our players feel as though there won't be a team that we'll
face where we will wonder whether we can compete with them or not. I think
there are a lot of teams that come into this tournament that say, hey, we want
to win some games. But, man, if we're matched up against a few teams can we
really play with those guys and give ourselves a chance to win? I know our
group feels like we can because we have been. We've been forced to because of
our schedule. We have come out on the short end of the stick, and there is a
reason why they are the best teams in the country. One of the teams we played,
I believe, will be holding a National Championship trophy if it's not us.
That's the type of schedule we have played. I think it should give our guys
great confidence if we stay within ourselves and play with great energy and do
what we work on every single day, that would be good enough to keep us there
down the stretch to win a game.  
  
Q. If it's not you, who?  
CHRIS MACK: I don't know. It could be different teams on different nights.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Tom Izzo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13984)

### [Matt McQuaid](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36910)

### [Cassius Winston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34730)

  
_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome student-athletes from Michigan State, Cassius
Winston and Matt McQuaid. Questions for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. Matt, you came here four years ago a skinny kid who can could shoot
the ball and basically all we thought you could shoot ball and now you're one
of the most feared defenders in the Big Ten. Every time you put on that
uniform now it could be your last. What's going through your head? Describe
your feelings?  
MATT McQUAID: I definitely have more of a sense of urgency, you know? I love
playing with this group. I love my teammates. They're like my brothers, you
know, close group. I'm going into every day trying to cherish every minute,
every second I have with these guys and just taking it one day at a time.  
  
Q. You guys getting Bradley as a 15-seed. What have you seen on film in
the last couple of days of the way they play?  
MATT McQUAID: They got a lot of really good shooters, and they're solid in the
paint. They run their offense really well. They even get out in transition.
They've got a lot of tough match-ups and run their offense really well.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Like Matt said, they're a solid team. They don't have a lot
of flaws, good guard play, good inside play. So this is a really good team and
we've got to play to the best of our abilities to beat 'em.  
  
Q. Bradley is a team that was down 18 in their conference tournament and
battled back to win. How do you deal with a team that doesn't go away even if
they're down?  
MATT McQUAID: They're definitely a relentless team. They finished their
conference strong. We just gotta be ready and come out with a sense of
urgency, knowing they're not going to quit the whole game and staying on our
toes until the end of forty minutes is up.  
  
CASSIUS WINSTON: Definitely. They're going to play their best, you know?
They're going to fight the whole time and we gotta be ready, you know? We
can't be lackadaisical, anything like that. We've got to come out and play
with energy and come out and play with heart.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, gentlemen.  
  
We would like to welcome Michigan State head Coach, Tom Izzo. Coach, welcome
to Des Moines.  
  
TOM IZZO: You made it sound impressive. I wish I felt that way. Thanks for
having us. It's been great so far. We got in yesterday and looking forward to
the game. Bradley, any team that starts out 0-5 in the league and finds a way
to win 10 out of 12, win their tournament, beat a team that was in a Final
Four last year and had a lot of players back in Loyola, got guards that can
shoot it. Brown and Kennell can shoot it from long range and that's always the
worry against a lower seed against a higher seed is a three-point shot. I've
seen nights where they've made a ton of them from long, long rage, we're going
to have to do a good job of defending that. They want to run. We want to run.
We're adjusting without Kyle. He was 18, 20 minutes a game, and he will be not
with us. He's with us, but dragging a damn boot around instead of tennis
shoes. So just the way it is.  
  
I think, in general, when you get to this time of year, I know from my career
every team is here for a reason, because they have had some type of success
and the excitement of getting into a NCAA Tournament will make teams better. I
know it will do that to our team and I'm sure it will do that to their team.  
  
Q. Tom, in 2007 you brought your team to Peoria to play against Bradley.
The all-time attendance record in that game for Carver Arena, which still
stands. What do you remember about that night? It was a close ball game. What
do you remember about it?  
TOM IZZO: I told Jimmy how stupid I was. Why would I come there to do that?
You know, and I don't mean that insultingly, I mean I know what kind of team
they were. I remember going to a luncheon that day and there were 400 or 500
people at the luncheon, and I was like, God, what did I get my hands into. It
was a great atmosphere. Peoria has had great basketball for 100 years it seems
like. I remember when it was stocked with high school players, kind of like
our Flint. There has been some fall off maybe because of companies leaving and
going and staying, but it's always been great.  
  
My college coach and Stan Albeck who was at Northern Michigan I used to hear
about Bradley forever back in those days. Rabid fans, great city, and Brian
has done a very good job with this team. You know, I think they're building it
back to where it needs to be.  
  
Q. This is a little bit of a homecoming for Jack Hoiberg, and I know
he's in the locker room. What has he been like for the guys in the locker room
even though he's only been there a couple of years now?  
TOM IZZO: I love Jack Hoiberg. I was a walk-on in college and things turned
out for me okay at a Division II school. Different level, but it looked like
Jack was going to go play golf. But I don't know what made Fred, his mom
Carol, come over and I think there were a couple of guys on his staff at
Michigan State and he came over and wanted to be a walk-on. I hope it was a
great thing for him, but if you know Jack Hoiberg at all, as a worker, as a
student, he's making himself as a player. Like a lot of guys, he is too small
for this, too slow for that. He has been one of the best scout team players
we've had. We talked about it and redshirted him for the first year and I
think he's a kid I questioned whether he could play at this level early on. I
told his dad a couple of years ago I think he can play at this level. And
what's he like in the locker room? Last year he got along with everybody and
those were the super stars. This year I don't have as many super stars, but he
gets along with everybody again. I think it's his background, his mom, his
dad, and his homecoming. He said he has a bunch of people coming. I couldn't
be more honored to coach a kid that does it in the classroom, on the court and
off court and with the work ethic he's done it with. Jack is a special player.
I bet you if you asked our players they wouldn't say we don't like Jack
Hoiberg, we love Jack Hoiberg.  
  
Q. Coach, when you started this annual March habit in this event, I
think it's '98 at Eastern Michigan and Princeton?  
TOM IZZO: Good memory!  
  
Q. I looked it up.  
TOM IZZO: Good honesty! With a bad memory! (Laughter.)  
  
Q. I have a really good memory, but I looked it up. I want to know what
you remember from just this point, the day before, maybe, or the week before
that and maybe how you might critique that coach?  
TOM IZZO: That was a weird year, you know? The year started 5-4. We had gotten
beat by I think Central Michigan and U of D, and I think they were talking
about firing me seriously and then we went on a run and won the next 18 of 22
and it was my first NCAA Tournament as a head coach and we played Eastern
Michigan and they were really good. We won that and had to play Princeton and
we started kind of what I do now, 20-minute segments, get up, 20 minute
segments on Princeton, have breakfast, another 20 minutes on Princeton. I
understood the attention span, and that was pre-Twitter. Now we have four-
minute meetings, and it's changed a little bit since Twitter has evolved.  
  
But we found a way to beat them and that first memory I have about that
weekend is right before the end of the half. Princeton was notorious for
backdoor plays and we ran one on them and found a way to beat them and then
went down and North Carolina took care of us. It was great start and I think
anytime your first game in this tournament, although sometimes it still feels
like my first game in the tournament, I just have a better idea of how to get
the hotel and the tickets and everything. But the excitement of the
tournament, I don't think it's ever changed for me. I love March. I love the
tournament. I love the way it goes. I love playing in games and I love
watching other games. I don't know what the second half of that was, but the
first half was I got a lot of memories of that and I don't have to look 'em
up. But I appreciate them still to this day, 22 years later.  
  
Q. Kind of following up on that a little bit, to what extent do you do
the job of telling some of your kids in the program who are about to
experience this one and done atmosphere for the first time. What part do you
play in helping to explain to them what it's like versus how much you rely on
veteran players to tell their teammates that from a player perspective?  
TOM IZZO: I'm starting to realize more and more, you know, as we all get
older, we're in this weird profession where our clientele are always 17 to 22.
So I think it helps to have other people telling them, you know? I've been
blessed at our place. We've been at one and done mode for about three weeks
now, when you think about it. We had to win so many games to win the Big Ten
Can championship, and then Magic coming back to Steve Smith, and I would
always ask them to talk to our guys. Then I would ask the Tum Tums, Jaren
Jacksons, and Myles did a good job calling guys and telling them how to deal
with those pressures. Then you get in the Big Ten tournament and you've got to
win 3 and I think we have more practice now of being one and done and we
haven't experienced what it means to lose and that's a good thing. But I try
to tell my freshmen there are different pressures, the "my bads" go out the
door because one "my bad" and we're going home.  
  
So I try to explain it, but that's where Matt McQuaid and Kenny Goines are
really helpful because he's been in the Final Four, and I think our guys know
what's at stake.  
  
Q. Tom, I wanted to ask you about the merits and the pitfalls of winning
the conference tournament going into this because your teams have done it both
ways. I'm wondering if winning the conference tournament can make guys maybe a
little complacent or overconfident going into the first couple of rounds or
whether maybe losing in a conference tournament can scare your team in a
productive way?  
TOM IZZO: Coaches are great creatures of habit and if we lose I'm going to say
that damn conference tournament and if we win I'm going to say that real good
conference tournament gave us a boost. You've got to have an excuse if you're
a head coach, so I play it both ways. But what I really believe, this is new
territory for me. Ninety percent of the tournament games I think we played on
Friday, 90% of the 22 games, I believe we have. I'm not proactive. We picked a
year where we're on a Thursday and we won the conference tournament. Is that
harder? Of course it's harder, but it also, there is momentum that you gain
from that, you know? The one thing I don't have, and I really don't worry
about it much in my program. We play such a good schedule every year I've been
there and usually we get the brains beat out of us by a couple of people. So
that big ego, thinking we're better than we are, you know, Indiana who didn't
make the tournament beat us twice. So we're not very cocky in that respect,
but I think when you do win you do get a little confidence. I think because of
the players that come back and explain to the guys what it is like. A lot of
writers three years ago who got beat by Middle Tennessee thought we looked
past them. We shot 50% from the field and 50% from the three. They just shot
above us. They just played better than us. We got in foul trouble. We had an
injury in that game to Kenny Goines, the match-up. They just beat us, and
there wasn't been many times I've worried about us looking past the team or
thinking we are better than somebody because that's something I try to do
every single day of my life. Never forget where I came from and never forget
those tragic losses, but never forget those exhilarating wins either. It's
just all part of the deal. I don't believe we are going to be looking past
anybody. I worry about fatigue because of the injuries and playing Sunday
night and getting home at 11:30 and all the things we went through. But cocky
or too confident, or go the other way, as you say, man, they came to this
program to try to win a championship. They signed up for that the day they
signed up and the goals and the rules have never changed. When we're down and
out they don't change, and when we are really good they don't change. When we
are not so good they don't change. This year's team has been consistent, if
you look at our offense and defense, and hopefully that will carry us through
here and win a game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Off track here, but Iowa State is just down the road, and they're
going to play an Ohio State team you're familiar with. What should people
around here expect from that team?  
TOM IZZO: Ohio State is a very good team. They had Wesson out for a while and
early injuries, but Wesson is a monster. He got in foul trouble, he's 6'10",
two whatever, but their guards are starting to play a little bit better. They
had a fifth year kid in there. They're athletic. They guard pretty well. Chris
is a very, very good coach. So I think it will be an hell of a match-up
because I've got a chance to see Iowa State on TV and Shayok was hurt for a
little while and he came back and he made a difference. So they both lost guys
and got 'em back. So it should be a heck of a game. Where is that game played
at?  
  
Q. Tulsa?  
TOM IZZO: Tulsa? It will be a good game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We would like to welcome the Montana Grizzlies. We have Bobby
Moorehead, Michael Oguine and Ahmaad Rorie. Questions for our student-
athletes?  
  
Q. What are your thoughts being in Des Moines, and how does it feel this
time around as opposed to last year in Wichita?  
AHMAAD RORIE: It feels real good. Travel was good. It's a blessing just being
able to be out here again for a second year in a row. We're coming out here
prepared so we had a good practice today and just been trying to get a lot of
rest. So it feels good having some downtime and be able to have some fun.  
  
MICHAEL OGUINE: It feels similar to Wichita, the last site we were at. I'm
sure there are going to be a lot of fans here, neutral fans enjoying a good
game. So I'm looking forward to that and having a good time with my teammates.  
  
BOBBY MOOREHEAD: Excited to be here, second year in a row making the NCAA
Tournament. It's a dream come true. I think we're more focused, more locked in
and ready to get after it.  
  
Q. Guys, part of the winningest two-year stretch in school history. What
are you most proud of in your Grizzly career?  
AHMAAD RORIE: Just being able to make it to the tournament twice in a row, win
two championships, and we have a group that has worked hard each year. With
that being said, just having this group that's, you know, been through a lot
of adversity but been able to achieve a lot as well.  
  
MICHAEL OGUINE: Just like Ahmaad said, getting to the tournament two years
that's been a big part of it, but also building something we could be proud
of, the people in the state are proud of and putting a product on the floor
people can enjoy and bringing enjoyment to the community is a special thing,
and I feel like we've been able to do that in our time.  
  
BOBBY MOOREHEAD: I'm proud of how much we've grown as a team over the last two
years. Like Ahmaad said, all the adversity, the championships are amazing, and
just going through everything with your brothers. Just to have these guys as
life-long friends is awesome.  
  
Q. You guys have grown up watching the tournament and watched upsets and
all that. What would it mean for you guys to be that darling, that upset
team?  
AHMAAD RORIE: It would mean a lot, you know, and I feel like we honestly have
the team with the potential to do that this year. We have a very old veteran
team and we've all been through a lot, prepared a lot. So I think just having
a good game plan, you know, and not really playing with pressure. I feel like
if we do that then we will be good. Just growing up watching a lot of games
it's been great to see teams go far that probably weren't supposed to go far.  
  
MICHAEL OGUINE: It would be a dream come true. Like Ahmaad said, growing up,
it's always fun to root for the underdogs, to pull off an upset is obviously
our goal. To do that it would mean a lot, for ourselves, for the team, for the
city, for everyone that supported us along the way that would mean a lot. So
that's the goal.  
  
BOBBY MOOREHEAD: We know there are going to be upsets every year, so why not
us? I believe and the rest of the guys on our team believe. So it would be a
dream come true. It would be awesome.  
  
Q. Ahmaad, this team is a strong defensive team and they're bigger than
you guys sizewise. When you approach the game, how do you look at the way to
run your offense against this team? They defend ball screens very well and
defend the three ball well. How do you approach this offensively?  
AHMAAD RORIE: I feel like we need to get out in transition. We don't do that
enough and when we do we score at a high rate and moving the ball side-to-
side, and I know all the shooters are going to be ready to shoot and getting
offensive rebounds. We have guys that are capable of getting rebounds. So if
we do those two things we'll be good.  
  
Q. Bobby, along those lines, matching up with their size, something
you're going to have to do personally. So what do you think about that match-
up going up against them?  
BOBBY MOOREHEAD: It's going to be tough. We've dealt with size issues a lot
this year, and it's going to be nothing new. I know their center is over 7
foot, so it's going to be a tough match-up. But it's been tough the whole
year, so we gotta get mentally prepared for it and do our best and I think
when we have played our hardest and our best this year things usually work
out. So that's what we're going to do. Just play our hardest.  
  
Q. What do you guys remember just from before tip-off as far as the
jitters of last year and being on this experience and the scene? How much do
you think it will be not as big this go-round?  
AHMAAD RORIE: Well, it was my second time going to the tournament. I went with
Oregon before, so I was familiar with it a little bit. But obviously playing a
different role on this team. But I kinda had a little bit of jitters but try
to relax, know that my team was well-prepared, and I think this year will be
my third time and everyone else's second. We'll just come out here and be
focused and try to win the game. I don't think it will be too big of a deal
being nervous.  
  
MICHAEL OGUINE: Last year the game got delayed a little bit, the game before
went to overtime. So that helped out with nerves. You had pregame nerves, but
watching that game going extended time, kind of were able to relax a little
bit and go out and play our game. Experience definitely helps with that, so I
don't anticipate that we will be as nervous. So it will be more like let's
take care of business and get this thing going and go from there.  
  
BOBBY MOOREHEAD: There were jitters last year all around. You're traveling on
a charter flight which we're not used to with a lot of people who aren't
normally in our normal travel crew. So there is a lot of different things
going on, a lot of hype going on. This is different. This year we expected it,
prepared for it and I think this year are more focused. So I don't think the
jitters will be there as much. Obviously, you're still playing on the biggest
stage in the country. But when one year under our belt and we truly believe
that's the difference.  
  
Q. Michael, Coach John Beilein mentioned how much better of a shooting
team you were last year missing shots being the difference in that game. What
do you think about the shooting team you have this year?  
MICHAEL OGUINE: It definitely makes us stronger, a better team, sustaining dry
spells. We had a really big dry spell last year against these guys that put us
in a deep hole. The improved shooting this year is definitely going to help us
stay in the game more. We're going to rely auto that and get open looks and
have confidence to knock 'em down when the time comes. So it's definitely
great to have this year as compared to last year.  
  
Q. You guys face plenty of adversity as you mentioned, couple low points
when you fall to Eastern Washington before the Northern Colorado game and you
were able to regroup. How much did this motivate you guys to get back to the
tournament although you had things going against you? How much did this moment
fuel you guys behind those closed door meetings?  
BOBBY MOOREHEAD: We have a one-game mentality, throughout the year we're not
looking toward March Madness, so for a small school like us it's tough to get
there. So you have to get through those losses and we believe what we are
capable of and we got away from those things we do, and once we got back on
track I believe that's when we started to believe we could do this again.  
  
MICHAEL OGUINE: We knew it wouldn't come down to a regular conference loss and
we had a bigger picture at hand and we said let's get through this point,
let's regroup, get better and be the best we can be when it's time for our
conference tournament so we can win three games in a row and get back here. So
that's what motivated us.  
  
AHMAAD RORIE: At that point we weren't playing that good of basketball. We
were able to regroup like they said and just knew that it would come back to
the three games in the tournament and we knew that we would be fine.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Gentlemen, best of luck. Thank you.  
  
Pleased to have with us the head coach of the Montana Grizzlies, Travis
DeCuire. Coach, welcome to Des Moines.  
  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: Thank you. It's a pleasure to be here. This is what it's all
about for these young men is an opportunity to perform on the biggest stage.
I'm sure they just expressed that to you. Kinda feels like Groundhog Day, a
lot of familiar faces. Hopefully a different outcome. We've got a lot of work
to do. This Michigan team is very good. I think a lot of people may expect to
see the same thing as far as teams go. But I think we have evolved in a
different direction. They're more wing dominant. We spread the floor and play
a little faster and put a few more points on the board. Should be an exciting
game tomorrow and once again just fortunate to be here.  
  
Q. Coach, what's going to be the keys to beating Michigan, and do you
have any ties to Iowa?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: No ties to Iowa. Michigan is a tough team to beat. They're
good on both sides of the ball, a lot like last year. I think John Beilein is
one of the few coaches that spends a lot of time on both sides of the ball,
most teams have an identity on either side. They defend as well as anyone in
the country, 28% from three. It is common to look up to teams in the 30s,
field goal percentage overall. We like to do the same thing. For us, it's
going to be containing Zavier Simpson. I think he's the one that creates a lot
of offense for the others, keeping him in the paint, slowing down the
transition, containing him in ball screens and trying to force the others to
make plays for each other.  
  
If we can get them a little out of sync, slow down their timing in offense
maybe we can force turnovers and see if we can get out in transition
ourselves. We want to score in the high 70s, low 80s, they keep the game in
the 60s. So I think the higher we can make the score the better off we will
be.  
  
Q. For your entire conference season, you were the ones at the top that
everyone was chasing. The position has switched, you are now the underdogs
going up against Michigan. How does that change your mentality for better or
worse?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: Well, we've had a few games like this year where. The bullseye
wasn't on our backs and those were the ones that our guys performed best at,
whether we were on the road or we found ourselves in the second or third in
the standings and we tried our best to get back to the top. We played with a
high level of desperation. I think for a rematch our guys will go into the
game the same way. Hopefully we will be hungrier and focus on the details and
play our best basketball.  
  
Q. Coach, last year you had the same starting lineup all season long and
this year it's been up and down, changes left and right. Going into this game
knowing that this lineup you've done a lot of small ball this year, do you
feel confident even though you've had so many changes this year?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: I do. I believe in these guys. I've got veterans in this
lineup. Sayeed Pridgett has played a lot of basketball as a junior. He's a
senior now. We've got a lot of older guys going on the floor. So with our
maturity we've been able to settle in through adversity. Right now I think
we're playing our best basketball, and hopefully we can continue to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, Coach Beilein said that compared to last year's team the way
you guys are different as far as spreading you out and matching the pace, it's
hard to defend. We've heard a lot of Big Sky coaches say those same things. So
how do you think match-upwise it will be different than last year and maybe
you can exploit some of that?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: We ran into a brick wall last year. We were post dominant. We
threw the ball inside. We played inside out basketball. Film doesn't tell the
story in terms of how physical and how big a team is. I thought we would have
some advantages at the four spot in the post and we couldn't get a shot off.
Once the game settled down and it became a half court basketball game we
struggled to get shots.  
  
We're a different basketball team right now and I think the way we're built
could be advantageous to how they defend. But on the flip side, they have
advantages with size. We've got to find a way to keep that ball out of the
paint and rebound. But we've done that with bigger teams this year and the
question is if we can do it again tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Coach, along those same lines, you missed some open shots last year.
This team has been great at knocking those down. How confident are you with
the shooting you have this year?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: Doesn't matter how confident I am. Those guys you just talked
to up here, they gotta believe, right? I think we're a very confident
basketball team. I think we have found a way to grind and trust each other and
play with a high level of confidence in each other, which means our shot
selection is a lot better than it was a year ago. We will turn down an okay
shot for a better shot. If we can be patient knowing that this is a good
defense team that's going to take way first and second options and contest
everything and just work and not panic at the end of shot clock we will get
open shots. We've just got to be patient enough to wait for them. I think we
will knock those shots down, but I think the key is always to get as many high
percentage shots as you can. We are not going to settle and bomb away from
three because that's the best shoot you're going to get. We're going to find a
way to get two-point shots, and the more of those we get the better off we
will be.  
  
Q. You guys had a tough nonconference season at the beginning of this
year. How did that prepare you to be here and playing tomorrow?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: We played quite a few teams that either were built to be
championship teams or actually did compete for championships, and it's a
different feeling when you go on the floor and you match-up against someone
who thinks they're good enough to hang a banner. That prepares you for March.
I thought we did well. I thought we improved from the adversity that we dealt
with during those stretches. I don't think we were ourselves when we played
Creighton and I don't think we were ourselves when we played Arizona.
Unfortunately we didn't perform many of those games the way I thought we would
when I signed up for those games. But we had injuries right before or day of
that kept us from putting our best product on the floor and we weren't able to
play with what we prepared. This time around the guys we're putting on the
floor we have been playing with for a long time, but I do think those games
prepared us for this situation.  
  
Q. Travis, your team pretty much everybody here has been to the
tournament on this team. How has the feeling been? Have they been more calm or
how have they approached this year as opposed to last year?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: It's been more calm the last twelve hours. From the one big
league you're going to celebrate. You can go ten years in a row. That Saturday
night if you win you're going to celebrate like it's the first win in your
life and that's what our guys did. They enjoyed the moment. Sunday they
enjoyed Selection Sunday. We had an incredible crowd come and watch the show
with us, enjoy the moment with us. Monday's practice high energy, probably not
the most disciplined or detailed-oriented group that day. But then as time
passed, Tuesday morning, 8 a.m. practice, hard to get up for. They were ready
to go. As focused as any team could probably be at 8:15 in the morning, and
today they were ready to go. I thought I was focused and ready to go and I had
a couple of them on me making sure I was ready. So it turned into more of a
business trip today.  
  
Q. I think we asked the players what it's like stepping on the court and
playing the game. What is it like for you getting going on this game and going
up against a coach that I know you have a lot of respect for as well?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: It's exciting. But I've built this team to treat every game
the same. Whether you're playing Michigan or Eastern Washington or Idaho, you
have to treat each game the same so that when one becomes more meaningful you
can handle the rise in intensity in the moment. Right? But you also show up
for a game that you might not pencil in on your calendar when the schedule
comes out.  
  
So, you know, for us it's more than just another game, obviously, your season
either continues or ends tomorrow night. But our guys are excited and ready to
go. I'm excited and ready to go. It's a big moment for me. This is what I
dream of is coaching in the NCAA Tournament. As a head coach, it's my second
time. I would love to be able to do this every year until I have that type of
program. I'm going to enjoy the moment. So when I step on the floor I look at
the bright lights, smile, enjoy the moment and when the ball goes in the air
it's time to go to work.  
  
Q. Something about Michigan is they can have spurts offensively where
they don't score, five, six, seven minutes. You guys are a defensive-oriented
team. How do you force them into those stretches and take advantage of them on
the offensive end?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: Hard to answer without giving up the scouting report! We just
gotta do what we know how to do. We know where they're trying to get a shot
for the most part and if we're in the right places at the right times that
moment will happen. And that's what we're known for is holding teams scoreless
for two, three, four minutes. We finished the season leading the conference
for scoring and we held them for what, ten minutes? Hopefully we can do that
again. Michigan is a better basketball team. There is no question about it.
But if we're in the right places and we pick up the flow of their offense at
some point in time we should be in all the right spots at the right time and
hopefully it turns into one of those stretches.  
  
Q. Coach, what are you most proud of during this two-year run to lead
your Alma Mater to the tournament two years in a row, twenty six wins in each
year?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: You want me to answer that without bragging? Hard to do. I'm
proud of my guys. Ahmaad Rorie, you are talking about a top-50 recruit in the
country that's playing for a program that's in a one-bid league, transfers
down from the Pac-12. He's been on the number one nationally ranked team in
the country. He's got a lot of reasons to throw up 20 shots a game like a lot
of guards we played against this year. He's taken a backseat not to anyone but
just to the moment to benefit our team, our program, to give us an opportunity
to sit here in front of you right now. I'm proud of him for that because
that's hard to do.  
  
When you dream of playing in the NBA you dream of playing for money, sometimes
your stats, your accolades are important. And a lot of times those things are
worth dollar signs. He put those in the backseat to get here to win a
championship. I'm proud of him for that. Sayeed Pridgett, for two years he has
wanted to be the guy and he has wanted to get shots and get the ball in his
hands and he wanted to start and he waited his turn and he trusted me. Michael
Oguine had his best year as the freshman in the history of Montana basketball
and going into his sophomore year everyone had big expectations for him to be
the best player to put on a jersey at Montana. But here comes Ahmaad Rorie and
Sayeed Pridgett. He's got to share. Here comes Jamar Akoh. So he goes from
expecting to score 25 a game himself to 12, 13. But he's had 30-point games.
They've all had 30-point games, but none of them averaged 20. It's very
difficult to do. So I'm proud of the selflessness that my group has expressed
and shown together to build a championship program.  
  
Q. What do you hope with the senior crew that you're going to play with
for possibly the last time tomorrow night or maybe moving on? What do you hope
for them?  
TRAVIS DeCUIRE: I want to see them walk out of this arena with a smile on
their face. That means either we won, or they're proud of the effort that they
put forward and the product that they put out in representation of our
community, our program, their families, their friends. I want them to walk out
of here proud. That's not easy to do in defeat. We gotta find a way to win and
play our best basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_Des Moines, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Pleased to have with us student-athletes, University of
Michigan, Ignas Brazdeikis, Charles Matthews, and Zavier Simpson. Questions
for our student-athletes?  
  
Q. What was your guys' first reaction to seeing Montana again in the
Selection Show and you guys had just got done playing and your first
thoughts?  
IGNAS BRAZDEIKIS: I wasn't here last year, but this is really exciting for me.
Any team we would have played I would have been just as excited for anyone
else. We are not going to take anyone for granted. We're going to be ready to
go and I'm just excited for this opportunity.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: It was a coincidence that we ended up playing the same team
we played last year. They are a really talented team and we are excited to
play them tomorrow.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: Yeah, extremely talented team. Excited to have the opportunity
to play.  
  
Q. Coming off the loss with Michigan State this past week is there any
areas that you guys are looking forward to being able to work on in this game
on Thursday?  
IGNAS BRAZDEIKIS: I feel like we got a lot better as a team in the Big Ten
tournament. It didn't go the way we wanted it to, but I feel like we learned a
lot of different things and now I feel like we're moving the ball really well.
We are locked in on the defense end and I feel like we're getting better and
better and you will see the best of us in this tournament.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: Our approach right now is really just taking it with a clean
slate, try to forget about that loss. We understand that we wanted to win that
game, but we can't let that lose us another game in this tournament. We gotta
be fresh minded and take on the next task.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: Our focus is Montana. We're just trying to get better every
single day.  
  
Q. Based off the run from last year what's the biggest take away that
you guys take from that three-week experience to try to make sure that y'all
are in the right frame of mind yourselves and passing that on to someone like
Iggy?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: You've got to take one game at a time. That's one thing I
noticed from last year. You've got to have a little bit of luck and we had a
crazy shot to continue our run. But staying in the moment and having the most
fun and enjoying each and every night. Those are the teams that have the most
success around this time.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: I would just tell the young guys to enjoy every moment,
practice, the media, everything leading up to it because it goes by quick and
last year we were so focused on winning this, I don't think we got a chance to
enjoy being in the NCAA tournament, which is unfortunate for every team.  
  
Q. Charles, you were on you a great scoring run before you hurt your
ankle and you tried to get back in the groove with the Big Ten tournament.
Talk about that?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: It's a process. I understand injuries are part of the game.
Like I said, there is no pressure on me, though. I have so many great
teammates around me where I can ease myself back into the game, back into the
flow of things. But I'm confident in my abilities. I know I will be back to
where I was before, prior to this injury and right now I'm trying to help the
team win, whatever role is needed.  
  
Q. Charles, at Kentucky you were playing 10 minutes a game and now
you're playing 30 minutes a game for a really good team. Is this what you
envisioned when you transferred to Michigan?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: That was the goal, but I knew I was about to put the work in
and earn my coaching staff to trust me to be out there for that amount of
time. Right now it's not so much about Kentucky. I've been gone from there
forever. Now it's just trying to get back to the icing on the cake right now.  
  
Q. Charles, last year against Montana you had 20 points and 11 rebounds.
Do you approach this rematch similarly knowing it's a similar group with not
Montana or is it different for you this time?  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: Honestly, I just play to win every game I play. I never go
into there with the mindset I've got to get X amount of points, X amount of
rebounds, X amount of assists. It never really mattered to me, throughout the
game I heat up, do what I need to do for the team. Last year we had some early
foul troubles and I knew I needed to do more on the offensive end and rebound
as well.  
  
Q. Do you guys know anything about the state of Montana at all?  
IGNAS BRAZDEIKIS: I'm from Canada, so I definitely don't know too much about
Montana. Pass it on to Charles.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: It's on the west coast.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: I don't.  
  
Q. Montana runs a pretty heavy guard off and they're shorter than you
guys. Is that going to change the way you play? Is there anything that you are
excited to change when you face them Thursday?  
IGNAS BRAZDEIKIS: We always have a specific game plan for each team we play.
So depending on what they have, we kind of adjust our offense, defense. But
every single game we play hard, you know? We never let down for anyone. We
don't tape anyone for granted, so we're going to come into this game like it's
the national championship game, and that's the mindset we've got to have. I
feel like if we have that mindset we will be fine.  
  
CHARLES MATTHEWS: We don't take anyone for granted, but they are a smaller
team and that produces strengths for them as well, and that helps to create
for themselves and others. So I feel like we're going to respond to it.  
  
ZAVIER SIMPSON: They're going to present challenges, great guard play, great
team and coaching staff. So I'm excited for the game, and we just have to do
our best to contain them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, gentlemen.  
  
We would like to welcome Michigan head coach, John Beilein. Coach, welcome to
Des Moines.  
  
JOHN BEILEIN: Thank you very much, Mike. We're thrilled to be here. I just
told our AD I love being in these venues where it means a lot to Des Moines to
have a tournament like this and so much interest coming into this area. My
first time coming here. Looks like a wonderful place to live. Looks like we're
going to have great excitement here and you can guarantee Michigan is excited
to be part of this round of 64 by the time we play.  
  
Q. John, the players will know that it's Montana again, everybody has
probably asked and talked about that already, but from the coach's perspective
you have to balance the confidence that you have in your guys with the fear of
any complacency that they might have in a first-round game. Do you have any
extra worries that you have to guard against knowing that this is the same
way, the road that went so well last year is starting again? How do you make
sure that that deja vu factor doesn't make your players complacent?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I hope it doesn't go the way it did last year. They were ahead
of us 10-nothing to the start the game, and they have a lot of guys back. I
don't know if Akoh is going to play. I know he might. We have three guys that
played any minutes in this type of game at all. We are a little brand new to
playing in this type of game. They know Montana is even better than they were
last year, and like you say, we were up by 3 at half and very fortunate to win
by 13 points.  
  
So it wasn't a 30, 40-point game. They're a good team. Every team playing in
the tournament is a champion and the way they have played without their big
guy out is really going to present problems for a lot of high major teams
because they're going to spread you out with all guards and that can work
really well.  
  
Q. John, the 10-0 run that Montana started with last year, do you think
that works to your advantage knowing that these guys like Zavier and Charles
won't take them lightly this time around?  
JOHN BEILEIN: They know that and we've been really good so far this year. You
go into your games early. You have your games where you've beat the team
already, right? And we've been able to really respond. We usually respond
pretty well after losses, too, and we had a tough one Sunday. We've been
really good at that. I hope that trend continues. But I think our kids are
sometimes unique to other teams. I think they get all that part, right, that
we don't look past anybody, that we are ready to play every day.  
  
Q. Coach, last year Montana was the only team in the tournament that had
the same starting lineup for every game. This year they have had to evolve in
and out with Akoh being out. What would you say is the difference from last
year to this year?  
JOHN BEILEIN: I think having Dorsey and the other transfer, Manuel, that's the
difference this year, between Oguine and Rorie, those two guys are like Big
Ten, Pac 10 guards, and now you ad the shooters around them and everything has
changed. So this is a legitimate team that can have a Cinderella run. They're
terrific. They have a terrific coach, four out of the first five years they've
been in the NCAA Tournament. This is a traditional NCAA team and we're going
to have to play well. There is not a team in the country that can go out and
have a bad game and win. It's not going to happen.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been in this tournament representing a smaller school
before. So the newness, people were bummed that it was Michigan again, because
you guys are really good. So maybe the perspective of a smaller school getting
to the tournament. Your thoughts on having it be a repeat match-up?  
JOHN BEILEIN: Knowing how hard it is to win those three or four games in a row
and get to the tournament. I don't think people really care. For me, you know,
whether it was Canisius or Richmond. We made the tournament. We were just darn
happy to be there. I remember this bold statement we played Utah with Rick
Majerus and Doleac and Keith Van Horn. They had like four pro's on the team
and I said, that's a great match-up for us. We lost 70-40 or something. You're
just excited to get here and everything is positive from this point on. I
don't think anybody is saying, oh, it's Michigan. They're saying, oh, it's
Michigan, a great opportunity for us to have a great win.  
  
Q. The Montana Grizzlies are a heavily defense program and you guys are
one of the top defense programs in the nation. What are the advantages of
having a first-game match-up with two heavily defense teams?  
JOHN BEILEIN: That's one constant you have in basketball is to have a good
defensive team. There have been times we have had a great defensive team.
We're going to have to be great defensively against them. This is one of the
most efficient offensive teams in the country and a leader in a lot of
different categories. So the ability to shoot the 3-ball is a great
disadvantage for us. They're a downhill team and their fast break is
tremendous. It's going to be a big challenge for us.  
  
Q. John, I want to ask you about the merits and pitfalls of winning a
conference tournament. You won the conference tournament last year, got all
the way to the finals and this year trying to go as far as you can without
winning the conference tournament. I'm wondering if losing in the conference
tournament can scare your team in a productive way so they're not too
confident going into this venue?  
JOHN BEILEIN: As long as I've been coaching and I have been coaching a long
time and I've had a lot of wins and a whole lot of losses and after a loss,
every time there seems to be a bounce in our team. You've got to go through a
painful 24 hours. There have been a few times I lost in a championship game.
West Virginia was one of them, and we had to turn around and play right away
and because of the Big Ten schedule and the travel and the amount of time
we're playing I think we're pretty resilient to that. But it is three games in
three days and I know a Hall of Fame coach who said, if you're going to lose
in the tournament, lose on Friday, not Saturday or Sunday. Well, we messed
that up. We had Monday off and we've tried to stay fresh. So it's all part of
it. Our kids are resilient, I think. Montana has one more day of rest, I
believe. But this is the time of year you can't worry about being tired or
anything. We've got to manage that and just go play. But hopefully we will
have the same edge, right, that we have had in the last couple of years in the
first rounds after winning. I think we will have more of an edge, hopefully.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you.
