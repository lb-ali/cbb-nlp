_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 99, Louisville - 79  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Louisville head coach Jeff Walz and student-
athletes Bionca Dunham, Asia Durr and Jazmine Jones. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH WALZ: Just first like to start off congratulating Notre Dame. I thought
they really did a great job of controlling the glass, which was what was our
problem.  
  
You come into a ballgame, injuries, they happen. They're part of it.
Unfortunately, about found out about 20 minutes before tip A.C. was not going
to be able to go, and Sam goes down with a sprained ankle. But still it's the
next one up. And we just -- we just could not gain any ground on the defensive
glass for us.  
  
When you play somebody and they get more offensive rebounds than you get
defensive rebounds, it's not going to be a good day. And unfortunately for us
that's what took place. So you've got to tip your hat to them. I thought at
times we fought, we made some really nice runs. But then we just couldn't keep
them off the glass.  
  
Q. Can you tell us a little bit about Arica's injury? And, secondly, you
had the same rebounding differential in South Bend with Sam playing. How much
was a factor her injury today?  
COACH WALZ: It was a huge factor. She's our best defensive rebounder that we
have on the team. And they just really controlled the -- their offensive glass
the entire night. It wasn't just their post players. Jackie Young really hurt
us at important times. We came up -- we switched some defenses and forced them
to miss some shots, and then just couldn't come up with a defensive board.
That's a dagger. Kills your spirit. Kills your confidence at times.  
  
But it's one of the things we've just got to get back to the drawing board.
We've got to get some kid's healthy. It's A.C. I'm still trying to figure out,
I know she sprained her ankle in yesterday's game. I'm waiting to get
confirmation exactly what it was or what it is. And then we'll get her taken
care of and healed and back hopefully in practice in a few days so we can get
prepared for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Bionca, between the combination of Turner and Shepard, just talk
about having to try and guard and deal with them for 40 minutes?  
BIONCA DUNHAM: It was a battle down there. They crashed the boards. It was
hard to try to help and keep boxing them out, keeping them off the glass also.
They just got more rebounds than us.  
  
Q. Jeff, looked like Sam was trying to come back and you could see you
talking to her a little bit. When did you sort of make the decision to maybe
not have her --  
COACH WALZ: I talked to her before we started the third quarter. I said if
you're going to go out there you can't limp. And end all, end all, this isn't
our final, our major goal that we're trying to get to. And the last thing I
wanted was for her to go out there and try to continue to fight through it and
then all of a sudden you take a one Grade 1 sprained ankle and turn it into a
Grade 3 sprained ankle and now you're out three weeks.  
  
She went out there, got a ball, she may have gotten fouled or something. And I
think she tried to plant and that's when she looked at me and said, "Coach, I
can't go." Which I was proud of her because she's a little stubborn and it
wouldn't have surprised me if she tried to keep going. But I wanted to make
sure she understood, yeah, we're always trying to win every game we play. But
at the same time I wasn't willing to sacrifice her being able to play in two
and a half weeks when the big tournament starts up.  
  
Q. Asia, your final ACC Tournament, but as Coach mentioned a bigger goal
ahead, just speak about the NCAA and what you're thinking about that?  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, this is one game. This wasn't our final goal. So I think we
fought hard at certain times throughout the game. But this is not our final
goal. So we just gotta learn from it and continue to push forward.  
  
Q. Jazmine, this is the second time that they've had a pretty dramatic
rebounding difference against you. Do you see this as just a bad matchup for
this team or is there another issue at stake here?  
JAZMINE JONES: We've got to come out with a mindset to chop wood, like our
coaches say all the time in practice. We just have to come with a mindset. It
wasn't there today. We've just got to get back to it.  
  
Q. You've been projected pretty widely as the No. 1 seed in Chicago.
Presumably Notre Dame will get that given their proximity. What do you expect
now? Do you still think you're a No. 1? If not, what happens?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I mean, it's one of those -- I was really surprised when the
last reveal came out that we were going to Chicago. I mean, with the fact that
UConn was kept in Albany, it only made sense to put Notre Dame and Chicago
based on the proximity of them.  
  
And for us, at the end of the day, you know, being a 1 seed is great. It's a
great honor. It just shows you what your body of work has been throughout the
entire season.  
  
But wherever they send us, we know we're going to get the opportunity to play
the first two at home unless this loss put us to a 5 seed, which I don't think
it did.  
  
So, I feel pretty confident about that. And then it's one game at a time. I've
said it the 12 years I've been here. If you can figure out a way to get to the
Sweet 16, it's anybody's ballgame. They're great teams. And you've just got to
play your best that night.  
  
And it's the one thing that makes this time of year so exciting is the best
team doesn't always win. It's the team that plays the best that night. That's
why everybody loves March Madness. It's not a best of seven.  
  
In '13, I promise you, we could have played the best of 100 and we may have
won that one against Baylor. You've just got to come out and be ready to play
from day one.  
  
I would be surprised if this would drop us very far, especially with the
injuries that we had. But whatever it might be, we're just going to have to
embrace it and move forward.  
  
Q. Jeff, this team hasn't lost very much. You have been to a
championship game twice after playing UConn in a final that didn't go real
well. How much can you share with them about quickly turning the page?  
COACH WALZ: Well, yeah, this is the one thing about this ballgame. There were
some things that we did well. We shot 49 percent from the field. It wasn't the
offensive end of it. We scored. We attacked their man. We were getting layup
after layup. But the problem was we couldn't get a rebound. They shot 83 shots
to our 66.  
  
And the thing about it we both shot the same amount of free throws. Normally
when you see something like that, we may have shot like 35 attempts at the
free-throw line when you see such a huge discrepancy. But they just kicked our
tail on the offensive glass.  
  
If you give me 17 more shots at the basket, it's hard to win. And you've got
to give them credit for that. They played extremely hard. They attacked that
glass. And we just couldn't keep them off of it.  
  
Q. I know obviously defensively was tough for you today, but could you
describe how hard it was to defend Shepard and Turner, having them two
together inside?  
COACH WALZ: Jess, I had the opportunity to work with USA Basketball. And I've
just -- I told her when we played up there how impressed I was at the shape
she's gotten in. I'm not sure how much she changed her body or what she's
lost. But it's remarkable. She gets up and down that floor so much better.
She's always had a great touch.  
  
The one thing she doesn't do for them that she has is shoot the 3. That's one
of the things, when she tried out for a few of the teams that I was part of
with USA Basketball, she had a great 3-point shot. But for them, when you've
got Turner and Shepard inside, it's almost pick your poison.  
  
But we talked about it; you can't let them get two feet in the paint. When
they get two feet in the paint they're scoring on you. And there for a little
bit in the first half we stopped them from getting two feet in the paint and
they missed some shots. So they played so well together, they passed the ball
real well.  
  
But I'll say it, I think the key to their entire team is Jackie Young. The kid
gets -- I think people might not talk about her as much. I just go back to the
Final Four game, I think she went 10-for-10 against UConn in that semifinal
game. She just defensively, the way she attacks the glass, she passes the
ball. She's the one that when I watch on film she impresses me. She might not
make the wow plays as much, but she puts -- she's got a heart and she's a
motor that just does not stop.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 99, Louisville - 79  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw and
student-athletes Jessica Shepard, Brianna Turner and Jackie Young. Coach, an
opening statement.  
  
COACH MCGRAW: We came in with a goal of bringing the trophy back to South Bend
and I thought we played really well in every game of the tournament,
offensively especially. Just a lot of different weapons, a lot of people
scoring. Got great performances from these three every single day. I thought
we were really steady on offense and definitely came ready today. I thought
that was a huge win for us, and probably gets us to play in Chicago, which was
another one of our goals. So we're thrilled with where we are right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, I'm curious what sort of a message you think this game sends
to the other teams across the country who will see the scoring and what you
guys did this weekend?  
COACH MCGRAW: When you beat ranked teams by as much as we did this weekend, I
think it sends a great message. We want to try to set a tone, but it's a new
season. Everybody's undefeated. We've got to take care of business every
single game. I'm glad we sent a good message. We can enjoy a couple of days
off and then get ready to get back to work.  
  
Q. Jessica and Brianna, I believe you guys scored 72 points in the paint
today, which is a season high. Can you just talk about that and just the way
you two worked together throughout the season and then this game in
particular?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think coming into the game we knew we had a mismatch, I
think the guards just did a good job passing the ball inside. I can think of
all of them making a great pass in. And obviously getting to play with a great
player like Bri makes it really easy. You can just throw it up to the rim and
watch her go get it. It's been a lot of fun this season.  
  
BRIANNA TURNER: I think we really took advantage of how they were guarding us.
A lot of times they went four guards, so we knew someone would have a
mismatch. And also just Jackie taking the ball full court, going in for easy
layups. I think we really executed and took what the other team gave us.  
  
Q. Coach, looking back on the two ACC losses in particular, Notre Dame
and Miami, what did you learn from those and what did you sort of tell the
players about that that got you to where you looked as dominant as you have
this tournament?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think the first thing was we're coming in as the defending
champs and that's something that we've never done with this group. So it was a
different attitude. I think the regular season seemed a little less important
at times to them because we just were anxious to get to the tournament play.  
  
Going to North Carolina, I think that showed us two things: One, we've got to
focus and be ready for every game on the road, which we generally were; but
without Jackie, that kind of showed us how important she is to our team. To go
to Miami, they're a really good team. Miami's got a great team. Hof's played
really well and they did a lot of really good things and we didn't.  
  
We didn't shoot the ball well, didn't pass the ball well, didn't do anything
well. Our focus was off. I credit both teams, Miami and North Carolina.  
  
There's a lot of good times in the ACC. Paris Kea is a terrific player, Hof is
a great player. There's a player on every single team. I think it taught us to
be ready.  
  
Q. Jackie, one of the things that Coach Walz said watching you guys,
you're the player that he worries the most about in terms of how many things
you facilitate out on court. Can you talk about that, what you do out there in
terms of not just looking for your own offense but everything else you do for
the rest of the players?  
JACKIE YOUNG: Yeah, I think I'm just really willing to do whatever it takes to
help our team win. And whether that's guarding the best player on the other
team, rebounding, scoring, passing, whatever that is, I'm willing to do.  
  
So I don't know, I think early on I'm just -- for this tournament I think I
was just looking to attack early so I could get my teammates open and look for
Marina and Arike on the 3, and then have passes for Jess and Bri on the
inside. And if I'm scoring they're going to guard me a little bit tighter so
I'm able to dish the ball.  
  
Q. Coach, a year ago you guys, everybody was, like, wow, how are they
getting through all these injuries. You were sort of the underdog. I think
it's the exact opposite this year. And that's a different mentality. Can you
just talk about how well your team's handled that sort of pressure to be the
defending champ?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think it's been kind of a transition for them to learn how to
handle that. I think they've done a really good job of that throughout the
year. It's just different going into every single game they celebrate when
they beat us as if they won the national championship. And you've got to be
ready for that. You've got to bring your best game every single night.  
  
We're where we should be. I think right now we had a couple of bumps in the
road this year. Last year it was just so fun being the underdog. But this year
we have the big targets on our back. It will be different heading into the
tournament.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Louisville - 78, NC State - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Louisville head coach Jeff Walz and student-
athletes Sam Fuehring, Arica Carter and Asia Durr. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH MOORE: Just really, really proud of everybody in that locker room. I
thought it was a hard-fought game which we knew it was going to be. We came
out 10 days ago and just really -- offensively we were unbelievable the first
quarter.  
  
And I knew that was not going to repeat itself. You can't expect to have that
kind of performance every time out. And NC State's a heck of a basketball
team. Wes does a remarkable job. You're looking at three or four starters that
are out for him because of ACL injury.  
  
And it doesn't matter. It's next person up. And I've got a lot of respect for
their program, for Wes. They're going to -- I'm excited to see where their
draw is going to be for the NCAA Tournament, because now you're back to play a
game, get a day off, play a game, and if you advance past that you get three
or four days.  
  
So, when you're down to the numbers that Wes is down it's hard to play three
games in three days or back to back. So really commend them in their
performance today and I'm really proud of our group.  
  
It was a fun ballgame. We did some really good things and then we did some
poor things. But that's part of this game. But we figured out a way to win and
that's what you have to do this time of the year.  
  
Q. You go on a 19-0 run in the first half. You can check my numbers on
it if you want. What were you all seeing on their defense that made you all do
that?  
COACH MOORE: I don't think it's anything that went on with their defense. I
think we kind of changed the tempo at times. Mykasa Robinson, I think she
changed the entire game. I mean the entire game. Her overall hustle, the
effort on both ends of the floor. And it's things you can't even see. You look
at her stat sheet and I just told her in the locker room that I was really
impressed with the fact that she fouled four times in five minutes and wasn't
even trying to. But she comes up with, she has two turnovers and two steals.
If you look at that you're going, what in the world did she do? Now she
changed the entire complexion of the game for us.  
  
I was really proud of how she came in and performed, and then we started
executing. Our problem was we have gotten really sloppy at the offensive end.
We're not screening as well as we had the past month. And now we're just
flying by and we have to get back to doing what we do well. And that's set
screens, use screens, move without the ball.  
  
In that second quarter I thought we did a great job. We ran a few out-of-
bounds play. Kylee Shook gets five points off out of bounds, and big five
points. So really proud of them. And it's just -- it's the fun time of the
year. You've got to figure out a way to win.  
  
Q. Sam, can you talk a little bit about, I know you haven't had anytime
to think about this, but it's a matchup that I think everybody's been thinking
about, if you guys play Notre Dame again. Can you reflect back -- it's been a
while, to that January 10th game and what you guys need to do better
tomorrow?  
SAM FUEHRING: I feel like we need to rebound. When we played Notre Dame in
January, we didn't rebound well. And we kind of got sucked into the ref play
instead of our own play. I think we need to move on from whatever calls that
they call and just keep our heads in the game and not check out early.  
  
That's pretty much what I think of when it comes to that Notre Dame game is
boxing out, containing the ball, contesting shots and just move on.  
  
Q. Sam and Asia, you had the last 12 points of the game, you two. What
were you all seeing in that stretch that made it happen for you?  
ASIA DURR: We were just trying to make reads. I actually had no idea we had
the last 12 points of the game. But we were just trying to find a way to
score, try to get a stop, get a score, then a stop. That's what we all were
trying to do.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: What Asia said. But I also feel like Coach Walz ran really good
plays to set us up that way, too.  
  
Q. Asia, you got off to kind of a slow start shooting. What got you
going in that second quarter when you hit a couple of 3s there?  
ASIA DURR: You just have to stay patient. That's it. You're not going to make
every shot. I mean, everything's not going to be pretty. So you've just got to
stay patient, trust the process, trust the game plan and just play hard.  
  
Q. NC State got in foul trouble in the second quarter. Did you all try
to make an intentional effort to attack the basket?  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, you just want to make reads. If a player has two fouls or one
foul, picked up a quick first foul you want to go at her because she's
probably not -- she's probably not going to try to foul. And you have to make
that read. That's what Coach Walz is trying to tell us; if we have the ball on
the wing, just take it.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, Asia she touched on everything. So what Asia said.  
  
ARICA CARTER: What Asia said.  
  
Q. Arica, I think you guys got 28 points off turnovers today and
obviously won the turnover battle big time. How important is that going to be
tomorrow?  
ARICA CARTER: It's going to be very important. If we could find a way to make
Notre Dame turn the ball over and convert those turnovers it's going to be
great. Coach talked about that before the game, how we did a great job of that
last game and to be able to come into this game and do the same thing.
Hopefully we can keep it going and be smart with the ball.  
  
Q. Arica, you nailed four 3s out there today. You end up with a total of
16 points. What were you seeing on their guard play that was allowing you to
get those shots off and in?  
ARICA CARTER: Really just focusing on how my teammates have pumped my
confidence up. Read the defense when I was open. I shot it confidently because
of my teammates and how they're always telling me, like, you've got this. So
really just trying to take my time, read the defense and not rush any shots.  
  
Q. Coach, you were up about 10 with about 30 seconds left. Jaz was on
the bench with about five fouls, but you were still coaching her. Can you talk
about the team dynamic and how that works with your players even when they're
on the bench out of the game, you want to coach them up?  
COACH WALZ: We're just trying to teach them as the game goes at every
opportunity. When I was talking to Jaz about was about two possessions before
that, NC State had a sideline out of bounds and our goal was to make them
throw it in the back court towards our basket so we could use more clock.  
  
We went for a steal and they throw over the top. Now you're speeding them up
and they need points. The last thing you want to do is get the game going
faster.  
  
I was trying to make sure I explained that to her and everybody on the bench
because we try to use every opportunity we can as a teaching moment. And I
just think it's important during the moment, if you can do that, to try to
explain it to them. Because at the end of the day, you know, you've got to
make smart plays.  
  
I've got a good friend that always tells me all the time, dumb loses more than
smart wins. You've got to make the smart plays. You've got to make sure --
limit the number of mistakes you're going to make and you can give that credit
to Beth Burns, okay. That's her favorite line she tells me all the time.  
  
And it's true, it's like, guys, just eliminate the foolish and silly mistakes
and let's see what we can do. Now I'm sure Beth will be really thrilled that I
quoted her on that.  
  
Q. You mentioned obviously Wes Moore having to go to reserves late in
the season after losing several starters. What does it say about the talent
level of NC State to have two players in Elissa Cunane and Kai Crutchfield
have such good performances after being bench players the start of the
season?  
COACH WALZ: They're really good. I was hoping that Cunane, this was her senior
night also. I mean, she's really, really impressive. Just her composure on the
floor. She played the 38 minutes. Crutchfield stepped up and made big shots. I
love the confidence that Rogers is playing with at the same time.  
  
They're a really, really good basketball team. I think the only thing that
saved us at times tonight, we went in and pinched in on Cunane, not every time
but at moments and we got her to turn the ball over which is what you have to
do.  
  
You've got to figure out a way. You can't let her get comfortable. She loves
to turn it over the left shoulder. We did a great job of it 10 days ago of not
allowing her to do it. And then for some reason in the first half she turned
over the left shoulder every single time and scored on us. You have to give
her credit being able to what she does well and she kept going at it.  
  
Q. Looks like -- likely for the second year in the row you and Notre
Dame will be No. 1 seeds. It's turned into maybe the premier rivalry in any
conference considering the success you both have had. Can you just talk about
how in some ways I guess maybe you bring out the best in each other?  
COACH WALZ: All these kids know each other. That's really what's changed over
the past 15, 20 years, is the fact there's so much travel ball being played in
the summer. They all know each other. A lot of them play USA Basketball with
each other.  
  
So it's a great competition. And it's really what's fun to watch. I mean, I
watch the fans go back and forth like they hate each other. Then the kids all
know each other and they're actually friends. Now, do they want to win when
you step out on the court? Of course you do.  
  
But it's fun to watch them when they compete. And Notre Dame's playing
fantastic. I mean, offensively they're really fun to watch when you don't have
to play them. I've never seen a group of kids push the ball as hard as they do
in transition.  
  
They get it and go. They can go on a 12-0 run in two minutes. And that's where
you've got to be smart at the offensive end to make sure you're attacking but
you can't take bad shots. We talked to them in March. You can't come up with
empty possessions. You've got to get shots.  
  
And that's one thing over these past two games I'm really excited about
because I think we had five turnovers in yesterday's game and we had eight
tonight.  
  
Q. Sam, you got your double-double today, 12 and 14. You were battling
Cunane in there tooth and nail the entire game. Just talk about her as a
freshman and that experience playing against her.  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, she's an incredible player. I even told her after the
game. She's so talented as a post player. I know when I came in my freshman
year I wasn't, personally I feel like I wasn't nearly as good as she is.  
  
I don't want to say that she has a long way to go, but she's going to make a
really good four years -- well, three years because it's like three years
left. But, yeah, she's going to be really good by her senior year.  
  
COACH WALZ: It's going to be scary.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah.  
  
COACH WALZ: I mean, I'd be shocked if that kid's not an All-America by her
junior or senior year. She's that good.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: I'd like to see her shoot more, like shoot more outside shots I
feel like.  
  
Q. You or some of the other posts (indiscernible) as a freshman? Is that
meanness there?  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, she's tough. She got me with an elbow. But we were
battling down low. I feel like she was battling with my other posts, too. But,
yeah, she's a really tough freshman.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [Elissa Cunane](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36638)

### [Kai Crutchfield](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36656)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Louisville - 78, NC State - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by NC State head coach Wes Moore and student-
athletes Kai Crutchfield and Elissa Cunane.  
  
COACH MOORE: I told the players, first of all, how proud I am of them, how
they battled. But I'll take the blame for this loss.  
  
We had three kids pick up two fouls halfway through the second quarter. And I
got them out. And we went from 10 up to 10 down in five minutes or so. So, I
should have probably gambled a little bit there and tried to let them play.  
  
So, again, like I said, I couldn't be prouder. They fought all day long. They
fought all year. They've been amazing, and the good news is we still have some
more basketball ahead of us.  
  
Q. Coach, Louisville ended the second quarter on a 22-2 run, and you
came out, outscored them, rallied back to tie before the layup to end the
third for the Cardinals. What do you tell your team at halftime and how would
you assess how they performed in the third?  
COACH MOORE: I told them they did a great job to start the game. They built a
10-point lead. We're down by 10 at halftime. All we have to do is do what we
did to start the game -- flip it back, get the 10 points back. They did that.
Unfortunately, they probably ran out of gas fighting so hard to get back to
that point.  
  
So, like I said, they did a great job, and I probably should have gambled and
played some people with two fouls. Again, give Louisville a lot of credit.
They took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Wes, do you think your team just used up a lot of energy to get back
into the game and?  
COACH MOORE: I do.  
  
Q. Noticed barely 20 minutes off your bench tonight. Was that a
factor?  
COACH MOORE: I think so. We can manage -- we can rotate and manage with one
starter out or whatever, but when we have three out it's tough. We just don't
have the depth to handle that.  
  
So, like I said, should have probably taken a chance, let them maybe even get
a third foul if need be and make sure that we kept the lead.  
  
Q. Coach, last time when you guys went up to Louisville it was obviously
the first quarter that killed you. And today you come out strong in that first
quarter. How much of an emphasis was there on that starting well?  
COACH MOORE: We felt it was important we got off to a good start and more than
anything maybe flip it. It may have been important that we did and let them
get off to a great start and get that confidence going again.  
  
But, again, except for that second quarter, where we gave up 27 points, pretty
unbelievable to hold them under 20 each of those quarters, and, like I said,
have an opportunity down the stretch to win that game.  
  
Q. Wes, looking at Kiara's numbers -- nine shots, two rebounds. I know
she was expending a lot of energy guarding Durr, but what is her health
situation?  
COACH MOORE: I'm not going to talk about that. But she's not feeling well.
It's not a -- it's not an injury, she's just not well. I thought she battled
-- you look at what she and DD Rogers have done as fourth-year players is
pretty impressive. But Ki will be fine, but unfortunately she wasn't at her
best as far as physically feeling the last couple of days.  
  
Q. Coming into this season you ladies weren't getting that much playing
time. Always expected to. And as the season ends you're leading the teams.
What have you learned about yourselves moving forward? And like moving into
next season and the postseason, what can you improve on?  
KAI CRUTCHFIELD: So just coming into the season always had the mindset of just
following, being able to listen to what our leaders like Ais, Ki, the guards
and even the coaches have to say for me to grow on that.  
  
And it's a blessing, of course, just to be able to step into the role.
Unfortunately, the reason why I'm in the role I am in now is because of
injuries. But in the postseason and just going along with next year, I just
want to keep growing as a player defensively, offensively working on mid-
range, attacking the basket, whatever I need to do in order to fulfill my
position in NC State's program, that's what I want to do.  
  
ELISSA CUNANE: Same as Kai, it stinks that the injuries provided us with this
opportunity, but I'm going to take this opportunity and do what we can and
just keep on learning and improve my game.  
  
Q. Elissa, for you, going into this tournament, obviously, you've been a
starter for several games at this point. But how much confidence did you gain
from just these two games in the postseason play having the performances you
did?  
ELISSA CUNANE: I think my confidence has definitely increased just over the
course of the season so far and my teammates have really helped me out with
that. And so going into postseason, with [inaudible] with the opportunities
we'll have.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about maybe sort of gambling more maybe with
players with two fouls. One was Kiara, and she sat the rest of the quarter
after she got her second. So what made you not put her back in?  
COACH MOORE: Well, I mean, you're concerned about her picking up three fouls
if she -- that's normally what I do is, if you pick up two, then we're going
to try to live to play another day. But, again, today, against a really good
team like Louisville, probably should have maybe considered gambling a little
bit there.  
  
But if you've got three at halftime, you pick up a quick one in the second
half, you're shut down for a long, long time. So especially with the lead --
but we did let it get away. And, like I said, second-guessed myself on that
one.  
  
Q. Kai, new career high for you today. Was that part of the game plan,
was to allow you to take more shots, or was that based on what happened at
Louisville and the way they were guarding you today?  
KAI CRUTCHFIELD: I think I just went with the flow of the game. It wasn't
just, okay, I'm going to do this because of that. It was the open shots, I
take the open shots. And, of course, sometimes we all second-guess ourselves,
but I felt more confident, like he said, just the confidence that my teammates
have put in me, that the coaches have put in me, to get the career high.  
  
Q. Elissa, you came back playing the Greensboro Coliseum. What are your
overall thoughts on the tournament since you're from Northern Guilford?  
ELISSA CUNANE: I'm excited how we played, and proud of my team, how we battled
yesterday and today. And it was a very good experience. And I'm looking
forward to next year.  
  
Q. Elissa, when the ball got stuck in the rim the second quarter, you
looked like you said something to Kylee Shook when she knocked it loose that
caused her to laugh. What did you say?  
ELISSA CUNANE: I said, "Your arms are longer, that's why you got it."  
  
Q. Wes, for you, I Jeff Walz before this about the play of Elissa and
Kai, and he said to him Elissa has a chance to become an All-American by the
end of her career here at NC State. Obviously it's early in her career, but
how successful do you think both the two players sitting next to you can be
moving forward?  
COACH MOORE: I think both have grown a lot this year probably gained a lot of
confidence, and I think that always helps with Elissa being 6'5" and being
very skilled. I think she also didn't really have the advantage of working in
the summer last year because she was coming off of foot surgery. So I think in
the weight room is going to really help her.  
  
And with Kai, I think this is big for her to shoot the ball as well as she did
today and give her some confidence and hopefully moving forward in these next
few weeks, she can feel comfortable out there offensively.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Jessica Shepard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32622)

### [Marina Mabrey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30383)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 91, Syracuse - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Notre Dame head coach Muffet McGraw and
student-athletes Marina Mabrey and Jessica Shepard. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought we got our transition game going. I thought the second
half defensively we played a little bit better. They were probably a little
bit tired from the third game they had to play. But I thought we executed
really well in the second half.  
  
Really proud of Marina Mabrey and her accomplishment of being the all-time
leading 3-point shooter in Notre Dame basketball history. And excited to be
still playing. Looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. You started off the game, like, with 4:45 left in the first quarter,
it was 13-13. And then you guys ended with an 18-6 run at the end of the first
quarter. So go ahead and talk about what made you guys go ahead and really
have that dominant run.  
COACH MCGRAW: We were able to get some stops, which is always key in getting
the run. We got some rebounds, which is another key. And then I thought we got
the break going. We got some easy shots. And then we made some pretty good
jumpers. But I thought Jackie Young took the ball off their press and was able
to do a really good job of getting to the rim.  
  
Q. Coach, you kind of had, I guess, an opportunity to coach what I call
the splash sisters in Notre Dame with Michaela and Marina, and Marina becoming
the 3-pointers leaders today. It's not that often you see two sisters be that
successful in the same program. And could you talk about that?  
COACH MCGRAW: It was a blessing for me to be able to coach both of them.
They're very different personalities and very different players. But it was
great to have Marina as a freshman when Michaela was a senior because she was
a little bit like the mom out there. And I thought she did a really good job
taking care of her and showing her the way.  
  
Marina brings a different perspective to the game in terms of how feisty she
is and how competitive she is, where Michaela was someone who was always the
encourager trying to keep everybody together.  
  
They made a great combination when they were on the floor. They really knew
where each other was going to be. But it's really been a joy being able to
coach both of them.  
  
Q. You said a week ago that you thought you guys were peaking at the
right time. I'm curious, a week later, two more games in, playing for hardware
tomorrow, where you think you're at in the big picture sense?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think we're in a really good place. I like what we're doing on
offense. I think that's the easy part right now. We struggled a little bit
defensively in the first half of this game as well as yesterday. So I'd like
to see that tighten up a little bit. But offensively we're definitely where we
need to be.  
  
Q. Marina, I was curious, did you know on the floor where you stood vis-
a-vis the record and when you let that one go?  
MARINA MABREY: Yeah, I knew. Just like a lot of people have been telling me
from, like, our media staff and stuff. So it was really nice to have great
teammates who passed me the ball in the right spots. But really I'm just
worried about getting our ACC trophy back.  
  
Q. If you could both answer this, Coach has talked about -- we know how
good your offense is; that's just a consistent thing with Notre Dame. But
Coach has talked about wanting defense to be better. Could you just address
that? Do you feel it's progressively gotten better, and how has that
happened?  
MARINA MABREY: I think it starts with our focus, just sometimes coming out,
thinking we're going to outscore people. I think we really need to lock in and
want to defend and kind of have that competitiveness and pride in our defense.
We plan to bring that tomorrow.  
  
JESSICA SHEPARD: We talk about just giving a little more, and I think on the
defensive side of things is where we need to give a little more and like
Marina said, just come in focused.  
  
Q. You have five players that scored in the double digits today. Just
talk about how well-balanced your team is and how important that is moving to
the NCAA Tournament.  
COACH MCGRAW: It's been great for us all year to have five players average
double figures. I don't think a lot of teams in the country have that kind of
firepower on offense. Any one of them could have 30 on any given night.  
  
So it's a great chemistry that we have that nobody tries to do too much. And
we're sharing the ball really well. I'm interested in seeing the bench scoring
improve. That's what I'm looking for, seeing one person -- I think Abby
Prohaska has definitely taken a step up. She's shooting some 3s. Dani
Patterson gave us really good minutes. And I know Mikayla Vaughn's capable,
too. So I'd like to really see that bench come along.  
  
Q. I was just wondering, what do you think the chance is this year that
we will see rematches with the ACC in the NCAA Tournament with how strong the
ACC is this year?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think that the ACC is obviously the best conference RPI-wise,
but we definitely think we're the best conference. We've got so many great
teams, looking at taking at least eight to the NCAA Tournament, which is
probably more than everybody else.  
  
We had more teams than anyone else last year, with two teams making it to the
Final Four. And I think definitely we have the ability to do that again this
year. Looking forward to seeing where everybody's placed in the bracket,
because so much depends on where you go. And we have so much talent in this
league. I hope we show well in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

### [Tiana Mangakahia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34699)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 91, Syracuse - 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Syracuse head coach Quentin Hillsman and
student-athlete Tiana Mangakahia. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: Obviously not the outcome that we wanted, but you're playing
against a great team in this conference. And it's a grind every day of this
conference, I don't care who you're playing against, what day, what night,
doesn't matter. It's really good teams in our conference.  
  
All the games have been -- yesterday they were really close and obviously
today is one of those games where you've got to hopefully, you have enough
wind to finish the game. But it's not an excuse for us. We had shots. We had
layups.  
  
We missed a lot of shots but you can't miss shots against a team like Notre
Dame. I'm proud of our kids for coming in, competing and winning two games in
this tournament. This is a tough tournament. It's the toughest tournament in
the country and I thought our kids played really hard.  
  
At the end of the day these are my players. These are my kids. This is my
program. I'm (indiscernible) of my team and I'm not even going to count the
mileage. It is what it is. We'll just keep doing what we do and get ready for
the NCAA Tournament. And all the credit goes to Notre Dame today for being the
better team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you've done enough for your team to get to host in
the tournament?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Well, I mean, we've got a 10 RPI. And I think, what, a 3
strength of schedule. If we don't, I mean, they're going to have to change the
whole criteria. I don't know. I mean, I don't know, yeah, we have.  
  
Q. You had a coaching career here in North Carolina, where it first
started. How did it feel to be back here in North Carolina coaching again?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I went to Laurinburg Institute and The Patterson School right
in here. So it's fantastic, man. I love being here, love being in this state
and just have fond memories of coaching prep school and being here in North
Carolina. It's a great region, great area. I love it here.  
  
Q. On that same note, what are some of the lessons you learned about
coaching prep school here?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Teaching and trying to just push your kids to be the best they
can be and not let them settle. Obviously being at some of those situations at
those prep schools, those kids, it was their last chance, and they had to make
it.  
  
I'm really proud to say that we had a lot of kids going to Division I programs
and play at a high level and they're doing great in the business sector and in
the community. Some of them still playing pro.  
  
It was a great time for me, man. It was two really good experiences. It made
me a hard worker and made me appreciate winning.  
  
Q. What have you taken from this weekend that you're going to apply to
the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH HILLSMAN: I think the biggest thing that we have to understand is that
from this game we know we've got to make shots. The games you don't make shots
and you don't shoot a great percentage you're going to have a hard time
winning that game. We need to shoot 40-some odd percent to have a chance to
win this game.  
  
We were at 30 percent again, and we can't shoot the ball that way against a
really good team like this. And a bad shot for them is like an outlet pass, so
you've got to take really good shots, get the ball in the net, get your
defense set. More than anything that's important and we know we can play with
anybody. We never thought that we couldn't. So that's just a moot point for
us.  
  
TIANA MANGAKAHIA: I think a lot of us have learned the importance of recovery
and stretching. I think it's really tough playing three games in a row. And we
just need to make sure we take care of our bodies after games and as well on
the court, just play to the very end and try to take away what they're good
at. So take away the high-low action, the lob, all of that stuff. And just
recover properly and be prepared for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Notre Dame can hurt you in so many different positions. Do you try to
steer the ball and pick your poison as far as who is going to take shots or do
you just have to take what comes?  
COACH HILLSMAN: No. It's tough because they have so much balance. They have so
much balance. And we really wanted to try to pack the paint some. When you've
got shooters on the perimeter that can make shots, we can talk about it and
say this is what we're going to do. But it's kind of hard to not start easing
out a little bit to the perimeter to take care some of those perimeter shots.  
  
But at the end of the day they have a lot of balance. It's hard to sit on one
thing. But we did try to pack the paint and try to play off the high post a
little bit. But they did a good job getting the ball to the high post and
getting the ball out to the perimeter and attacking us off the bounce. They
did a good job. That's what good teams do. Whatever you give them, they
capitalized on it and they did.  
  
Q. What can you say about the depth of the ACC this year, playing a
tough schedule all season long? Where do you think the ACC rates compared to
years past and the rest of the conferences this season?  
COACH HILLSMAN: The rest of the conferences, they ain't close. That shouldn't
be in the conversation. There's not a conference that's close to this
conference from top to bottom. When you think about the teams that have new
coaches and the turnarounds, (indiscernible), Clemson, NCAA Tournament team.
They should be in.  
  
And Pitt, they're playing hard and they've been aggressive and they're playing
a different style of basketball but they're doing a good job there. And I
think the top of our conference is -- they've got two to three teams that
could be in the Final Four. So nothing surprises me with this conference or
what can happen towards the end of the season because this is a very strong
conference. I don't think it's close.  
  
Q. So you're talking about, like, facing a balanced team like Notre Dame
and stuff. So how, when you get in the NCAA Tournament, will you go ahead and
change what you're going and try to go ahead and fix your issues with that,
when in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH HILLSMAN: We don't have to change it because it ain't going to be Notre
Dame.  
  
Q. Like other teams and stuff. I'm sure you're going to face other
balanced teams?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Sure. Yes, definitely going to face balanced teams. But I
don't know if we're going to face any team that's going to be as good at all
five positions as Notre Dame is. I wasn't really trying to be funny or
sarcastic. I'm just being honest. They're just a really good team.  
  
They have scorers at all five positions and they're going to be Notre Dame and
I think they'll be able to play some of our same schemes and not get hurt so
much in those positions.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

### [Dana Evans](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36629)

### [Asia Durr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30724)

### [Sam Fuehring](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34733)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Louisville - 75, Clemson - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Louisville head coach Jeff Walz and student-
athletes Dana Evans, Sam Fuehring and Asia Durr.  
  
COACH WALZ: I'd like to thank everyone that's here today covering our
conference tournament. I truly believe it's the best conference tournament in
women's basketball hands down this year. Having a number one RPI, it's not
something that just comes around. It's something you earn. And every team in
this conference has helped us earn that.  
  
Clemson is a team that without a doubt will be playing in the NCAA Tournament
-- 9-7 in our league, it's not easy to do. So I'm looking forward now to being
a fan of Amanda and her program when that draw comes out, because I really
think the ACC can do some great things in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
For this ballgame tonight, you know, you've got to give Clemson a lot of
credit. They came out, played with a lot of passion, a lot of heart, did some
things tonight that they had done in the past, but really attacked us and took
it at us. And we did not respond well. And that's something that we talked
about as a staff and as players that we've got to make some quick changes real
fast.  
  
Whatever they did to prepare for this game, they need to change it, because it
did not work. And I'm challenging them, because right now there is no, I
didn't give great effort. When you lose, you're going home.  
  
So now we've got to fix that. I thought the fourth quarter we played extremely
well. Defensively, they did what we asked them do. We tried to make Clemson
take more perimeter shots than layups after three quarters; I hoped our
players could realize that they could go by them and shoot a layup and make
it. That's exactly what they did for three quarters. And credit to Clemson
because they kept attacking. Finally we had better positioning on the ball and
made them shoot contested outside shots.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Can you talk about your team's dominance offensively and defensively
in the fourth quarter? You outscored them 21-7.  
COACH WALZ: I thought we finally did exactly what we were trying to do
defensively, and that was make them shoot contested outside shots. We finally
got our feet on the 3-point line. We stopped dribble penetration.  
  
And I thought Sam did a great job of not fouling as players drove to the
basket. She went straight up, contested the shot. And then Bionca was great on
the glass in that fourth quarter. She came up with some really great boards.  
  
And we had some big-time offensive rebounds as well. Durr gets her own on the
one shot. And all of a sudden we've taken about 50 seconds off that clock at a
critical time.  
  
So we're just going to have to continue to get better. I thought we executed
well a few times in that fourth quarter, which we're going to have to do a
much better job tomorrow.  
  
Q. How much did Edwards leaving this game in the fourth quarter affect
the outcome of it, in your opinion?  
COACH WALZ: Well, I think she went out with the last two minutes or something.
I'm not sure how much time there was. But up to that point I thought we had
done a really nice job. We stopped trying to fight with her and tried to stop
her in the full court. And then we backed off of her.  
  
Because she's really quick. She loves to penetrate and then do an up-and-under
move. And we finally picked her up maybe half court but did give her a head of
steam to get going by us. I thought in the fourth quarter we did a real good
job on everybody.  
  
Q. Sam, 12 rebounds. You were really going to war with them inside
there. Talk about the nature of having to battle some very good post
players.  
COACH WALZ: 14 of them, 14 rebounds. Not 12.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Thanks, Coach. Battling against Clemson, it's really hard
because they're nonstop. They just keep going. But I don't know. I give a
shout-out to Katie, our strength coach, because my vertical is getting higher,
I guess.  
  
But it was really hard, especially offensively. I don't usually -- I feel like
I don't usually get that much. I haven't since last year. But it felt good to
know that I still have it in me to just pursue the ball.  
  
Q. We talked Tuesday night about Clemson. What did they do differently
this time around when you guys played them two weeks ago?  
COACH WALZ: I thought they attacked us off the dribble a lot more. They really
tried to get to the glass and use dribble penetration more than they had when
we played at Clemson. And then for us, we didn't do a very good job for three
quarters of staying in front of them and making them shoot pull-up jump shots
contested.  
  
And then when they get going and get excited, I mean, they play with a lot of
passion. Like I say, Amanda's done a remarkable job. That's the one thing. You
add Simone Westbrook, who is a very good player. Her savviness, she
understands the game; she'll bait you into something.  
  
What I admire about her game is she's not the fastest thing in the world, but
it's like I tell my players. She changes speed so well that she'll slow up
almost to like she's just in a walk. And when she does make a move, it's
explosive. So she knows how to change speeds at several levels.  
  
But you add Simone and then everybody else for the most part is returning from
last year's team. And Amanda's got them playing a style of basketball that
fits them. She's up. She's pressing. She's attacking.  
  
And it's a credit to her. That's why she was coach of the year in our league
because she did a remarkable job with those young women.  
  
Q. Asia and Dana, you win the fastbreak points battle here 12-0.
Especially early on, you were really getting fast on them. What did you see in
their defense that allowed them to do that?  
ASIA DURR: Well, we were just trying to create tempo and get some cheap ones.
Dana was doing a great job of pushing the ball up the floor. So that's what we
were trying to do. Coach Walz has always preached to us tempo. So I think we
did a good job of that tonight.  
  
DANA EVANS: I think with the eight to 12 transition points that we did get,
Coach Walz always talks about how we need to get eight or 10 easy points. I
think we focus more on trying to get transition points and pushing the tempo
to get those points.  
  
Q. I think when the other teams played, I know people want to have the
bye in the first round. But sometimes when other teams play, sometimes we have
games like this where it takes. Did you feel like maybe that was the case
maybe a little bit today where you guys really started finally clicking in the
fourth quarter?  
COACH WALZ: I do like to have a chance to play. Like I do like having coming
off and played, because there are a lot of games like this where it's the
first time out there, your first time going through it. But I can't use that
as an excuse.  
  
I thought Clemson outplayed us for three quarters. I thought their effort was
better than ours. There were a few plays where they had four players on the
ground and until Mykasa Robinson came in the game we didn't see the floor; we
just bent down and tried to pick it up. And Mykasa finally started to dive on
the floor, which I thought got the rest of us to realize how hard you have to
play.  
  
Clemson just did a really nice job of coming out and attacking us. It's like I
said, they put that thing on the floor. They shoot 15 free throws to our nine.
But in the fourth quarter we finally started to give that effort defensively
and we started talking. There were several times where we gave up -- just a
dribble handoff, and we didn't communicate. Two went with one and somebody
went down and shot a layup.  
  
And I'm sitting over there going, I can't coach that. I don't know what to
tell them because we've talked about it the entire year. And we lead our
league in defense, it's about 54 points a night. And they had 60 at the start
of the third quarter and we talked about that.  
  
So I was proud of them, because you've got a choice there to either keep
fighting or throw in the towel. And I had no doubt that we would keep fighting
and these young women did a remarkable job to get a W.  
  
Q. Dana and Sam and Asia, could you talk about the second to final
sequence where everybody seemed to expect a foul? You drove coast to coast and
dished to Jazmine and everybody seemed very confused by that. Were you
confused as well?  
DANA EVANS: I was sort of confused -- actually, I don't know about that. They
were really aggressive and they were trying to reach in. But it kind of
backfired because they didn't call a foul at the end when they were trying to
foul. I was just trying to use as much clock as I can and I just saw Jaz
running so I gave it to her for a layup.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: I thought we were going to pull it out. There was about eight
people in the back court and Jaz just kept running. Good for her. But I didn't
know what was going on at that time. I should have. But I thought it was,
like, less time and then I looked up and it was, like, 24 seconds. And I was
just going with the flow.  
  
COACH WALZ: If that makes you all feel a little nervous, how do you think it
makes me feel when she goes I wasn't sure what was going on? You give me a
bunch of confidence right there, Sam.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: I was following everyone else. I was literally following
everyone else. Everyone's back there, okay, I'll be with you.  
  
Q. You talked to your local media about this, but for Asia to win player
of the year in this league two years in a row in a league that's this stocked
with talent and now everybody is just looking at where that places her, and I
guess you could say the hierarchy of great Louisville players. Can you put it
in perspective how big of an accomplishment that is?  
COACH WALZ: It's pretty amazing because this is one of the best leagues, I
think the best league, if you look at just what we've done the past two years.
And for Asia to be able to do what she's done and get back-to-back player of
the years, it's pretty amazing. And she'll be the first to tell you, too, we
have a pretty darned good basketball team.  
  
Some people are, like, how can you finish second in the league and not have
more than one player on the all-conference team. I tell them it's easy. We
have six players that averaged between 10.5 and 7.6 points a game. Every
single one of them have had a night where they scored 15 or more. That's why
we're good. Because who do you not guard?  
  
And if you look at our stat sheet tonight it's the same. Sam Fuehring has
eight. Bionca has eight. A.C. has 10. Jaz has 8. Durr had 24. And Dana has 15.
We've got three players one bucket away from a double-figure night and we'd
have six in double figures.  
  
So I know the one thing I will say about her is she's as humble as any player
that I've ever been around. She's always complimenting her teammates. I think
when you're as talented as she is and you're as humble as she is, your
teammates are excited for her.  
  
Our game on Thursday night, our last home game, it was pretty neat to watch,
because her teammates were looking for her and getting shots, stuff you can't
-- you either know how to do as a player or you don't.  
  
And it's fun when you've got players that are looking for you and setting you
up. And then you want to talk about our hierarchy of players, you've got Angel
McCoughtry. She's a two-time Olympic gold medalist on top of what she did
here. So that's pretty impressive.  
  
And now we're going to try and make a run to win this thing, be back-to-back
ACC Tournament champs, but we know we'll have a tough game tomorrow. This is a
program that I don't think it ever won regular season back-to-back
championships, co-championships. So I think that puts all of them pretty high
within our program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Nicki Ekhomu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36635)

### [Morgan Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36636)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
NC State - 69, Florida State - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Florida State coach Sue Semrau and student-
athletes Nicki Ekhomu and Morgan Jones. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH SEMRAU: I want to compliment NC State. What Wes has done with that team,
they just continue to fight and played great defense.  
  
It was a great experience for us, though. It was an experience with a very
young team to come in and play a top 10 team and to compete at that level. You
could see the immaturity in our team. We'll continue to grow, and this will be
a great teaching tool going forward to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Looked like you struggled to cope with Cunane's height, especially
early when she really established herself there.  
COACH SEMRAU: We struggled when Valencia Myers got her second foul. She didn't
play that whole half. So that was tough for us. We're not very deep in the
post. They're not very deep in the post. They did a better job of not fouling.  
  
Q. You talked about what an experience, a good experience this has been
with such a young team. If you could put in perspective what this whole season
has been like, because I don't think very many people expected you guys to be
in the place you are.  
COACH SEMRAU: I appreciate that. And they didn't. And how could you, with the
youth and then the three major injuries that we had. Makes me very proud. My
juniors have carried a very heavy load and done a great job doing it, to be in
a position to go and compete in the NCAA Tournament with this young team.
Really excited to have 23 wins on the year and 10 in the ACC. I think they
have accomplished a lot this year.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
NC State - 69, Florida State - 62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by NC State coach Wes Moore as well as student-
athletes Elissa Cunane, Aislinn Konig and DD Rogers. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH MOORE: Proud of the way we hung in there. Obviously very frustrated with
the first quarter. We gave up 24 points. And then very proud the second and
the third period, did just a great job defensively. And in the fourth period
again we gave up a few too many points.  
  
A lot of those came off of turnovers in the fourth period. We've got to do a
better job taking care of the ball in those innovations.  
  
Really proud of this group. It's always tough when you've sat around for a
couple of days, the other team's played a game. I think they have an
advantage, especially in the first period. And I thought our kids bounced
back, kept their confidence, and just did a great job. So they've done it all
year long. And it was good for us to get off to a good start tonight and get
to play another day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. DD, for you, obviously the final game of the season for you on senior
night, you finished with over 20 points and 14 rebounds in that game. You go
into this one, how much confidence did you have in yourself after having that
kind of performance that you could do it again with another double-double
tonight?  
DD ROGERS: Yeah, I definitely came off that game feeling very confident in
myself and in my team in general. I played off of them knowing they'll be
there to play off me as well. Just take it one step at a time. I definitely
felt good about this game coming into it.  
  
Q. What adjustments, if any, did you make from the first time you played
Florida State to tonight?  
COACH MOORE: Well, we tried to play pick on the ball a little bit different.
Down there, we were probably too passive with our defense and allowed them to
get some open 3s. And down there I probably should have adjusted better in the
second half. And tonight we did take a little bit different approach.  
  
And I thought our players did a great job executing it for the most part. I
know we gave up a couple of 3s there late in the game that was a little
disappointing when we were really in a no-3 situation. But for the most part,
definitely in the second and third quarters anyway, did a pretty nice job. So
I think that was a big factor.  
  
Down there, again, it was tough, too, we lost Erika Cassell and it was tough
on the team emotionally and tonight was different from that standpoint.  
  
Q. Elissa, you came out for the opening tip with a big smile on your
face, and that's kind of the last emotion I expected. Did you battle any
nerves at all?  
ELISSA CUNANE: Yes, I was nervous before the game but as soon as I stepped on
the court those just disappeared and it's just playing the game of basketball
like I do every single day.  
  
Q. Kiara Leslie only had four points in the first half. How were you
able to pick up where she left off with her production?  
AISLINN KONIG: She's a really great player and a lot of times she leads us in
scoring and does a lot of great things. I think we moved the ball well and
we're finding open shots and definitely feeding off the fact that Elissa was
scoring in the paint a lot.  
  
And then DD was able to get some good points too. So I think we were able to
move the ball and find the people who were scoring. And Ki was able to pick it
up on defense and really help us there and keep us in the game.  
  
COACH MOORE: Ki was struggling with some stomach pain, too. That's why she
came out for a little bit there in the first half. And so I know she struggled
with that most of the night. But I think she'll be okay for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Elissa, you get to come back here close to home and have such a good
game in your first ACC Tournament play. What's that feeling like to be able to
show out like that here?  
ELISSA CUNANE: It's very special for me to play in front of my friends and
family, and what this team is doing is special. It means a lot to me and I'm
excited to see where we go.  
  
Q. A lot of players played over -- five players played over 34 minutes
tonight. For the players, how do your legs feel? And, Coach, can you keep this
up for two more days to win the championship?  
COACH MOORE: From my standpoint, it's one game at a time. So our main goal was
to win this game tonight. And then obviously tomorrow our goal will be to try
to win that game and we're not really worried about Sunday yet. We've got to
take them one at a time.  
  
And obviously every team at this point in this tournament is really, really
good, including Florida State tonight. So I don't know if you guys want to add
to that.  
  
ELISSA CUNANE: My legs feel great. I'm excited.  
  
Q. Ais, you hit that 3 in the second half that kind of kick-started a
big run. And then after Florida State hit a 3 you had that and-one. So two big
timely plays. How big was that for you guys to be able to halt their runs and
go on runs of your own with your big shots?  
AISLINN KONIG: I think our team as a whole does a really good job of finding
the open player and being able to create energy. So Ki was able to pick up
that rebound and throw it down. And that energy really I think, the whole team
was able to feed off of it but also that wouldn't have been anything -- that
and-one wouldn't have been as exciting as it was if my teammates hadn't been
there and reacted the way they did and celebrated with me.  
  
Q. Wes, I'm guessing a big part of your game plan was to go to Elissa on
the low block there. But where in the plan was it called for her to drift out
and take that 3-pointer there with the game on the line?  
COACH MOORE: We're comfortable with Elissa taking the 3. Obviously we like her
on the block. And probably second half I probably did a poor job of getting
her touches.  
  
We had a hard time running our stuff in the second half. I thought Florida
State got in the passing lanes and pressured us some and at times we were a
little disconboluated -- if I said that right.  
  
AISLINN KONIG: Discombobulated.  
  
COACH MOORE: You got my point. I thought, again, we should have got the ball
more, probably should have got DD the ball more because they were playing
really well tonight. And I felt the matchups were good in there for them.  
  
Q. Elissa, you had a couple big games down the stretch against good
teams, twice against Florida State, that Notre Dame game. Is there something
about those opponents that brings something out of you?  
ELISSA CUNANE: I just think during those games I've had the opportunity to
step up and my teammates have done a great job finding me. It means a lot to
me to be able to impact my team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Emese Hof](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32656)

### [Beatrice Mompremier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30896)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 92, Miami - 85  
  
THE MODERATOR: We now have Miami, head coach Katie Meier and student-athletes
Emese Hof and Beatrice Mompremier.  
  
COACH MEIER: A lot of talent on that basketball court today. I mean, that had
to be amazing to watch. Huge credit to Syracuse. Tiana, my God, like that was
a performance for the ages. She's responsible for probably, what is that, 50
to 60 points of their 90.  
  
And we know that. So here's a credit to her. We know that. That was the entire
game plan. We had 17 different schemes. And she still just controlled the
entire game.  
  
And I think the game -- as a coach, you don't take a lead in that game and
then not win it. So that's -- it's bitter for us because we did a ton, a ton
of adjustments and the team was responding to every single one of them, not
just in the first half but definitely in the second half. They responded and
played with courage and executed the game plan and made timely shots and
everything.  
  
Then it came down to Miranda Drummond and Kelsey Marshall. It did. Miranda
Drummond comes down and hits two 3s. And we get two for Kelsey, and she misses
them. There's the game.  
  
I'm not saying Miranda won the game and Kelsey lost the game. But in a game
like that -- two wide-open 3s by your best shooters, right? Kelsey Marshall's
a great 3-point shooter and Miranda Drummond is a great 3-point shooter. And
if that goes 2-for-2 for Miami, 0-for-2 for Syracuse we win. And that was a
huge moment.  
  
I'm disappointed because we left the reservation a little bit. What got us the
comeback and what got us the lead we didn't do enough in the last four
minutes. So I'm disappointed in my team's response there and lack of a
possession awareness. But hopefully we'll live to play another day and take
that lesson and learn from it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, I guess particularly talk about when Syracuse shoots
3-pointers like this, how difficult that is. And how does a game like this
prepare you going into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH MEIER: You know, you get that draw. We've gotten the draw a lot where we
find a team that is reliant on the 3. We've got our double big coming up --
I'm sorry, but let me talk about how amazing these two were. I mean, my God,
just warriors. And smart. And moving off of each other and playing off each
other.  
  
I will answer your question. But there's no way I'm not going to get up here
and tell each of you how much I love you and how proud I am of you and how
unbelievable that performance was. It was amazing.  
  
The question being, the second half, Syracuse we can withstand. I think we did
some stuff to break the rhythm. There was four inches of a basketball game in
the first half that we gave to Syracuse. That's four inches on a 3-point
shooting team. We did not have enough urgency for that last four inches of our
closeout.  
  
So they made them. And in the second half I was screaming about four inches.
It was -- I mean I wanted to fly a plane with a banner that said "Take those
four inches, Miami," because once we took those four inches away, they were
human and not superhuman.  
  
Q. If both players could answer this: Obviously you guys have had a
great season so far. And it's not over yet. But, in particular, what the two
of you are looking for in terms of going to the NCAA Tournament. You don't
know who you're going to play yet, but you know you can play with the best
teams in the country. How confident do you guys feel like you guys can make a
run in the NCAA Tournament?  
EMESE HOF: I think we are confident. But we need to work on a lot to be able
to pull that off. No one can relax. And we see that today. You're probably
going to face a team like Syracuse. And like for me and Bea, that's adjusting
-- because like one of us -- usually Bea, sorry -- has to defend on the
perimeter. And that's different play-style. And, too, post we just defend down
low. However, I am confident we can make a run in the tournament. And it's all
we've got left.  
  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: Just going out there and competing, focus on what we have
in front of us instead of moving on to the next game, just going out there and
competing.  
  
COACH MEIER: Did I give enough credit to Syracuse? What a performance. I'm
going to hang my head because I think there's some things we could have
controlled, including offensive rebounds in the last three minutes of that
game. But my God, you've got the Tiana thing you've got to solve and all of a
sudden Strautmane steps up and then Drummond starts hitting. And then the
offensive rebounds by Maeva. Three offensive rebounds. So they're very, very
good.  
  
This should not make Miami seem what's wrong with Miami. We've lost to NC
State, who is very, very good. And Syracuse is very, very good. And we
generated opportunities that we could have been on the other side of that.  
  
We're not rocked, but I do think in times like this, sometimes the losing team
doesn't give enough credit to the winning team. And I'm -- all hail Syracuse;
they're good. So is Miami.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Brianna Turner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28843)

### [Arike Ogunbowale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32683)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 95, North Carolina - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Notre Dame coach Muffet McGraw and student-
athletes Arike Ogunbowale and Brianna Turner. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH MCGRAW: I thought offensively we did a lot of good things. We were able
to see the mismatch, get the ball to Bri. She had a fantastic game, 11 for 15
from the field. Really did a nice job pinning and taking advantage of whoever
was guarding her. I was disappointed in our defense, but I thought Paris Kea
is a phenomenal player, a great guard and a tough matchup for us. She had
another great game. I was happy we held her to 27 this time instead of 30.  
  
Q. Coach, it looked like you tried a lot of different things on Paris --
zone, man, rotating defenders, even Brianna at stretches. What was the idea,
just to make her work harder or did you feel like one was more successful than
another?  
COACH MCGRAW: I didn't think any of them were successful. I think we were
trying to find something that worked and we weren't able to.  
  
Q. Just talk about you guys lost to North Carolina last time. Do you
feel like today you had some determination to get a little revenge from losing
to them down here a couple months, a month ago?  
COACH MCGRAW: Yeah, absolutely. I think we were happy to see them on our side
of the bracket. And it was great to have Jackie Young go for almost a triple
double. We clearly missed her in the last game. No excuses on that loss; they
played well. And they played well today but we just shot the ball better
today.  
  
Q. We know that this is sort of the second season. In terms of marking
the success and the steps that your team is taking as you guys go for the
ultimate goal, what are your measurements, what are you looking at?  
COACH MCGRAW: We're trying to find some people that wanted to defend. I think
that's the thing we're probably lacking right now is the ability to shut down
a really good player. We haven't really had that all year. We're trying a lot
of different things see what we can come up with. But that's probably the one
area that now I'd like to see improve.  
  
Q. Players, been there, done that. What are you guys saying amongst one
another in terms of reiterating what coach is hoping to see as you guys
progress?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think we're just talking to each other, wanting to play
hard, play together and try to execute Coach's and the rest of the coaching
staff's game plan.  
  
BRIANNA TURNER: I agree. We have to be able to get a stop. We're going to have
tougher games down the road, too. We have to come together as a team and make
sure we're playing hard on D and make sure we're winning the rebounding battle
as well.  
  
Q. Tomorrow, what's the most dangerous thing about Syracuse in terms of
that matchup?  
COACH MCGRAW: I'd say the 3-point shooting. They're so dangerous. But really
Mangakahia, she's a terrific guard and she's a triple-double possibility every
single game. She really can see the floor. She's got tremendous vision. She
can score. She can drive it. She makes everybody on their team better.  
  
And they have some really good weapons. So I think those are the two things
that are my main concern.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned a little earlier having Jackie, but it just
seems like the way she's able to impact from every single level of the game,
we're seeing that game after game from her. Can you sort of put that in
perspective about how she's raised her level at everything across the board?  
COACH MCGRAW: She really has. I think she's an incredibly complete basketball
player. She can defend, rebound, score and pass. She can do everything, and we
put her in a lot of different spots. In the last game, she played 1, 2, 3 and
4, depending on who is in the game. She can play the point just as easily as
go inside.  
  
She's kind of the glue that really keeps us together. She's probably the one
common denominator that we like to have on the floor.  
  
Q. North Carolina is going to be playing in the tournament for the first
time most likely in four years in a couple of weeks. What sort of challenges
do you think they can pose for opponents moving forward?  
COACH MCGRAW: I think they're going to be a really tough out. I wouldn't like
to see them again. I think that they can score in a lot of different ways.
They can defend. They can run the ball. They can slow it down. They've got an
inside/outside presence. They've got terrific guards. And I think they're
going to be a really good team in the tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 92, Miami - 85  
  
THE MODERATOR: To my left is Coach Quentin Hillsman and student-athletes Tiana
Mangakahia, Gabrielle Cooper and Digna Strautmane.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: Guys, obviously you're here this time of year just to survive
and advancing. You've got to give Miami a lot of credit. They're a great
basketball team. And it's one of those deals where you're in the best
conference in the country, the best teams in the country and unfortunately one
of us has to go home today because Katie does an amazing job and those kids
are really tough and good players.  
  
Our team, we just gotta get out. We knew we had to make shots. We knew -- the
first game we played them at our place we just didn't make shots. And we know
when we can make shots we can get into our pressure and force tempo. And that
was the biggest thing we wanted to do. We just wanted to put the ball in the
basket so we can play defenses that we could call, not playing against an
unsettled floor the entire game.  
  
Just a lot of balance in this game. Players make plays, and our best players
stepped up today and they all played well. We could talk about five, six
different players in this game right now. So, I'm not going to bore you with
all of those because you all have the stats.  
  
But we knew we had to win the game. Our goal was to host the NCAA Tournament
at home and try to get back to a Final Four. We know that's the path is to
play at home for those first two rounds and we're just excited and really to
move on to tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, in the first quarter, Miami kind of took the lead pretty early
and you guys came back in the second quarter to have a 13- or 14-point lead at
halftime. What was the difference between those quarters?  
COACH HILLSMAN: Our interior defense really buckled down in the second
quarter. Did an amazing job in the post. Something we've been stressing to
them. But more importantly they just didn't let them score the ball around the
rim. They were making them take tough 2s and they were missing shots and
getting rebounds and running transition.  
  
And Tiana did a good job attacking the paint and finding shooters on the wing.
Tiana was just fantastic in this game, 25 and 13. And four assists -- four
turnovers in 39 minutes, that's just pro numbers. She just did a fantastic
job. And our players did a really good job of running the floor, give her
space to attack the paint.  
  
Q. I guess I'll start with you and anyone else who wants to answer.
You've said before that you don't feel like your team is playing its best
basketball. You said that about a week ago. Do you feel like today you hit
that mark?  
COACH HILLSMAN: We're getting better. We still have these spots to where we
don't make plays. We still let teams make some runs. But it's all about
toughness. All we talk about is toughness; what are you willing to do to save
a possession? They made a run. They took the lead. We came back and we made
our run.  
  
It's about playing tough. If we can put 40 minutes together, I think we've got
a real chance to do something special this year.  
  
TIANA MANGAKAHIA: Yeah, I think this time of the year is a lot different to
just regular season play. And like Coach Q said, toughness and grit really,
especially tomorrow we play the winner of this game and coming off a good game
we'll be confident. And just really pushing to the very end and giving it
everything we have. And I think that's going to help us get to the
championship game.  
  
GABRIELLE COOPER: I think now is the time we lock in. We're locking in,
focusing in, preparing better. We're just doing all the little things that we
probably didn't do exactly the right way we needed to before. So, we're just
locking in, trying to finish out, like you said.  
  
But there's still times we have plays we don't compete. But we only had, what,
eight turnovers this game. And we've been focusing on little things like that.
So we're hitting goals and marks that we need to. So we're just trying to
buckle down and be ready.  
  
DIGNA STRAUTMANE: I agree with what they said. It's like it's a different part
of a season and we just have to push through all the little things that we
didn't do. We have to just try to do better every situation. Like, in every
game we have to get better, like, in all those things. So it's the last moment
when we can show this season. So we have to do it.  
  
Q. Tiana, at one point they had Hof on you and Cornelius down low. How
hard is it for you to get the ball around the floor?  
TIANA MANGAKAHIA: I know which situation you're talking about. At the time,
like, obviously Maya was in the post and I was waiting for the clock to run
down a little longer. And, I mean, it's either I attack her or give it in and
let Amaya take on the guard. And I think at that time I threw it in to Amaya
and let her do what she does best.  
  
Q. Gabby, in the fourth quarter, you were involved in some plays that
probably won't show up in the stat sheets in terms of tipping the basketball
out, I think you got a block down the stretch. What kind of clicked for you as
the game was sort of the tightest?  
GABRIELLE COOPER: I'm a leader on this team. I know I have to make certain
plays. Certain plays you can't let go. So when I missed that 3 I'm, like, we
need this ball back. And I seen an opportunity for me to go get the rebound.
And I didn't think I was going to be able to grab it because the way the two
players coming at me were.  
  
I see Tiana quick at the top. I thought maybe I could get the tip to her I was
able to do that. That made me happy. Like you said, it's the latter part of
the season. We're just really trying to focus in and grind in. So every little
play counts. And we're really trying to focus on every little single play.  
  
I know I caught myself in the beginning in the first half, I shot the shot and
my rebound kind of came back my way. And I probably could have attacked it.
And I thought about that when the second time happened. It's like, I've got to
get it this time; I can't let it happen again. We're trying to bypass every
little mistake we can.  
  
Q. Tiana, after Miami came back from 15 down in the second half and took
the lead in the fourth quarter, what were you wanting to do at that juncture
to get the lead back quickly?  
TIANA MANGAKAHIA: I just wanted to move the ball and really attack them
because that's what was working for us, attacking them. But I knew Gabby and
Miranda were both hurt. They were shooting well. Gabby hit one down the
stretch at the top of the key and that really helped us get the good vibes
back in the game. So, yeah, just sticking to what we're good at, attacking and
dishing and just playing everyone's strengths.  
  
Q. You guys keep talking about it being the sort of the second season
and rightfully so. But you can't just become who you aren't overnight. In what
ways through the course of the year have you guys prepared for this moment?  
TIANA MANGAKAHIA: I think a lot of ways, our preseason games that we played
were really strong and that definitely helped us. I think the tournaments that
we went to, Cancun and Florida, both prepared us for this tournament to have
tough games and to push through those adverse times.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Sylvia Hatchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15656)

### [Paris Kea](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32666)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Notre Dame - 95, North Carolina - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina Coach Sylvia Hatchell and
student-athlete Paris Kea. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH HATCHELL: Once again, thanks to all the Greensboro folks for doing a
great job here. The ACC, the Greensboro Sports Council, the coliseum people,
they continue doing an awesome job. They've got it down to perfection. I want
to make sure we don't take that for granted. So thanks to all those guys.  
  
It was a hard-fought game against a great Notre Dame team, and they show why
they won the national championship last year and why they're just so good.  
  
I thought we battled really hard, especially in the first half, and pretty
much first few minutes of the second half we kept fighting back and fighting
back. But thought we ran out of gas a little bit probably playing back-to-back
from yesterday because the rebounds were even and at the end of the game they
outrebounded us by 12.  
  
I'm proud of my team. Bailey, Bennett and Paris all had really good shooting.
We shot right at 50 percent. That's pretty good against Notre Dame that we
shot 50 percent. But we couldn't stop them. We couldn't stop their inside
game.  
  
They're big and strong and really, really tough right around the basket. But
the fact that as a team we only had 11 turnovers. That's pretty good there. So
you look at all the positives.  
  
But I think we're peaking at the right time, even though we don't have Watts
rights now, but we're expecting to have her back for the NCAA Tournament, but
I think we're peaking right now. And we're looking forward to the NCAA. We've
had a really, really tough schedule. I think today it was ranked eighth. It's
been anywhere between four and eight throughout the whole year. I think it
probably went up playing Notre Dame today.  
  
But our strength of schedule has been tremendous. And our RPI is really,
really good, too. So we're looking forward to Selection Monday and playing in
the NCAA.  
  
But it was a great Notre Dame team. It was hard-fought. And they showed why --
and they're very experienced. Gosh, what, four seniors, I think, out there.
They started four seniors. And so they're just really, really tough and a
great shooting team. But we battled hard. We fought hard. And we're looking
forward to the tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Obviously it's been a couple years since you were in the NCAA
Tournament. How good does it feel to have a team that's headed back there in a
couple of weeks?  
COACH HATCHELL: You're right. We went through a lot with the -- because we
were top team in the country there until the NCAA thing hit, and we went
through a lot there. But we persevered through it. It's over. And we're back
to being one of the top teams, I feel like, in the country.  
  
And our league is just so, so tough. And the fact that Paris is our only
senior and we've got a great class coming in. Now we will definitely miss this
young lady, no doubt about it.  
  
But I just told the team in the locker room, I would not want to play us in
the NCAA Tournament, because we're capable of beating anybody. We showed that
by playing like we did. If we hadn't played back-to-back we probably would
have had a little more gas there in the second half. But we're looking forward
to it because I feel like we're just peaking right now.  
  
We get Stephanie back that will give us even a little more firepower out
there. And we're looking forward to it and I think it's going to be a lot of
fun for this group of kids.  
  
Q. I was curious, Leah Church hardly played today after a career high
yesterday. What was the situation there?  
COACH HATCHELL: We started her and she was out there. But she wasn't getting
any looks. Leah is a zone buster. She's a shooter and zone buster. And
defensively they were posting her up some. A little bit of difference in the
size made a little bit of a difference there.  
  
But she wasn't getting some open looks. So I made that switch. I put Jocelyn
in there because of the rebounding, of her physicality and the rebounding and
all that there. And Leah played what, 11, 12 minutes something like that. But
she got a couple of shots. Where was she, Church, 0-for-2. She was in there
for 13 minutes.  
  
But she wasn't getting the looks and all. So I felt like we needed Jocelyn's
size and rebounding and everything like that. So that's really -- but if you
play us a zone and she gets open looks, that's when she's deadly.  
  
Q. Paris, how do things change on offense when you get Janelle back in
the mix, and how do you think she played today?  
PARIS KEA: Janelle played good today. Looks like she had a pretty good
shooting night. So, when she's in the game she can stretch the floor for us.
Turner had to come out and guard her. Whoever was guarding her, the lane was
basically open for me.  
  
Q. Paris, having Shayla out there, she has 17 points, how does that open
up more looks for you having another good guard?  
PARIS KEA: I guess if I'm being trapped or face guarded and I'm not having any
open looks, she takes care of business.  
  
Q. How important is it going to be opening up you guys as more of a
dynamic offense if you have Stephanie back for the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH HATCHELL: She definitely helps us because her size. And right when she
got hurt, she was -- of course she's a great 3-point shooter and driving to
the basket -- but her defense had really, really come around and she was
really helping us tremendously.  
  
The last time we played Notre Dame, I mean, when the ball, when they were
doing their high-low and throwing it into their post players, she was there.
She was on weak-side defense. She was reading the passes and she would be
there lots of times when they threw it into the post players.  
  
And so we miss her defense as much as we miss her offense. So having her back
would really, really help us out. So we're hoping that she'll be able to play,
of course be a couple of weeks. But the first time we play will be, I guess,
will be week from tomorrow. So we're hoping we'll have her back by then.  
  
Q. After the NC State game you talked about the keyword for you guys is
healthy. Having this big stretch of time off before the tournament, how
important will that be for you guys to be back to where you were in that week
before you beat NC State?  
COACH HATCHELL: You must have been in our locker room. I just talked to them
about using the time that we have -- of course next week is spring break, but
we'll go Monday and Tuesday and I'm going to give them a little time off. I
said, this is our time to heal up and get ready to come back and have a few
good practices and go play.  
  
But that is one of the things that I addressed in the locker room because
we're a little bit banged up and all that. But we will definitely do that. And
a lot of them will be in treatments and everything else.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [Simone Westbrook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36628)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Louisville - 75, Clemson - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: I'd like to welcome to the stage Clemson head coach Amanda
Butler and student-athlete Simone Westbrook.  
  
COACH BUTLER: Just really, really proud of my team. Obviously the outcome is
not what we wanted and not what we were fighting for, but they're pretty
dadgum good. We got beat by a really good team, really good staff. But I don't
think we have anything to hang our heads about. Really proud of our effort.  
  
I thought we fought through a lot of adversity, battled foul trouble the whole
time and we never let any of those reasons be a distraction from what we were
trying to do, and that's just continue to battle, continue to fight, continue
to be the ugly ducklings and the Fighting Tigers. A lot to be proud of, a lot
to look forward to, and we'll go back to Clemson and do what we've done all
year long and that's just try to get better every day.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. For three quarters your team did a really good job at getting into
the paint and getting layups. And then in the fourth, what did they do to take
that away?  
COACH BUTLER: Well, they really kind of started sagging off of us a little bit
more, in particular our screeners, and just trying to really clog the paint.
They were a lot more spread out the first part of the ballgame and took some
of our good looks from 3 away, which is something we've been doing really well
here lately.  
  
And then they just kind of flipped the script in the last part of the
ballgame, second half, fourth quarter in particular, made it much tougher for
us to get in there and finish.  
  
And, guys, this is one of the best defensive teams in the country, as well. So
as much as we just -- we like to say we're just trying to be us, Louisville
was just Louisville and played great defense when it mattered most.  
  
Q. Can you kind of put in perspective -- when you came in here, it's not
even been a year, did you think you'd be sitting here in the position you're
in, potentially getting an NCAA Tournament berth, and playing a protected No.
1 seed right to the wire basically?  
COACH BUTLER: We just didn't really approach it like that on the front end. I
think that on the front end we just wanted to agree to things that we were in
control of. And that was daily improvement.  
  
How much we were going to love each other and what that was going to look like
and that when we did get an opportunity to compete against someone besides
ourselves, we wanted to make that competition to be Clemson's best and not as
much about our opponent.  
  
The last thing that we wanted to try to accomplish was whoever we were playing
-- at the beginning of the year, I'd be lying if I told you, we said, oh,
let's win this many games or try to finish in the top half or get this seed or
any of those things. We just said whenever we play somebody let's make sure
they know who they're playing. Let's make sure when that game is over they
know who they were competing against.  
  
And ultimately we don't always control the outcomes, especially when you're
playing against the best teams in the country. And in this league which makes
this league so special and gets us so ready for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
But on the front end, we agreed to the things that we wanted to give energy to
and that wasn't records or decisions that committees were going to make that
we didn't have any power over. We just wanted to just, every single day, work
really, really hard; love each other; and be proud of our university; and go
out and battle and compete whenever we get in those opportunities.  
  
Q. One of the things in women's basketball has been that when coaches,
when women coaches lose their jobs, a lot of times they did not get second
chances. And I asked Muffet McGraw about this earlier today, and she said,
you're a great example that she gives to people as somebody who had that
happen and then has come back. Can you talk about that? Because I do think
it's been an issue in women's basketball, that maybe the trend is starting to
change.  
COACH BUTLER: I would love to think that what this really special group of
women has accomplished this year and the administration at Clemson giving me a
chance to do what I love is a great example to other ADs across the country
that second chances, next opportunities, whatever those are, just hire the
best person for the job.  
  
And I'm really glad that you asked that question because I think that it has
been a really negative trend in our business that when women lose their jobs,
they don't get a similar second chance. And it's not as common in other ways
in sports.  
  
I'm just really, really grateful that Dan Radakovich and Stephanie Ellison
thought I was the right choice; that we have a group of women that, from day
one, made that transition for a new head coach and a new staff really, really
easy because they were eager, and they were just really wanting to figure out
how good they could be and wanted a chance to do that.  
  
But if I can be someone that somebody else looks at, whether that's the next
fired coach or whether that's an AD who goes, "Hey, that wasn't a bad idea,"
then I'm proud to be that.  
  
Q. Simone, can you talk about the confidence of this team? Because this
is such a hard league to play in. And obviously Clemson, the last several
years, has struggled to put together ACC wins to make the kind of jump you
guys did this year. Obviously it's taken some confidence. How did that build
over the season?  
SIMONE WESTBROOK: Well, we came together as a team and kind of looked at what
they did last year and ways they wanted to improve. And just every day in
practice we got better. Every game we found a new way to win.  
  
We would look at film and we would perfect our mistakes, and we would perfect
those in the next game and just try to find something to get better at. And,
ironically, we came up with "Ugly Ducklings" because we realized we're a
scrappy team; we're the team that's first to get on the floor and first to get
up.  
  
We found our niche in this league. And I think we're the only ones that could
do that. So we just tried to improve every practice, every game. And we always
try to be the tougher team. And I think that we really do that.

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Tina Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17406)

### [Jocelyn Willoughby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32640)

### [Dominique Toussaint](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36562)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 67, Virginia - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by head coach Tina Thompson followed by Jocelyn
Willoughby and Dominique Toussaint. Coach, a brief opening statement.  
  
COACH THOMPSON: I thought that my kids were tough today. We played a 40-minute
game. Of course, there were some things that we felt didn't go our way. But, I
mean, we're not the personality that we're going to make excuses about how the
game goes, whether we win or lose.  
  
But I thought that we played tough, that we did not back down at any point and
we continued to take the fight to Syracuse. Early on they shot the ball
extremely well. Their 3-point shots definitely put some distance between us
and them. But we recovered. And we continued to try to get to the things we do
well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, they employed that full-court press from the opening tip. Did
they employ it the same way during the regular season? And how did you see
that affect you guys especially early in the game?  
COACH THOMPSON: Well, no, I mean it's pretty much a very similar game plan
from the first game of the regular season. I think they did a lot more
substituting this game, which was pretty smart to kind of keep sending fresh
bodies at us considering the numbers that we have.  
  
But they didn't do much different. They shot the ball a little bit better this
game than they did up in Syracuse. But very similar game plan.  
  
Q. Coach or Dominique, Dominique, you got into foul trouble pretty early
in the second half. How did that change the pace of the game for you dies?  
DOMINIQUE TOUSSAINT: Personally, it was kind of difficult to get into a rhythm
when you have foul trouble like that. You play a little hesitant, especially
on defense, because you never know what the ref is going to call. But I knew
when I was on the bench I had to be ready for my team because I was going to
go back in.  
  
COACH THOMPSON: I just think it's pretty just tough to adjust when you feel
like the same things are happening on both ends and you're getting calls and
we're not. So it's not that we have to adjust to a complete, I guess, game in
the sense that you are -- there's a lot of foul calls or there are little and
it's very physical. So I personally didn't know how to tell her to guard in
general just because it was just tough.  
  
Q. Coach and Dom, when Dom got her fifth foul you met her at the bench,
you draped your arm over her shoulder. She's meant so much this year. What did
you tell her at that moment?  
COACH THOMPSON: I told her I was proud of her and she had a great season and
she played tough. Our team, when we talked about it quite a bit, just kind of
the obstacles that we face and the hurdles we've had to jump over. But my
girls show up every single day, competing and giving their absolute best.  
  
So it was just a "don't hang your head," because you have nothing to be
ashamed about; that you brought it today as you do every single day and that's
something to -- it's honorable. It's something to be proud of.  
  
Q. With Jocelyn Willoughby back into so many games the second half of
this season, the moment you got that fifth foul, what was that moment like for
you?  
DOMINIQUE TOUSSAINT: Well, I thought at that point I thought she was going to
score, so that's why I fouled her. But it was kind of just like a sad moment
because I had to come off the court one more time for the last time this year.
So it was just a sad moment.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Mark Simons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36588)

### [Chanin Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36589)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 80, Georgia Tech - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Georgia Tech. To my left is Coach Mark Simons
and Chanin Scott. And, Coach, just a brief review of the game and an opening
statement and we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH SIMONS: I thought our kids competed. I think we got great play off the
bench. We had kids come in, played great minutes for us. And I think it hurt
us that Elizabeth got in early foul trouble and we had to limit her minutes in
the first half. And then she wasn't herself when she came back. But I thought
that for the most part they hurt us with second shots. And then Paris Kea is a
heck of a player and she took over the game in the second half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, how big of a difference maker do you think the turnover margin
was today? UNC only turned it over five times. I think your team was forcing
it 18 times a game in ACC play.  
COACH SIMONS: They did a great job. They kept the ball in Kea's hands. We
tried to keep it out of her hands as best we could. We tried pressing them
before, and that's how we that's how we generate offense sometimes and
generate energy. But we knew that when we played them the first time that they
pretty much shredded our press and got open looks from 3.  
  
So we had to limit our pressing a little bit. We tried to do more trapping in
the quarter court. But, yeah, the turnover difference was, I think, they had
-- what did they have off turnovers? They had 15 points off turnovers to our
six. Usually we're at least in double digits.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk just a little bit about this last few weeks has
probably been tough in terms of keeping your team's focus and playing. They
played very well today. But can you just talk about what that's been like, you
know, going through that with them?  
COACH SIMONS: We just talked about that again. These kids were really
resilient. Okay? They binded together and as you saw today, I mean, they
really competed.  
  
Some kids had to play that hadn't ordinarily played and increased their
minutes and so on, and I thought these kids stay focused. They really did. Our
practices have been good. I think Chanin can attest to that.  
  
This is a great group of kids. This is really a great group of kids, and they
did an awesome job of staying the course, blinders on, let's go forward, let's
slide in the back door of the NCAA Tournament somehow.  
  
And we lost some tough games. We really did. We lost some tough games. But
these kids remained together. They remained together.  
  
Q. How has it been for you sliding back over into the head-coaching
seat?  
COACH SIMONS: Bob and I have known each other for a very long time. And I want
to say this as an aside because I know -- I think my kids actually tried to or
may have contacted the newspaper after all that what went down many years ago
because of your support.  
  
And it wasn't an easy transition. A year ago I was fishing, and I mean really
fishing, not fishing for a job. And this opportunity came up -- I was doing
some consulting -- and this came up. And I decided, what the heck?  
  
I have to be honest with you, it took me a minute. It took me a minute to move
over to the chair because I was used to being the other one, you know? But I
will tell you that from that very first time that we had our first practice,
that Wednesday morning, these kids had my back. And I told them that I really
appreciated that.  
  
I have one more thing, please. This is kind of leading into what you said,
Bob, and that is I'm up here today because Machelle Joseph asked me to remain
and coach the team. That was her decision.  
  
This is her team. She was the leader of this team; not me. I just drove the
bus. And I had to move, like you said, move up a couple seats. She put this
team together. She recruited this team. Those two kids that were on the all-
freshmen team, one being freshman of the year, those were her kids. Those two
kids on the All-Academic, All-ACC team, those are her kids.  
  
She's my friend. She's my boss and the reason I came to Tech. That's all I
have to say. Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Sue Semrau](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24768)

### [Kiah Gillespie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36607)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Florida State - 51, Duke - 41  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Florida State coach Sue Semrau and student-
athlete Kiah Gillespie. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH SEMRAU: About this win, I know Duke has been playing extremely well. Won
their last four, hit 12 3s last night. I thought our players did a great job
of making sure they knew what the assignment was, what the game plan was and
stuck to it the whole game. We didn't shoot the ball extremely well but we
rebounded it really well. I think that was the difference in the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. You mentioned rebounding. You're not a huge team. Don't have any 6'5
" or 6'6" players. But you controlled the board. How did that happen?  
COACH SEMRAU: That's what we talk about every day. You don't have to be tall
to be a warrior. And we talked about toughness ever since the Clemson game.
And these kids have continued to grow every single game.  
  
Q. Let me ask you about the job you did on Miela Goodchild, who has been
shooting lights out from 3. She didn't get any looks at all today.  
COACH SEMRAU: I think our length on the perimeter was really -- and the speed
that we had -- Morgan Jones is so long as a freshman. Nausia Woolfolk has such
great athleticism. She had to play on Gorecki a lot. And that put Nicki Ekhomu
on Goodchild, and I thought she did a fantastic job.  
  
I really have to give credit to my assistant, Joy McCorvey, did a great job on
the scout. We were really well-prepared.  
  
Kiah had a double-double. Anybody want to talk to her about that? Thank you
very much.

# [ATLANTIC COAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Joanne McCallie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34727)

### [Haley Gorecki](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36573)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Florida State - 51, Duke - 41  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Duke. To my left is Coach Joanne McCallie and
student-athlete Haley Gorecki.  
  
COACH MCCALLIE: Obviously a defensive game. No question it was a different
kind of game. A lot of defensive plays. A lot of stops that were needed. And
rebounding played a huge role.  
  
We didn't accomplish our goals at all. The rebounding was very poor as a team.
The numbers indicate that. And when you look at a 10-point game and missing
free throws and not rebounding, you can quickly come up with 10, 12 points,
14. And that can make a huge difference.  
  
Credit Florida State for rebounding much better than we did. And credit them
for making a few more plays than we did. And the free throws they had they
made them. So that was lessons to learn for us as a team.  
  
Very disappointing. I really liked the run we had, that last run, to end the
season out and sort start a new season. Always proud of the team. But very
disappointing, for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Going 12-of-20 from 3 last night, you only attempted two in the first
quarter, only finished 2-of-12 overall. Could you explain that difference
between yesterday and today shooting the basketball from deep?  
COACH MCCALLIE: It's a totally different game. They played a different
defense. It was a totally different game. It wasn't a game for 3s; it was a
game for driving and getting to the free-throw line and attacking.  
  
You have to be able to play any type of game. It would be nice to get some
transition 3s and make a few. But if that's what we're going to hang our hat
on, that's going to give you ups and downs.  
  
We needed to rebound. You see the rebounding stats. They're very clear. We
have nobody on the whole team -- six are the most anyone has on the team. So
it's a very poor rebounding night. It was a blue-collar game.  
  
Offense sells tickets. That's what happened last night. Defense and rebounding
win championships, and that was evident in this game tonight.  
  
Q. Up until the fourth quarter you guys only took two free throws. Do
you feel that was just like a product of their size, or was it an effort to
stay outside and attack the mid-range shot?  
COACH MCCALLIE: We shot 11 total; they shot eight. There wasn't a lot of free
throws being shot. You had to make the ones you had. The officials, I think
they let it play it a little bit. But I think they did on both sides. They
shot eight. We shot 11. So we did a bed of work there but we've got to convert
those.  
  
That's a standard of a kind of game like that. A lot of blue-collar, letting
some physicality go. Not in a real bad way, but letting some go. You've got to
be able to hunker down and concentrate.  
  
One of the most disappointing thing is the three 3s that No. 15 got rather
easily when we scouted her and she was in the exact spot that we knew. Again,
this was not a game that was going to be 80 to 90. It was not that kind of
game. It had to be -- it was an ugly game. And you have to find a way to get
those things done -- making free throws and rebounding are two that I can
think of.  
  
We had 58 shots at the bucket. They had 51. Plenty of opportunity there that
we've got to learn from. It's very important lesson for us to learn. Very
important.  
  
Q. Coach, you didn't get much offensive help for Leaonna and Haley,
especially the two freshmen had the deer-in-the-headlight look. What do they
have to do so this doesn't happen again next year?  
COACH MCCALLIE: They have to take the experience -- obviously it's lessons
learned, things to be worked on, playing off ball, cuts to get open, playing
off the bounce.  
  
It's not always a game of catch-and-shoot. It's a different game. You've got
to be able to play off the bounce. That's one of the things I appreciate so
much about Haley's game. She'll catch and shoot, but she'll play off the
bounce. And that's one of the reasons why Haley had 17 points.  
  
That's one of the reasons why she was a leader and attacking in that game. She
certainly drew excellent defense. But those are skill sets that need to be
developed and given over time of experience.  
  
So Onome learning, Miela learning as well, Jade as well. Jade had some
opportunities that she'll be better for in the future in terms of finishing on
the block. So there's no question there were different areas to look for for
offense.  
  
This was going to be -- this game was going to be basically a 60-or-below
game. It wasn't going to be great offense. That's not the way tournaments
work. You're playing back to back. You're playing in a row. You're playing in
a situation where people know each other pretty well.  
  
So once you get deeper into this kind of tournament it's harder -- it gets a
little bit more difficult. It gets a little more defensive-oriented. And,
again, some of the other things we talk about need to happen.  
  
Q. One thing you guys did well was forced 15 Florida State turnovers. Do
you believe your aggressive defense helped you guys stay in the game, or how
were you successful in that department?  
COACH MCCALLIE: I think a little bit of ball pressure. I think it was nice. We
had eight turnovers. That's a real positive. That's seven more times we took
care of that ball. That's what put us in the position to get that game was the
turnover margin.  
  
That's a positive. That's something that we'll look at. Imagine having eight
in most games. Imagine what we could have looked like with eight turnovers in
most games or 10. So that's an outstanding stat and that's something we need
to consider, especially since the ball pressure was pretty significant. Pretty
good ball pressure out there. Pretty good pressure. Pretty good defense.  
  
Q. First ACC experience. What have you learned in this last couple of
days that will help you lead your team next year as you move forward to the
next level?  
HALEY GORECKI: I think just having -- you're in a tournament, so this is kind
of having the mindset, this could be your last game. So taking that over and
just bringing it quarter by quarter, just getting stop by stop, just knowing
that it could be your last game.  
  
Q. Haley, kind of a variation of the same question just asked, but half
an hour ago you were expecting to be playing tomorrow. So you've got to make
that quick transition. It's the offseason now, but you're one of the leaders,
most experienced players. What do you do starting tomorrow, starting next
week, starting next month, starting the offseason to make sure Duke's not
sitting here with 15 losses again next year?  
HALEY GORECKI: Just bringing my experience and leadership to next year. I
think as the season went on everyone grew as a player and just bringing that
to next year. And the offseason as well, just getting prepared, what Coach P
was saying, developing and getting better day-by-day.  
  
Q. Coach, do you think that the rebounding differential, do you
contribute that to playing back-to-back, or do you think it was just mostly
Florida State outworking your team?  
COACH MCCALLIE: It was pretty much, I think, probably a combination. But
rebounding has been an issue. And putting bodies -- the contact was so
important.  
  
15 for them, Gillespie, and 12 rebounds, she had her way a little bit. And No.
13, that's a guard rebounder getting three offensive rebounds in there.  
  
It's a really important part to finishing our defense. There were times we
could have great stops. It's all five on the defensive end. Everyone's got to
stay in and make contact. We've had that lesson before, unfortunately. And
it's important to take this on.  
  
There's a time to sit back and think about tremendous growth our team has had
through the season and all the things that we're proud of about getting
better. And there's a lot of things. And there's a lot of things this team put
into place and was dealt a very difficult situation, and that's all true and
that's all been documented.  
  
But right now, for us, the most important thing is to take this head on. Okay.
To look at this and understand how this game, despite the fact that it was
poor shooting for us certainly, despite all the problems, we were in a seven-
point ball game and a six-point ball game in the fourth quarter. That's what
the message is. You just find a way. It was not about perfection. It was not
about any of those things.  
  
We were in a position to take that game and be competitive and move forward
for most of that game. And we've got a spot that, even if as a player I'm not
as hot or doing all the things I can do.  
  
So it's just really good -- it's hard because we've been playing very good
basketball and very well. And unfortunately everyone ends in a loss and it's
not a good feeling at all. But you spend 24 hours kind of, as you talked about
it, you've got to think about it a little bit. First thing we've got to do is
think about it and then move on and take the lessons from it.  
  
Q. Haley, maybe not the season you expected. But a really solid end to
the year. How do you and the team plan to take these last four or five games
head on and take it into next season with the roster that's mostly coming
back?  
HALEY GORECKI: I mean, obviously, unfortunately, like you said, Faith and
Sofia aren't going to be here. But having the team that we have, but like you
said, the last five games, the experience and the hard work that we've been
putting into, it's great to see. So carrying that over to next season, I'm
real excited.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Quentin Hillsman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18363)

### [Kiara Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33279)

### [Miranda Drummond](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36575)

### [Tiana Mangakahia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34699)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Syracuse - 67, Virginia - 57  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: ... we had a great balance. We were able to get a few players
off the floor probably for a few more minutes than we had to play. At this
time of year it's about winning the game and we gotta do whatever we need to
do to get a W, so just really happy for our team and happy for our effort.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. I know the press is kind of the calling card of yours. But how did
you do in that aspect? And how did it affect the game given UVA's short
bench?  
COACH HILLSMAN: We wanted to speed the game up. A lot of times when you're
pressing teams everything is predicated on your turnovers. And for us it's not
predicated on that. We just want to get pace and get tempo.  
  
I thought that our press really sped them up and allowed them -- sorry, it
made them not run solid offense. They couldn't really get down the court and
get into a set. That's what we really wanted to do, not guard the sets for the
entire game.  
  
Q. Coach, it feels like the 3, obviously it's still a big part of what
you guys do, but feels like it's a bit more well rounded now, it complements
the inside game. Has that been an effort in the last couple of months?  
COACH HILLSMAN: We were talking about attacking the basket and attacking the
paint off the bounce and post feeds. And our offense did a really good job of
really recognizing when they're open and when they're having good shots.  
  
And Miranda was -- really, really shot the bell really well and Gabby shot the
ball well today and that was key. You have two of your best shooters making, I
believe it was six out of their eight 3s, that's what you want.  
  
Q. Tiana, what does it feel like today when you have an off game early,
takes a little bit to get going but your teammates pick you up? How does that
make you feel especially moving into tomorrow?  
TIANA MANGAKAHIA: Yeah, obviously I didn't have a great game. I had a couple
of turnovers and stuff. But it's always good when everyone's contributing to
the game and everyone's giving what they bring to the table. And I think that
really helps us no matter who we play. And no matter how I'm playing or what
I'm doing, like, if everyone comes to the game prepared and ready, like, we
can win.  
  
Q. Miranda, you had three pretty big offensive boards in the third
quarter and one in the fourth quarter. How does that boost team morale after
you get those second-chance opportunities?  
MIRANDA DRUMMOND: It's a good feeling, I guess, getting a rebound. That was
one of my main focuses for this game is to box out and get as many rebounds as
I can. I feel like they were big-time rebounds, like you said, and I felt that
kept our team going. We stayed positive and I thought that helped with our
energy.  
  
COACH HILLSMAN: I want to chime in on that because it's important we
understand that it saves possessions. Those rebounds and those games and games
like this, that means we're playing offense for a minute and that was critical
down the stretch. Those rebounds, they were huge rebounds. They really sealed
the game. Did a good job.  
  
MIRANDA DRUMMOND: Thank you.  
  
Q. Kiara, you really thrived over the past couple of months. If Tiana
had an off game, feels like you come in and provide that spark off the bench.
How do you think you fit in with this team and how do you find your groove,
because you've been very productive?  
KIARA LEWIS: I know a lot of teams focus more on Tiana, so I think that's my
opportunity to come off the bench and step up. And actually, not starting, you
get to see how the game's going.  
  
So I think that's helped me in the last few months. And I know a lot of teams
are going to focus on Tiana so that's my chance to step up and help the team.  
  
Q. Miranda, looking at the Miami game, you missed that game, the game
they came into the dome and built you guys by double digits. Is it exciting to
get back out there get a second chance and have Miranda back in the lineup,
anybody?  
TIANA MANGAKAHIA: I think for sure. She's a big aspect of our offense,
shooting 3s, that's what we love to do. And I think her coming into this game
will really help us a lot. It was a good game against them at home and not
having her, we struggled with the 3-point percentage in that game, yeah, so I
think it will be good for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
North Carolina - 80, Georgia Tech - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina and to my left is head coach
Sylvia Hatchell, Paris Kea, Leah Church and Shayla Bennett. Coach, a brief
opening statement and we'll go to questions.  
  
COACH HATCHELL: Thank you for being here. I love the ACC Tournament. And first
I want to say to all the Greensboro folks, thanks for doing a great job.
Without a doubt we have the best tournament in the country, and they just do a
super fantastic job. So I want to say special thank you to the ACC, to the
Greensboro Sports Council, the coliseum people and all those folks.  
  
We knew Georgia Tech was going to be really tough. They always are. We always
have very physical games with them. And we beat them by one point a few weeks
ago at our place.  
  
And we were a little shorthanded today with Janelle out and Stephanie. It's a
day-to-day thing with Stephanie. She had hyperextended her knee in the
Virginia game. So, it's a day-to-day thing with her.  
  
And then Bailey will play tomorrow. But these guys stepped up. Of course, Leah
making six out of eight 3s. The kid can shoot the 3s. If she's got time to get
set it's usually going in.  
  
And then I challenged Shayla to be a little more aggressive to the basket and
she was. She did a really super fantastic job there.  
  
And then Paris, the first half, she didn't score like normal. But at halftime
the TV people interviewed me and wanted to know what I was going to do to get
her going. I said we were going to post her up. She looked at me like I was
crazy. But we did; we posted her up a lot in the second half. But Paris did a
great job with that.  
  
The outstanding thing is she had nine assists and no turnovers against a team
that presses and does a lot of things that causes problems out there. But to
have nine assists and no turnovers and two steals, that's pretty outstanding.  
  
So everybody else just looks at all the scoring that she does. So I've said
enough. I'll stop so you can talk to those kids. But I'm just really proud of
them. And we're looking forward to playing a great Notre Dame team tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the players stepping up. How big was Jocelyn
off the bench? She's usually like an energy-type player, but she scored a
career 14 points today?  
COACH HATCHELL: I challenged them all to step up, and they did. Jocelyn made
some big baskets, had some big rebounds. And she's a physical-type player. She
loves a game like this. I mean really, in practice, you know, she's knocking
people all over the place. And she loves that. But she stepped up and helped
us a lot. And Jaelynn Murray did, of course. And of course these three up here
as well.  
  
Q. Paris, you had a big home crowd. You're from Greensboro. What's the
experience like playing in your hometown?  
PARIS KEA: Playing here in the coliseum is absolutely amazing. It's always
great to see a lot of faces and family and friends that I haven't seen in a
while. It's just an amazing atmosphere in Greensboro and I absolutely love it.  
  
Q. Coach, how important was the turnover margin today? They committed
15. Your team only had five. They were forcing over 18 a game in ACC play. How
was your team able to take care of the ball like the way they did today?  
COACH HATCHELL: That's what I was talking about with Paris and -- not just
Paris but some of the other ones as well.  
  
The turnovers we did have, we passed the ball to them. We threw the ball
inbounds and then we just got a little lazy there. But Paris had several games
this year where she had only one or two turnovers. For a point guard that's
really outstanding.  
  
But that was huge and we knew they were going to come after us and that taking
care of the ball would be really important especially against their presses.  
  
Q. Coach, you subbed Olivia Smith in at the last moment to score those,
to shoot those free throws, and that was her first free throw attempt all
season. What was your mindset behind that?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, Olivia is a really good shooter and practice, we do
drills and stuff. She hardly ever misses.  
  
And the rule is that -- that's what I was talking to the ref so much about --
the rule is that whenever you come out there -- and they called the trainers
out -- and Paris has to go out, her sub has to shoot the foul shot. No one on
the court can do that, because I was going to send Leah up there but Leah was
already out there. So someone off the bench had to shoot her foul shots. And
so that's why I put Olivia in there, because she's really a good foul shooter.  
  
Q. For any of the players, at one point I think Janelle was up in the
coach's box. She was standing up a lot this whole game like an assistant
coach. What was she saying to you guys and how big was it for not only you
guys but Murray and Na (phonetic), the girls who don't play that much, to be
in their ear and kind of coaching them along.  
PARIS KEA: I mean, she was basically encouraging us, anything to get us going
and bring the energy, really.  
  
LEAH CHURCH: Same thing. I know when I came off the court, maybe if I missed a
shot, she'd say you got the next one. Just like what P said, she was just
always encouraging.  
  
SHAYLA BENNETT: I think she was trying to keep Murray engaged in the game, and
always making sure we were all making the right plays and being an extra
coach.  
  
Q. Leah, a career high 20 for you today. But also early in the second
half, I think there was a stretch where you forced three straight turnovers,
took a charge, stole one off the inbounds and took an elbow to the face. How
pleased were you overall today, not just the 3-point shooting?  
LEAH CHURCH: I was just trying to take advantage of this awesome opportunity.
It's been a dream of mine to play in the ACC Tournament. To have this chance,
I didn't want to waste it. I wanted to do whatever I could to help my team
whether it's taking charges, knocking down shots, just having energy out
there. I was just trying to do my part.  
  
Q. Notre Dame tomorrow, obviously you guys beat them in January. And
you'll be getting Janelle back. So any of the three players, what's the
mindset going into that game?  
SHAYLA BENNETT: I think bring her back is obviously going to be a big deal.
They're going to have to play her inside, which is going to open up our
outside. And I think it's just going to give us better opportunities because
they're going to be focused on her because obviously she didn't play today and
she's a big factor on the team.  
  
Q. Paris and Shayla, how does your role change when you guys are a
little bit short staffed and you don't have Stephanie and Janelle out there?  
PARIS KEA: I think I've become more of a facilitator they were face guarding
me tonight. I maybe only been face guarded once or twice throughout the whole
season. They trap most of the game.  
  
And so Church probably had most of my assists. But just facilitating the ball,
two people on me, somebody's open and finding them.  
  
LEAH CHURCH: My role, I think, is just, like I said, being as vocal as I can
be because Janelle is a vocal leader on the court and just trying to make
shots. That's always my role.  
  
SHAYLA BENNETT: For me, I think my role would be like Coach Hatchell said, to
be more aggressive because obviously Janelle is not in there; it's like next
player up and keep my teammates involved and not try to overdo it but just
play my game and help my team.  
  
Q. Coach, at what point was the decision made or did you guys know that
Janelle wouldn't play this game? And what was the conversation like with
Murray on getting her second career start?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, the situation at Duke the other day, it was excessive
unsportsmanlike behavior. That's not Carolina. That's not how -- and she was
very sorry for that situation. But she had to -- the consequences were to not
play in this game. And she accepted that.  
  
And I told her, I said, "Look, your role needs to be" \-- because they're
roommates and best friends -- I said, "I want you to coach Murray; talk to her
about what you would do in situations." I said, "I want you to make this her
greatest moment since she's been at Carolina. I want you to help make this her
greatest time of playing basketball at the University of North Carolina."  
  
And so I talked to her about her role today with Murray and not just Murray
but the team. I thought she did an outstanding job. She was so positive over
there and talking to the kids and helping her teammates win. And she'll be
back out there tomorrow.  
  
And it takes all of them. Olivia making that foul shot. Bailey talking to her
teammates and helping Murray and Naomi and all -- and then Stephanie as well.
They all are contributing in their way. May not be time playing on the court.
But it's the mental part is tremendous.  
  
The chemistry out there with this group today was tremendous. The teamwork,
the chemistry, and those kids that didn't get time, they were a big factor in
that. So just proud of the whole group.  
  
Q. To follow up on that sentiment, I think a lot of people have said
this team has a short bench. But obviously the bench stepped up big time
today. How important do you think that is going forward to prove that when you
do have multiple regulars out, that everyone can kind of step up?  
COACH HATCHELL: I tell them probably all the time, probably every day you
never know when you're going to be called upon. Always be ready. We had
several situations this year where people have had to go in there, someone
gets hurt, someone would get in foul trouble or something like that. And just
like today with Olivia.  
  
And so that's why in practice -- Olivia works so hard in practice to make her
teammates better. And so you never know you've got to be ready when that
opportunity knocks. And so, like I said, I preach that about every day
probably. So that was good.  
  
And I told them before the game: I believe in you guys; I know you can do
this. And I had Mack Brown come and talk to them the other day before we left.
Mack and I are really good buddies, and we go back a long, long way. And he
came in and said some things to them. And he actually sent us a message this
morning.  
  
And I'm sure these things they've heard before. But he was just really good
about preparing for tournament time and creating an edge and things you have
to do and stepping up, being a team player and the mental part of it and just
all that. He was really good.  
  
And they listened and they took that all to heart today. And when we came out
of the locker room, I felt a sense or a spirit of oneness with this group.  
  
You can just feel that and sense it, especially when you've been coaching as
long as I have. I could feel that and sense it with them and on the bench
today. And we had timeouts. You could just -- you could feel it. It's like the
wind, really can't see it but you can feel it. And I could feel that today. I
think they could, too.  
  
Q. Paris, if it came from Mack Brown, we'd love to hear it. But where
did you find your edge in the second half and what helped you get going; Coach
said you were posting up more, but what else was going on for you?  
PARIS KEA: Well, I feel like there were a few calls that I didn't get. They
were very physical. So I just had to learn to just play through the foul
really down the stretch.  
  
If you've never seen heart, you see heart in Church. She brings it like no
other. And I think that her grit kind of brushed off on me in the second half.
And I just wanted to give my team whatever it took to get the win.  
  
Q. Shayla, looked like your knee was bothering you a little bit. You
played all 40 minutes. Did you ever think about putting a fist up and asking
for a sub for a minute or two?  
SHAYLA BENNETT: No. Two minutes left in the game, I played 38 minutes, two
more minutes wouldn't hurt me.  
  
COACH HATCHELL: When she got hurt, the assistant coaches were saying, "Oh,
Shayla needs a sub."  
  
I said, "No, she doesn't. Not Shayla." I've seen this kid play too much. "No,
no, she's staying out there. She don't need a sub." She's never -- she's one
of those that's never hurt. These three up here, hu-huh; they don't get hurt.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Amanda Butler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18040)

### [Aliyah Collier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36604)

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Clemson - 80, Virginia Tech - 79 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Clemson head coach Amanda Butler and student-
athletes Aliyah Collier and Danielle Edwards. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BUTLER: You know, we were able to beat a really, really good team today.
Virginia Tech is just one of the best performing teams in our league in
February and down the stretch, and obviously their performance yesterday. So
they certainly put up a great fight and we've got a great deal of respect for
them.  
  
Really, really proud of my ugly duckling Clemson Tigers, though. Just fought.
It wasn't our prettiest game, but we don't ever really count on pretty. We're
just going to play hard and grind it out. And we kind of have this agreement,
we're all going to do what it takes and then be okay with where we end up
after that.  
  
But tremendous senior leadership. Tremendous balance. Dani got us out of the
gates. Aliyah was just doing her thing the whole ball game. Kobi had a section
where she led us. Destiny Thomas had a section where she led us.  
  
But ultimately it came down to us being able to get stops. And we're really
proud when we can be in that position and then come out on top that way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Aliyah, you scored eight straight points to take the lead for good in
overtime. What were you seeing in overtime to get those three straight
baskets?  
ALIYAH COLLIER: Wasn't seeing really much, just was going with the flow of the
game. Get it out and in. Get down. We know what defense they were running, so
we were prepared to attack their defense and at least try to get to the foul
line.  
  
Q. What was helping you with the back-to-back 3-pointers there?  
ALIYAH COLLIER: The flow of the game, really. My teammates, they seen after
the first shot I made, so they was finding ways to get me the ball. And I was
just going with the flow and they weren't guarding me. So I wasn't going to
shy down from a shot.  
  
Q. Obviously Emery scored the last 17 points for Tech in the fourth
quarter. What changed there where she was able to be so effective there late
in the fourth quarter? And she didn't score in the overtime until the last
second 3-pointer. Did you make any adjustments defending her in overtime
there?  
COACH BUTLER: Yes, we went zone. We thought that we could switch some screens
and keep somebody in front of her. And she just, she played with like a senior
with her hair on fire, that sort of urgency that you expect to see in your
seniors, just like mine did. But she's a great ball player. Look at the
numbers that she's had in the league. Maybe her best game in the league. But
she deserves a lot of credit.  
  
Her team did a great job finding her. And we just -- we couldn't keep her out
of the paint. We couldn't keep her in front of us. We couldn't keep the ball
off the block, so we said, let's play a little zone and see how that works.
And it worked much better.  
  
Q. What was your defensive game plan against Magarity today?  
COACH BUTLER: Our biggest aspect of our defensive game plan was to try and box
her out. She's an elite rebounder, and we did that reasonably well. She still
got 10. She's just double figures on the board, seems like, just when she
wakes up in the morning.  
  
But I think that her low scoring was because she's a really good ball player
who understood what was working. And when we got the ball in to her she took
advantage of it a couple of times. But then she was looking for Emery, because
she was obviously unstoppable. So I just think really unselfish ball player,
making the plays that her team needed her to make.  
  
Q. Was your defensive game plan any different than when you played them
at your place during the regular season?  
COACH BUTLER: Very similar. We did a much better job of defending them. They
did a really good job handling our back court pressure. We kind of expect that
at this point in the year. But we wanted to keep pressing so it became a game
of who is going to have more energy at the end to make that one last play.  
  
And our team really committed to that. We did probably a better job the first
time we played them of pressing them. But, again, credit Kenny and credit
their kids for adjusting and handling it really well.  
  
Q. Before you get away, this is your first ACC Tournament game. Give us
some thoughts about it and what it means to your program?  
COACH BUTLER: Oh, shoot, you know, it's just, I'm happy to be here. I don't
know. Is that too simplistic to say? I'm really happy to be here. I'm happy to
be a Clemson tiger. This is the best conference in the country. And I just
feel really blessed and fortunate to be coaching such a special group of women
who compete for each other every single night.  
  
Greensboro puts on a first-class event. I've always admired it from afar. And
it's just, like I said, it's an honor and a privilege to be part of it, and it
makes it even special when you're part of it and you're a winning part of it.  
  
We're really excited to be playing in the quarterfinals. That hasn't happened
for my seniors ever. So we're going to celebrate for another 10 or 15 minutes
before we start thinking about the next one.  
  
Q. Playing off of that, Danielle and Aliyah, what does the win mean to
you, a win in the tournament?  
DANIELLE EDWARDS: Whenever someone has asked me about this postseason, I
describe it as special. We've been able to accomplish something with this
program this year that hasn't been done in a very long time. So being able to
get to the quarterfinals, it's just special.  
  
ALIYAH COLLIER: Same as Dan. It's really special because, like, in the
previous years, you know, we've gotten here and we haven't gotten as far in
the postseason. So to be here in this situation and to get the win tonight to
help us keep going forward, I think that's just something that I'm going to

### [Kenny Brooks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30712)

### [Taylor Emery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34700)

### [Regan Magarity](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32617)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Clemson - 80, Virginia Tech - 79 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach Kenny Brooks and student-athletes Taylor
Emery and Regan Magarity. Coach, a brief opening statement.  
  
COACH BROOKS: Proud of my kids. That's all I've got.  
  
Q. Taylor, you scored Tech's last 17 points in the fourth quarter. What
were you seeing out there that enabled you to get on such a roll there and
lead your team into overtime?  
TAYLOR EMERY: I'm a senior. And we needed this game. And I told them I'm going
to carry us, so get me the ball and I'll make it happen. And they trusted me.  
  
Q. You didn't score until the last-second 3-pointer there. What
defensive adjustments did they make on you there on in overtime if anything?  
TAYLOR EMERY: They started face guarding me. But that's no excuse. I still
have to come through for my team.  
  
Q. Taylor, when you look back on this game, how frustrating will it be
knowing how close you guys came?  
TAYLOR EMERY: It's a heartbreaker. It feels like last year all over again.  
  
Q. Regan, how were they defending you? Were they making it a tough
shooting day for you, doing things defensively to make it tough for you?  
REGAN MAGARITY: They're long and athletic, but that's no excuse. I just wasn't
able to make shots when my team needed me to.  
  
Q. Collier had the eight straight points there in the overtime to give
their team the lead for good. What was she able to take advantage of, anything
with the defense to get the team the lead there?  
COACH BROOKS: No, she just made shots. The two 3s she got, there was a
defensive miscommunication and just gave her two wide-open shots and she
knocked them down.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about Taylor's performance there, particularly in
the second half and how she carried you guys?  
COACH BROOKS: She did. She was tremendous on the offensive end, got us going.
She hit some very tough shots. I thought she could have done a little bit more
but she got beat up. She got beat up quite a bit. She's going in and going to
the hole. And I thought she got beat up quite a bit.  
  
So to be able to persevere through all of that, it's even more impressive to
what she was able to accomplish, all things considered.  
  
Q. I know it's maybe tough to look at now, but as postseason comes
along, you've got maybe a 10-day stretch here before you'll know where you
guys end up. How important will it be for the program to continue a postseason
run that it's had?  
COACH BROOKS: It will be extremely important for our program. Just as
important I think it will be extremely important for these kids. They deserve
it. They played extremely hard. They've done tremendous things for our
program, for our university.  
  
Two of the hardest-working kids I've ever been around. For them to come up
short, it's really a travesty because I thought they had opportunities. And
like today, it's heartbreaking because I thought they deserved it.  
  
But I think that obviously the postseason is important to our program as we
continue on. What they've done for this program since I've gotten here has
been unbelievable. Couldn't ask for a better crew, what they've done and how
they progressed. So I think it's very important.  
  
Q. Obviously last year you had the close shave in the ACC Tournament and
you bounced back from that made it all the way to the WNIT final. What's going
to be the key to bounce back and being similarly motivated in the WNIT this
year?  
REGAN MAGARITY: I think we just have to continue doing what we've been doing
well. We have to play for each other, play together. Our goal is definitely to
win, so I think we all have to come out, put this loss behind us and just get
ready to work again.  
  
Q. Kenny, your defense in the fourth quarter, did you make any
adjustments to keep them in check in that last quarter?  
COACH BROOKS: We didn't. I mean, they made some adjustments and tried to, and
we had to counter that. But I thought we left them a couple times and gave
them too good of a look and they capitalized on it.  
  
They're a strong rebounding basketball team. But it's a lot of grabbing and
holding going on in there. And I can't wait to watch the film. I really can't,
just to see really how a couple things happened.  
  
They made shots. I don't think they typically go 8-for-19 on a given night.
They're not really known for their 3-point shooting. But give them credit.
They stepped up. Thomas did a tremendous job early. And then -- sorry --
Collier knocked them down in overtime.  
  
Q. Taylor, as a senior, how much would you like -- this may seem like a
simplistic question -- but how much would you like continue playing and have
another round of postseason play here?  
TAYLOR EMERY: I'd love it. It's our last season. So it's very important for us
to play postseason. I don't want it to end just yet.  
  
Q. You made that late 3-pointer there and waved bye-bye to the fans
there. How much fun were you having there in the fourth quarter? Was it
something you can feel, like, oh, they can't stop me, I'm feeling hot here, I
guess? What was it like to play in that fourth quarter?  
TAYLOR EMERY: I was just trying to win, and whatever my team needed me to do
was what I was doing.

## March 6, 2019

  

### [Lance White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35299)

### [Cassidy Walsh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36571)

### [Jasmine Whitney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36572)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Duke - 86, Pittsburgh - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: To my left is Coach Lance White, Jasmine Whitney and Cassidy
Walsh.  
  
COACH WHITE: Obviously I'm really excited to be in the ACC Tournament and
allow these kids the opportunity to come and do what they do. And I was really
pleased with our first half and their ability to compete and fight. And really
we talked so much all year long about growth. And to see them and we really
wanted this game to be an exhibition of how far we've come.  
  
And I think as a basketball team and as a program we really have come a long
ways. Sometimes you don't always see it in the end result. But we have really,
really come a long way.  
  
And I was disappointed in the way we started the third quarter. But, again,
overall and throughout, reflecting back throughout this season, really excited
about each of their growth and what they were able to do from where we started
to where we end today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, that second quarter, it seemed like you guys were really in
control of the game. I think you had a four-, five-point lead. What kind of
went wrong from there?  
COACH WHITE: You know, it was. We had a few turnovers right after that. We had
made some substitutions and some of that stuff. And then, again, we've been a
team that has really battled confidence, being able to be a team that once we
get hit to get back up and get hit, get back up. And again the ACC is a beast.
Is that -- the players, we've talked all year that everyone is bigger,
stronger, faster than us.  
  
We have to be a team that has an underdog mentality and you've got to keep
fighting. But our confidence sometimes gets shaken. And I thought in that
moment, once they came back and tied it and then, I think, took a lead, our
confidence was shaken a little bit.  
  
And if we can't respond right away -- and even going into halftime, it was a
4-point game. But it was. I thought at that point it was our confidence is our
biggest issue. And so in the third quarter whenever they came out and it
quickly went from four to 12, it's really difficult for us to overcome that.  
  
But it was -- it's more, I think, confidence and energy than it was what we
did or that kind of stuff.  
  
Q. Jasmine, you're going to be one of the players coming back next
season as an underclassmen. What kind of positives can you take away from the
experience of this season? It's been a struggle, but you did win two ACC games
and gave Duke a good fight today?  
JASMINE WHITNEY: Like coach said, even though the end result wasn't what we
wanted all season. We still learned a lot. We've still developed a lot. And
I'm excited to take what we've learned this year and with the freshmen and
everybody coming in and just to see what we can do next year, work hard this
summer and just see what we can do.  
  
Q. Cassidy, you've been the face of the program for four years. You've
played your last collegiate game. Talk about what you think the legacy is that
you've left in the Pitt program for the future?  
CASSIDY WALSH: I'm sort of the foundation for Coach White, me and my fellow
seniors. But I think he's going to do tremendous things here. And it was sort
of -- we started this journey when he came in May, I think. And it's been
ongoing since then. Nonstop of hard work every single day. And that's what
sort of been set in stone. And I think that will just continue. And I think
the seniors sort of put that in, like, the juniors, sophomore, freshmen. And
the incoming freshmen, they'll just follow everyone's lead.  
  
But I think probably the legacy is just having pride, wearing Pitt across your
chest and that is what I have loved to do these last four years. And that's,
when you come to Pitt, that's what it's all about, representing Pittsburgh.
And everybody who comes here who Coach White has coming in, they'll do the
same thing. That's where the legacy has been and that's where it will continue
to go, is just with hard work.  
  
Q. Coach, when the team came out with so much passion and energy to
start, diving on loose balls and everything, was the message this is a new
season; we can go on a run here and anything can happen?  
COACH WHITE: Absolutely. And, again, I thought we played extremely well at
Duke. Again, we were in it until the fourth quarter. And so for us is that we
had a couple of goals that they had set early on in the year, is that they
wanted to win more ACC games than last year. And we had a chance to do that.  
  
So I think there was that energy of being able to accomplish that goal and
what that was. And, again, it's going to be hard. We're in the ACC, the best
conference in the country. And we know that.  
  
But that was something I think that was in their minds of, yeah, we want to
beat somebody that we've never beaten before. That was another one of their
major goals. And both of those could have been accomplished today.  
  
So I think that was a big part of their energy and stuff early. And
unfortunately we can't sustain that for as long as we need to against good
basketball teams.  
  
Q. Coach, the team has been pretty good all year eliminating outside
3-point shots. Were they doing something differently today, or were they just
hitting everything they put up?  
COACH WHITE: It's interesting, historically, with the ACC, usually that first
game the teams don't shoot it very well. And, again, they have two to three
really good -- two for sure really, really good shooters. We knew that, but it
was -- obviously if you leave them wide open, they can knock them down.  
  
So, again, we made some miscues and didn't exchange the way we should. But,
again, kudos to them; they knocked them down and really shot it well, 12 of 20
from the 3-point line is really doing a good job.  
  
Q. Coach, Cassidy mentioned foundation earlier, as this being your first
team. What kind of, I guess, foundation did her and some of the other seniors
kind of lay for you this year?  
COACH WHITE: You know, it was an interesting mix. And whenever I took the job,
there were at that point five seniors that, again, had been recruited by
another coach who didn't know me from nobody and could have really thrown in
the towel and said peace out and I want my scholarship and move on.  
  
But what this group really did of coming in and buying into what I'm selling
was really remarkable to me in how hard that -- again, they had a lot of
things that were in their minds. And again we dealt with confidence issues all
year long of really just if you're open you have to shoot it. And a lot of
them went from role players to now where they're cast as our number one option
and you have to shoot it every time you're open.  
  
And so again that foundation of I've said all year long, they're freshmen for
me. That group, that whole team were freshmen in terminology in the way that I
act and the way that I coach and all of that stuff that they had to get used
to quickly.  
  
And then we had to go into the best conference in the country and try to
compete and win basketball games. And so it is -- their work ethic, I think,
was the major thing, energy that they had to bring. And then obviously with
our younger kids, again, at that point everyone's a freshman. So things
Jasmine had to do once Aysia Bugg got hurt and took ownership of this team and
led us from there forward.  
  
And we talk in the locker room afterwards about this experience is all about
remember whens: remember when we did this. And there were so many things as a
basketball program that we can look back and remember when we did this. And
that's for me their experience, it's this group of young women who got an
experience to be a part of a big-time women's basketball program, and they'll
have tons of experiences and remember whens once they leave.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2019

  

### [Tina Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17406)

### [Jocelyn Willoughby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32640)

### [Dominique Toussaint](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36562)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Virginia - 77, Boston College - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: To my left is Coach Tina Thompson, Dominique Toussaint and
Jocelyn Willoughby. Coach, a brief opening statement.  
  
COACH THOMPSON: This was a big win for us, not just because we wanted to win
but we knew the kind of game that we were going to come into that it was going
to be a grind-it-out game. The first game against Boston College it was a
similar game. So we knew what to expect. We knew it was going to be physical,
and that it was literally going to be trading baskets throughout the game.  
  
I mean, our kids were tough. Although we had a little drop in our energy in
the first half we came back fighting. We are a blue-collar team. We fight. We
grind things out. In games like this, I think this is when we are our best.
I'm so proud of my kids. We're small but in my opinion very mighty. And we
show up to come and play.  
  
So just really, really happy for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Jocelyn, looked like the short bench might catch up with you guys in
the third quarter, but you came out and had 13 points. What did it take for
you to pick up the intensity late in the game knowing you were tired?  
JOCELYN WILLOUGHBY: I think a lot of times tired is a mentality. If you think
about it you're going to give into it. I think for me it was just a team
commitment to come out with more energy and changing the tempo of the game to
be more in our favor, getting out on in transition and making them or putting
them on their heels on defense.  
  
Q. Coach, you jump out to 11-nothing lead but you find yourself down at
halftime. What did you say to them in the second half just to get them to roll
back the way they did and take control of the game, basically?  
COACH THOMPSON: We basically just reminded them to be exactly who we are. We
are a team that gets out in transition. We are a team that pushes the tempo.
We're a team that creates opportunities for ourselves from our defensive
efforts. We're a team that at times we have to be something more than just
ourselves.  
  
I mean, with these two -- the two leaders on our team, we've asked them to do
so many things that probably going into the season weren't necessarily what
they thought their roles were or in their repertoire. And we've asked
Dominique to be at times more of a facilitator and we asked her to do that. We
ask Jos to be more aggressive, get to the basket and creating opportunities.  
  
And we've just done a really, really good job of just reinventing ourselves,
and that's what we needed to do going into the second half and they did a
great job of that.  
  
Q. Emma Guy had 14 points in the first half. She only had four, I
believe, in the second. What did you do to take her away and deny her the ball
and make her less effective in the second half?  
COACH THOMPSON: Well, one thing we did we tried to front her as many times as
we could as well sending double teams.  
  
I mean, she's a tough guard for everyone in this league. So we wanted to make
the touches she got very difficult and not allow her to get clean looks at the
basket.  
  
Q. Dominique, you scored your thousandth point there in a big run in the
fourth quarter. How special was that given this was a big win for you guys?  
DOMINIQUE TOUSSAINT: It means a lot, having two juniors on the same team
getting a thousand points, I think it's a big thing.  
  
I think it just goes to show you like how hard we work over these past three
years. And I was kind of just focusing on the win, I didn't realize it until
the end. But it's a great feeling.  
  
Q. You fell behind by 12 points in the middle of the third period.
You're the two veterans. You kind of willed your team back into the game. What
was your message to your team, to yourself, to each other?  
DOMINIQUE TOUSSAINT: It goes back to what Coach said; it goes back to what our
identity is. We like to play fast, get into transition and we like to believe
in our defense. And that's what we did. We got back to what we do best.  
  
JOCELYN WILLOUGHBY: It's really just having the mentality we've been here
before and the game isn't over until it's over. We knew we could make that
run. Niq had some awesome plays, and so did I and so did our other teammates.
It was a team effort. And we're proud of our comeback.  
  
Q. Coach, given the difficult season with the injuries and the short
bench, you touched on it earlier, but what have these two meant to this
program this season?  
COACH THOMPSON: They've meant everything, simply because they -- Dominique,
Jocelyn, as well as Moné -- play a significant amount of minutes on our team.
They're the three that I substitute the least in that even when they are tired
and they look tired and they tell me, I kind of ignore them at times and then
I kind of gauge when it's really severe or not.  
  
And I think that they've kind of come to know that, so to kind of sacrifice, I
guess, their games in that way. It's not easy to be very efficient when you're
tired like that. And they found a way to figure it out.  
  
So I think overall, when you talk about a statistical, from that perspective,
they're probably not as efficient as they would be if they had substitutions,
but it's not something they're worried about.  
  
They're worried about getting wins and doing whatever it takes to do that. So
we've sacrificed a lot. But they've also given a lot and that means kind of
more than anything. I mean, how they approach the game is how our team
approaches the game. And our team has taken on the identity that these guys
have decided to kind of be and show up for our team.  
  
Q. Jocelyn, Virginia has been a good foul-shooting team all year. You
guys were 26-for-29 today which is going to win a lot of ball games. You were
12-for-12. Seems like down the fourth quarter every possession you kept going
to the foul line and extending the lead by two and two more. Can you address
that part of Virginia's game today?  
JOCELYN WILLOUGHBY: When you're hitting free throws I think it gives you a
better chance. For me, I look at it as a whole other possession, like, those
two points are another possession that the other team will have to score to
catch up to us. So free throws are super important, and just trying to dial in
and give our team a better chance at winning the games, really big for me and
for the team.  
  
Q. Dominique, maybe a chance to brag a little bit. You had eight
assists. I'm sure quite a few went to Jocelyn. Just talk about her game today.
She was phenomenal out there.  
DOMINIQUE TOUSSAINT: I just trust Jos with the ball I'll find her on the court
no matter where it is. I just trust my teammates in general. I like to believe
that I'm a great court general, floor general.  
  
COACH THOMPSON: You facilitate really well.  
  
DOMINIQUE TOUSSAINT: Floor general, that's what it is. I like assists just as
much, the same as I like points. I like passing the ball and making sure my
teammates get to score.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Faith Suggs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35183)

### [Miela Goodchild](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36574)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Duke - 86, Pittsburgh - 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Coach McCallie, Haley Gorecki, Miela Goodchild
and Faith Suggs.  
  
COACH MCCALLIE: Good game for us overall. Obviously the second half, coming
together, I thought Mie gave us great leadership and Haley early and Miela as
well and Faith and others in that second half. Obviously that's where the game
turned, great ball movement, playing together. Really appreciated Haley's
attack, every time she caught the ball she was a threat and then some looking
to create.  
  
Miela doing her work, spotting and playing off of her teammates. And then to
see a career game from Faith was fantastic. The senior she is for us just
incredible. And what a great game you played, Faith. That was excellent.  
  
Congratulations to Miela for setting the freshman record of three pointers. I
guess it was Becca's record. That's exciting. And it's fun to see your team
play well. It's fun to watch. As coaches we were doing more watching than
coaching -- even though we still try to coach -- but we were doing more
watching than coaching in the second half because the way the team was
playing. Obviously we're excited to get better and excited to move on to the
next.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Faith's leadership on the floor. Could you talk
about her hustle plays in the first half on the balls and getting her scoring
going in the second half?  
COACH MCCALLIE: Just an all-around fantastic game. Seven very aggressive
rebounds. Dives on the floor. Had a nice charge. She gets a lot of charges.
Nobody else on our team does, but Faith does. She has a complete monopoly on
that. And hopefully somebody else will do that as well. But she's terrific at
it. And I think she had -- she was either -- had each hustle play or was
involved in it. It's no surprise to any of us. And it makes us all really
happy.  
  
Q. Faith, let me follow up with that. We talked over the years a lot
about you bringing energy off the bench. 15 seconds after you go in you dig
out a tough rebound in traffic. Pitt was dominating the boards early. That
seemed to set a tone and kind of turned the game around. Just talk about what
you wanted to bring to the team coming off the bench tonight.  
FAITH SUGGS: Coach always preaches on rebounding how important it is
especially in the ACC Tournament. I just wanted to get there, get rebounds at
first. That's how you get your energy moving really, get your rebounds,
everything else follows. So I just loved getting the rebounds and it was
exciting.  
  
Q. Coach, in the second quarter there, I think Pitt had a four-point
lead. They were kind of making some runs and of course you guys bounce back in
a big way. What were they doing early on that was giving you all some
problems?  
COACH MCCALLIE: I think they were just executing and playing good basketball.
They were finding their shooters if I recall, some 3 balls were going up and
in. From our perspective, our team just tightened up defensively. We made some
switches and did some different things we needed to do.  
  
And it was excellent to take that, to turn it over very quickly. I think we
were minus-4 and then we were plus-6 or whatever it was. Just gotta be able to
do it in games, stop runs, make runs and also make some adjustments. And the
team was very good at doing that.  
  
Q. Coach, the 3s were really falling all game, but in that run in the
third quarter, seemed to be the defense that clicked. What did you see from
your team defensively in that third quarter run that helped you guys pull
away?  
COACH MCCALLIE: Just playing off of each other. Intensity. You've got to
really be intense at this level regardless of time and score. So I thought we
played off of each other well. I thought we executed different defenses well
and I thought rebounded better, more aggressively. Haley was always in there
with her boards. Faith was rebounding. Jade was very efficient on the boards
for the minutes she played and rebounds she got.  
  
So it was a little of everybody getting in there and fighting for the ball.
And in these tournaments it's all about the ball, pursuit of the ball, who has
the ball, possession of the ball, and I think that really was key for us
especially off the boards. And I just have this image of Haley, long -- Haley
is a long, tall rebounder. She gets one hand up and it's like a suction cup
and pulls it down. And that's obviously very motivating -- you know what I'm
talking about, don't you? That's motivating for her teammates and certainly
motivating for us.  
  
Q. You guys had an unbelievable night shooting the basketball. How are
you able to, as a team, be so accurate from the deep?  
COACH MCCALLIE: The players. I mean, the players. They can shoot. They can all
shoot. When they find each other -- you saw the 20 assists. There was always
an extra pass. That's about the players. They do that.  
  
Q. Haley, you've watched some ACC Tournament games from a different
vantage point. What's it like to finally get out on the court and having that
significant a role for Duke?  
HALEY GORECKI: It's exciting, being the first time playing in the ACC
Tournament, especially with this group of girls, we're a great group. And
especially at this time I think great basketball is happening right now for
us. So it was really exciting.  
  
Q. Miela, how does it feel setting that Duke freshman 3-point scoring
record?  
MIELA GOODCHILD: It's pretty exciting, but gotta give it to my teammates.
They're the ones who found me for the shot. And, yeah, yeah, really exciting.  
  
COACH MCCALLIE: We like the yeah, yeah.  
  
Q. Obviously this is a different setting here in the Greensboro
Coliseum. Shot 12 three-pointers. Did you guys have a good shootaround, feel
like you adjusted to the arena, because the shots really fell for you guys
tonight?  
HALEY GORECKI: Yeah, actually, we were kind of worried -- we were talking
about how it's going to be definitely a driving type of game and games just
because the shooting -- the shots weren't falling for us for shootaround. But
I guess we just got all our bad shots out at shootaround.  
  
MIELA GOODCHILD: I think it was just, yeah, I think we were all pretty
confident in our shots. So knowing once we hit one that, yeah, we're going to
hit the others. So, yeah.  
  
FAITH SUGGS: We didn't exactly have a shootaround, but it was kind of like we
kind of got off the bus and wanted to feel out the arena. But we were
definitely worried. There were a lot of frustration grunts coming from Haley
behind me every time she missed. But it was definitely good to see the ball go
through the net today.

## March 6, 2019

  

### [Jen Hoover](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24773)

### [Gina Conti](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36568)

### [Alex Sharp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34686)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Virginia Tech - 85, Wake Forest - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: Next to me on the left is Coach Jen Hoover, Alex Sharp and Gina
Conti. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH HOOVER: Disappointed in the outcome, obviously. I think we give a lot of
credit to Virginia Tech. I thought they came out on a mission, and it was
obvious in the first half. We had a lot of missed assignments. It took us a
while, I thought, to kind of fix it.  
  
And anytime you've got two kids getting 10-plus rebounds in a game that's kind
of denomination on the board. It's hard for us to win games if we're not going
to outrebound our opponents.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Jen, where did you feel like that one was slipping away in the first
quarter? I think they went on a 20-2 run.  
COACH HOOVER: I thought defensively we struggled. We just did. They're a tough
team to guard anyway because they move the ball so well. They've got a
combination inside/outside. Magarity is a tough matchup for anybody because
she can play inside and outside. And I thought we had a lot of missed
assignments. They hit a lot of shots and they drove the ball hard at us and we
had a lot of fouls.  
  
Anytime you're not scoring on one end and you're giving that up, it just
becomes a grind. And we really just couldn't withstand it or stop the
bleeding, if you would. So I felt that happened pretty early in the first.  
  
I know we started off okay. It was going back and forth a little bit. But once
they hit a couple they were able to get momentum and we weren't able to take
that momentum back.  
  
Q. Alex, Sunday you guys were leading that team at the half. What was so
different about tonight?  
ALEX SHARP: I think Sunday we were more locked into our game plan. Today we
didn't execute on our game plan. A big part of that was defense. And our goal
was to communicate better than what we did Sunday because we thought that
would really give us an edge and push us over the edge to beat them but we
didn't do that. So I think that was a big difference.  
  
Q. Jen, obviously disappointing finish to the season. You guys had a ton
of adversity. When does the page get turned and you start working on next
year?  
COACH HOOVER: I told them in the locker room everybody that played out there
tonight is back. And that's the encouraging thing for next year. The things
that this team's faced this year, it's been a tough year. It's been a tough
year not only for our players but a tough year on me and our staff.  
  
Every time we turned around, we lost somebody else. And we were playing
freshmen and sophomores. And the one junior, Alex, misses a six-week period in
there. So we've only had her back for a couple of weeks.  
  
And you're playing against a team like Virginia Tech that's two leaders are
seniors, Magarity and Emery. And I think there's a big difference on the
court, especially in a crunch-time situation with that experience and that
leadership and that ownership there. But we turned it. We've turned it for
probably the last four, five games. And we've been playing with kids that all
will be returning.  
  
So I'm excited about that. These kids never gave up. They believed. They kept
giving me everything they've got every day.  
  
And sometimes it just wasn't enough. And we ran out of gas a lot of times. So
we're excited. We've got some new pieces coming in and we really think will
help us. And these pieces will continue to know how this felt and know that
Wake doesn't lose on the first day of the ACC tournament ever.  
  
Q. Is this maybe your toughest year of playing basketball ever? Is that
-- can you quantify it that way?  
GINA CONTI: I would say this year has been pretty tough. But I mean I feel
like I've been prepared with practices -- the coaches and my teammates have
prepared me for, like, game situations. So with going to Italy and getting a
head start in the year having ten extra practices, I felt prepared, yeah, I'd
say it's been okay.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to be in a game like this and look down at the
end of the bench and there's Elisa who hasn't played in a month or so and
Ariel hasn't played all year and just knowing what the team could have looked
like versus what it did end up looking like?  
COACH HOOVER: In the last month or so, this may sound bad, I've ignored them.
I've had to because you can't think about what would have been because the
rest of the kids were pouring their hearts out for us and every day coming in
and finding a way to get better, a way to step up, a way to rebound a little
bit more here.  
  
It was just a situation where we were really focused in on the kids that we
knew we were going to play night in, night out. And I think that was important
for this group to know that we couldn't think about what if, what if, what if.
It just wasn't that. And this group never did that. They never thought, oh,
woe is us; we're so hurt, so injured, I never heard it out of them ever. It
was like, Coach, what's next? And Alex, I'm going to play you at the 4. She'd
give me bright eyes, okay, and she'd do it, like it wasn't, well, I don't play
the 4.  
  
So I think kudos to this team and these players because they gutted that out
and we just tried to continue to keep focused on the ones we had and the ones
we knew would be in there in the fight each night.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Trinity Baptiste](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36565)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Virginia Tech - 85, Wake Forest - 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with Virginia Tech. And to my left is Coach Kenny
Brooks, Trinity Baptiste, Taylor Emery and Regan Magarity.  
  
COACH BROOKS: Obviously this time of the year survive and advance, but I
thought our kids did a little bit more than that. I thought we really set the
tone in the first quarter, continued that in the second quarter.  
  
I thought we had a really good balance to us. I thought the seniors did a
tremendous job of getting us going. Taylor had a great bounce, got us going
with some early shots. Regan did a tremendous job on the boards but also
scoring. And they really set the tone. I think both of them had 17 points at
the half. And then it just kind of propelled us into the second half.  
  
Fourth quarter got a little sloppy but overall very pleased with our effort in
the way we came out and played throughout the whole game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Regan, what did you feel like was going right for y'all in the first
half or so?  
REGAN MAGARITY: I think we were playing for each other. The guards did a
really good job of finding us inside. We share the ball. We always say it
starts on defense, and I think we did a good job communicating, rebounding the
ball and then the offense just flowed.  
  
Q. Taylor, wanted to ask you, you've won seven of your past ten games
now. What's been the difference down the stretch for you all?  
TAYLOR EMERY: We've been putting pieces together. All season, we've been
trying to put our pieces together and trying to get people in the right spots
and who needs the ball. I think we've done a really good job on knowing what
we need to do especially closing out games. I think we've done a better job in
our past ten closing out games and we've played really well as a team.  
  
Q. Taylor, you kind of flashed to the crowd early with the 3-pointer.
Did you have a feeling that it was going to be a good day right after that?
Were you kind of feeling it early? What was kind of the sense, you seemed to
show excitement there just right off the bat?  
TAYLOR EMERY: The ACC Tournament it's so fun. And my teammates were finding
me. They were telling me keep shooting, keep shooting. And that's what I kept
doing. And there's a lot of excitement going into this tournament and we don't
plan to be leaving anytime soon.  
  
Q. Kenny, if I'm not mistaken today's win was your 400th as a coach.
Just your thoughts on that? And were you aware of it coming in?  
COACH BROOKS: I was not aware of it until I turned the corner, and they
sprayed me with water bottles and they got me some balloons. But it's a great
fashion to do it in, especially with the stakes so high. And a couple of the
water bottles sprayed a little bit longer. Maybe they were a little getting
back at me for a few things. But it was really good for that.  
  
But to do it with this group in this fashion -- we've been through a lot this
year. To capture that, I think Taylor just alluded to it, we're starting to
put the pieces together and we're playing our best basketball at the right
time. And very proud of these kids because we went through a lot and it was a
recipe for disaster. And we could have thrown in the towel but they didn't.
The leadership of these kids right here they stepped up and they fought back.  
  
And I think we're a dangerous basketball team right now. I think we definitely
showed that we're one of the better basketball teams and we're not going to be
an easy out. I'm very proud of what they've accomplished.  
  
Q. Trinity, was it strange to go through an entire season and play Wake
at the end, and then have them be the first team you play in the tournament
right away?  
TRINITY BAPTISTE: It wasn't strange. We were aware we would have a chance to
play them again today. So, I mean, we gave them a little hope last game when
we played them at home. But today we really wanted to make a statement.  
  
Q. Kenny, the game in Blacksburg was a lot closer than today. How nice
was it to see your team come out and just sort of take the game right from the
start?  
COACH BROOKS: It was fantastic. The game in Blacksburg obviously was senior
night. And senior night is always an emotional game, the way the kids come
out. They're always a step behind because of all the activities leading up to
it, the emotions in the game. You're out of your routine.  
  
And I thought we gathered ourselves nicely at halftime in Blacksburg, came out
in pretty dominant fashion in the second half. We kind of continued that on.  
  
We alluded that to like playing an NBA Finals game because we played them on
Sunday, had to turn around and play them on Wednesday. And it's a chess match.
You're trying to figure out if they're going to change things. You're wonder
if they're going to play you the same way.  
  
We made a couple of wrinkles, got us off to a really good start. The kids shot
the ball extremely well. They shared the ball. We had 19 assists tonight.
That's a really good sign for us; means we're playing good basketball. I
thought they played tremendously in all aspects of the game and it was led by
these kids right here.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=ATLANTIC+COAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2019

  

### [Joanna Bernabei-
McNamee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35280)

### [Emma Guy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36561)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Virginia - 77, Boston College - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have Boston College with us. To my left is Coach Bernabei-
McNamee and Emma Guy. Coach, a brief opening statement and we'll go to
questions.  
  
COACH BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: That was a bad way to end a season. We're a little
disappointed in our locker room. But I think this team, for being young,
really fought this year, and I think every team that played us for the most
part had to put a fight up to get one over on us. I think it's great that we
have everyone returning. So we're going to work really hard at this. If this
doesn't fire us up to work hard in the offseason, I don't know what will.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. They only had seven players dressed. Did you feel like you could wear
them down? And when you got that 12-point lead in the third quarter, did you
feel like you were wearing them down?  
COACH BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: Yeah, you know I think a team like Virginia, knowing
those players on the team, I knew that they weren't just going to wear down
and not continue to give a fight. But I do think that with our pushing tempo
and trying to press them a little bit, that was the hopes, that we were going
to wear them down a little bit and take advantage of maybe some turnovers or
mishaps on their end.  
  
Q. Coach, you watched them go out to 11-0 lead but you actually take the
lead at halftime, up by 11 in the third quarter. What happened in those last
15 minutes, what they were doing against you all?  
COACH BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: You're asking about the last 15 minutes of the game?
Is that what you said? I think what happened was we started -- not what we do
is living and dying by the 3-point line. We were chucking up shots that maybe
we could have waited in the offense and tried work it inside out, which was
our game plan from the beginning.  
  
I thought our shot selection was a little bit bad. And I thought offensively
when they were coming down we were getting caught on the bad end of a lot of
foul calls. So those were some things we have to work on and get better at.  
  
Q. Emma, you had 14 points in the first half. I believe only four in the
second. What did they do to kind of keep you from getting touches?  
EMMA GUY: Personally, I don't think they were doing anything different. I
mean, I take that upon myself. I have to be stronger in the post, and I have
to know how -- I just have to go hard every single second.  
  
Q. Coach, going back to your earlier comments, this could refer to both
taking too many 3s and you mentioned some foul calls, but you only went to the
foul line four times, which is -- what happened to keep you guys off the line
like that?  
COACH BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: I'm not sure. I think one of those attributions was
that we shot a lot of 3s, which we weren't getting fouled on those shots. I do
think it's a remarkable game that she has that many attempts inside and we're
getting the ball so many touches and she didn't have one foul called for her
in the game, which I'm not sure because I thought that they were definitely
working pretty hard in there to guard her. And I thought it was equally as
physical on the other end that we were getting called for those fouls.  
  
So that's something that I have to look at, and we'll work on. But I thought
that we maybe caught the bad end of that a little bit.  
  
Q. Coach, as your ACC season ends, what type of motivation things will
you bring to the team for next year to improve upon your season?  
COACH BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: I think the big thing right now is in this postseason
for us to get motivated to get stronger in the weight room, really work to be
more gritty. I think when you're stronger in the weight room and you start to
get that competitive edge and that's something we'll continue to work on. And
our skill set and developing, I think I have an amazing coaching staff.  
  
We'll get in the gym with these players. We'll really work hard on improving
their skill set. And I think next year and the years to come you're just going
to see our program get better and better and better.  
  
Q. Virginia's Jocelyn Willoughby had 13 points in the third quarter,
really played a big role in their run there. How did you see her affect the
game there especially in the second half?  
COACH BERNABEI-MCNAMEE: She really took it out strong. She's 12-for-12 from
the line as well. She's an excellent player. That's what -- she's one of those
players skill set-wise that can score at three levels. She shoots the 3. She
can post people up. She has a good mid-range game.  
  
So on our end we probably didn't do a great job limiting her touches there in
that second half, which was one of the things we wanted to do. But again with
a young team, that's something we'll keep growing and maturing being able to
stick to our game plan throughout a 40-minute game which we've had a little
trouble with this year.  
  
Q. Emma, coming in with straight eight losses, when things started to go
south in the fourth quarter, the last five minutes, how tough was it to try to
keep that "oh, no, here we go again" kind of thing from creeping into your
head?  
EMMA GUY: I try as hard as I can not to have that thought go through my head.
I'm pretty sure it never once went through my head. But I have to rely on my
teammates to know my teammates are there, try to huddle them back up and get
the confidence back to get going again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Chloe Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32657)

### [Lauren Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33249)

### [Kalani Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30449)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor 67, Iowa State 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Baylor Bears, head coach Kim Mulkey
and her three student-athletes, Kalani Brown, Lauren Cox, and Chloe Jackson.
Coach, I'm sure you're going to want to make an opening statement.  
  
KIM MULKEY: I think I'm going to pass tonight.  
  
Q. I guess both Kalani and Lauren and Chloe if you want to jump in on
this one too, that fourth was complete dominance. Can you talk about what
happened there, how you were able to take over the game?  
LAUREN COX: I think we locked down on defense. We started getting steals,
getting out and running and I think that eventually wore them out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anyone else want to comment on that?  
  
KALANI BROWN: She got it.  
  
Q. I know this is part of what you came here for and you've still got
another big tournament to play. What's this experience been like to be part of
this and win this championship for you?  
CHLOE JACKSON: It's a blessing with this team. This is a special team, and
it's just surreal. This is what I came here for, like you said, and I wouldn't
want to do it with another group of girls.  
  
Q. Kalani, every game is different and this one, I mean, you guys got
out to a quick start. They answered and it was kind of back and forth. When
that fourth quarter run comes, we asked you yesterday about when you guys get
on a run like that, when it's in the fourth quarter and you guys are able to
kinda land that knock-out punch, what's that feeling like?  
KALANI BROWN: It's a good feeling, because the momentum is with us. We have
all the energy and we play with high energy. We play some good basketball and
good team ball. You just start having fun with it after that and I think
that's what we did in the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. Lauren, was there any frustration setting in or was it more what Iowa
State was doing, the way they were controlling y'all a little bit on the
defense end.  
LAUREN COX: I think we were missing easy shots. We were letting them be
physical with us, and I think that got us a little tired. But we pushed
through that and our shots eventually started falling. Chloe was hitting from
the outside and Lani hit a couple from the outside. So that started to open it
up down low.  
  
Q. Chloe, your step-back jumper that you hit in front of the bench with
three minutes to go, how nice was that? When you do it right in front of your
teammates like that?  
KALANI BROWN: Pretty great.  
  
CHLOE JACKSON: Yeah, it was pretty great. But all credit to my teammates. They
gave me that confidence that I could knock down a shot and Coach talked about
it earlier, pay attention to the shot clock. I knew I had to do something with
this.  
  
Q. Kalani, I know you've talked about this a lot, the disappointment, if
you will, in the NCAA Tournament and how you didn't really want to think about
that or focus on that. You just wanted to focus on this season, but here we
are again. How cohesive, how good does this team feel going into the NCAA
Tournament as a number one seed?  
KALANI BROWN: We set goals in the beginning of the season. This was pretty
much the final little mini goal before we make our run for the NCAA
Tournament. So I think that's the only thing we haven't checked off our list
is the Final Four, and if anything, winning tonight should make our team more
focused.  
  
Q. Chloe, you struggled at times against Alexa Middleton. Talk about
Moon and maybe DiDi switched to her in the fourth quarter and she didn't
score. Talk about their defense?  
CHLOE JACKSON: They're amazing defenders. That's all I can say. They're great.
They do a great job!  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations and best of luck. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Can you talk about the job that DiDi Richards did on Bridget Carleton
tonight?  
KIM MULKEY: I thought DiDi did what she has done all year. DiDi is our defense
stopper on the perimeter. When she got a little fatigued, we could move other
people. When she wasn't looking for her shot on the offensive end, as I told
her, you can't be an offensive liability or I can't play you. She started
cutting to the basket. She was just standing there. She works hard. She has
the body and the conditioning and the length to make it difficult. She didn't
bite on the fakes all night. She stayed on the floor. You know, how many times
do you play Iowa State and the majority of their game are post-up moves by the
perimeter players or drives? When you describe an Iowa State team the first
thing you say is you must defend the three. They only made three threes
tonight. So their game plan obviously was a little bit different. Why was it
different? I have to give credit to our kids and their effort on the defense
end of the floor. We change people's approach to the basketball game because
of our defense, whether that's Cox and Kalani's presence in the paint, whether
it's DiDi Richards is not going to give up as many threes as you're used to
taking. But I've never played an Iowa State team that drove with their guards
like that. I love that kid's energy. You gotta talk about Moon Ursin tonight.
She was so valuable on the defense end as well.  
  
Q. Coach, how does a game like this, a tough, hard-fought game help you
guys going forward as you enter the NCAA Tournament?  
KIM MULKEY: We've had a bunch of 'em, Nick. It's good. It's good. We've had a
bunch of those. Look at the last of our schedule this year. Three of the last
four games were teams that were vying or fighting for second place in the
league, so it of wasn't like the hard part of our schedule was played early. I
think that will only help us down the stretch.  
  
Q. NaLyssa Smith seemed to get in that game just when you guys needed
her and be a spark on the offensive of side of the ball. Talk about her and
what she did in this game?  
KIM MULKEY: It's not just tonight. NaLyssa Smith started the season. We don't
win against Arizona State and Connecticut without NaLyssa Smith. When you head
into conference she is not the forgotten one anymore. Everybody knows
everybody's strengths and weaknesses.  
  
So that freshman came out in her in that she is going, wow this is a lot
tougher in conference, man. I can't turn. I can't do that and I just kept
telling her, stay with it, stay with it, stay with it. I thought NaLyssa Smith
in the last part of the season is going back to being a big-time player and an
offensive threat for us. She just, I don't want to say hit a wall, but she hit
that freshmen frustration thinking this is supposed to be easier than this is
right now. There is nothing I can tell her. There is nothing her parents can
tell her. She has to live it and it's good to see her this time of year
because we need that kid and that's what I told her coming off the floor. It's
good to see you're back.  
  
Q. Going back to Moon, what can you say about her transformation this
year alone? Especially in the last three days for these games. What can you
say about that?  
KIM MULKEY: It's not just the last three days. It's all season. I'll tell a
quick story. Moon is from the state I grew up in, my home state and I watched
a kid with a tremendous body in high school and I watched a kid with
tremendous speed and quickness and vertical leap and I just thought her best
basketball is ahead of her. When her mom dropped her off at the dorm at Baylor
I put had my arm around her neck and said she is going to call home homesick
many days. She is going to think she is the worst player ever. You just keep
telling her, stay in there and hang, hang, hang. It was just a matter of time.
The kid has a beautiful mid-range jumper. She has speed and quickness.
Confidence would be a good word to use. When you're a freshman you think
you're the worst player ever and when you hit that point, usually about your
sophomore year you realize, wow, I'm pretty darn good. Moon has just really
done what I had hoped she would do. She is a crowd favorite. She goes in the
game because she plays so hard, but she is really a crowd favorite because of
her presence.  
  
She is a happy kid. She speaks well. No matter how down she is, you want to be
around her.  
  
Q. Kim, it's 48-44 going into the fourth quarter and Iowa State is
making y'all work down low and you guys immediately go into Kalani, go into
Lauren. They score. Do you have the utmost confidence that they're going to
continue to get it done even when it is a grind?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, for me it started at halftime. If you look at their shooting
at half I challenged both of them. I said to both of them, you're a combined
and I forget what it was, it wasn't very good. I said if you're as good as
people say you are, then you will work your way through it. And they did. They
got fatigued. Everybody gets fatigued this time of year and I gave 'em rest
and that's when NaLyssa Smith went in and helped us maintain what we had at
that point. Those kids are experienced players.  
  
They've seen it all. You go with the kids that are experienced, but what you
saw is you finally saw Kalani find the second gear when she was fatigued and
run the floor. You gotta push no matter how tired you get you gotta push. I
thought her running the floor late, I thought we get to 50-50 balls better in
that fourth quarter than we did in the first half, 50-50 balls, steals, balls
loose, active, and we were very poor in the first half.  
  
Credit Iowa State. Chloe didn't pay attention to the shot clock a lot of times
and that's not Chloe. So I addressed that at halftime. That was really the
difference. I just thought we had more energy in the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. Kim, you usually don't reflect during a season. You usually wait. But
you your comment out there, does it hit you when this program has done during
your time, 13 times in this game in 19 years and I can rattle off the numbers.
But does it hit you what this program has done?  
KIM MULKEY: Actually it did today. I don't know why. I don't know somebody
just talking to me before the game and just said, Coach, do you realize y'all
have played in 13 of these championship games; and I said, no, I didn't know
that. I've only been at Baylor 19 years. I said, I didn't know that. And that
person said you've won 10 of 'em if you win today.  
  
I kinda knew that because somebody said a total of 20 championships in 19
years if you count the regular season. I knew more of that than I did that
we've played in 13 of 'em. That's pretty remarkable.  
  
I can't say enough about the Baylor fans today. They were loud and proud. They
were here. Gotta keep doing it. Gotta keep feedin' that monster. I think
Michelle brought it up, the disappointment we've had in the NCAA Tournament.
See I don't view that that way. Last year Kristy Wallace gets hurt. Did
anybody expect us to go to the Final Four without your quarterback? Think
about that. We got it to a Sweet 16 and that's a disappointment. I don't view
it that way. That's why I cried when she tore her knee up against West
Virginia in that game. I'm a realist. Too many things can happen that affect a
basketball game. We have been very fortunate to stay way from injury and we
have been very fortunate that I've got a deep, deep bench and those kids never
pout on you. Those kids are a joy to be around. They pull for each other and
that's a rarity in today's society. That is a rarity as a coach that you don't
have one in that locker room that's pouting. They all want to play. Look, I
want 'em to want to play. But they understand their time and their role and
we'll see what we can do.  
  
But I can tell you this: The public might say it's a disappointment and a
failure and I didn't feed the monster if we don't get to the Final Four, so be
it. We're still relevant and we'll fight till the last second ticks off that
clock because I know how hard it is. And a lot of things have to go right. A
lot of teams get on a roll. We're pretty good. We'll see what happens.  
  
Q. Coach, how much of a luxury is it to be able to beat a top-20 team by
18 points, not even make a 3-pointer, only attempt three of them. The luxury
of having a team that can play that style of ball in this day and age to be
able to do that?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, how smart would I be if we shot threes with a 6'5" and 6'7"
post out there. You know what? Those two kids can shoot the three ball. Those
two kids can shoot the three ball as good as anybody I have. I think our
record speaks for itself.  
  
You know, it's just going to be interesting to see when Cox and Kalani leave
how they're used at the next level because I know what strengths and
weaknesses they have; but, boy, they sure have won a lot of basketball games.
Kalani Brown is 70-2 in the Big 12. Check it out. I believe she is 70-2 if you
don't count this tournament in regular season games.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season. Best of luck in the
Final Four.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2019

  

### [Bill Fennelly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13850)

### [Alexa Middleton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36677)

### [Bridget Carleton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30406)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor 67, Iowa State 49  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Iowa State Cyclones head coach, Bill
Fennelly, and his two student-athletes, Bridget Carleton and Alexa Middleton.
Coach, your thoughts?  
  
BILL FENNELLY: First of all, I want to congratulate Baylor. That's just a
really, really, really, really good team. I wouldn't be surprised if about a
month from now they're holding up another trophy. Congrats to them. I want to
on behalf of our team and our university I want to thank the Big 12 for
running an amazing event. I want to thank the people of Oklahoma City, the
people here at Chesapeake Arena. Our kids have been smiling since they landed
and I'm going to get them to smile again before they leave. They provided our
kids with a lot of memories and I hope that the people here enjoyed having
Iowa State here.  
  
Lastly, for our team, I thought our kids played as hard as they could play. I
couldn't be more proud. It's kinda the same cycle when we play Baylor. It's
been these two and they didn't get a whole lot of help. For us to be down 4
going into the fourth quarter, we gave ours a chance, but Baylor's defense was
great and we just couldn't get some offense from some other people. The best
part for me is this team is tremendous to be around and the best part is we
get to play again, and I get to keep coaching them for a little bit longer.
I'm not looking forward to the end, but we're going to celebrate what we're
doing right now. These two have a little time left, and we're going to make
sure they enjoy it.  
  
Q. For each of the players, I know it's disappointing, but for three
quarters you were neck and neck with the best team in the country. Can you
reflect on what that means for this program especially considering where it's
been the last couple of years?  
BRIDGET CARLETON: For sure. It was exciting to be in that game, going into the
fourth quarter. Obviously Baylor is a great team and they're hard to compete
with. Our bigs were battling. Maddy was battling a long time against 6-4, 6-7
and it gets rough down there and they're a really good team, and to be down
only 4 in the fourth quarter our spirits were high. We were ready to go.
Obviously they made a run. Their defense was really good tonight. It's good
for us going into the NCAA tournament and it's good preparation for that
because we're going to see some really good teams.  
  
Q. What did happen there in the fourth quarter? You hung with them for
most of the night and then kind of the last six, seven minutes is when things
kinda changed direction.  
ALEXA MIDDLETON: You look at the box score we only had five points in the
fourth quarter. They had 19. That was a lot of it. Like Coach said, their
defense was really good in the fourth quarter. We weren't able to execute like
we wanted to and right there with them in the third quarter, we survived the
surgery they usually have in the third quarter, just couldn't get it done in
the fourth.  
  
Q. Coach Fennelly was talking about how excited he is for what's still
in store, I guess. Given what you were able to do tonight and just all season,
what's your guys' excitement level as you get ready for the NCAA tournament
now?  
BRIDGET CARLETON: We're really excited. Obviously some rest is going to be
necessary in the next week. But we're excited for Selection Monday and we're
hoping we get to host, hoping we get to win some tournaments and win some
games in the tournament. You know, playing college basketball you want to get
to the NCAA tournament. That's what it's all about. That's where the best
memories are made, so we're looking forward to that. I can't wait.  
  
Q. You guys both played a lot today, yesterday. Alexa, your most minutes
of the season. What was it like in the second half? Were you all pretty
fatigued? How did you feel today?  
ALEXA MIDDLETON: Yeah, it was a lot of minutes. Like you said, the most I've
played all year. The third game in a row, three days in a row is tough. Coach
Steyer talked to me before the game yesterday about they're tired, too, and
you've got to think I'm going to attack that on them and I'm telling myself
I'm not tired. I think we were mostly able to do that, but fatigue is in the
back of your mind. You're tired, your legs are dead, you've got to get more
lift on your shot, but overall I think we did a pretty good job of pushing
through that and doing some great things on the court.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. Best of luck. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Bill, with about a minute left you took Alexa and Bridget out and you
talked to them. What words did you have for them?  
BILL FENNELLY: I just told them I wouldn't be more proud of the effort that
they gave. When you're on the court and playing at the highest level against
the best team in the country to play that well and I took 'em out because
obviously they were tired. Bridget dinged her ankle a little, but I wanted our
fans to acknowledge them.  
  
I wanted the Baylor fans to acknowledge them. And I just told them that
they're not done playing. I told them to wipe the tears out of their eyes, get
their head up and cheer for their teammates, but mainly how proud of them I am
and that they still get to play and that's the biggest thing for them. They're
pretty down, which is probably in a weird way a good thing. But they'll be
okay. They'll be okay.  
  
Q. Bill, you know you're not going to go against anybody tougher than
that in the NCAA?  
BILL FENNELLY: I hope not. The only team tougher is our football team,
probably.  
  
Q. I know it's disappointing, but having played a team this good three
times how does that prepare you for March?  
BILL FENNELLY: You must have been in the locker room because the last thing I
said was there isn't a team in the country that got better preparation for the
NCAA tournament than us. This is the best practice, obviously we're
disappointed we lost the game, but I can't imagine anyone being that physical
at both ends of the floor that we're going to see. Maybe there is, but I don't
know who it is.  
  
That hopefully is the message that our kids will take out of here is we played
really well for two games and three quarters. Hopefully that's something that
we can build on moving forward.  
  
Q. Bill, that was a recipe, the first three quarters that has knocked
them out of postseasons before. What changed? What makes them different that
they can handle that now?  
BILL FENNELLY: Well, I think the biggest thing is that they continue to just
do what they do. They're not going to take a bad shot. They don't lose their
poise on offense. You don't see many teams go 0-3 from the 3-point line in
modern day basketball. And obviously their defense is really good. When
Kristin Scott got in foul trouble I knew we were in trouble. We had no
spacing. We can't create space against their big guys. They do such a good job
of that. If they're guarding you really well and you can't get to the free
throw line they're hard to score on. We had a hard time certainly in the
fourth quarter.  
  
Q. In three words, how would you describe tonight's game?  
BILL FENNELLY: Physical, emotional, fun!  
  
Q. Just your thoughts on how Alexa Middleton played tonight. Looked like
she took the fight to 'em and was aggressive and kept you guys in it?  
BILL FENNELLY: Alexa played really well. She had a great tournament, had a
great game last night, had a great game tonight. We played her two many
minutes, but I kept telling her, we're not taking you out. You got us here,
you gotta finish it. With her and Bridget, they play really well off each
other. Like I said earlier, for the third time against them, you're not going
to beat Baylor. I thought our defense was fine. I thought we completed
defensively, did the right things, transition baskets and inability to score
in space when Kristen got in foul trouble put us in a position we could not
overcome.  
  
Q. Bill, can you put in perspective how Cox's overall game has grown?
Seems to me she is able to hurt teams in a lot of ways on both ends of the
court.  
BILL FENNELLY: I think she is a great player and her numbers are always -- she
scores, she rebounds, she blocks shots, she defenses multiple positions, she
passes the ball. I mean, obviously she's going to be their preseason Player of
the Year in our league next year. Her ability to do other things at that size
and length just adds so much to their team that I don't know other team in the
country that has that. I'm sure there is, not that I've seen.  
  
Kalani Brown is a great player, but part of the reason Kalani Brown is a great
player is because she is playing with Lauren Cox. I think what she does and
how she does it really impacts their team and it's a credit to the way they
play and the way they've coached her.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season.  
  
BILL FENNELLY: Thank you, everyone. Appreciate your time.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor 88, Kansas State 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Baylor Bears head coach, Kim Mulkey,
and her student-athletes, Lauren Cox, Juicy Landrum and Kalani Brown. Coach,
would you like to make a comment about the opening?  
  
KIM MULKEY: I don't.  
  
Q. Lauren, you had a double-double before the half. Tell me why were you
so aggressive and able to make those stats before the half?  
LAUREN COX: I was trying to be aggressive going to the basket and my shots
weren't falling, but the refs were calling fouls and I was knocking down my
free throws and being aggressive on the glass and attacking it.  
  
Q. Tomorrow is the big day, Finals. How are you guys feeling? What are
the emotions? What's going on in your mind? Tell me.  
KALANI BROWN: I'm pumped. I'm excited, playing for another championship. That
never gets old. I'm excited for our freshmen to experience a big game like
this. They haven't had one in a long time.  
  
Q. Kalani, you played a very, very good basketball team today and you
drilled them in just about every category. How many games have you guys played
where you played better than this, if any, this year?  
KALANI BROWN: I don't know. I think we've playing good basketball all
together. When we're all in sync like that I can think of a few games, the
UConn game for example, I can't name 'em, Texas at home, thank you. It's just
a few of them, but we've been playing good basketball. So I think most of our
games have been good games.  
  
Q. Juicy, they came out pretty hot. They hit like 7 of their first 11
shots, and in my mind, Kim may see it differently, looked like y'all were
playing good defense, hand in the face. When they're doing that, is there any
panic, any sense of nervousness?  
JUICY LANDRUM: I wouldn't say nervousness. She said that in the huddle, that
they were pretty hot. But our hands were up. But they're pretty good shooters.  
  
Q. Lauren, 8 assists. I would imagine most of them were to Kalani, but
were you looking for that? Is that anything that you really try to pad your
assist total?  
LAUREN COX: I think it's just something that happens. I'm not like -- when I
catch the ball I'm not like, I'm going to do that and then I'm going to pass
it to Kalani. I would turn to the middle and she would have the lob and he
with just work really well together, kind of have that unspoken connection. I
know where she wants the ball.  
  
Q. Kalani, can you guys feel when a team starts to wear down a little
bit? The opponent? Because it seemed like at second quarter, you guys started
to pull away and impose your will a little bit.  
KALANI BROWN: In a way, yes. I just think when somebody hits a big shot or we
have a great player and one we just took the momentum and ran with it. When we
play with energy we play a lot better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. Thank you. Coach?  
  
KIM MULKEY: Let's go! Hit me with your best shot!  
  
Q. Kim, like I said, obviously they did come out hittin' shots with
hands right in their face. What was just kind of the message in the timeout?  
KIM MULKEY: Weather the storm. You keep playing good defense. You keep running
the floor, shooters will fatigue. Usually you lose your legs first when you
shoot a lot of perimeter shots like that. Just stay with your defense and
weather the storm. They were shooting 60% at one point in that first quarter
and if you look at the stat sheet which is one of the things I circled, they
went from 44% in the first quarter to 18 in the second. That's defense. We're
not doing anything different in the second quarter. There was nothing
different defensively. It was just continue to guard 'em like you've been
taught to do.  
  
Q. Coach, congratulations on the win. This team has been aggressive
throughout the tournament, throughout the season. What's the key to
maintaining that offense? Do you guys practice differently for each team, or
is it the same game plan?  
KIM MULKEY: Back-to-back games is very difficult -- in fact we didn't have a
shootaround or anything today. When you come to conference tournaments you get
about forty minutes before your first game and now tomorrow we will get some
time on the floor. You don't really go through anything extremely hard. You
walk through things. You don't change a whole lot this time of year, you tweak
a few things.  
  
I've got a basketball team that can score a lot of points. I've got a
basketball team that's got a lot of depth. The more that I can get them on the
floor, the better we will be down through these playoffs. I have to keep
coachin' them. I had 5 new ones on the floor and I wasn't real pleased and I
took 'em off the floor for a few minutes. I have to coach them like I do
everybody else. If I don't get their attention and let you know why you came
out of the game you're going to get your opportunity to go back in and they
did. We're going to see these in the playoffs, very physical. They make you
think. They are 1-3-1, which is really a 2-3. Made the new ones think a lot
and that's why they created a lot of turnovers, but put them in a position to
see that.  
  
Q. Once you find out who you guys will play against tomorrow, what's the
strategy? Do you start looking through film again?  
KIM MULKEY: We will watch half of this game if not more. I would say probably
a half. We will go back and we will go to dinner and then after dinner we will
get in the film room. We will go through a scouting report and go to bed. Then
tomorrow we will come and walk through and shoot a little bit. I don't know
how much we will shoot. How we're going to guard 'em. Most of the time when we
do things it's usually more defense than offense. I know where we can score
points. But it's two different kind of styles, two totally different teams
that you would play. We've played both twice and we will be prepared for
either one.  
  
Q. Kim, Lauren struggled with her shot early. You talk about don't let
your offense affect your other play. She kept playing defense but she finishes
with 15 rebounds, 8 assists, just the way that she played today.  
KIM MULKEY: She had to because Kalani was in foul trouble. Did Kalani play
maybe a minute in the second quarter? I don't know. But Cox took over down
there and she made everybody around her better. Freshmen came in, she would
give them easy shoots. She would always defend the player where she could be
the one helping the most. I think Lauren, she was so close to a triple-double.
I think she was looking for that when I put her back in I told her shoot the
ball. You're passing up layups to get an assist. Score the ball. She just
kinda took over the game when Kalani was out and then Kalani comes in, plays,
what, 20 minutes and look at her stats.  
  
Q. Kim, there was a lot of discussion yesterday after the TCU game and
the West Virginia game, some pundits have said that maybe the Big 12 may get
as few as three teams in the tournament. What do you think about K-State, West
Virginia, TCU and what are their chances? What do you believe they should do
with them?  
KIM MULKEY: I'm going to be partial and I'm going to always promote the Big
12. The second place team in the SEC was who? See, y'all don't even know.  
  
Q. South Carolina.  
KIM MULKEY: Thank you. You're not even a media guy. That's why I love you. You
know more than they do. Here is my point. Did Baylor play South Carolina on
their home floor earlier in the year? Look at that score and then look at the
scores of Baylor and who they played in this league and see if they were
tougher games. Those are things I would compare things to. I'm going to always
promote the Big 12. I know how tough it is. The styles are so different.
Playing West Virginia is different than playing Iowa State or Kansas State.
Our league is as good as anybody. Now, we don't have big numbers like the SEC,
what, 16, I don't know how many is even in the SEC, but you got some good
teams that I hope they don't leave out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor 88, Kansas State 60  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Kansas State Wildcat coach, Jeff Mittie,
and his student-athletes, Kayla Goth and Peyton Williams. Coach, your thoughts
about this afternoon's game?  
  
JEFF MITTIE: Well, I didn't like it very damn much. I would say this. What you
saw was, I think, a really good Baylor team. Give them a lot of credit. That's
a team, I believe, that has a chance to win the National Championship. It's a
team that has all the weapons. You have a tough time. We went into this game
trying to keep Kalani off that left block and that's easier said than done,
and they put Landrum on that same side and to squeeze that Landrum knocks
threes down. You have to pick your poison with them and they're very, very
good.  
  
I thought we got off to a great start. I thought our players were competing
and I think the fatigue. The one thing is we had to fight hard to get to this
game. That takes a lot out of them. I credit our players for fighting and
battling, but I think I think we were tired and I think they wanted to play
well. But at some point we got really offensively standing around and I think
a lot of that had to do with the fatigue of back-to-back and how hard we had
to fight to win yesterday's game. So give Baylor credit.  
  
Q. What have you learned about your game fundamentally playing against
Baylor?  
KAYLA GOTH: Good question. I think they expose a lot of your weaknesses. So, I
mean, protecting the ball in general becomes a bit of an issue for somebody
like me who has the ball in their hands a lot. Just their length. Richards was
on me most of the game and she is long, so being able to find open shots kinda
gets tough.  
  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: I would say that we're used to being the team that's a little
longer and a little bit taller on average than everybody else and I think that
was a big challenge to try and move the ball against length. So I think that
contributes to us not standing and not really knowing where to go. I think in
order to when we face bigger teams we need to learn how to move better even
when we're facing teams that are taller.  
  
Q. You guys, you're only two losses the past month to Baylor. How would
you characterize putting yourselves back into the mix and giving yourselves an
opportunity to make the tournament?  
KAYLA GOTH: I think we got back to having fun again. We started to play a
little bit more and I think we came into this game really hoping that we could
pull something off here. I think we got back to having fun and moving the ball
and flying around on defense, and, yeah, just getting back to having fun I
would say.  
  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: Right. I think part of that is we know that our season is
still going to continue. I think in the third quarter there that was a lot of
the motivating factor was looking ahead and saying, okay, we're practicing for
now, of course, but then we're also practicing for tournament stuff as well.
So I think that was contributing. We tried to improve in the areas that we
could I think during then.  
  
Q. You guys, strong start. But in the second quarter it got way. What
does it feel like when they're starting to run at you, clearly because you
guys were a little tired there?  
KAYLA GOTH: It's tough. They're obviously a really good team. They're number
one in the country for a good reason. We got off to a really good start but
honestly I think we did some of that damage to ourselves. We stopped moving
the ball, got dribble happy, stopped finding open people, stuff like that, we
stopped doing what made us good in that first quarter. They're obviously a
really good team, though, and they kinda do that to you. They start to get
aggressive on the ball and deflect passes and stuff like that. But I think we
got away from what made us good.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. Thank you.  
  
Q. You've coached over 27 seasons. This is your fifth season at K-State.
What have you seen differently in this team in particular that you haven't in
the past?  
JEFF MITTIE: This team for the last month has played extremely well. The
growth in this team I think is probably more than I've seen in some of the
teams. Now, we're a young team so you hope that we could have that growth. We
only have two seniors on this roster. But at the same time, having that growth
in the middle of a Big 12 season is not always easy. It's not easy to get the
victories. You can see growth but not necessarily victories. In the last
month, since February 4th the only team we have lost to is Baylor. Baylor is a
tough match-up for everybody. The ability for them to throw 6-7, 6-4 together
that play so well together, that have played so many games together. Their
size is so imposing, so you have to take advantage of every opportunity. But
against, with our group we have seen tremendous growth and we've seen with the
exception against Baylor we have played unbelievably well this last month.  
  
Q. Also, you know, when you're looking at game video, what's the plan?
What's the strategy before you went into this game today against Baylor? How
many hours have you, you know, looking at film and stuff like that?  
JEFF MITTIE: You spend a lot of time trying to figure out how to score. That's
the one thing ironically today, we score more today. We felt like we needed to
hit ten threes against them. We felt like we needed to knock down. We felt
like, yesterday we had 29 attempts and we felt like we needed to get that
number of attempts where Baylor is so good at is they ran us off the line
today. They really got into us and we couldn't get the attempts up, 5 of 19
and some of those were end of shot clock threes that weren't very good. We
just couldn't find enough offense from the 3-point line.  
  
Q. Do you think chemistry becomes a factor within the players, like you
mentioned when you look at Baylor, seeing the teammates, players, playing with
each other for so long?  
JEFF MITTIE: Well, that starting five of theirs with the exception of Chloe
Jackson, and Chloe has blended in nicely with that. It's a group that has
achieved at a high level. It's a group that is extremely competitive,
extremely talented. Many of those teams played AAU ball with or against each
other. So they've known each other longer. That chemistry is great. You see it
with our team. You've seen Goth and Williams playing so well together. Time
can only get some of that. But when you look at Kayla Goth playing 120-plus
games in her career, 90 of those with Peyton Williams. There is the
connections there. What we have seen with our group, the chemistry has
continued to grow like you would hope as a coach. Our young group has
continued to blend better at both ends of the floor.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations on a great season. Good luck.

### [Alexa Middleton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36677)

### [Bridget Carleton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30406)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Iowa State 75, Texas 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Iowa State Cyclones head coach, Bill
Fennelly, and his two student-athletes, Bridget Carleton and Alexa Middleton.
Coach, congratulations on the win and your thoughts about the game?  
  
BILL FENNELLY: An amazing college game. I think this is what postseason
basketball is supposed to be about. That's a great Texas team, similar to
Austin when we got a lead and they came roaring back, but the toughness and
the resiliency of the last 5 minutes was very special and something that has
kept us together. To be playing in the championship game tomorrow is a great
honor for our kids. They're excited about it and it's a great way for Iowa
State to showcase what our university is about and our program is about.  
  
Very proud of the way we played. Bridget was Bridget and Alexa Middleton was a
monster from start to finish. When these two are running our team and running
our offense I stayed out of the way and let them call the plays. Just two
dynamic performances at a time when we really needed it.  
  
Q. Alexa, you're up 16, they tie it with about 3 minutes to go, what is
the mindset of your basketball team when it looked like Texas was going to
roar all the way?  
ALEXA MIDDLETON: We talked about staying poised and continuing to be who we
were that whole game, and I think we did a great job of finding that extra
push when we needed it and stayed together and continued to play as a team and
finishing out the game strong.  
  
Q. Alexa, I mean, how does it feel to make such a big impact in such a
big game and is this kind of why you came to Iowa State?  
ALEXA MIDDLETON: Coach said that to me before the game yesterday. I love it
here and playing with these girls is so much fun. Just tonight was almost a
relief. I felt like I struggled a lot this season shooting-wise and continuing
to stay positive. My teammates have been positive to me. My coaches, too, and
working through that and tonight when they fall it feels really good.  
  
Q. I think you said before the game yesterday he talked to you. What did
he say?  
ALEXA MIDDLETON: He said, this is why you came here, and it is. Moments like
this, playing on a big stage, playing a lot of minutes, this is why I came
here and I'm enjoying every minute of it.  
  
Q. Bridget, there are only two teams left playing for the Big 12 crown.
What does that mean to you to be playing for a championship tomorrow?  
BRIDGET CARLETON: It's amazing. To be at this point in the championship game
to make it to semifinals alone. We haven't done that since 2013 and no one on
the roster has done that, and we knew it was going to be a tough one. But to
come out with this win. We're so excited and to be in this position, I
couldn't ask for a better position to be in with this group of girls. It's so
much fun to play with them, and it's an additional game added on to our
season. So I couldn't ask for anything more.  
  
Q. Bridget, how hectic were those final five minutes or tense were
they?  
BRIDGET CARLETON: They were intense, but we've been in that position many
times this year, teams, you know, throw runs at us late in the fourth quarter.
But we have the poise and the maturity to relax and when Alexa has the ball in
her hands a good decision is going to be made on the offensive end. When they
tied it up I knew it was a matter of getting a good look on the other end and
getting some stops and we were able to do that. We have the experience now. We
were fine and relaxed and it wasn't anything to worry about.  
  
Q. Was there a time when you guys came together and talked about keeping
your composure during that stretch or during a timeout where Coach Fennelly
sent that message to you guys?  
BRIDGET CARLETON: Yeah, we kind of -- every timeout there was in the fourth
quarter it was okay, 10 minutes, left, that's all we've got for 10 minutes and
there was another timeout with 5 minutes and another with 4:30 left. So it was
a matter of taking every possession by possession and just, um, doing what we
can. We're getting good looks. We were getting to the freethrow line. We were
able to knock down freethrows. It was a matter of getting to those positions
and we were able to do that.  
  
Q. Texas is a big team. They hit the glass hard. I thought Ashley Joens
rebounded really well. Were you all impressed with her ability to get the ball
off the glass?  
ALEXA MIDDLETON: Yeah, she has done that all year. She is a great rebounder,
especially on the offensive end. She goes hard and she comes up big when we
need those and she did that tonight. Then knocked down her freethrows, so that
was huge from her.  
  
Q. Bridget, playing Baylor for a third time. What do you guys expect
from them this time around tomorrow night?  
BRIDGET CARLETON: The same thing, they're the number one team in the country
for a reason. They have unbelievable post presence, obviously, and they have
guards who can knock down jumpers. They're a tough match-up, but we're
excited. We need to put together forty minutes to compete with them and we
haven't done that I think this year. So hopefully tomorrow is our time to put
together forty minutes and give it our best shot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies, congratulations. Questions for Coach
Fennelly?  
  
Q. Bill, what did you say to the entire team in the locker room once you
guys got back there at the end of the game?  
BILL FENNELLY: Basically what I told them was obviously how proud we were. I
had all the support staff, everyone in the locker room, just, this is why we
do what we do. The resiliency that they showed to showcase our university, our
program on a grand stage and just really congratulated them.  
  
The other thing I told them was, enjoy this. Don't worry about what's coming
tomorrow. So often you work so hard, you accomplish something and it's
immediately what's next. That's the coaches' job. I told them, enjoy your
friends, your family, celebrate beating a great Texas team and celebrate the
fact that you get to play. Like Bridget said, that's the best point of the
night is they get to play another game with each other. It's one more game
they get to play together.  
  
Some groups, that's the last thing they want. This group, that is probably the
biggest thing about winning tonight is it adds another game to the schedule.
That's a great thing.  
  
Q. In the first half, things were coming pretty easy, just because you
were hitting shots, the shots weren't falling the second half, you missed 16
straight at one point. How were you able to survive that stretch and come out
with a win?  
BILL FENNELLY: I think when you miss shots there are a couple of things,
obviously, you gotta give credit to Texas' defense, they ratcheted it up. They
were face guarding Bridget. We did have shots we missed. You get a little
tired, you lose your legs a little bit and then what happens -- what you're
making them it's contagious and when you're missing them it's contagious and
we only turned the ball over two or three times the second half. It wasn't
like we weren't getting a chance to score but that happens. Sometimes you
outscore the other team and sometimes you have to keep guarding and I thought
overall, we kept guarding.  
  
Obviously their size is overwhelming and we don't really match-up with that.
But we had to, you know, keep 'em out of transition and do the best we could
reboundingwise. And overall I thought defensively it kept us in the game when
we were wobbling. I tell them, it's like a fight. You're on the ropes. Get
your gloves up, get to the bell and then let's come back out again. Our kids
can do that.  
  
Q. I think you just answered my question, but, they tie it up with three
minutes to go. Did you have a message specifically to your players? Did you
say something verbally to Bridget or Alexa or anybody?  
BILL FENNELLY: I told Bridget and Alexa, I said, no one touches the ball or
makes a decision unless you two do it. We didn't call a timeout. There was a
freethrow and I grabbed 'em real quick and said, it's your team. Make the
choice. Figure it out, and we made a couple of adjustments on a play call. The
play Bridget made in transition was a huge play, kind of a broken court thing.
We made a great pass. Bridget made a great catch and score. You're up two, you
get a stop and now you're up five and now it's a two-possession game again.
The way that ball went in the basket, you could tell -- the energy level on
our team went really, really high and the energy level on their team probably
sunk a little on that play.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about Baylor. Your third time around, like Bridget said,
you haven't played a 100% game against them yet, but it's two best teams and
World War III is coming up tomorrow.  
BILL FENNELLY: It's like someone asked me when I was walking down the hall,
are you excited to play Baylor tomorrow? And the answer is yes, because if
we're not playing tomorrow we lost tonight. So I just want to play tomorrow.
Baylor, obviously they are the number one team in the country and I think it
speaks to the strength of our league. I don't know who bracketology, what that
degree is, but if you sit on the bench like I do and watch a West Virginia and
watch a TCU play and you have to play Baylor twice and you have to play
everyone twice and then you see a Texas team like tonight, you know, there is
no way.  
  
Again, the numbers thing, there is no way West Virginia and TCU shouldn't be
in the NCAA tournament. Because, again, at some point it's about basketball
it's not about numbers. If you want to play the best teams then that's what
this league has done and every one of us is trying to beat Baylor. But every
year you start your conference schedule with two losses. You do. Let's be
honest. There is no other league in the country that does that. I don't think
our league should be penalized for that and if you watched the TCU-Texas game
last night you tell me that's not an NCAA team. We lost at West Virginia and I
coached against them. You win 11 games in this league you should be playing in
the NCAA tournament.  
  
No one told me to say that. I just feel really strongly about that, because
sometimes, and we've all been in that position, and I hope the Committee looks
at video and watches games and sees that if they want the best teams to play
in the greatest sporting event in our country, there should be all those teams
in the tournament in my opinion. Sorry. I didn't mean to go on an editorial --
I'm avoiding the Baylor question. (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. She mentioned that the people that she had make the Big 12, they
should be in the tournament, historically if you win double digits --  
BILL FENNELLY: Yeah, if you win 10, 12 games in this league, as soon as you
say that, there is another team on the bubble or whatever, but if you want to
line up and play, let's line up and play. And I think West Virginia, TCU
easily can line up with anyone in the field and would do a great job of
representing, like I said, what this tournament is supposed to be about. I
hope they get the call on the 18th, because we've all been there. There's not
a lot of things worse than sitting around until Selection Monday not knowing
what's going to happen.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you beat Baylor?  
BILL FENNELLY: The one thing that we'll tell our players and it's what we've
told them before. Number one, you can't be beat. I've had a lot of teams at
Iowa State. We've had a lot of teams. As soon as Baylor showed up on the
schedule the game was over. We didn't want to play them. Number one, you've
got to believe that you can play them. Number two, we don't have to beat the
Thunder four out of seven. We gotta beat them one time, forty minutes. That's
what postseason basketball is all about. The other thing is, they have to play
not their best. We have to play like we played in the first quarter probably
for four quarters, and give yourself a chance and eliminate the knock out
punch which they are so good at, as good as any team in the country. Hopefully
we've got enough in our legs to go out and compete and have a great
championship game. Appreciate your time. Thanks for being here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

### [Karen Aston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24311)

### [Jatarie White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34773)

### [Sug Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36669)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Iowa State 75, Texas 69  
  
THE MODERATOR: We were joined by the University of Texas Longhorns head coach,
Karen Aston, and her two student-athletes, Sug Sutton and Jatarie White.
Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game?  
  
KAREN ASTON: First of all, congratulations to Iowa State. Obviously a hard-
fought game, and congratulations on a great year for them in particular.
Tough, tough loss for us. Just in a sense of we dug ourselves a little bit of
a hole, which we did last game in Austin. But the sense of urgency and our
attention to detail was so much better tonight in a sense of being able to
regroup.  
  
The other thing I thought was so much better for our team was the ability to
get the ball in the right places as the game moved along. We got it obviously
in the paint some. Had some kids open up the floor with some perimeter
shooting. We had much better flow offensively. But, again, very, very tough
loss, really disappoint for our players because I thought we had ourselves in
a position with some momentum, and had a tough situation happen that I
wouldn't wish on anybody. I'm really proud of our team, proud of their effort,
proud of how much they've grown in really just a week or two. I've seen a
dramatic difference in how much our team is blending together and growing, so
we will move forward from here.  
  
Q. Sug, you're down 16 in the second half. Did you personally have a
message to your teammates when it looked like it was getting away from you?  
SUG SUTTON: I think it was a collective thing. Everybody was in the huddle
telling each other that we need to get out this hole and play with a lot of
heart. We've been in the position before, so we just needed to come together
and play with a lot of heart.  
  
Q. What have you guys been working on individually throughout the
season?  
JATARIE WHITE: Well, postwise we've been working on kinda getting physical in
the paint, making sure all of our shots are to the basket and not fading away.
Also, as a team we've been working on, like, building each other up and making
sure that if somebody makes a bad play or a bad decision just picking them up
because we've got to move on to the next thing. So I think those are the
biggest things.  
  
Q. Jatarie, Coach mentioned getting the ball into the right places at
the right time in the second half. Looked like you and Joyner were open. Talk
about what it took to make it all the way back to a tie?  
JATARIE WHITE: I think it took everybody making sure we were in the right
spots moving at the right tempo. Being patient on our screens and making sure
we buried our men and since we had the size advantage kinda getting in the
paint and doing our work there. I think the guards did a good job of
recognizing that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations and good luck.  
  
Q. Coach, team rallied back from 16 points toward the end of the game.
You guys sorta pulled back away. What was the deference in the game that you
saw?  
KAREN ASTON: Well, I definitely thought that shot selection had a lot to do
with the flow of the game in the second half. We got the ball where it needed
to be a little bit better than we did in the first half, didn't shoot it as
quick in the first half that led into easy buckets for them. Alexa Middleton
was really good tonight. We gambled a little bit on going not under her early
in the game and she made us pay for it. I thought we made adjustments
defensively. We got a guard on Bridget midway through the first half which I
thought helped us defensively. It was anybody's game. It really was.  
  
Q. Why is their 3-point game so difficult to defend?  
KAREN ASTON: I think it's decision making on their part. They really, really
share the ball well. So I think that's always a big piece of good offensive
flow is when the ball doesn't stop in someone's hands all the time and they
have a good flow. They all share it together. They make the right plays at the
right time, and they can all shoot it. That helps. The fact that they all can
shoot it. But I think it also takes collective effort to make the right play
and make the right pass.  
  
Q. I've never seen her even raise her voice, but did you talk to Olamide
take after the technical foul? I've never seen her do that even in practice.  
KAREN ASTON: Yeah, that's a tough one for me. I mean that young lady I asked
her to go in for one minute and do her best. Give Jatarie a break for one
minute. And she makes a hell of a play. She didn't say anything. She didn't
bend down. I have a hard time with that. I have a hard time with that.  
  
Q. Did they explain it? Was it a stare down thing? I'm just asking. I
don't know.  
KAREN ASTON: Yeah, I just watched it.  
  
Q. Can a game like this help you in the future because of how you came
back and there must be some good feelings in the locker room to know that they
made a battle of it until the very end?  
KAREN ASTON: It's hard for those kids to have good feelings. I mean, as a
coaching staff we're absolutely going to try to lift them up because it was a
difficult set of circumstances that changed the game. But, you know, in sports
you have to teach them that it's not about one play. You have to teach them
that, you know, unless it's golf or tennis, one person's not responsible for a
win or loss and that's the way sports is, team sports. Our team has got to
look at this performance and say, okay, where could we all have been better
and move forward. But to answer your question, we should be lifting them,
because we're playing a little bit different basketball. You've seen us all
year long, Rick, and you know we've been on a roller coaster all year long,
but I think the team's cohesiveness is better right now and I think we're on
an upswing. I will be shocked if our seeding doesn't improve on the
performance given the last three games and I will be shocked in the Big 12
doesn't get six in. But right now I just want my team to, you know, you've got
an Audrey Warren that's not played much at all since her concussion and comes
in and starts and plays her heart out. I have a lot of things to be excited
about with this group.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good luck, Coach. Thank you.

### [Marlene Stollings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27751)

### [Chrislyn Carr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36652)

### [Sydney Goodson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36651)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor 100, Texas Tech 61  
  
The MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Texas Tech Lady Raiders, Coach
Stollings, Chrislyn Carr, Brittany Brewer and Sydney Goodson. Coach?  
  
MARLENE STOLLINGS: You have to start with giving Baylor a lot of credit.
They're number one in the country for a reason. They played like it today.
They're so physical. They're so deep and they're so long and athletic that
they're hard to go against. We had a good first quarter and after that, you
know, it got kind of difficult for us. But what I will say is I'm really proud
of our team, because we came from a seven win season last year when we arrived
about eight months ago and they doubled their win total this year to 14,
quadrupled their Big 12 conference win total from 1 to 5, and we get to leave
this tournament scoring the most points ever at 104 yesterday. I'm proud of
our team, the young women and the start of something special brewing in
Lubbock.  
  
Q. For all of you, Chrislyn, I know you're a freshman, but how have you
experienced the turnaround with Coach this season?  
BRITTANY BREWER: I would say the turnaround is overall our heart for the game
and just like I feel like even our skill level has raised. When they came in
they expected a lot out of us that we had not seen before and a lot of us rose
to that expectation and took that into play and our hard work ethic and stuff
like that has really raised.  
  
SYDNEY GOODSON: I redshirted last year, but I got to watch all the games and I
think we brought heart. We're playing a lot harder. I think we understand to
win games in the Big 12 with you have to play hard and I think we did that.  
  
CHRISLYN CARR: You can definitely see how much they've grown as players,
especially Brittany just being physical and scoring the ball. She was a big
piece of our team this year, so I would definitely say the main thing was
growth.  
  
Q. Chrislyn, is there a player on the team that you look up to or a
player within the league, WNBA that you look up to, looking at their
fundamentals and trying to get better?  
CHRISLYN CARR: I would definitely say I look up to my whole team. They all
bring something new every day, whether it's their words or their actions on
the court. So I would definitely say I look up to my team and I'm thankful to
be playing with these girls, and in the WNBA I watch Maya Moore play a lot. I
like her game and how she plays and how she plays with toughness the whole
game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Coach, what are some of the things you are most proud of in this team
and that you've seen in your first season here?  
MARLENE STOLLINGS: I think just the fight that really jumps out at me, their
fight and toughness. We lost 10 games by single digits. So just a tremendous,
tremendous swing. We went from some of the kids saying, hey, Coach, people
don't take us serious, even during warm-ups to being an incredible team and I
told them to leave here feeling proud about that. They've left their mark and
they've helped lay the foundation of where we're headed.  
  
Q. Looking toward next season, are you going to change up your strategy?
With regards to your team anything that you think you can make a change to
hopefully win the championship one day?  
MARLENE STOLLINGS: I took the Texas Tech job to win championships, so that's
exciting big picture. We have to be realistic in our progression and you win
with talented players and good people. So it's going to take us a little bit
of time to get exactly where we want to go, but this is definitely a big start
for us. In some ways it exceeded even my expectations.  
  
Q. Coach, I know Chrislyn got in foul trouble there. How much of an
impact did that make while she was out of the game?  
MARLENE STOLLINGS: It always hurts us when she is in foul trouble early, but
we had to put her back in quick. She was back in there in the second quarter
when they made the big jump and we never really recovered from it. Any time
she is out early in the game from our team this year, it had an impact on us.
She is doing pretty good with that, but her physicality got to her a little
bit early there in the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

### [Christalah Lyons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34744)

### [Kylee Kopatich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36648)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Iowa State 75, Kansas 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by the Kansas Jayhawks, head coach Brandon
Schneider, student-athletes, Christalah Lyons, Kylee Kopatich and Brianna
Osorio. Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game?  
  
BRANDON SCHNEIDER: I was really proud of our fight. I know we got down but
continued to compete until the very end, which is indicative of this team's
character. Led by a terrific group of seniors. I think Iowa State is an hell
of a team. I would not be surprised if they advanced very, very deep in the
NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. For all the players, talk about the moment that your coach shared
with you at the end of the game, you guys are seniors, last time playing, talk
about that moment.  
KYLEE KOPATICH: Well, I'm going to try to not say a lot because then I will
start to tear up. But he expressed how much the coaching staff cares about us
and how much they love us and how proud they are of us and all of the
successes over the last couple of years. That's all I'm going to say. I'm
going to start to cry.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Would you like to respond?  
  
CHRISTALAH LYONS: I think it was a lot of emotions after the game, a lot of
tears, because this is the last year playing.  
  
Q. For all the seniors. Just describe probably the best moment that you
guys had over your career.  
KYLEE KOPATICH: I got this. Beating K-State at K-State.  
  
CHRISTALAH LYONS: Yep.  
  
BRIANNA OSORIO: Yeah, that's it.  
  
Q. Just describe the relationship with your coach. It seemed like a
touching moment, everybody was feeling the moment, it seemed so special. What
was the relationship like and some gems that he's taught you guys throughout
the years.  
CHRISTALAH LYONS: For me, it was personal, because Coach Brandon was only one
of the few people that recruited me out of college and JUCO and he's a caring
person and cares for every single one of his players, which stood out to me
about Coach Brandon.  
  
KYLEE KOPATICH: Being a four-year player of his, we've been through a lot,
I'll say that. There have been some ups and downs, some we expected and some
we didn't. The loyalty that we had for each other and the love that he just
continued to show me and Kylee and Chelsea who have stuck around with him.
It's great to have him as a coach and if I had to do it all over again I would
pick him again.  
  
BRIANNA OSORIO: I really felt at home once he recruited me and we have a
unique relationship. I make fun of him. He makes fun of me, so I'll miss that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach now?  
  
Q. Coach, I can just tell the relationship with you and your players is
very good. You guys look like you're in good spirits and at the end of the
game I saw you were really emotional. Talk about your relationship with your
three seniors up here and the moment that you had with them at the end of the
game.  
BRANDON SCHNEIDER: I think Kylee used a great word. They are extremely loyal,
and they demonstrate that every day by their hard work and their dedication,
their willingness to be coached and be challenged. I thought they demonstrated
their competitive spirit, not only today but in this tournament. I'm really
glad that we could share the game that we had last night together. But, you
know, people talk about family all the time, but I really do believe in our
program that it's genuine, and I think our players understand that when they
make a commitment to come to the University of Kansas it may be a two-year or
four-year commitment. But in return they're getting a lifetime commitment from
our coaching staff.  
  
Q. So speaking on that, moving forward now losing some players that are
by big part of the family, how are you going to move forward from there?  
BRANDON SCHNEIDER: We've got a lot of work to do in recruiting still. We did
sign five players early. In the early signing period, but we still have a few
scholarships, and we'll aggressively continue to try to improve our program.  
  
Q. In what ways do you think are the main things that didn't work that
you can also improve on, in terms of recruiting and building for next
season?  
BRANDON SCHNEIDER: I don't know that early in our time at Kansas we focused
enough on culture and chemistry, and I can tell you that after having a couple
of rough years, that is a premium on which we make every decision. I think
it's now why you can see three young ladies in front of you who have such high
character.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

### [Kianna Ray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34762)

### [Amy Okonkwo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32708)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas 66, TCU 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by TCU Horned Frogs, Raegan Pebley, her two
student-athletes, Kianna Ray and Amy Okonkwo. Coach, your thoughts about the
game?  
  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: Congrats to Texas. Definitely a battle. Felt like that was an
NCAA tournament game. It was very, very physical. Extremely physical. I'm
proud of TCU. I'm proud of these players to my right and proud of the players
in the locker room. Proud of everything that they've put into the team and the
season and proud of everything that they have left in them, too. This is a
very driven and motivated team with a lot left in their tank. Just very
honored to coach them.  
  
Q. Kianna, talk about what emotions are going through your head, the
team in the huddle, late in the game when it's so tight and you guys know it's
leave or go home?  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: I think late in the huddle we're eyes on the prize. We still in
our heads. We weren't down any point in that game to us. I think just locking
in on each other and trying to continue to fight for each other, which I think
we did, 100%. But, yeah, just staying focused.  
  
Q. Amy, you had a great night, 21 points, double-double. Can you talk
about how you were able to come up and lead on the team offensively,
especially with Jordan in foul trouble?  
AMY OKONKWO: I felt like I had to do whatever my team needed. If that was
rebounding, do that. If that was scoring, do that. Just try to do what I can
with Jordan on the bench and try to do what I can so when she came back in we
could both, you know, help each other.  
  
Q. Kianna, long time since Bowie, 0-9 five days ago and you were lights
out tonight. I thought you were maybe the biggest reason you guys were there
at the very end. The difference between last Tuesday and today for you is...  
KIANNA RAY: Confidence. My teammates telling me to keep shooting it and my
role on this team is to look to score. I can't get inside of myself. I have to
look to pour out into my teammates and take whatever they're pouring into me.  
  
Q. When you were warming up your shirt said "family." Did the way you
played today demonstrate that you take that to heart?  
AMY OKONKWO: Most definitely. The frog family. We're going to stay together no
matter what.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, obviously this game was huge for you guys. NCAA tournament
hopes for a bid. The Texas coach was talking about, she believes that you guys
are still a high contender for a bid. What are your thoughts on that and do
you feel like the Big 12 was good enough this season to get six teams in?  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: Absolutely I do. I think we're one of the top RPI leagues in
the country. I mean, if you look at the quality of games and I know, you know,
the committee is not always looking at eyeball tests and who looks like a good
team but even just a -- it's not easy going to Lubbock and getting wins and
everybody has to do that and it's not easy going to Manhattan and getting
wins. This is a tough league to play in. I think the fact that we're a league
where you've got to play everybody twice is something that makes us even a
better team or a better league compared to most Power Five leagues don't do
that. Absolutely. I know I'm biased. I think that we're still a very good
resume-built team for the NCAA Committee to consider. I know we're a team that
is so locked in and still fighting and healthy and healthy mentally, healthy
physically, and we've battled. We've battled. You look at a game like this and
this is sports. You know, couple possessions go a different way. Is that one
couple of possessions going to be the difference between us in or out? I hope
not. I hope that we can look more at our body of work and what we've done.  
  
Q. Obviously something that stands out is they were able to contain
Jordan really, really well. What happens to your team whenever she is on the
bench with four fouls and zero points and other girls have to step up and at
the same time talk about the way the other girls really did step up tonight?  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: I mean, the way that Jordan was played led a lot to her going
0-8, only shooting 4 free throws. This is one of the top field goal percentage
players in our league to go 0-8 right at the rim. She needed her other
teammates to step up because of how that was going for her. But, you know, she
had the confidence, we had the confidence in them and I was really proud to
see them step up and hit some of those shots and capitalize off of their
opportunities. They work hard. They work really hard to develop that
confidence.  
  
Q. Coach, did Texas do anything that was surprisingly strategic or did
you anticipate, you know, because you're familiar with this team?  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: There probably wasn't a lot of surprises out of either them or
us, you know, for each other, especially considering we just played each
other. But I was really proud of some of these players like Adeola Akomolafe
coming in and the confidence that she had. She not only didn't play a lot of
minutes but those minutes were not productive. And Kianna Ray coming in and
hitting shots that she didn't when we played them at our place on senior
night. We outrebounded one of the best rebounding teams in the country. There
was just a lot we did well except we just didn't get three more points.  
  
Q. You are going to lose two great players. Amy just had her career high
and Jordan is a really good player as well. So how do you think things will be
moving forward without those pieces?  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: We're losing great players, but we're graduating great people.
You know, what they've done for our program is just continue to set a standard
for what that means to be a part of our program and the unconditional
commitment that it requires, the vulnerability that it requires, the growth
mindset that it requires, and I just have tried to value every single day that
I've had to coach these seniors, and I'm serious about that. It's been easy
because I love coaching them. They are, man, they are just awesome people. I'm
going to miss the people that they are more than players. But I know they will
be around. Amy is never leaving. I know that for sure. People in the Big 12
office know that. She is not leaving. She is staying around.  
  
Q. Coach, it happened last Tuesday and happened again today. What sets
Sug apart. They don't win this game without her direction.  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: I thought we did a better job on her tonight than we did in
Fort Worth. I think Sug works really hard. I'm not the coach of their team. I
don't see what she does in their practices. But, to me, she is somebody who
paid close attention to Ariel Atkins and probably took some pages out of that
book.  
  
Q. Coach, how are you able to keep your team motivated following what is
a heartbreaking loss? Waiting for the NCAA announcements?  
RAEGAN PEBLEY: This team has been easy to motivate all season. They've been
driven, so I'm not worried about keeping them motivated. They want to get
better and they're going to use this next week. We always use this week to
serve our community in Fort Worth in some way while we wait. We're going to
use this week to get better as a team and we're going to have fun.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Kalani Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30449)

### [NaLyssa Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36658)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Baylor 100, Texas Tech 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by our Baylor Bears, head coach, Kim Mulkey
and her student athletes, NaLyssa Smith and Kalani Brown. Coach, your thoughts
about the game?  
  
KIM MULKEY: Yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: I thought so.  
  
Q. Kalani, seven players in double figures for you guys. I think it was
a Big 12 Tournament record. What does that say about your team?  
KALANI BROWN: Our bench is really deep. We have numbers and we can put
different combinations in players for different styles of play which I think
will help us in the NCAA Tourney going forward. Today our bench did it for us
and was able to get the starters off to rest and as long as we can keep
playing like that we can go really far.  
  
Q. NaLyssa, going on what Kalani said about the bench you outscored them
52-0. You guys outscored them on the bench. Talk about the performance of you
guys because whenever somebody from the bench comes in and a starter goes out,
you guys don't lose any rhythm or anything at all.  
NALYSSA SMITH: It just shows that we're always ready on the bench, so when our
name is called it just shows that when we go in we gotta do what we can do and
we've got to rest our starters for bigger and better things down the road and
we have to handle business so they don't cut the lead.  
  
Q. NaLyssa, relaying off that, the fact the starters didn't play at all
in the fourth quarter and you guys still outscored them, 28-17 was that a
pride thing, not to let them cut into the lead?  
NALYSSA SMITH: For sure, because when we played with them the first time they
cut the lead and we didn't hear the end of it that time, so we had to make
sure we maintained that lead and make sure they didn't cut into it.  
  
Q. NaLyssa, talk about you're a freshman here on the team. What have you
learned from Kalani during the season? Is she your big sister? Talk to me
about the chemistry between you guys.  
NALYSSA SMITH: I've learned a lot from Kalani. She is my mom on the team. She
makes sure I'm doing everything right on and off the court. You see how far
she is getting so I just want to walk in her footsteps, and do what she has
done.  
  
Q. For either of the players, can you try to describe what it's like,
the feeling when you get on one of those runs that just -- like a tidal wave
of points off turnovers or whatever. What's that feel like on the court?  
KALANI BROWN: To me, it just feels like you're having fun when everybody is
scoring and everybody is getting to play. You don't lose no energy. We come
out with a lot of energy. You just want to come out and have fun. When you
stop having fun you stop playing.  
  
NALYSSA SMITH: It's just very fun everybody getting to score and everybody
doing what they love.  
  
Q. Kalani, in a tournament like this where you have three games in three
days. How beneficial would it be for you to sit out the fourth quarter and
only play 17 minutes?  
KALANI BROWN: It's definitely beneficial for me to sit out and all the
starters. The fact that our bench took care of business today shows a lot
about them and us as a team and I'm very proud of our bench today, especially
the younger ones.  
  
Q. Kalani, Tech scored 104 yesterday and Brewer had 40 and you guys were
able to shut 'em down and shut her down. Obviously, that defense is something
that Kim stresses all the time. But is that something you guys will point to
as well?  
KALANI BROWN: Absolutely. We have the two-time Defensive Player of the Year.
We take pride in our defense. Coach rides us about it all the time. Just
performing, basically.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations.  
  
Q. Kim, I guess the bench, what they were able to do today and
particularly in that fourth quarter like NaLyssa talked about. They kind of
came back on you in the fourth quarter there, what the bench was able to do
today?  
KIM MULKEY: I hate using the word "bench" because those kids could start for
us. They're all that good. It's just y'all don't get to see them. They're
freshmen and when you saw today is the future here. I'm so happy for NaLyssa
Smith and those kids that finally just could relax and play a lot of minutes
and valuable minutes and didn't look at the scoreboard, not mop up minutes.
When you play this many games and you're trying to play for bigger things down
the road as much rest as you can give the ones who get the most minutes it's
beneficial.  
  
It wasn't that they just relieved them of playing time. It's what they did
when they got that playing time. They were so productive.  
  
Q. Kim, DiDi is mostly known for her defense and being the all-stopper.
But 7 assists today and I think you had a tournament record, 32, for the game.
Just her passing, is that something that's underrated?  
KIM MULKEY: I think all our kids are underrated, if you want to know the
truth. But we have an hell of a team, don't we? When you have seven kids
scoring double figures and really I guess I could have given Queen a few more
minutes and a couple more shots and we would have had eight. That's what wins
championships, your defense first and then sharing the basketball. We lead the
country and if we don't we're there at the top in assist-to-turnover ratio.
We're going to share the wealth and guard you on both ends of the floor.  
  
I'm not surprised, DiDi pretty much can do it all. She can defend you. She has
length on the perimeter. She can play point and has on some sets that we have.
She never gets tired.  
  
Q. Coach, what was your defense game plan knowing that Brewer scored 40
last night and Carr was the Big 12 Freshman of the Year?  
KIM MULKEY: Nothing any different. We played those guys twice and we didn't go
in there and change anything that we do defensively. Just make sure you have
your match-ups, who is guarding who is very important to me. I thought DiDi
being on the point guard because DeGrate is not playing as much for them, and
DiDi being on the point guard, Carr was important and Lauren Cox being on
Brewer. Those are our best two defense players and we need to make sure
they're on our best office players.  
  
Q. You were named Coach of the Year for the Big 12 seven times.
Congratulations. Talk to me about your coaching style and how important it is
for you to be out there to have that chemistry with your players to make it
this far?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I'm very mild. I'm very meek. I'm very passive, and they
want to play for a coach that's like that. No, I don't know. (Laughter.) April
fool, huh? Listen, I put those tennis shoes on many years ago and played for
some of the most intense coaches, Pat Summitt and Leon Barmore. They know that
every ounce of energy I have during a game they're going to get out of me and
I want it out of them. They know that behind the scenes, Coach is real, Coach
is funny, quick-witted, say things in timeouts that makes them want to bust
out laughing. But that's not what the public needs to see and not what the
public does see. I really don't care. All I care about are those kids in that
locker room. I care about my family and I care about my kids and I care about
my coaches and that I represent Baylor in a way that makes them proud. I hate
losing and I want them to hate losing. I don't want to coach a kid where
losing is okay. They don't come to Baylor to win individual awards. They come
to Baylor to win championships. All those kids are excited right now because
they all have a Big 12 Championship ring. That's what they come to Baylor for,
to play for bigger things than just an individual award.  
  
Q. A little take-off on that. You said that you thought some of your
players were underrated. Is it just because you spread is out so much that
it's virtually impossible if someone's not going to play 20 minutes, for
example, that you're going to lose an MVP, for example?  
KIM MULKEY: Rick, it's a good question and I'm going to try to explain this in
a way -- first of all, all the kids who won individual awards, congratulations
to them. It's just hard for me to accept that an individual award a kid that
shoots 15 and 20 times a game for her team, she needs to do that. I can't
fault any kid that does that. But if you're playing on a team, the team that
spreads the wealth the most is usually the team that's going to win
championships. So why do we not reward those great players that could go to
those other schools and shoot it 30 times a game, but they choose to come to a
team where it's about the team and about championships. Why don't we reward
those kids? I struggle with that. When I was a player out of high school I
signed at Louisiana Tech they made it to their first Final Four and they had
five returning starters and everybody was like you're nuts to go there. You're
going to be a junior before you play. So go to another school and average
forty minutes a game and 15-20 shots a game. Well, is it about stats, really?
Is that what it's about? Do you think I could get Kalani Brown 30 shots a
game? I don't know. She is doubled and tripled team, but what Kalani Brown
does is makes everybody around her better, because she draws all that
attention. So I struggle with -- I don't know why we send out stats when we
vote on awards. If you've played people you should remember who hurt you. If
you are recruiting you should know, gosh, I would love to have that kid on my
team. That's what I struggle with, but that doesn't take way from people who
win those awards. Why did I get Coach of the Year? Why did I get Coach of the
Year? Because I coach a great team. But yet we can't reward those kids? I
would take my Coach of the Year any day and give it to 'em, because I am only
as good as those kids. I hope I've explained it. It's not to take away and say
somebody is not deserving of it, every year it's in the NBA, it's the same
thing. Who puts up the most shots. You may be the most valuable player for
your team, without a doubt, but are you the best player in the league? That's
what I struggle with. Everybody has an opinion, Rick. It's like politics,
right? We all have an opinion. The one thing I do wish that we would do is put
our name on the ballots. We did that last year. I'm not afraid to tell anybody
who I vote for. I just wish that we would put our name on the ballots when we
vote at the end of the year. Why not? Y'all do it when you do polls, don't
you? Sign your name. Who voted? I love these kids and what I love the most is
they chose to come to Baylor and share the wealth and they didn't say, oh, I'm
going somewhere elsewhere I can average this or be this or be this or be that.
That's what you known you've got some unselfish kids. What a fun group to
coach.  
  
Q. Coach, I saw you had words for Coach Stollings after the game. What
did you say to her knowing that this is her first season in the Big 12?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't remember if I said it, but she had two quick hitters that
she ran yesterday and I might use them for the playoffs. I said I might make a
call to you. She wished us well in the playoffs and thanked me for
representing the Big 12 the way we have. I told her how hard her kids are
playing, what a tremendous turnaround. It may not show in the wins and losses,
but watching the growth of some of those players from last year to this year,
complimenting her on things she is doing from a distance as a competitor, as a
coach on the opposite end of the floor.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Kansas State 72, West Virginia 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the K-State Wildcats, Head Coach Jeff
Mittie and his student-athletes, Peyton Williams and Rachel Ranke. Coach, your
thoughts about this afternoon's game?  
  
JEFF MITTIE: First off, I thought as a 4-5 game it's a high-level game in this
league. I thought it was a high-level game. Sloppy at times, but I think that
was the effort. Both peoples were playing with such great effort and energy.
This time of the year everyone talks about NCAA tournament teams and West
Virginia is a NCAA tournament team. There is no doubt in my mind. I want to
make that clear. You look at -- what I will say about West Virginia is that
nobody in the tournament will want to play them. I can assure you.  
  
That is a team that has taken Baylor to the wire recently. It's a team that
wins 11 games in our league and anybody that's gone the double round robin you
win 11 games in a league, to me it's a no-brainer that you're in the
tournament. So all the bracketology, all those things that come out, I know
they have a lot of criteria for that, but I can tell you if you're watching
that game and you're watching the eye test, the eye test says West Virginia is
an NCAA tournament team.  
  
My thoughts about today, I thought as of a high-level game, I thought our
players came to play, I thought our group played defensively. We were able to
get turnovers with our defense. As the game wore on we shared the ball better
we passed the ball better. We had multiple players step up and play. I thought
we had big plays from Rachel Ranke down the stretch. I thought we had big
plays. Laura Macke hits a big 3 on the wing. Big defensive plays. Rachel's
defense has continued to get better and better and make plays. So I thought we
played well today, and we knew we were going to have to play well to beat a
very good West Virginia team.  
  
Q. Rachel, to have the season you've had where you've struggled at
points and put a game like this together, how does it feel?  
RACHEL RANKE: It feels good. Come March you want to be playing your best
basketball. So, yes, there was times where I had to overcome adversity this
season. So, yeah, just right now I feel like we are at the top right now,
playing pretty good basketball. So we're going to try to keep that rolling.  
  
Q. What do you do to overcome adversity?  
RACHEL RANKE: Got in the gym and shot a little bit more. Had my teammates help
me out and coached helped me out during that time. Sophomore slump is what
Coach called it, so I had people helping me out.  
  
JEFF MITTIE: I told her she was a junior! (Chuckles.)  
  
Q. Peyton, if you look at the stats you forced 25 turnovers and you had
18 steals. I thought that was the difference of the game. Your thoughts on
that?  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: I thought especially up front our guards played really
aggressive and tried to get into the shorts of West Virginia's point guard and
I think it was really successful, especially for a young point guard to have
to handle that pressure is really difficult. Yeah, it was -- I didn't have to
run back a lot because we had a lot of layups and that was nice for me. So I
think our defensive effort helped us tremendously that game for sure.  
  
Q. Peyton and Rachel, both of you guys had big games tonight. What was
your mentality coming into this game?  
RACHEL RANKE: Survive and advance. We just came out ready to play. Wet to play
again tomorrow so we just came out and we had to get it done on the defensive
end and we did so.  
  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: I think the biggest mindset is, like Coach said, this is a
tournament-caliber team. We knew we couldn't take anything for granted. We had
to come out strong and we came in saying we have to win defensively first and
we did that today.  
  
Q. As you can see, you know, WV got back in the swing of things toward
the end. What do you need to do now moving forward to stay competitive in the
Big 12?  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: That is a good question. I think just pay attention,
especially when teams are trying to get back. They go to those players that
are the trusted ones that have been the trusted ones over the course of the
season. So sticking to the scout I think is going to be really important
during those times. Davenport and Niblack tried to go to their drive and that
was something we were expecting and we have to be prepared for that next game,
too, staying to the scout and stay on top late in those games.  
  
RACHEL RANKE: What she said.  
  
Q. They got back within one a couple different times there. How do you
shore up mentally to hold off those runs?  
RACHEL RANKE: Well, every game the team -- the opposing team is going to go on
a run at some point. We had to come together as a team and stop the run and we
huddled up in our little huddle, I guess, and we talked about staying
composed, putting in a little bit more effort on the defensively end because
they're going to go on a run and we just had to stop them.  
  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: And amp up the defense and staying poised I think were keys
in those times.  
  
Q. Peyton, what makes you the most proud of the way Rachel has handled
that adversity?  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: I think as a young player coming off a year of so much
success, a freshman year where she contributed a lot to go through that is
mentally frustrating, especially when you know that you can shoot really well,
and we all knew that. I'm really proud of her, absolutely. I'm glad we as a
team could rally around her and stay -- just keep telling her, hey, we believe
it in you, too. Don't get down on yourself. Keep doing what you do and it paid
off. She came out to play today. I love it. I love it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Congratulations.  
  
JEFF MITTIE: The biggest thing I would add to that is that you know Rachel
gets four buckets inside the arc so that has given her another avenue to get
points. Her all-around game is so much better, the defensive end, the whole
thing. That has been a drastic improvement for her. I'm proud of the
development that she has had, stay the course and players like Peyton and
Kayla Goth have helped her through that because they went through it as well
in their careers. So that's the advance of our leadership.  
  
Q. Coach, you spoke to how good of a team West Virginia is, and you
split the season series with them, 1-1. What was your game plan coming into
today's match-up?  
JEFF MITTIE: You know, Tucker, we wanted to get them off the line better. We
felt like in Manhattan in our victory we didn't do things well defensively, so
we need to get them off the line. I thought we did a great job on Tynice
Martin and on Naomi Davenport. That was the plan to get them extended, and
offensively we wanted to be aggressive. I think your players got to make plays
I didn't want to call a lot of plays today. I wanted them to go make plays and
our group had that mentality.  
  
Q. As you mentioned before, WV is a very competitive team. I just want
to know your thoughts, basically you guys are ranked No. 5 within the seed and
they're ranked 4. Just to elaborate, does it matter about the ranking? You
guys obviously took the win today.  
JEFF MITTIE: We tied for 4th and the tie-breaking procedures put us at fifth.
I think when you get to the quality teams that you have in our league, you're
going to have to play. You're going to have to play.  
  
We have had three very different games against them, which happens a lot when
you play teams. One night the offense is great. The game in Morgantown we
couldn't throw it in the ocean and they could throw it in the ocean a little
bit better. Here today, this was a highly-competitive game. Justin mentioned
it was a 1-point game numerous times there, and what I liked is the players
had the ability to stay within themselves and make a push-back at them when
West Virginia came at them. That has been an improved part of our run in the
last 8 of 9, I guess, is where we're at. So that's been the improvement.  
  
Q. So last time y'all played, Tynice had 20-plus points, but in this
game she didn't reach double figures. What adjustment did you make in this
game to keep her in check?  
JEFF MITTIE: We wanted to get her from the catch and shoot. We did not want
her to catch and shoot. We had to be very quick to her in rotation. Our group
had a great awareness of where Tynice was, but it really started with the ball
pressure we had on the point guard at the top of the zone. I felt like we
shoved them off the line some and then we had a great awareness of her.  
  
Kari Niblack gave us trouble in that iso stuff they run, but a lot of that was
we were extended we had to give them something and what we took away was
Tynice Martin getting those plays.  
  
Q. Most of the bracketology I have seen has Baylor and Iowa State and
Texas in and you just put West Virginia in. I'm going to guess you would like
to see your own team in there. If so, can you state the case for Kansas
State?  
JEFF MITTIE: I felt like we were in before this game, Rick. One of the
brackets had us as a 10 seed. You look at our RPI, 32 before the game,
strength of schedule is one of the tops in the country, non-conference, I
think it's in the top 40, somewhere in there. All those things are -- it's
kind of funny, when I look at these brackets that are coming out, there seems
to be a lack of respect. We are the third rated league in the country RPI-wise
and we play everybody twice. That changes the dynamics. We have played Baylor
twice. We will play the number 1 team in the country a third time tomorrow if
they beat Texas Tech and that's not a given in this league. While Baylor is
unbelievably talented, Texas Tech has a front line that is very good. But if
we do play them we will get to them for the third time, but we feel like we
have made our case, I can go on and on. We probably don't have enough time in
the presser to talk about the wins we have had, but they're probably, with the
exception of Baylor and the exception of Oregon and the exception of some of
the teams that have won their league there is not a hotter team in the country
right now than us.  
  
Q. You guys went up 21-8 the end of the first quarter, they narrowed the
gap to a 6-point differential, how were you able to keep the lead and
maintain?  
JEFF MITTIE: We knew they would make -- you expect a quality team like West
Virginia to run back at you. I honestly thought we missed some opportunities
in that run, because there were fast break opportunities where we got a little
rushed. They made a nice run back at us to get it to within 5 I think at half.
I felt like it was going to be a tight game the whole way. It was exactly what
I expected. I just think we had good poise. We had good possessions at both
ends of floor and our group has continued to be pretty solid in those areas.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Iowa State 75, Kansas 58  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by Iowa State University, head coach Bill
Fennelly and student-athletes, Madison Wise and Bridget Carleton. Coach,
thoughts about tonight's game?  
  
BILL FENNELLY: Thank you. I thought after the first quarter we thought the
emotion from this tournament playing for the first time kinda gets to you. But
our kids executed really well. I thought they played really hard. Kansas, like
always, kept coming at us. Bridget and Madison Wise is someone who is the only
player of our starters who didn't get any All-conference recognition and we
talked to Maddy about the impact she was going to have here. Her teammates
understood that. I thought they was fantastic tonight. Good team effort, nice
to get everyone in the game for a little bit to play as my grandson would say,
where Russell plays. Honored to get the win tonight and I get to work late,
late, late, late, late tonight and coach these guys tomorrow.  
  
Q. Madison, can you talk a little bit about what Coach Fennelly was
saying in terms of how he talked about you playing an important role coming
this tournament. When he spoke, did he speak just to you?  
MADISON WISE: Yeah, right, we talked about it a little bit, but to me it
doesn't matter. I have four other great starters who deserved their awards to
be able to play on a great team with players like Bridget and other starter on
the bench has been really great for me, so it doesn't matter there. Just happy
to be on this team.  
  
Q. Maddy, this year you struggled at times shooting the ball mostly,
tonight you were on. How does it feel to get a double-double and have a
performance on the big stage?  
MADISON WISE: Like I said, we got the win so it doesn't really matter. It's
nice to see some shots drop. But we played hard and got some jitters out, so
it was another good one for us.  
  
Q. Bridget, how big was it to have Madison step up and add that scoring
especially during the first half there?  
BRIDGET CARLETON: It was huge. It was nice to see her relax a little bit, a
smile on her face. To see those drop, we knew all along she was going to make
those shots and to go 6 from the field and have 10 rebounds that is
unbelievable in this game. I was happy she was able to knock some in
especially in that first quarter when we weren't so hot on offense.  
  
Q. There is a good chance you guys are going to host. There are no
guarantees obviously. But what would it mean to you, your program and
yourselves if you got to play a few rounds in front of your own people?  
BRIDGET CARLETON: That would mean the world to us, we love playing at Hilton.
We come Iowa State to play at Hilton, because it has such great crowds,
amazing fan and we want to play there as much as we can and to have the chance
to host two games in the NCAA tournament would mean the world and we would
take that every time.  
  
MADISON WISE: Just what Bridget talked about. We have the best fans in the
nation. They come out no matter what. They're always support supporting us. We
had a pretty good crowd today and for us to get to play in Hilton again, would
be great, especially for our seniors, that would be great.  
  
Q. You guys haven't advanced to the semifinals since 2013. So what kind
of statement is the team making and what does it mean to you guys?  
MADISON WISE: I think it's a pretty big statement, especially for our seniors.
They mean a lot to this program and they've left a legacy. So playing hard
with and for each other and especially for our seniors.  
  
BRIDGET CARLETON: I think we put it ourselves into a really good position
coming into this tournament, obviously being a two seed. But the records are
0-0, so we've got one down and we want to play as hard as we can and no
regrets and give it our all for the next couple of games because the end of
season is in sight. We never know when our last chance will be. Just taking
every moment as it is and working as hard as we can to give ourselves the best
opportunity.  
  
Q. Speaking of seniors, what did you say to your teammates, because this
could have been potentially your last game. What was your mindset coming into
this game? How do you encourage your teammates?  
BRIDGET CARLETON: Yeah, it was just playing loose, playing like we know we
can. Coach always talks about if we're us, that's enough. If we play like we
can we can beat anyone. We were relaxed, ready to go. That first quarter got
our jitters out, but we were relaxed in the second quarter and played like we
can and that's how we got the win today.  
  
Q. Congratulations, Bridget, for the award. Do you feel any extra
pressure that you have to prove yourself in any way? You didn't play great in
the first half but you came on. Is there any pressure to live up to that?  
BRIDGET CARLETON: I don't think so. I know what I can do. My teammates know
what I can do. My coaches know what I can do. I've had my share of bad halves
and come back. But, you know, I have confidence every time I shoot it. I take
the shots I need to take. I make the extra pass when I need to make the extra
pass. I control my game, so I think that's no pressure. It's just how I decide
to play is how I can play.  
  
Q. Maddy, this year you've become a critical player in a lot of
different ways, scoring the ball, rebounding, defense. Do you feel like you've
evolved in terms of becoming a complete player and having a complete game?  
MADISON WISE: Yeah, this year it's been important for me just doing what I can
and helping the team in different ways, any way I can. I play with great
teammates and great players and our coaches have a great game plan. So being
able to defend as best I can and knowing that I have help. Just doing the best
I can to help the team out in any way that is needed.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. Piggybacking off the question they asked them, do you feel like
tonight going to the semifinals for the first time since 2013 you kinda send a
statement to people with this?  
BILL FENNELLY: I don't know that you're sending statements. The biggest
statement is that this team has had a great season. It's continuing. Getting
to the semifinals of this conference tournament is hard. We've been in that
4/5 game a lot, so you get knocked out once in a while. This group, I keep
telling them, you're writing your own book and each chapter there is a new
thing to check off. For some people it's not a big deal, but for this group to
be in the semifinals and be able to showcase our university, how they play
tomorrow night on a national stage in a phenomenal venue in a phenomenal
conference tournament, that's why they play and that's why we coach. Very,
very happy that we get that opportunity tomorrow.  
  
Q. Bill, today Maddy got the stats that show up and gets the double-
double, but she often brings the same kind of energy to the game. How
essential is she to your team?  
BILL FENNELLY: She is critical to our team. I think anyone in our locker room
will tell you that. She is a kid that her whole life has been about scoring
and she scored a lot of points. We've asked her to be a defense player,
stopper and that takes your legs out. That's a hard thing to do over time. But
for her to do that today, I think -- she doesn't need validation. What you see
is what you get. You guys know, she is a humble kid. She's appreciative. It's
nice to see a young person get to come sit in front of you guys because she
doesn't get to do it very often. Everyone knows how important she is, but this
is a night that you love to see those things happen. That's what tournaments
are about. That's what March is about. Who is this person that does things
that hasn't done them as, like a Bridget. But it's great to see and if you
were in the locker room you could see the excitement they had for what she
does for our team.  
  
Q. You mentioned talking to her before the tournament, was it one
specific conversation, one important message, you sat down and had with her?  
BILL FENNELLY: It was two things. I addressed the team when all the awards
came out and talked about -- and that's the one thing about our team, it is a
team. We don't just show up and wear the same color jersey and travel
together, it is a group that cares.  
  
I talked to the group about the disappointment that I'm sure if you're the
only starting player that doesn't get something, and then I had an individual
meeting with her after practice and I just told her, you know how much we love
you, how much we appreciate what you do, and I said I just have a really good
feeling when we go to Oklahoma City you're going to do something that
validates unnecessarily, probably, what you mean to our team and I thought she
did that tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, you've been with this program for a long time?  
BILL FENNELLY: Way before you were born.  
  
Q. You said this team writes its own story for itself. What makes this
team stand out?  
BILL FENNELLY: I would say it starts with our seniors. We have an amazing
senior class. The other thing is this group. Iowa State is a uniquely special
place, not just our team but our university, our fan base, the coaches, the
leadership. This group understood what that obligation was. When you go
represent what Iowa State is about, we have signs all over the place "the Iowa
State way," and this group is about that every single day.  
  
Sometimes that translates to winning more games, but this game group is a joy
to be around and they have represented our university in a way that couldn't
be better in my opinion.  
  
Q. Coach, there is no guarantee what's going to happen in the next game,
and I'm only going to use this if Texas wins. But if Iowa State plays Texas
tomorrow, what kind of game would you expect?  
BILL FENNELLY: Typical game when we play Texas. We better figure out how to
rebound. We better figure out how to get in our offensive a little bit because
they're going to get up into us and guard us, and I think it's going to be
exactly what this tournament is supposed to be about. I think it will be a
great game, two great teams, two teams that represent their league in a
positive way, two teams that I think will be a tough out in the NCAA
tournament, hopefully, but it should be fun.  
  
Q. Again, no guarantees, but if you guys play host in a few weeks, what
would it mean to your town, your university, your basketball program?  
BILL FENNELLY: It would mean a lot! Our fans love this team. They enjoy
watching this team play. I think as Maddy said if our seniors got to play at
least one more game at Hilton, that's one of the things that I get all the
time from our former players. They text me, Coach, I just wish I could play
one more time. We went through senior night and they walked off the court
thinking that's it. You get the best of both world's. You get senior night and
you get to play in the NCAA tournament at home. Who knows what's going to
happen. I know it's going to be close. We will do whatever. It would be a
great thing for our university. Our men are in the NCAA tournament, so it's a
fun time. March Madness is fun and games right now, it's helped us get through
the weather.  
  
BILL FENNELLY: Thank you, everyone.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

### [Mike Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20552)

### [Katrina Pardee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34779)

### [Naomi Davenport](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34781)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Kansas State 72, West Virginia 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the West Virginia Mountaineers, head coach,
Mike Carey, his two student athletes, Naomi Davenport and Katrina Pardee.
Coach, your thoughts about today's game?  
  
MIKE CAREY: You just look at the hustle plays. They outhustled us. Points off
turnovers, 18-3, second chance points, 18-7, fast break points, 8-0. That says
all you need to know on that. We cut it to 1 or 2 and then come down and
turned it over three times and took some bad shots and didn't defend on the
other end. They just kept -- they outworked us, they played harder than we
did.  
  
Q. You guys did an amazing job toward the end, getting back in the swing
of things. What happened in the beginning? It was a slow start to try to get
the ball movement going.  
NAOMI DAVENPORT: In the beginning we were just slow, like you said. We were
slow and getting outhustled. We finally picked it up and then down the stretch
we made dumb decisions, turnovers. We got steals, but then when we got in
transition we turned the ball over. We didn't get out on the shooters when
they got offensive rebounds and that was the game.  
  
KATRINA PARDEE: I think it came down to the little things, not having the
discipline toward the end when we needed it the most and focusing, and I think
we were more concerned about offense and getting the score closer. By doing
that we had to score obviously, but we were primarily focused on that and not
on getting stops to where they didn't score so we could get the lead.  
  
Q. Naomi, I know every time your team needed a big play you stepped up.
What was your mentality coming into today's game knowing that it could be your
last?  
NAOMI DAVENPORT: I didn't think about it being my last. It was just another
game. I don't know. That's a hard question. I don't know. I just looked for my
teammates. Somebody helps over, help it down, square up to the basket, skip
out to KP open on the wing. Tynice open on the wing. Playing what the defense
give us you.  
  
Q. Katrina, we're practically neighbors. I live in Northwest Austin, I
know where you're from. Can you talk about the journey to go so far from home
and now you're going to graduate from college and what it was like and your
thoughts about going to the University of West Virginia?  
KATRINA PARDEE: Yeah, going way from home I feel like I wasn't necessarily sad
at first because I was looking forward to something new, and playing in the
Big 12 a lot of the games are in Texas and my family is able to see me play a
lot. They traveled to any game they could to watch me play so having their
support made it easier knowing that I'm out living my dreams and that's all
they want me to do and they support me 100% in whatever I do. So I think that
made the transition a lot easier.  
  
Q. What has been the biggest lesson you guys have learned about yourself
as a basketball player, as a woman playing at WV?  
KATRINA PARDEE: Personally, I think I've grown up a lot here. Like he said,
being away from home it kinda made me mature faster, and being able to play as
a freshman gave me a lot of experience, I think, and I think over the years
I've become mentally stronger because of Coach Carey. So I think that's the
biggest thing for me.  
  
NAOMI DAVENPORT: For me, I would say I matured very quickly in my two years
here. As a person, Coach Carey always says never get too high, never get too
low, and that's my favorite quote by him. Always stay in the middle, just
never try to get too high, never get to low, be there for your teammates,
listen to your teammates, listen to your coaches and it will all be good in
the end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, I know you split the season series with K-State. What was your
game plan coming into today's match-up?  
MIKE CAREY: We wanted to get the ball on the baseline, but we couldn't make
the pass to the baseline. We turned it over. It's unbelievable. Put the ball
above our heads, didn't get in the gaps, didn't get the ball where we wanted
the ball. They were extended. Especially when Kari was in there. We could have
went high-low, but I think she played two minutes the first half. When you're
extended, it's one on one in the paint. All we had to do was get it high-low,
and turned the ball over way too much, because we had nobody that could attack
the gap. If you don't attack the gap they're long, and they were getting in
the passing lanes and getting steals.  
  
Q. Mike, Jeff was here a minute ago and said it's a no-brainer that West
Virginia should be in the tournament next week. He also said that he doesn't
understand why the Big 12 is so underrated, because some of the brackets only
have three teams. Your thoughts on your own team and his thoughts about Big 12
being underrated?  
MIKE CAREY: Let me put it this way. If a team on the men's side in the Big 12
won 11 games and didn't get in the NCAA, you would all picket. There would be
a picket. Basketball would be shutdown. Only on the women's side could
something like that happen. It's amazing how this goes on on the women's side,
it really is, because if it happened on a Big 12 men's team, it would be all
over. There would be changes. You win 11 games and finish fourth in the league
and you're the third rated RPI league in the country you should be in the NCAA
tournament, and if we're not there is a big problem with the selection. Now,
we didn't play well today and all that. But we won 11 games in the Big 12. I
had a winning season in the Big 12, you should be in the NCAA. I go back and
you watch, on the men's side, there will be men's teams in the Big 12 with
losing records during the season gets in the NCAA, and how they do it and we
can't get it done, I have no idea.  
  
Q. Coach, can you speak on the impact that Katrina and Naomi have had on
the program since they arrived?  
MIKE CAREY: Yeah, I mean, Katrina, like she said, she came down his or her as
a freshman, got better every year, continued to work, game a team captain,
tremendous job.  
  
Naomi, only the second player in the history at West Virginia, junior college
player to score a thousand points. They both did a tremendous job for us since
they were at West Virginia.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Further questions? Okay, Coach, thanks. Good luck.

### [Sug Sutton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36669)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas 66, TCU 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the University of Texas Longhorn head
coach, Karen Aston, and her three student-athletes, Sug Sutton, Danni Williams
and Jatarie White. Coach, your thoughts about the game?  
  
KAREN ASTON: It was hard fought. I definitely told our players in the locker
room that it was really kind of just a gut check on our part. If you look at
the stats we probably shouldn't have won. But I thought we came together as a
group, really, in the final quarter and in particular the last minutes
defensively, locked in a little bit better than we had during the game.  
  
A lot of credit to TCU as far as how hard they played. I thought they played
with a little more urgency maybe than we did today in a lot of areas. But
credit to our team that they were able to gut this one out. Proud of 'em.  
  
Q. Sug, you are down 6, 4th quarter, looks like that's when you wanted
to take command. Was that in your mindset?  
SUG SUTTON: Yeah, I struggled a little bit in the beginning of the game. My
teammates picked me up in the game and I told them I was going to pick them up
in the fourth quarter. We all came together as a team in the fourth quarter. I
don't think it was just me. We all came together as a team and we finished the
game out.  
  
Q. You guys have a lot of fans there. Did you feed off the energy?  
JATARIE WHITE: We think our fans are the best fans in America, so we're very
happy that they come to our games and they come out and support and we just
really go out and play for them. They do a really good job of helping us
through the bad, lifting us up and all that. So thank you to our fans.  
  
Q. Danni, you had a step-back three, two late in the game and felt like
you could hit from anywhere. Talk about the game and where it felt like you
couldn't miss.  
DANNI WILLIAMS: I want to give credit to my teammates. We played them on
Tuesday and TCU guarded me really well. I had to go back and look at film and
my teammates were putting me in good positions to score.  
  
Q. Toward the end of the game, just talk about the conversations that
were in the huddles.  
DANNI WILLIAMS: We were just really believing in each other. We would be down
and we would say one stop, one stop and we were so positive. That's what got
us through the game. We were so encouraging of each other. Somebody make a
mistake we pick 'em back up, and it was our heart that got us through that
game.  
  
Q. Danni, I think you had 2 points last week against the same team. What
did you discover on film that applied itself today?  
DANNI WILLIAMS: On Tuesday they were being aggressive with me, trying to beat
me to spots on the screens so just taking that personal and really trying to
drive more. I know a lot of people are going to come at me so that's kinda how
I got myself going is driving. Like I said, my teammates were creating, giving
me the ball and good opportunities.  
  
Q. Jatarie, obviously Jordan Moore is a huge threat for TCU. You guys
were able to shut her down for the most part and she was dealing with foul
trouble. Can you talk about how you were able to stop such a force on TCU?  
JATARIE WHITE: I think going into the game I made sure I caught her early,
making sure that I forced her to her left hand and making sure that I beat her
to spots and not fouling because that's what I did last game. I fouled too
much in the second half, so I made sure that I walled up and my teammates a
really good job of setting and making sure she passed the ball out. So I think
that's what really helped throughout the game.  
  
Q. Sug, you were up 2, steal the ball, make it a 4-point game and they
came close. Can you take us through that play, what you saw, how it developed
and when you jumped in?  
SUG SUTTON: I know we huddled up before we got on the court and the energy
just went through me and I told myself I was going to get a steal. Like I
knew, I was like, I'm going to get a steal and I went out there and she threw
her body at me and I went out there and got the ball and it happened. I just
fed off the team's energy and I just did when I needed to do.  
  
Q. Big game tomorrow, Jatarie, Iowa State. Talk about what you expect
from them. You beat them there. They beat you at your place. What do you
expect from Iowa State?  
JATARIE WHITE: I expect a really good game. They're a really good team. I
think we're going back to the hotel knowing we're getting our heads straight
and making sure we come out tomorrow and we play our hardest. We make sure we
play to their tendencies and play with more energy and more effort.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. The game was close the whole time, 17 lead changes. Tell me what did
your team do in order to get this win? What did they do good?  
KAREN ASTON: I thought, first of all, they got a little more aggressive
offensively and we got to the foul line. So that enabled us to get our defense
set. Probably the biggest problem we had tonight was getting our defense set
and there were times I subbed young players in and different combinations and
we weren't good. We lost Kianna Ray, which we know after the third time of
playing them not to lose her. She had a big night tonight particularly in the
second half, but I thought the biggest difference was just them buckling down,
again, and whether we were switching screens, not switching, a little bit more
of a connection than what happens in transition defense sometimes. We
struggled at times trying to figure out who we had in transition, but I think
they locked in last five minutes of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys beat TCU in Ft. Worth on Tuesday. What do you have to
say to your team this week coming off a hard-thought win to play the same team
again to start this Big 12 Championship?  
KAREN ASTON: This is the first time I've experienced this and it is different,
you know, to turn around a couple of days later and play the exact same team.
So you don't overanalyze too much. You start to look at things that you could
have done differently, and in particular, against their zone. I anticipated
what we saw in the first half which was a lot of zone because we had a little
bit of trouble with it in the second half against them.  
  
I anticipated transition defense problems which reared its ugly head again for
us, and we're obviously a work in progress; I hate to say that in March. But
we do have problems in the middle of games with getting back and getting
matched up. It was one of those games where you really just wanted them to
know that TCU was going to have a real sense of urgency. Playing somebody for
the third time, and being in the situation where they're in, where they're
trying to get as many wins as they can for their resume, which I must say that
I think they are an NCAA qualifier. I think we are a good enough league that
we should have six teams in. I'm not quite understanding where all of at
that's coming from that we're not strong enough to have six teams in. I think
you can watch the quality of play between a 3 and a 6 seed and see that they
should be in the tournament. I hope that's a reflection of what people watched
tonight.  
  
Q. So TCU leads in turnovers in steals, in general in the Big 12, what
was your strategy to eliminate that?  
KAREN ASTON: Definitely against the zone we knew it was important to try to
get the ball in the center of the floor. I thought the thing we did better
this time than in Ft. Worth on Tuesday was we penetrated the zone a little bit
more. Up there we sort of stood, our guards stood with the ball up over their
head. I thought we did a better job getting in gaps and seams, much better
than we did. But our composure has been pretty good against all the games
against them which is ironic because they do force a lot of turnovers and they
depend on those turnovers to get open court layups, live ball turnovers. So we
preached that all week. Don't hand them layups.  
  
Q. Coach, I talked to Jatarie about the stopping Jordan Moore and you
guys did a great job of that. Whenever she is not playing well, but then Amy
Okonkwo starts to pick up the pace, especially in the second half. Does your
game plan have to switch there or are you sticking with what you started
with?  
KAREN ASTON: We tried the best we could to give Amy Okonkwo some different
looks because she was pretty much scoring with whoever had her assignment, but
I thought that the switch we made to put Danni Williams on her, actually Danni
asked if she could guard her for a few trips to give her a different look was
a positive one. It enabled our bigs to help in a different way.  
  
As far as Jordan Moore is concerned she is a fantastic player and you have to
kinda keep a big on her. What happened today was what I kind of expected which
was for other players on their team to step up and they did that and that's
what made the game so difficult for us. We gamble on a couple of match-ups, to
help on Jordan Moore, and that didn't go so well for them, maybe on Tuesday.
But I thought that the players we gambled off of stepped up tonight and it put
us in a bit of a dilemma with the other players.  
  
Q. Did you have any personal sit down with Danni after last week's TCU
game, meaning she played poorly and I'm sure she beats herself up sometimes
and for her to come out six days later and play like this. Did you have any
role in that?  
KAREN ASTON: No. I would like to take credit for that, but I think she is a
competitor and she knew that she didn't play her best. One thing about it is
she is a bit of a gym rat in a sense. She is going to watch film and take in
what you have to say. We did watch a lot of film on that game, just to make
some subtle adjustments offensively and I think she took it to heart that if
everybody is going to play her like that she's got to make some adjustments
and that was a conscious effort on her part. It's a competition now. Every
day. Sometimes it's just a competition to get open but you have to do it if
you're going to help your team win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations.

_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas Tech 104 , Oklahoma 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Texas Tech Coach Marlene Stollings, our
players, Sydney Goodson, Chrislyn Carr, Brittany Brewer, and Zuri Sanders.
Coach, congratulations on the win and your opening thoughts?  
  
COACH STOLLINGS: Thank you. I'm so thrilled for our team, particularly these
four young ladies sitting up here with me for doing something really special.
Everyone knows we inherited a program that hadn't had the best of times and
they have come so far.  
  
Two of our young ladies up here have career highs, Brittany with 40, Zuri with
25 points, and to set a Big 12 scoring record with 104 points is phenomenal.
This conference is incredible. It's been around for many, many years, and I'm
just so happy for our kids.  
  
Q. Brittany, it looked like one of the keys to the game was your ability
to get the offensive rebound. Talk about that part of the game. Have you ever
had game similar to this?  
BRITTANY BREWER: I don't think I've had a game similar to this, but definitely
the goal as a team was to rebound, and then last game that we played them I
didn't really do my job and so I knew I had to come out here and give me
teammates my all.  
  
Q. Brittany, you set a record for field goals in the first round. How
does it feel to be able to accomplish a record like that?  
BRITTANY BREWER: That feels awesome. I definitely wasn't expecting that. I
just wanted to come back and have a good game. So it's an honor, yeah.  
  
Q. Coach Stollings, obviously with Brittany you had a big advantage with
height and stuff but you came up with a good game plan, too, to get her
involved and get going. Could you talk about coming into the game how you
thought you might get her going?  
THE MODERATOR: We would prefer we let the student athletes answer.  
  
Q. So Brittany was having a really big game in the first half, you guys
could tell. Did you guys just start feeding her the ball? What was your
mindset?  
ZURI SANDERS: I would say that we definitely feed off each other, and
something we noticed is that Brittany had the hot hand so obviously you want
to keep feeding that hand, and she didn't let us down at all. The ball was
going through the net for her and I'm so proud of everything she gave for
forty minutes straight. Even if a shot didn't fall she didn't let that affect
her, and she definitely came through today, and the other two young ladies and
the rest of the team. It was a great win. It wasn't just one player doing one
thing, it was an all-around team win.  
  
SYDNEY GOODSON: Absolutely, Brittany is in the gym all the time and it's cool
to see her hard work pay off, but like Zuri said, it was a big team effort.
But, yeah, Brit had the hot hand; we were going to get her the ball. We could
hear the coach on the side saying "give it to Brittany, give it to Brittany!  
  
COACH STOLLINGS: You did hear me? (Laughter.)  
  
SYDNEY GOODSON: So of course we want to feed her the ball. She was knocking
down shots and she made rebounding a lot easier because they were all going
in. (Laughter.)  
  
CHRISLYN CARR: Feeding off what Zuri and Syd said, she had the hot hand so
obviously the ball is going to go her. Like they said, Coach was screaming
really loud give her the ball, so obviously we're going to give her the ball.
She was hot, and like they said, it was easy to get the rebounds.  
  
Q. Brittany, I know you and Zuri had huge games tonight. Could you talk
about how Zuri opened that up for you with her dominant play down low?  
BRITTANY BREWER: Zuri is dominant down low and I think when we put her down
low she just proves herself. She has done it this whole week against Oklahoma,
and every time we put her down there she is always saying, I'm not a 5, I'm
not a 5, and I'm like, You can play like a 5 if you want to. So good down low.
She opened up a lot, especially for double teams and stuff like that. She was
awesome.  
  
Q. Syd, Coach alluded to these were not the best of times for this
program last year. What was the biggest jump? What led you guys to this point?
And Zuri, if you want to answer the same question after Syd.  
SYDNEY GOODSON: I think it was work ethic and culture. I think this year we're
all really close. We're a family, bonded together. On and off the court we're
always together, and I think that's fun. I don't think we understand what
working hard at this level looked like and what it meant, and for us to come
together and trusting our coaching and buying in we made a huge jump.  
  
ZURI SANDERS: I think a huge emphasis is buy-in. As soon as the new coaching
staff came in they said they're not changing and they're going to always push
us regardless of what we're giving them. That's something we deeply
appreciated, they is that they never let us down, so we're not going to let
them down. And you can see that with the outcome of this game be tonight. We
worked our butts off this season to get here, and I think it's definitely
shown.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on your win. We will see you tomorrow.  
  
Q. Brittany had such a great game. You had a height advantage with her,
but could you talk about your game plan to get her going in the game?  
COACH STOLLINGS: We started the game with her on the perimeter. She's a very
solid 3-point shooter for us, and as the game evolved Zuri hit quite a few
shots at the basket. As the game evolved we wanted to shift that, so we moved
Zuri out and allowed her to become more of a screener and put Brittany at the
basket.  
  
We always felt Brittany could score against them, but Oklahoma packs the
paint. They're good in help defense, and we didn't want to start the game with
two or three defenders on Brittany. Her hitting those shots early really
helped with that. It loosened things up with Brittany scoring and Zuri scoring
from the outside, and so then we were able to reverse them. She went to work
down there. She is a capable very scorer when she had the one-on-one matchups,
and even one-on-two at times. The secondary defender ended up being a guard a
lot, and with her size and height she was able to shoot over them.  
  
Q. Coach, I know this is your first Big 12 tournament win as head coach
of the Raiders, how does it feel?  
COACH STOLLINGS: It's great. We're here to win. You go to the tournaments to
win. It's called March Madness for a reason. I told our team in the pre-game
talk there is nothing more exciting than this time of year and nothing better
than being on this stage in the Big 12 and performing and to have fun and
enjoy the moment. Don't look at it as pressure, look at it as opportunity.  
  
I thought they did a good job of not putting extra pressure on themselves.
Again, I'm just so happy for them. I've been coaching a long time and wins
will come and go, but and I'm so happy for this group in particular, because
they had to go through a lot of change to get here today. To be sitting here
with a Big 12 record is just tremendous. I'm so happy for them.  
  
Q. Coach, did you have to change the culture when you got here? A year
ago at this time I never remembered a program being as down as they were when
you walked off the stage last year.  
COACH STOLLINGS: Yeah, culture was huge. It was in every aspect of their
lives, so to speak, for our returners. For our new kids, they don't know any
different, but for our returners, it had been pretty rocky. It was very
important that we set the standard. As Zuri alluded to a few minutes ago, we
weren't going to change. We were going to keep that standard. They were going
to have to rise up to our standard. We were not going to drop down to anything
that had happened previously.  
  
Within that we put in a lot of accountability. It even shows in our academics.
We have above a 3.0, academically and when I arrived we were one of the lowest
academic female sports on campus.  
  
Our ultimate goal was how they approach life and, that's why I coach, is for
when they leave us. The ultimate goal was to help them become better women for
when they leave us, and that's not just on the basketball court.  
  
Q. So speaking on what you just said what, are the things you
implemented to change the culture? You said the grades changed, attitudes
changed; Syd said it's like a family. What are some of the things that changed
that?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Well, you know, initially there was a lot of discipline, hard
work, the strength and conditioning workouts changed drastically,
accountability academically. Lots of things fall under that. I could probably
write a book. I won't keep anybody in here for all of that. Those are the
highlights.  
  
And just our approach to practice. We're big on treating the practice like a
game. Scoring in the hundreds is and we want to be able to do big picture as
our program evolves. We want to be able to do that a lot. Very uptempo, very
fast paced, and very hard to guard. We got to see a glimpse of that tonight. A
little bit unexpected, but we'll take it. There are lots of things that go
along with it.  
  
Q. Coach, the point differential between the first two games was Texas
plus 1. Today you were able to beat OU by 20. What was the difference in
today's game compared to the rest of the season?  
COACH STOLLINGS: Today's game, I think, is the ability to keep the pace. We
thought if we could get into the fourth quarter with the pace the way we
wanted it would wear on them a little bit. They're in great shape, too, and
they like to run as well, and I will certainly give them credit for that. But
we thought we could sustain it better.  
  
One of the biggest things we take pride in is our strength and conditioning,
and it's one of the things in the fourth quarter we like to see separation in.
Tonight we were able to see that separation, and a lot of those points ended
up happening in transition later in the game.  
  
Q. Coach, got a quick turnaround for the game tomorrow. Talk a little
bit about facing Baylor, the number one team in the nation.  
COACH STOLLINGS: I was hoping I would get out of here without that question!
(Chuckles.) For a couple of hours before I get to a Baylor question! But
Baylor is just loaded. They're deep, they're tall, and they can score at
multiple positions. They're impressive, and it will be a tall task for us, no
question about it.  
  
We have great respect for their team and what they've done this season and
what they've done for our conference. I want to be very clear on that. They've
brought a lot of notoriety to the Big 12 with their performance, so we will
let the kids get some food and the coaches will get to work right away and we
will put the best game together that we can, David versus Goliath.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Okay, Coach, we will see you tomorrow afternoon.

### [Brandon Schneider](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28904)

### [Kylee Kopatich](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36648)

### [Aniya Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36649)

### [Christalah Lyons](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34744)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Kansas 76, Oklahoma State 66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Kansas State Jayhawks. We have Brandon
Schneider, his student athletes, Christalah Lyons, Aniya Thomas, and Kylee
Kopatich. Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game?  
  
COACH SCHNEIDER: Well, I was really happy with how well our players executed
the game plan. I thought we did a much better job of exhibiting patience on
offense and working for the best shot and not just the first shot. They've got
a terrific team, two terrific players in particular in Miller and Gray, and we
wanted to make them work for everything.  
  
We felt like if we could hold them under 40 we would have chains and I think
they got 41. Proud of our team tonight.  
  
Q. Chris and Kylee, knowing this could have been your last chance in a
Jayhawks uniform, what were you thinking going into the game?  
KYLEE KOPATICH: That today wasn't going to be our last game. We really didn't
want to end it that way. We knew we were so much better than that, and I think
we proved that tonight.  
  
CHRISTALAH LYONS: Yeah, what she said and I think we have a winner's
mentality.  
  
Q. So the last two times you met up with them things didn't go so well,
so what did you do differently?  
CHRISTALAH LYONS: I think we followed Coach's game plan. He said he wanted us
to move the ball more and that we would have open shots if we do so, and we
ended up with a win.  
  
ANIYA THOMAS: Just this game we were more aggressive. We were ready to get it
done and beat them.  
  
KYLEE KOPATICH: We have six seniors on your team now and none of us wanted
this to be our last game. We prepared better than we have the last two games,
and I think like Christalah said, we followed the game plan a little more
precise this time.  
  
Q. I asked the seniors about this being maybe their last game. What did
you think about your first game, Aniya?  
ANIYA THOMAS: Man, it was good. Got my first dub here. We played good! We
played very good today.  
  
Q. Coach, can you expand about what your players did? Last game was a
loss by 20 but you got the victory here.  
COACH SCHNEIDER: In Stillwater we took 20 shots on the first side of the floor
and we took 5 shots on the third side of the floor. That's not a recipe for
good offense. You're not making your defense work, giving them perhaps a
chance that you can take advantage of.  
  
That's really what we harped on for the last couple of days is just making
them guard, a little bit deeper in the shot clock and, you know, we felt like
we could get higher percentage shots and spread the ball around a little more.  
  
Q. So this is Kansas' first win since 2015-2016 season. How does this
feel getting this win in the championship tournament?  
COACH SCHNEIDER: I'm just happy for our seniors. They've continued to really
have great attitudes. Coming to practice every day, you know, despite the Big
12 record, with the mentality of getting better, and they've stayed very
committed to being great teammates.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you guys jumped out to that big lead in the first
quarter and OSU cut the deficit to 10 about 3:30 in the second quarter and you
called that timeout. What was the message to your team?  
COACH SCHNEIDER: Obviously not to get discouraged. Basketball is a game of
runs. We had a run early. You know a good team like Oklahoma State is going to
come back with a run at you. We were in foul trouble. Richardson and Kylee
Kopatich and Aniya Thomas all had two fouls, so we had to have some
substitutions during that stretch, but mainly let's make sure we stay poised
and composed and stick to the game plan.  
  
Q. What's the game plan for Iowa State?  
COACH SCHNEIDER: Well, Bridget Carleton obviously is one of the best players
in the country. I'm not even going to just say our league. She is such a hard
guard. There is a good chance she is going to get anywhere from 25 or 30. I
think the real key with being able to be in the game and compete with Iowa
State is you just can't let the other guys have big nights.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. We will see you tomorrow.

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Jim Littell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23326)

### [Vivian Gray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36646)

### [Braxtin Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36647)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Kansas 76, Oklahoma State 66.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oklahoma State Cowgirls Coach Jim
Littell and his two student athletes, Vivian Gray and Braxtin Miller. Coach?  
  
COACH LITTELL: We put ourselves in a bad situation and fell behind 13-2 and
30-10, and just too big of a hole to dig out of. They jumped on us early. We
didn't do the things we needed to do. It's just a big hole to grind out of,
because in the second half, really from the second quarter on, it makes it
where every possession is just crucial when you fall that far behind.  
  
Q. Braxtin, a bounce-back game for you today. What's been the problem,
but you did have a good game today to finish it all out?  
BRAXTIN MILLER: I don't know. I don't know really know what the problem was.
Just confidence and staying true to myself. I don't know if anything switched.
I just tried to keep my mind off things and play ball like I know I can.  
  
Q. Vivian, in your first Big 12 Tournament game, how do you think you
did personally?  
VIVIAN GRAY: I'm not happy with how I played on defense. I think I could have
done better and I let my teammates down and. First quarter wasn't where it
needed to be, and I think that led to the hole we dug for ourselves.  
  
Q. What was kind of defensively were you seeing there in the first
quarter to allow them to have that big lead.  
BRAXTIN MILLER: We just straight up weren't playing good enough defense. They
were getting downhill and we didn't have our rotations on point like we need
to off ball screens. Just went downhill. Just didn't do what we needed to do
on defense, for sure.  
  
VIVIAN GRAY: They just came out stronger than we did, ready to play. I think
that's the bottom line.  
  
Q. How did you push in the second quarter to kind of change the
deficit?  
VIVIAN GRAY: We just played how we know we can play. First quarter just wasn't
-- we did not do well, and we bounced back in the second. I'm proud of that
and Clitan was a spark for us.  
  
BRAXTIN MILLER: She came in and was a huge energy that we kind of needed, and
I think we came out in the second quarter and worked really hard and tried to
find each other and play off each other like we know we can. We just came out
really poorly.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, you can go back to the locker room and we will take
questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, after Kansas put up the lead to 20, what were you talking to
your teammates about?  
COACH LITTELL: We were slow on all rotations. We use a term call ball line and
we lost our ball line and lost shooters. And just didn't play with the energy
and passion it takes to play at this level, and that's all on me. You've got
to play hard every possession and you can't take plays off. We're not talented
enough to do that, and I've allowed that to happen so that comes on me.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you think about the fight, coming back there, and
Vivian getting it back to 1 twice -- Braxtin first and Vivian in that second
half.  
COACH LITTELL: I thought from the second quarter on we were a lot better than
we were, which allowed us to grind back in the game. But then there were times
where we just had breakdowns and they got easy. Baskets, you crawl back within
1 and then within 3, and then they would shoot a layup on us at the other end.  
  
Like I said, when you fall that far behind it makes every possession from
basically the second quarter on a must have-situation, both offensively and
defensively. When we crawled back in, they got stops. Credit to KU. They were
patient. They were waiting for a crack, and when they saw it they took us to
the hole on that.  
  
They shot the ball well from the three. Kylee Kopatich, we held her in check
the first couple of games and we didn't do that today, and Lyons just killed
us. She had a big-time game against us.  
  
Q. Coach, how big of an impact did Miller and Gray have on your squad
this season?  
COACH LITTELL: Well, they both had nice years and that's reflected in Braxtin
being Honorable Mention All-Conference and Vivian being newcomer of the Year,
unanimous choice All-Conference. But we've got to get more pieces into the
puzzle.  
  
All season long we looked up and we had two people in double figures. That's
not conducive to winning in the league. We have to develop some young players
in the off-season and we've got to add some pieces to the puzzle as far as
recruiting goes, but both of those had really good years, and we expect big
things out of them in the future.  
  
But we just gotta get better. We gotta get better with the kids that we have.
We've got to develop them, and then we've got to add some pieces to the
puzzle.  
  
Q. If you could elaborate basically on Vivian Gray and what have you
seen as a coach, you know, coaching her throughout the season and seeing her
grow fundamentally or, you know, in areas that she could work on?  
COACH LITTELL: First of all, she is a total joy to coach. She is the same way
every day. It's not by accident that she had all those 20- and 30-point games.
She works hard on her game and she is by far unquestionably our best practice
player. She has a big heart, she cares about the game, and you know, even in
games that she maybe didn't play well she was giving everything she had.  
  
So I can't question Viv at all on anything. I think she's got a huge heart.
She came to play every day in practice, she came to play every single game,
and that's reflective in her being newcomer of the year.  
  
To think she averaged 15 in a Division II league last year and came in and
averaged close to 20 in the Big 12 is pretty amazing, and that's a tribute to
how much she cares and how hard she works at the game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much.

# [BIG 12 CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+12+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Sherri Coale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13897)

### [Madi Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36650)

### [Ana Llanusa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34764)

  
_Oklahoma City, Oklahoma_  
  
Texas Tech 104, Oklahoma 84  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're now joined by the Oklahoma Sooners Coach Sherri Coale and
her two student athletes, Ana Llanusa, and our other student-athlete is Madi
Williams. Coach, your thoughts about tonight's game?  
  
COACH COALE: First I want to congratulate Texas Tech. I thought they played
incredibly well. Brittany Brewer had an amazing night. She missed, what, six
shots, seven shots? Averaged making three or four threes a game, and they hit
nine tonight. They hit on all cylinders. They were just really, really good. I
want to congratulate them. Zuri and Brittany played like juniors and seniors
who are hungry and nearing the end of their career and don't want it to be
cover.  
  
I thought they played and led their team, and obviously that's where the
majority of their points came from. We had a hard time rebounding against that
size.  
  
Otherwise we cleaned up our turnovers from Tuesday night. Did a better job
there. Had a number of assists, but I thought we felt our inability to stop
them, we felt it on the offensive end. I felt like the pressure of being
unable to get a stop bled into our offense and we missed easy locks, layups,
open threes that we usually make, and that's just youth. You cannot rush the
farm. Kids grow when it's time for them to grow and they mature as they get
older. And no matter how badly we would like for it to happen sooner rather
than later, it happens when it happens.  
  
I appreciate our team's diligence. These young guys have fought and they've
never given up and they have continued to learn. I thought they hit a little
bit of a mental wall in terms of adhering to the game plan tonight, just the
moment was a little too large for them. But they're young and they've gotten
some valuable, valuable experience this year.  
  
They're going to use that as fuel, because I can promise you no one in our
locker room ever wants to feel like this again.  
  
Q. Ana, late in the third quarter you cut the lead to 4, I think, and
have a chance to come back and cut it to 2 there after I think your steal.
What happened after that that the game sort of started to get away from you?  
ANA LLANUSA: I think that would be us not getting rebounds. They got their
boards and went back up and got second shots. So it would be that, and then we
did get a little sped up on offense. Like she said, missed a number of
different layups, just easy layups that we needed to finish, and I think that
was the turning point.  
  
Q. Ana, I know she is tall, but what separated Brittany from being what
she was able to do tonight? Why was she that difficult?  
ANA LLANUSA: I think she just had a really good game. She shot the ball really
well. I don't think we were -- we knew she could shoot but she hit a lot of
threes, a lot of open shots. Just props to her for making those shots,
knocking 'em down.  
  
Q. Madi, what was it like trying to guard Brewer and some of the size
that they had inside? It had to be frustrating at times for you, especially
when they would drop out and she is shooting threes out there.  
MADI WILLIAMS: The whole game plan was whenever she did get the ball inside
was to dig it out. If anybody got the ball inside we were to go dig it out. I
think we relied too much on our help side and we were just like, okay, let 'em
catch and our help side would be there. And when it wasn't because we had to
-- because they were hitting shots from the outside, then just kind of went
downhill from there.  
  
Q. Ana and Madi both, can you put into words what the season was like? I
know it wasn't like what anyone wanted, and Sherri said no one wants to feel
like that again, but speak to the challenges and how difficult it was at
times.  
ANA LLANUSA: I think it was challenging trying to find out exactly who we are.
We went up, we went down, we played close games. We've gotten beat by a lot,
but just the learning experience we got this year is really important, and I
think it's going to accelerate us for next year.  
  
MADI WILLIAMS: I think that this year was a great way for us to see our
potential, and before we leave we're going to win a National Championship. I
think we're all looking forward to that.  
  
Q. With that, what's the biggest learning take-aways that you guys have
going forward?  
ANA LLANUSA: I would say just knowing that we can all score is really
important. To have that confidence. Every single one of us on the floor can
score, but we have to just really dial into defending somebody and fall in
love with defending. We all know we can score, but can we all guard? And
that's something for sure we are going to be working on, as soon as possible.  
  
MADI WILLIAMS: We can't wait until the off-season to put in work. We all know
we have some work to do so we can come back next year and have a better
outcome.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations on finishing the season and best of
luck to you.  
  
Q. Coach, I know you spoke to the youth of your squad. What are some
take-aways from today's game and this season that you want to bring into next
season?  
COACH COALE: Well, the list is so long I'm not sure you have time for me to
talk about it all. What our guys got was exposure. Exposure to talented teams,
exposure to size, exposure to athleticism, exposure to the pace of Big 12
basketball, Division I basketball. They got exposed because there was nowhere
to hide. We didn't have a guy to go to. Every team we play against has a guy
to go to and we didn't have that.  
  
They were so young that our preconference schedule was probably way too tough
for them and where they are in their career, but you can't -- that happens way
ahead of time. It knocked our confidence a little. Not having Ana early and we
didn't have her the entire first semester affected us a little because she
probably would have become the guy and has developed so much as a leader. I
could talk for a long time about how Ana Llanusa has grown. She is obviously a
talented offensive basketball player, but she has grown in terms of her
ability to lead the people around her.  
  
There are a number of things that we have to get better at, but we're not as
far away as it might appear. There are things that come unraveled because
there's just one slip here or there or just an understanding but an inability
to apply an understanding yet. It's a whole bunch of yet. It turns out and it
looks ugly when you look at that score and when their two post guys combine to
miss seven or eight shots on the night it looks ugly, but we're not that far
away.  
  
We have some young guys doing some impressive things. We have to get tougher
and find some size and fall in love with defending. The laundry list is long
in terms of things we have to do. I'm proud of their fight, and they're going
to look back on this year and realize what a pivotal -- we all are. We're
going to look back on this year and realize what a pivotal year it was for our
program and their growth. They're not going to soon forget how hard this was,
and that's what will propel them to make it different.  
  
Q. Sherri, you mentioned in your opening statement that you thought
maybe they got overwhelmed a little bit with the game plan. Is one of the
reference points maybe when you pulled within two or one in the third, you
make a rally, looks like you're getting into this game, and then all of the
sudden you don't make a bucket or two and you're down five or six and it gets
away from you?  
COACH COALE: We panicked. We talked at the timeout about our momentum we had
momentum. You have to continue to hang on to that and make this next play.
This play coming out of the timeout is an important one, but I could sense it
even in that timeout a little trepidation. They wanted so badly to win and
advance here and to play beyond the first day here, and. When we missed a
couple of easy shots I felt it really -- you could just cut it with a knife.  
  
Again, I think the inability to stop them sort of bleeds into that, and it did
turn into a snowball and they took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Sherri, same question to you. You spoke on it, but the difficulties
and challenges for you this year, personally or professionally, what was it
like for you? It's been a long time since this program has been -- you know, 8
wins for a year. What was this like?  
COACH COALE: It was hard, very hard. At the same time, there were lots of
rewards in the growth of these young guys. My job is to teach, not to be
frustrated or talk about how difficult it is for me. My job is to teach and
coach and lead, and I've tried really hard to do that.  
  
We as a staff have tried really hard to model realistic optimism. Here are our
weaknesses. Here is where we need to get better and this is what we can do,
and hopefully we can do that and we have cemented that mindset that you have
to believe and you have to be realistic about what your shortcomings are and
how you can shore those up. I'm proud of them. Nobody likes to lose. I put
myself at the top of that list. There is nothing fun about it.  
  
But at the same time, our job is to grow kids, and that's what we're trying to
do.  
  
Q. Sherri, along those lines, how confident are you -- you talked about
how close you believe this team is. How confident are you that this can get
turned around relatively quickly, whether it's the players that you've got
now, the ones you've got coming in, and the job your staff has to do?  
COACH COALE: Well, I'm very confident about the future, you know? Again, this
is a team that had two seniors that played sparingly, no juniors, and
everybody else is freshmen and sophomores. I don't know of another team in the
country that's in that situation. This is -- yeah, it's been tough. Yeah, we
feel like we hit rock bottom.  
  
But from there you spring forward. There are lots of guys who are close. When
you add that up and they continue to get better, things can happen really
quickly, you know?  
  
It's a lot of work ethic in the off-season where guys have to figure out how
to work on their weaknesses and how to compete and how to get tougher. It's
also going to look entirely different after these guys have an off-season
together and can come back next year. There is no doubt we need to add some
size. There is no doubt about that. We return all of our scoring, all of our
rebounding. We return everything, all of our assists, and we have three guys
joining us. I'm excited about that. I'm excited about the potential of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your comments.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2019

  

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Allazia Blockton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30443)

### [Natisha Hiedeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30444)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 74, Marquette - 73  
  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Congratulations to DePaul. Stonewall was phenomenal tonight.
She was just relentless, very, very tough. They wanted it really bad. You
could tell that last five minutes. I absolutely love my team, and I will take
them to battle any day. We have a lot of basketball left to be played. We're
going to regroup, we're going to fix a lot of things, we're going to watch
film, and we're going to get better, and these two sitting next to me right
now, it's going to -- it hurts. It stings. They wanted this really, really
bad, and we've got to use it as fuel because we've got the NCAA Tournament
right around the corner, and I know for certain that they will respond.  
  
Q. Natisha, can you take us through your process on that final play?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: There was like five seconds left, just tried to attack, we
didn't have any time-outs left so just tried to push the ball up the floor and
put the ball on the rim.  
  
Q. What are the emotions like? I know this is something you guys were
circling on the calendar months in advance. What was it like in the final
seconds?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: It's just heartbreaking, and it just came down to little
things, and we just have to use it as fuel. We can't drop our heads because
like Coach said, we've got a lot more basketball to play so we've got to learn
from our mistakes and capitalize on those moments and take it into the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Yeah, we're hurting right now, but like Coach said in the
locker room, it hurts so bad because we care so much, but we know that the
season's not over, we still got time left, so we're just going to use
everything that -- this is a lesson, and use it in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Allazia, could you elaborate on that when you say the little things,
because it seemed like in that third and fourth quarter early on when DePaul
would get it close you would have an answer, a fast break bucket or you would
get a stop, so what were the little things that when the tide shifted?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Just personally I think free throws. We were 9 for 19, which
we've got to capitalize on those points, like we were getting them right where
we wanted to, getting them in foul trouble, and I just think focusing on
rebounding, we gave up a lot of offensive rebounds tonight. And Coach kept
preaching it on the sideline and we weren't adjusting, so I think we've got to
be tougher on the boards and make our free throws.  
  
Q. Natisha, so you have to deal with this; how do you wait and see what
happens with the NCAA Tournament and where you guys fall in that?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Whatever happens, our coaches are going to have a game plan.
We're just -- we're excited, so we've just got to have that mentality that
it's not over. I mean, I know we're all devastated right now, but we've just
got to keep our heads up, and like Coach said in the locker room, the next
practice we've got to come out even better, stronger, and just keep giving
everything we've got until it's really over with.  
  
Q. How important was it to have the men's lacrosse team out there
cheering you on?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: They've been great supporters from day one, and their energy
that they gave us is just amazing, and we appreciate them coming out.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Like Natisha said, just great props. They always gave us
support. We support them and it shows you how tight knit the Marquette family
is, when it's a big game everyone comes out and supports each other, so thanks
to them for coming and making that drive to support us.  
  
Q. How would you guys say, whether it be this game or last year's game
or the year before, how does that redefine or make this rivalry something more
special than what it used to be?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: I mean, I just think that whenever DePaul and Marquette step
on the floor, it's going to be a great game. The rivalry is going to be for
years, just because of the location, we're travel partners. We both play fast.
So I think this game just makes it even more special.  
  
I know me and Natisha are leaving the program this year, so we're going to
push that fuel on to the next people to take them down next year and give them
that support.  
  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Yeah, the same exact thing.  
  
Q. Coach, save for say half of the last quarter, the defense seemed to
be -- when you needed a stop you would get it or a turnover you would get it.
How did you feel about your defense overall?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, tonight I just -- I'm really disappointed in our
toughness. We got them rattled and got the shots that we wanted them to shoot.
Not rhythm shots that they normally do. And we didn't produce on the
rebounding end. They had 22 second-chance points. It's going to be hard to win
a game when you miss 10 free throws and you give up 22 second-chance points.  
  
Q. You said this is fuel; how do you implement that throughout the week
leading up to whatever happens for the tournament?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, our whole motto all year has been 200 feet, and it's
whatever is in front of you is what you're going to go tackle. Unfortunately,
this is behind us now, and we're going to use this as motivation to work
harder. But it's over, it's done with, and we've got to regroup and we've got
to get better and we've got to figure out a way to carry that chip on our
shoulder to the NCAA Tournament because our plan all year was to carry this
program farther than we've ever been and that was the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. What do you tell the players in the locker room after this game? Do
you want them to move on, but it's also --  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, first of all, we have to learn lessons. We were saying
the same things in every single time-out and we need to be better adjusters.
We need to play with our heads instead of just emotion.  
  
You know, like I said, I just told them, we care about them, we're there for
them, but we have to be tough. We have to be grown women when it's March.
Toughness wins, and defense wins, and tonight DePaul made big plays, we had
some good stops, we just didn't finish the play.  
  
Q. It's not very often that your team goes 47 percent from the line,
what do you think was the cause behind all that?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I have no idea. I wish I could answer that. If that was the
case I would have hopefully helped them more than I was able to.  
  
Q. What does a game like this do to strengthen the rivalry between
DePaul and Marquette women's basketball?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: We're just two very elite teams right now battling back and
forth, and hopefully that continues year in and year out. I know they're not
going anywhere, and I sure as heck know we're not. So for us we're going to
keep battling every day. My plan is to be back here, let's battle again next
year.  
  
Q. After the relaunch of the conference a few years back, programs like
UConn and Notre Dame were gone. Could you elaborate on how DePaul and
Marquette, getting to this point and what that does for the conference as a
whole?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I think it's huge for us, I really do. I think Doug and I both
agree that we want this conference to be elite, and we want to be recognized
as one of the best women's basketball conferences in the country. And I think
we've got, all 10 teams, we've got to keep pushing the envelope and we got to
keep going because I believe we can be and I just think we got to keep getting
better, we got to keep recruiting the way we are, and if I keep trying to keep
up with Doug and he keeps trying to keep up with us, it's just going to make
everybody else better.  
  
Q. Coleman was probably the only player who left from last year to this
year. What was the difference between the result last year and this year?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I will say this: I thought our team weathered their runs way
better than we did last year. We took punches and we handled them. This was a
much more exciting game than last year. Obviously still a heartbreaking
outcome with many, many lessons for us to learn from. But I'll take this fight
versus the fight from last year any day.  
  
Q. Talk about Chante Stonewall a little bit, what about her ability to
react in the paint and how she was able to create mismatches?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: You know, it's -- we've had to really adjust the last three
weeks with Erika going down, and it hasn't been easy. It's been an emotional
toll. We've challenged our girls, and I think this is something that we've got
to figure out. We've got to weather the storm and we've got to figure out who
we can play more, who can rebound, who can battle, who can adjust. We've got
to still play small, but in those moments I've got to do a better job as a
coach figuring out lineups and situations, because we've got to come up with
those rebounds. We just have to. And I know our team will respond and we'll
have Erika's back, and we're not going to lose another game the rest of this
year because of rebounding or free throws. I'll be dang sure about that.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 12, 2019

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Mart'e Grays](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34794)

### [Chante Stonewall](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36700)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 74, Marquette - 73  
  
DOUG BRUNO: The Marquette program has been awesome, and they've done a
magnificent job, Coach Kieger and her staff have done a magnificent job of
developing their team and bringing that very excellent Marquette team to the
forefront of the nation this season. And I really -- I just really want to
state our respect for everything that Coach Kieger and her seniors have done.
That's a great senior class. It's a great story. And they've just done so much
for the Big East. It's a very, very good Marquette team we beat, and
basketball is a funny game.  
  
Our players never gave up. They never quit. There were many, many ebbs and
flows and ups and downs, and I was just really proud of the way that they
stayed the course and were able to put themselves in position so that we could
make a play at the end of the game. Chante made a play at the end of the game,
and the play that she made at the end of the game everybody thinks is just
scoring the ball and making a free throw. But Hiedeman with five seconds to go
is one hard match-up. She got rid of the ball with five seconds, and she did
also a very good job of keeping Hiedeman from scoring.  
  
But again, it's always the players that win the games. We coaches try to lead
them into position to be able to win the games, but this coach sitting here
talking to you didn't get a rebound tonight, didn't get an assist tonight, and
didn't make a basket tonight. The players did the work against a really,
really excellent Marquette basketball team.  
  
Q. Are you able to walk us through what you were thinking there on the
last DePaul offensive play and the last Marquette offensive play?  
CHANTE STONEWALL: Yes, sir. Well, the plan was to get me back to the pinch
post and operate there and get to the basket if I could, and if not to kick it
out for Ashton. And then after it went in, of course we were all excited, but
I knew I had been struggling with free throws lately, so I knew I had to just
hit that free throw, knock it down, but then also get another stop.  
  
Throughout the series, throughout the fourth quarter, we knew we had to get a
stop, get a bucket, get a stop, get a bucket. So after I made that free throw,
it was like, all right, what's next, and I had to defend Hiedeman who actually
got up the floor pretty quick.  
  
Q. After the game you were awarded the Most Outstanding Player Trophy.
Your teammates were saying it was all you, all your effort, but you deferred
back to them. What does that say about your team?  
CHANTE STONEWALL: I understand it's not one player. It's not me, it's we, and
throughout this whole entire season, it's not me who just had like 20 points
in one game and the next game I have two. 25 points, next game I had 6. So
throughout I showed a lot of inconsistency but my teammates always had my
back, get the next game, get the next play, I was telling Te', like we got to
get you going, we got to get you going. Same thing with me throughout these
past two previous games, she's like, we got to get you going we got to get you
going. So after hearing that I won that, I'm like, no, the girls got me going.
They believed in me. And so yeah, that's why I referred back to them.  
  
Q. Mart'e, how big of a win is this for you going out being a fifth-year
senior? Can you speak on how special of a moment this is?  
MART'E GRAYS: Yeah, this is a very special moment, man, like because --  
  
DOUG BRUNO: I'm sorry, again, I'm not supposed to talk. We were given these
Big East hats to represent the Big East, all right, so I just realized that.
Thank you.  
  
MART'E GRAYS: Yes, this is very special. Everyone keeps coming up to me, like
you guys did it, you guys won it. But it's so unreal right now because nobody
believed that we could. Everybody was like, oh, Marquette got this. Like Coach
Bruno always preaches, they're on a mission, but what about us? Like we don't
have a mission? I'm just glad that we fought through everything that we fought
through in this game and got the W.  
  
Q. Chante, you had the basket and the and-one to win it, but Mart'e, on
the possession before that you had the tip to keep the ball alive and that led
to free throws to cut it to one. So on a tough shooting night what's your
mentality shift to and help carry the team forward?  
MART'E GRAYS: Oh, yeah, most definitely. These girls don't know -- well, they
probably do -- but I have so much confidence in them. It's just contagious.
Everybody knows, like, you know, if one of us is not on, we know to give the
ball up. But my mentality was just do what I can do -- do what I do, but just
not trying to force it. So if I'm there, I'm trying to make a play. I'm not
about to be like, oh, I'm not shooting well or whatever. I'm trying to help my
team. So I'm glad I was able to get in there and shoot because I barely had
any rebounds. But I'm glad Chante is always in the right place at the right
time, she got in there and she did what she did.  
  
Q. Chante, can you talk about every time Marquette would go on a run
they were up by 13 points, at one point, and you guys kept responding every
time. Can you talk about you guys' willingness not to bow down and just to
keep fighting?  
CHANTE STONEWALL: Coach always preaches that there's no such thing as a four-
point play or a 13-point play, but always that we can get a stop, make a
bucket, get a stop -- I already said that earlier in interviews -- but yeah,
just one stop at a time, win every possession on offense and on defense, and
that was going to get the game closer than what it was.  
  
Q. Mart'e, how cool was it to play in this game in this atmosphere
tonight?  
MART'E GRAYS: It was so cool, man. Like it's just so cool. This type of
competition, this type of atmosphere, man, like this is games we live for. I
feel like nobody has ever -- well, on our team I could feel it, like nobody is
nervous, we're more excited, we're more pumped up. It's just great.  
  
Q. For either player, how would you guys say that the match-up between
DePaul and Marquette has intensified over the last two or three years?  
CHANTE STONEWALL: I feel so young, I feel like I'm still a freshman. But
coming in here, I never really understood the rivalry, and I never really took
it as seriously. But man, one year later you understand it. Both programs are
just so competitive, and the growth through their side of their program and
ours is just amazing to see the evolution.  
  
Like I said, the rivalry is something special. So every time you step on that
court you know it's going to be fast. Referees should be even bringing their
inhalers. But it's just -- no, but it's fun, and you play against the best
players in the Big East, and it's just a really fun game to play. And tonight
the atmosphere was great. I don't remember the last time I seen Wintrust that
packed, and you always see the court get rushed, in my dreams, on TV, so it
was nice actually being there. Like Te' said, this is stuff we dream of as
little girls, like this is going to be us one day, and it was just incredible
to feel that tonight.  
  
MART'E GRAYS: So I've been here five years, and my freshman year -- it's just
crazy how Coach Kieger developed and evolved this team. Like my freshman year,
Marquette was like one of the lower teams in the Big East. Like we used to --
it was a rivalry, but we used to just run right past them. And then it's just
crazy how the next year they just got so much better, and they're just getting
better and better. So it made it more fun, made it more interesting to play in
the game, and I just have so much respect for her and her players for even
putting in all that work and being dedicated to their program.  
  
Q. Chante, you said as little girls you always dreamed of this moment.
How did this moment exceed your expectations?  
CHANTE STONEWALL: I know it sounds cliché, but hard work always pays off.
Tuesdays are always our hard practices but I'm just thinking like, man, I'll
take this game over a Tuesday any day. Man, it's just -- this is the stuff
that you dream of, that you pray of, and when the moment comes, it's like,
wow, it actually paid off, and this group of girls is just -- man, I'm
speechless. This is an incredible feeling, and I hope we just ride this wave
on -- maybe bring it back here and let's do it again.  
  
Q. Coach, Mart'e briefly spoke about this, but can you just speak on
behalf of Marquette and how much they've evolved as a team?  
DOUG BRUNO: When you're as old as I am, sometimes when you're a younger
person, you think that Marquette is just starting right now. Marquette has had
a great program over a lot of years, and so for me, it's not just starting.
I've seen these ebbs and flows happen before, where we'd be on top and then
Marquette would be on top and then we'd be on top. So I've seen this come and
go and ebb and flow. It's great to see, though, this group, they just did a
great job -- I think in my opening statement I said I really respect what
they've done, and we're proud of what they've done, but competition is
competition. You love your brothers, you love your sisters. Inside a league,
we're brothers and sisters, but still, when brothers and sisters go in the
backyard and put a competition, put a ball out there and compete, brothers and
sisters fight, like hard.  
  
So it's a competition. We know it's a competition. Again, the Marquette -- the
Marquette-DePaul rivalry is a long-standing rivalry. I think it's the longest
rivalry on our men's side. I think they've played 125 games or something to
that respect, and the women's side, if I'm not mistaken, it's either us or --
this has been going on for a long, long time. So it's a great rivalry, and
again, Coach Kieger has done a great job with her program, and the senior
players there, they've done a great job of working hard to get better. It's
always about development and getting better.  
  
You know, I really don't want to forget that our players have worked hard to
get better, too. I'm answering your question about Marquette, but sometimes
through the evolution of Marquette, people have just kind of treated us like
stepchildren, and guess what, we're not going away. I don't care what, who,
what program brings in anybody, we're not going to go away. We're going to --
our players have worked very hard to develop, as well. And I'm proud of our
players.  
  
Chante Stonewall came back to school this year the most improved player. She
worked very, very hard in the off-season. I'm just -- as did everybody, Kelly,
Mart'e. So I'm just thrilled that our players have worked hard, also.  
  
Q. I know plays sometimes run together, especially in a game like this,
but it was a frustrating thing in the third quarter kind of leading up to the
technical foul after the three-point shot. Did you tell your team anything to
get them kind of --  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, it wasn't just the beginning of the third. It was the end of
the second quarter. I mean, we gave up five points in a couple seconds to
close out the half. And then you come back and you give up six straight. So we
gave up five at the end of the second and we gave up six at the beginning of
the third to go from a tie game to chasing 11. Maya Stovall -- I love these
freshmen, all of them. Lexi has got more minutes tonight, but Maya Stovall and
Sonya Morris have all been very, very important. She hit that shot and she
knocked it down and she let her emotions get away with her and clapped, I
guess, in the opponent's face.  
  
But as Maya said to me, Coach, they're talking, too, and I said, Maya, we
can't control them, they can only control us. That's what rivalries are.
You're going to smack with one another. So somebody talked at her and then she
clapped in somebody's face, and then it was a technical. But it was really
more to do with us letting the game get away from us than even the technical.
I mean, it was -- and basketball -- again, I feel so bad for you all having to
listen to me repeat, that every basketball game has a life of its own, but it
does. For us, for the two technical fouls to be missed, the free throws to be
missed, for somebody that shoots as well as Lott to miss three free throws,
things like that, you still have to catch breaks in basketball games. And we
caught some breaks, also, but we took advantage of those breaks, as well.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about the play of Chante Stonewall tonight,
especially guarding Hiedeman?  
DOUG BRUNO: I mean, she did a magnificent job. Hiedeman is a really hard
match-up, I think she's a pro. I really do believe she's got a chance to be a
pro, a WNBA pro, okay, and I just think she's a really hard match-up. As
thrilled as I was at the end of the game when Chante, we iso'd Chante in the
pinch post, she took a very good defender, Marquette's best defender is Selena
Lott, and she took Lott to the basket and finished strong. But we knew five
seconds, Hiedeman has thrown in more buckets with less seconds time than that.
And the stop that she made on the five seconds is every bit as important as
the -- as she had to make that bucket and she had to make the free throw, but
then she had to make the stop or make a very talented player like Hiedeman on
the left side miss a shot at the end. Chante had a really strong game all
night long. She did score her thousandth point the other night. I'm not going
to take Bob's job ever. I don't want Bob's job. But for the record now, DePaul
has got four 1,000-point scorers. We don't have five but we got four out
there, we got four out there and Tanita Allen hadn't hurt her knee this year
we would have had five this year, too.  
  
But at the same time, again, Chante was just awesome tonight. At one point in
time, there was -- I barked at her about something -- I forget what it was. It
was something that she needed to get barked at, and I brought -- and then she
turned and didn't let me continue my second and third bark. I gave her the
hook, and I kept her on the bench for all of about four seconds. It might have
been 12 seconds, 30 at the most, but at the same time, that's just what we do
in our program. When I talk to you, I expect to get a response from you. I
love Chante, I love the effort she's put into this, and so I'm just thrilled
that she was able to, when we called her number, come up big.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the play of Lexi tonight?  
DOUG BRUNO: Yeah, again, Lexi took the charge, maybe a couple charges if I'm
not mistaken, and maybe a third -- she took two for sure. But then the post
feed pass from the corner. It's not just Lexi Held knocking down shots, it's
Lexi Held, that pass to the post from the corner, that's got a subtle, very
special basketball player to it. So I think she was really, really important
tonight. I think Tanita Allen was important tonight, and the bench tightens,
but when I talk about Lexi I have to talk of all our freshmen. Sonya didn't
have a lot of minutes tonight but I thought she was nice and aggressive early,
got to the rim and just missed it and got a good pull-up and just didn't knock
it down. And Maya gave us a good start to the basketball game.  
  
Q. Can you talk a little bit about how this win is going to propel you
into next week and obviously the NCAA Tournament?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, it's really one of those situations where you play for March
and it's March, and then March is here. But for two teams, the emotion -- what
makes this tournament so beautiful is the excitement of who's getting in,
who's not getting in, the first four days before competition starts where all
the conversation about the match-ups, the story lines about the match-ups, the
players in the tournament, who didn't get in, who did get in. And then all of
a sudden the games start.  
  
Everybody is going to crash and burn except one team on the men's side and one
team on the women's side. It doesn't matter if you lose in the first game or
-- we've only gotten to the Sweet 16 four times, or the third game for us so
far. It's crash and burn, and you're in this exhilarating place of high and
there's no other way to describe it when you're not going to play tomorrow.  
  
So we're really excited to put ourselves in position to hopefully earn our way
into the NCAA Tournament and then we'll regroup here and get ourselves ready
to be the best we can be no matter where we get sent. And no matter who we're
going to play against, I promise our players will be ready to compete in the
NCAA Tournament. This is what we play for.  
  
Q. The play of Kelly Campbell tonight, all around, three steals, 12
rebounds, especially in the second half when you needed those rebounds to keep
chipping away at the lead, can you talk about her play?  
DOUG BRUNO: Kelly is just a special player. She's a rock. She does all the
things that go unnoticed. And we couldn't be where we are without her, and
she's emerging -- the class of 2020, Chante and Kelly together are emerging.
Their leadership is emerging, so Kelly is becoming more of a vocal leader out
on the floor, also. And I just think there's no way we're where we're at
without Kelly Campbell and Chante. We're not here without any and all of our
players, but she's really been special to this program.  
  
We've got a lot of work to do still. We've got a long way -- we still have
miles to go before we sleep, Robert Frost. Miles to go before you sleep, miles
to go before you sleep.  
  
Thank you all for covering women's hoops, and again, I'm really thrilled for
our players that they can steal a victory again against a very, very special
Marquette team.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2019

  

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Natisha Hiedeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30444)

### [Allazia Blockton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30443)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 75, Georgetown 62  
  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, first of all, I just want to congratulate Georgetown.
They made us earn this win today. Dorothy Adomako was phenomenal, she was a
force inside and outside so give a lot to credit to them. In terms of what we
brought to the table tonight I thought we showed an enormous amount of
toughness tonight. It was a different kind of game, up and down, a lot of
runs, we had to weather them. I thought our team did a great job of staying
composed, staying one possession at a time, obviously Allazia Blockton had a
huge performance for us tonight with the double-double. And obviously Natisha,
as well, with the 23 and 7. When we're sharing the ball and we're moving it
the way that we were in that first half, that's the team we need to be. And I
thought our energy when we challenged them at time-outs, they really
responded. Again, I thought it was a great mature effort by our whole entire
squad.  
  
Q. How does it feel to be back at this stage now hoping for a much
different result than last year?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: We're super excited. We've been working for this the whole
season, even preseason before the season even started. So just to have another
opportunity and go at it, we're going to give them our best effort, whoever we
play.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: We're just ecstatic, ever since we left this place last year
we had a chip on our shoulder to just get better and better every day, and
this has been one of our goals coming into this year, so I think like Natisha
said, we're going to give our best effort for whoever we play.  
  
Q. There seems to be something special about this team this year. What
differences do you see in this team compared to previous seasons?  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: I just think our determination, our hunger, how we attack
each day, how we attack each practice in preparation. We just attack
everything we do. So obviously Erika went down and it's been a lot of injuries
that we've had and we've just rallied around those players and it just pumps
us up even more. So I just think how hard we attack every day.  
  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I would say our maturity. We continue to grow every day, and
I think that when we're mature, we know who the hot hand is, we try to get
them the ball. Just in different aspects on the court, and as far as, you know
if we get punched, we're mature enough to not fold and punch back.  
  
Q. How different is it for you guys now that it's the senior year? You
guys have been playing together for four years, the majority as a team, and
now it's sort of the ending.  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: I think we just -- ever since we came in, we've been a
family, and we don't want to let our sisters down. So when we step on that
court, we're looking to the left and the right and we just don't want to let
that player down. So when we step on the court, our chemistry is amazing, and
we just go out there and fight hard. We consider ourselves a pack of lions,
and we go out there and we go to hunt, and we play for each other and play for
the jersey.  
  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Exactly what she said. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Your team had 12 threes. Was that just confidence? What was your
mindset?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I would just say we were moving the ball really well, which
was making a lot of our threes not contested, wide-open threes, and I think
when we share the ball, we're at our best.  
  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: Me too. I think we just visualized it yesterday. We know
Georgetown plays us in zone, so we just visualized ourselves knocking down
threes. I had dreams about it and I came out hot, and T went on her run, and
everyone was knocking down shots, and I think that's what really propelled us
for the game.  
  
Q. Allazia, you have talked about this during the season, that the
motivation for this team is to get redemption on championship night in this
building. Coach talked about earlier this week that it's so key for you guys
to celebrate each other. What is that like when you're celebrating each other?
Describe that.  
ALLAZIA BLOCKTON: I think for us, it just makes the game easier. We're just a
selfless team, so when something does something great, we always celebrate it.
You see like me and T were flexing down the court when I got the big RB, we
try to celebrate every play, and that just shows how much we love each other
and how much we care and play for each other. So I think for us we know energy
is a big factor to how we play, so we just try to celebrate those little
things and those big things.  
  
Q. Natisha, how hungry are you to be back in the championship game?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: I'm starving (laughter). I just think it's a great
opportunity for us, and I think that this is going to propel us for our next
games and everything. You know, we do need redemption, and I think that our
mindset going into the championship game is going to be excellent. We've had a
great week so far, super positive, and I think that's the boost that we need.  
  
Q. Coach, you said that the key to this weekend would be where your
group would be mentally. What has been unleashed in them mentally in this run
thus far?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I just think we're more focused. You can see in time-outs
we're talking to each other, on the court our communication is at an all-time
best right now. We're playing -- except for Dorothy today -- personnel pretty
well. So I just think there's a different level of intensity when it comes to
game plan right now. And it shows, like they talk about, their maturity level
right now. So we -- my staff I should say, does a phenomenal job preparing us,
and I think the players are kind of latching on to that, and that can be their
comfort zone, and when Georgetown makes a run, we can go back and we can
weather it and we can go on our time-out and settle ourselves and regroup, and
we did that today, and they gave us a punch, they gave us their best effort,
and we weathered it.  
  
Q. Talking about weathering it, Georgetown defensively, what did you
lock in on in order to weather those runs?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, I think switching to our zone was huge. It was a big key
for us. Give a lot to credit to my players, because it's been something we've
been working on, but we haven't really showed it in games. So today when we
went to it, I thought for the first five possessions, I think, they went
empty, and we were getting our hands on loose balls and rebounding. I was
really proud of them to just do that on the fly because it's not something
we've done a lot this season.  
  
Q. That game a year ago, is that still fresh in your mind, and if so,
how do you use that as a motivational tool?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I think any time you fail, you use it as a lesson. DePaul
played a phenomenal game last year, and we did not. So obviously as
competitors, it's in the back of your mind. But I think we've done a really
good job this year of focusing on 200 feet at a time. You hear us say that
constantly, but we really are buying into that. No matter who wins this game,
we're going to have to be sharp, we're going to be to have focused, and the
only thing we're thinking about tomorrow is one possession at a time.  
  
Q. Four seniors had 57 of the 75, they all played like 33 minutes plus.
This has sort of been your group for the last four years. How much does that
class mean to you?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, this is their time. You know, this is when you want your
seniors to step up and enjoy themselves and enjoy each other. This group, it's
really hard to put into words what they mean to our program and mean to myself
and my staff. They were our first recruiting class. They were the first ones
to buy into a vision that wasn't clear yet. We told them when it came to
recruiting what we wanted to do. We told them we were going to be a top-10
team, and they bought in. They stayed loyal, they stayed true to the process,
and it hasn't always been easy. We've had a lot of ups we've had a lot of
downs. They've really worked hard and they've rolled up their sleeves and we
got here through sheer hard work. And I think it's been a phenomenal story
because these six seniors, they didn't come in as McDonald's All-Americans,
they didn't get the credit they deserved out of high school, and I think
they've made a big splash in the nation right now.  
  
Q. With no disrespect to either of your potential opponents, would it be
extra sweet to have a chance at redemption against DePaul?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: No comment. (Laughter.) Well, of course as a competitor you
always want to. That's a rivalry that has been going on for a long, long time.
But we also have to get redemption on Creighton as well. They gave it to us
pretty good on their home court a week ago. So for us, no matter who we play,
I think our girls are going to be ready and focused.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2019

  

### [James Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34798)

### [Dorothy Adomako](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28401)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 75, Georgetown 62  
  
JAMES HOWARD: I thought that Marquette made a heck of a run. They were hard to
guard tonight, five guards on the floor. It's like you wish Davenport would
have played because you can guard them a little different, but when you're
playing against five guards who are all pretty much thousand point scorers.
They gave us some problem, but I really was impressed with the fight in our
players. We got down about 20, we cut it to one in the second half, and then
they made another run. Veteran team. They're the 17th ranked team in the
country for a reason, but very proud of our young women.  
  
Q. Dorothy, I know it's tough after a loss, but how would you reflect on
a remarkable time at Georgetown?  
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: Yeah, it's been great. It's kind of hard to talk right now
when I'm kind of down about the loss, but credit to Georgetown. I mean, they
gave so much to me, and I really wanted to give back to them and take us to
the finals, but we couldn't do it. But credit to the girls, as well. We never
gave up, and we kept fighting and we kept playing tonight.  
  
Q. How about yourself? Can you give yourself some credit, too?  
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: Yeah, it's been an awesome career. I really enjoyed playing
here. I was lucky enough to get five years, and I'm really going to miss it.  
  
Q. What do you think stands out about this Marquette team and just the
way that they've matured? You've seen them through the years, as well.  
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: Yeah, I remember freshman year they weren't as good, and then
they exploded, and now they're a really good team. But we stayed on them
tonight, and we kept fighting, and that's what really matters.  
  
Q. Even though it wasn't the result you wanted, how much did that fight
that you showed -- you were down 20 at one point in the second quarter, you
cut it all the way down to six at the half. How much did that fight kind of
illustrate what you and Dionna have done with this program?  
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: Yeah, being seniors and being the leaders, we just couldn't
give up. We had to leave it all on the court. It's our last game playing here
in Chicago, so we really had to go out there and just leave it out there on
the court.  
  
Q. How tough is it to guard Marquette when they're running such an up
tempo offense and kind of keeping up with them?  
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: Like I said, they're a really good team, and we just have to
-- if you miss a play, they're going to come back and just shoot the ball or
get a rebound, so we've just got to stay locked in.  
  
Q. Big runs by each team at certain points in this game. For your team
offensively in those runs, what did you see that you were doing well?  
JAMES HOWARD: I thought we started to move the ball well, and then we were
able to get downhill and get to the basket and get some easier looks. I
thought we were playing with more effort when we got back, and you can see
like the tempo changed in the game. For us we were excited again, we got that
bounce back. That's what carries us. When we're playing like that, you're
excited, but you get back and then you see a good Marquette team respond. You
know, we took the first punch, and again, we were able to come back for a
while, and I thought we threw it in the second half and got it back to one,
and then a good team, they stood right back up and they punched again, and we
just couldn't recover from that one.  
  
Q. Dorothy had 27 points tonight. What has she meant to your program and
how do you think she did tonight?  
JAMES HOWARD: Dorothy has been a big plus to Georgetown. She's phenomenal in
just how she carries herself, her work ethic. Not having her last year, it
hurt us all. But she came back this year and she was able to help her team
this year get back to a semifinal. So you know, for the four years that she's
been at Georgetown, and she's in the grad school now and working on her
Master's Degree, as she said, Georgetown has given her a lot, and she has
given Georgetown a lot.  
  
Q. One of the seniors we haven't talked about is Mikayla Venson. When
she came off the floor for the first time you had an exchange with her. What
did you say?  
JAMES HOWARD: At that time I was just saying, thank you for everything you
have done for us, because that's a young lady that transferred in that had to
fight, adversity and playing in her first year last year, she was a point
guard coming from Virginia. We talked to her about moving over on the 2 side
and diverting, handling the team and running the team. Mikayla stood up for us
this year. During these last six games, she really has taken on a whole
different approach to say, it's my team and I'm going to distribute and I'm
going to get the ball to Dorothy, I'm going to get the ball to Dionna. And she
was known as a scorer, but when you're a scorer and you have that leadership
and you know in order for your team to win, you're going to distribute that
ball to players that you feel as though that can make plays at that time. Hats
off to her. And that's all I said: Thank you for everything that you have
given over these three years.  
  
Q. Coach Howard, talking about players and your team specifically, the
fight that this team showed, what are the new standards that they have set for
next year?  
JAMES HOWARD: That's great that you said that because we were just in the
locker room talking about the standards. You know, these seniors have set a
precedent that we've gone to two back-to-back semifinals. So when you look
back, you have built a culture that we expect each year to be in the semifinal
game.  
  
Now, for the young players, the work now begins. So yes, they have raised the
bar of how we coach, how we play, and the respect level that we have put back
in the program. So that's hard. It's hard to swallow because you've got three
good ones leaving. But we'll get back to work and we'll figure out a way to
try to get back here next year. But we're not going to stay in the semifinal
for long. We want to get to the championship.  
  
Q. You've had more success against Marquette than most teams; what have
you guys done differently than other teams to be able to win one and be close
in a lot of others?  
JAMES HOWARD: Yeah, I think we have kind of knocked them off balance. You
know, they're a transition team. They like to get back. They like to push
tempo. They like to score in the 90s. We drop four back when you're playing
that type of team and we try to slow down their break points. Today they were
able to get penetration and points off of lane lines. In the past we have been
able to slow that down, and that's where a lot of it came from. I think they
ended up hitting 12 threes, and most of them was in the first half. They shot
lights out, and if you can keep them in front of you, now you negate all the
athleticism. And we weren't able to do that in the second half. We were able
to do it for runs, and then here they come downhill again, and they got to the
rim, and they're very skilled in finishing. That hurt us.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2019

  

### [Jim Flanery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28426)

### [Jaylyn Agnew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34788)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 80, Creighton - 69  
  
JIM FLANERY: Well, I think it was a real similar game to last Sunday. We were
right there. Last week we actually pushed it out in the third quarter and had
a decent margin, but the thing about DePaul and what makes them really good is
they just -- Jaylyn can tell you about every time-out, don't get too high,
don't get too low, just keep playing, because it's 40 minutes, you're going to
have runs, they're going to have runs, but they just make you uncomfortable or
they make us uncomfortable, and obviously the 20 turnovers was the difference
in the game. We shot more than well enough. Jaylyn was spectacular. But you
know, you can't overcome a 15-turnover differential. Credit to DePaul. They're
a really good team. They're fun to watch play. They're just not quite as fun
to play.  
  
Q. Jaylyn, how would you say that you have grown so much this season,
and where do you think it's going to lead you to playing next year?  
JAYLYN AGNEW: Well, I think we have really competitive practices, and being
able to guard and practice against Audrey Faber has really helped me, as you
all know. She's a great player, and she's helped me the last four years in
being able to go against her every day in practice has helped me improve a
lot, so hopefully I can take that into next year and hopefully be like that
and help the other younger people improve, too.  
  
Q. What kind of mark does this senior class leave?  
JAYLYN AGNEW: I'm going to get emotional. Like you said, they're a great
class. They've all been through so much. Jade's injury, Audrey being one of
the greatest players that Creighton has ever had, Brooke transferring, and
then Ali and her injuries, they've all shown us how to fight through
adversity, and they're just a great group, great leaders on and off the floor,
great friends. So yeah, we're going to miss them a lot. But they're great
people to be around, and just joke and laugh with them all the time. Like I
said, not just on the floor, but great leaders through all aspects of our
lives.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you think went wrong when DePaul was making their big
run to get back on top?  
JIM FLANERY: Well, turnovers. I mean, we had two different five counts, I
think, in bounding the ball. We tried to make that a point of emphasis. We
weren't as good as we needed to be there. And then conversion out of the
press. I thought we made a couple, probably about three unaggressive plays
where we had broken the press, we had three on two, and then I thought we were
tentative. Once they got up five or seven, it's easy to get a little panicky.
We gave up -- I thought they did a good job of throwing the ball inside, which
they did last weekend, and we got caught on -- we had mismatches on Stonewall
a couple times there late off switches that we had to defend.  
  
But mostly it was turnovers. If we do a little better job taking care of the
ball, you know, it's a different game. Then the charges in the half court,
they sat down and guarded, and we -- during that stretch, I thought we -- part
of it is we stood around and then late shot clock we had to drive it and they
were in good position.  
  
And then I thought we kind of flipped and got a little more aggressive moving
and drew some off-ball fouls. But we didn't do that during that stretch that
you're talking about. The charges and the five-second counts were huge.  
  
Q. Beating Butler yesterday and playing DePaul really tough tonight,
what do you think that does for your program going forward?  
JIM FLANERY: Well, and I honestly believe this: I think right now we're as
good a basketball team as we were a year ago when we went to the NCAA
Tournament and went to the second round. We just weren't that team all year.
Jaylyn wasn't healthy, we didn't have the health to get better for quite a
period of time, and we didn't have a rotation.  
  
So I just -- you know, I'm proud of them because I felt like we played our
best basketball at the end, which is what you want to do. The problem is we
weren't -- there were stretches where we weren't very good. But I told them
all year, it's nobody's fault that we had the injuries we had. We just weren't
able to improve -- for a long period of time we were not able to improve as a
team, and at the end of the year when we got healthier, I thought we really
improved. You see how well Jaylyn played tonight and some of our younger
players, Rachel and Tatum and younger players who hadn't -- but our practice
situation got better. I mean, I'm not yet looking forward to next year, but I
think I will be because I think we return a good group.  
  
Q. You talked about the problems Mart'e Grays gave you during the
season. What specific problems does she pose for you?  
JIM FLANERY: Well, she's long and she -- they run a lot of down-screen post-
ups for her. They shoot it so well, you can't give a lot of help. We talked at
halftime about trying to give a little bit more help, and we did a better job
on her. She had 16 at the half and finished with 20. So I thought Audrey's
one-on-one defense in the second half on her was really good. She got to her
left shoulder, blocked her shot a couple times, and I thought she really
competed.  
  
But part of it is that they have good players around her. I mean, we played
Iowa and Megan Gustafson, and Megan deserves every bit of credit because she's
a great player, but Iowa shoots the ball really well and they pass the ball
really well, and that's DePaul. They shoot it well and they pass it well, and
that's in addition to what the good post player can do. That's important. We
don't feed the post as well, if you can tell.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 11, 2019

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Ashton Millender](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34795)

### [Mart'e Grays](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34794)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 80, Creighton - 69  
  
DOUG BRUNO: The Big East is a great league and it's a great league because it
has great coaches, and Jim Flanery is one of the best, but it also has great
players. The Creighton basketball team here fought through a really tough
season because of the injuries that they had early. Coach Flanery doesn't back
down on a schedule. It was a great schedule that they played, and Jaylyn Agnew
came into the season as an all-Big East player, didn't quite have the year
that we thought she was going to have, but she was just absolutely magnificent
tonight. And then when you have to guard Faber and Carda, it's just a really,
really special Creighton team that we were just able to beat.  
  
Whenever you win a game, it's always about the players. The coaches set them
up, but the players have to go on the floor and do it, and I was just really
proud of our players for maintaining their resolve into the fourth quarter
when we gave up a couple threes there. We had a six-point lead, gave up a
couple threes, and then our players kept the resolve and kept their wits about
them and did a good job then in the fourth quarter of executing in the fourth
quarter.  
  
Marté is playing really good basketball. So is Ashton Millender, and one of
the things that was most important about Marté tonight outside of the
basketball was that she lost her composure slightly at the beginning of the
second half, and I thought she did a great job of recapturing her composure,
and I think that was very, very important to getting the win.  
  
Marquette has had a special year. They've had a special four years. Coach
Kieger and Marquette has really done great things. It should be a great game
to play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Marté, that run that you guys had in the third and fourth quarter, to
come back on top, what does that say about the resiliency of your team?  
MART'E GRAYS: Yeah, we preached and preached about it, like just defense and
rebounding. That's what was going to bring us back into the game, and I think
we done a great job with that going down the stretch. That's what created our
lead. So I think we did a great job with that.  
  
Q. Ashton, Coach talked about this before the season; how much do you
think this group has evolved defensively, and how much did it show in this win
tonight?  
ASHTON MILLENDER: I believe we evolved very well. It took us a minute, it
shouldn't have, but I feel like we've all come together, like he said, because
we're always talking about how we look for focused on getting stops and
getting rebounds more than we did in the beginning of the season. So I feel
like we just talk to each other and then like it's go time now so I feel like
we all just we came together and got it done and started focusing on
rebounding and getting defense.  
  
Q. What Marté is on a roll, what does it do for this team?  
ASHTON MILLENDER: When she's on a roll inside, I feel like it opens up the
outside for us. But at the same time, when she's doing good on the inside,
just give it to her, that's what I said in my head. When she's taking
advantage inside, give it to her. She's going to get it out, she's not a
selfish player, so I feel like if I give it to her, she'll give it back to me.  
  
Q. Marté, tomorrow is going to be the third time you play Marquette this
season. Obviously you lost both times to them, but that second game, the
second half, you guys kind of found some answers against them and almost won
the game. Do you feel like that's going to give you some confidence heading
into tomorrow night?  
MART'E GRAYS: I feel like our confidence is coming from what we've done these
last nine games. I'm telling you, this stretch has definitely just been -- our
main focus has been defense, so I know if we just continue to focus on our
defense end and rebounding, we'll take care of business, because we have great
players, and I'm not saying that Marquette doesn't have great players, but we
know we need to be on our defensive game tomorrow, so that's where I'm really
confident about this one.  
  
Q. Ashton, how big was ball security tonight with you guys only
committing five turnovers?  
ASHTON MILLENDER: That's very big. I feel like every game, turnovers are very
big. For us to only have five tonight is great, making history.  
  
DOUG BRUNO: Oh, my gosh. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Ashton, what do you think is going to be the key tomorrow night
against Marquette and trying to win the Big East Tournament final?  
ASHTON MILLENDER: Like Mart'e said, Marquette has very good players, so just
containing them, playing defense and getting rebounds, offensive wise and
defensive wise, they're very good in transition, so I feel like us getting
stops, focusing on defense, it will get the job done.  
  
Q. How great of a spotlight is it for the Big East to have Marquette and
DePaul in the final?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, again, we're proud of what we've achieved here at DePaul,
but we don't look back. We only look to the future. You know, we've done a
little bit here at DePaul over the years, and Marquette now is in a place
where they've really had a great year, a great couple years, and so to have
the two teams that were picked in the preseason to win the Big East Conference
and then the two teams that finished one game apart from each other in the
regular season, and to have the two teams that have played in the championship
the last two years, I think it speaks -- it's a great -- it's good for the Big
East -- again, I just love this league, and the league was so much better this
year than it was last year, and people beat each other up this year because
there were so many better teams.  
  
But we're looking forward to the opportunity to compete against a really,
really strong Marquette team, and the Marquette players are special players.
They're good players. Hiedeman is the Player of the Year in this league and
she's a very tough matchup for anybody. Blockton is the preseason player the
year in the league. She got hurt, but she's back at full health now, very,
very difficult match-up, Dani King has really hurt us. So Lott's playing
really, really good basketball. It's just a really, really good basketball
team. Everybody just talks about the only college basketball rivalry that
exists is Duke and North Carolina, but here in the Midwest, Marquette and
DePaul have been going at it for a very long time. And I was lucky enough to
play for Coach Ray Meyer, against Al McGuire, and I know what this rivalry
truly means, and it's a great rivalry, and so many young people from the city
of Chicago, pick a Catholic school, and they'll be DePaul or they'll pick
Marquette.  
  
So it's a big deal. There's the Wisconsin border. North of Wisconsin this team
called the Packers plays. South of the border this team called the Bears
plays. So there's a lot that goes into this rivalry that maybe people across
the nation don't understand, but it's a healthy, fun, great rivalry, and we're
looking forward to the opportunity just to compete.  
  
Q. Would you say there were times over the past three seasons that
pressure usually doesn't pay dividends in the first quarter but it almost
always does in the fourth. Was that an example of that tonight?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, when you commit to pressure like we commit to pressure --
and I'm talking defensive pressure here, and I think that's what you're
talking about -- yeah, the first objective of defensive pressure is to get a
steal. But against the talented college players you're not going to get
steals. So then can you wear people down, and I think tonight was a good
example of wearing a really, really good team down. Marquette is a very
difficult team to pressure. So that's something that, looking forward, I don't
even know that we can or will. We'll see what happens. But at the same time, I
think that's what our pressure is designed to do is to beat you over time, and
I think it did take a toll tonight as we moved into the fourth. We generally
-- that second and fourth quarter usually is a quarter where we can -- the
pressure usually pays some dividends.  
  
Q. Coach, after that second game against Marquette early in the season,
you talked in the press conference that that was DePaul ball at its best in
the second half. Can you talk about how that gives you confidence heading into
tomorrow?  
DOUG BRUNO: I don't know that I said DePaul ball at its best, but in the
second half against Marquette, we were down 12 at halftime, and I think we had
27 points at halftime. We were down 39-27. Scoring 27 points isn't what we're
out here to do. And then I think we had a 37-point third quarter. We got the
game tied at 80 with three to go, and then Marquette finished and we didn't
finish.  
  
At the same time, I said it's the first time this year that I felt like I saw
DePaul ball come back. I didn't feel like it was there in the first non-
conference part of the season, and even the first part of the conference
season.  
  
You know, I think the second half of Marquette was the beginning of a
turnaround for this basketball team that, we won in the non-conference, but we
weren't ourselves. I just think it was -- we started to come back after that
half.  
  
But let's not get carried away here. Again, you poor people that cover us all
the time have to live with my statement and belief that every game is a life
of its own, every season is a life of its own. So what happened in the game
last year here isn't really going to have a lot of bearing, except for
Marquette's motivation tomorrow. What happened in Game 1, what happened in
Game 2, it's still going to come down to what's going to happen between 7:00
and 9:00 tomorrow right here against a very good basketball team.  
  
Q. Can you just speak about what it meant for your team to just remain
calm and in the moment when trailing at times? How important was that?  
DOUG BRUNO: I'm one of the crazy people in coaching that doesn't like the word
poise. I like the word resolve, all right. Poise, I mean, it's a very
important adjective to describe athletes. There's no question about it. But I
think dancers have some poise -- once we get into pure competition, I like to
think it's more resolve than -- and we could get into a semantic argument and
a coaching argument, okay, but I just think that our players have had some
pretty strong resolve here down the second half. You start the Big East season
1-2, having played two home games, that's not the way to think you're going to
win a Big East conference championship, and we still put ourselves in position
to almost pull off the regular season tie coming down to the last game of the
year.  
  
So I just think our players have had to have a lot of resolve through this
stretch here. I've had to learn our team, and it took me a while to learn this
basketball team. I'm still learning it, but I think we're getting more
educated about what we have with our different combinations. We have a solid
four players and our two seniors, Mart'e Grays, Ashton Millender, Kelly
Campbell, our juniors, those are four staunch players, and then you pick it
and you try to figure out who's going to -- Tanita Allen gave us some great
ball tonight, maybe six minutes and seven points, and she gave us some great
minutes tonight. Lexi wasn't really, really having a great night tonight, Lexi
Held. I really was questioning who could be the fifth player coming down the
stretch of the game, and I was ready to go back with Tanita Allen with an
older lineup and even a bigger lineup, and Lexi then kind of caught some
fourth quarter resolve, all right, and did a pretty nice job in the fourth.  
  
Q. Are you able to expand on your bench play tonight?  
DOUG BRUNO: Yeah, I mean, Dee Bekelja gets in the game, and she just -- she
just gives you -- she just finds ways to score the basketball. It's unorthodox
looking, but she just finds ways. Then Sonya Morris, I thought, let's start
with Maya Stovall started the game but she's really in that rotation, even
though she starts, I thought she had a really good beginning to the game. I
didn't think it would continue, but I thought Bekelja gave us some really
strong minutes, Sonya Morris gave us some strong minutes in there, and Tanita
Allen did a good job, as well, and then Bekelja -- but Bekelja also was
involved with giving up a couple of those threes there. We're not trying to
give a very good Creighton team threes, and we gave up threes after we gave up
a five-point lead.  
  
Q. I know you mentioned that every game is on an island, but the
dynamics change maybe a little bit for Marquette, no Davenport this time
around. How do you think that perhaps changed the interior game plan?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, it's tragic that Marquette has had to deal with -- Davenport
is a really part of the Marquette equation, and yet sometimes when we talk
about these seasons having lives of their own, if you would ask -- I don't
want to speak for Coach here, but I don't think she would have liked to see
Blockton go down this season, I think she would have liked to have seen
Blockton play every game. But sometimes you find some silver linings, Blockton
going down created the emergence of Lott. So now obviously the Lott factor
here, and that's a very, very good player.  
  
The dynamic changes. There's no question about it. But they weren't overly big
to begin with, even though Davenport gave them great strength in the middle.
I'm not trying to take anything away from her about that, but they still
weren't a big basketball team. I didn't mention Wilborn before, I should have
mentioned Wilborn, that's one of the toughest basketball players in this
league. She's just a really, really good basketball player and a tough, tough
match-up. You know she's going to get to the rim. You just can't keep her from
getting to the rim.  
  
With Lott and Wilborn and Hiedeman and Blockton, this is still a really,
really good basketball team, and Spingola is coming out and making some
threes, and I think they're still a really, really excellent basketball team
that has earned the right to really -- I mean, I believe they've earned the
right to still play at home in the Big East, in the NCAA Tournament, but I'm a
person that believes in the Big East, just like I believe we deserve three
teams in, and I think it's going to be a stretch at this point. But I think we
deserve it, and the reason -- we're better this year than last year, and we
got four in last year. I don't want to get off on a tangent right now about
that. It's going to be a really tough Marquette team to play against tomorrow
night, and I feel for Davenport. We always feel for any injured athlete.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Joe Tartamella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24904)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 88, St. John's - 57  
  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Certainly a disappointing effort from our end as far as how we
showed up today. I thought we didn't do too much too well. I thought Marquette
did a great job. Obviously they're a very good team, so if you don't show up,
you're going to have the results you did. I thought they did a good job of
really controlling the tempo on us today compared to the first two games, and
I thought after -- the beginning of the second quarter we started to get a
little winded and really just lost focus.  
  
Obviously credit to them, and they're a great team. Certainly been a long year
for us up and down, proud of our kids how they played, how resilient they were
through the second half of the season and getting us to a position to be -- to
have an opportunity to win this tournament, which I think is wide open still.
However, obviously I wish we would have played a little better in our last
game.  
  
Q. Can you speak to Akina Wellere, a four-year player, and what she's
done for your program?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Akina has been a four-year player for us who is a Big East
champion, a tournament champion as a freshman, so she's been kind of a
cornerstone for us in the last four years, so she's done a great job in her
growth, and extremely proud of her, where she came from as a freshman, and has
really become a leader for us on the floor. I think really has matured to a
great level from where she was as a freshman, and kind of excited to see where
she goes next, as she takes her next step, and certainly she'll be missed.  
  
Q. Natisha Hiedeman kind of had her way in the first half. What makes
her so hard to game plan against?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Well, when she's ready to play, she's difficult. She can score
it, certainly has the ability to drive it on. You can shoot it -- when she's
making shots, she seems to have a lot more energy, obviously, like most
players. Just a great player. I mean, she's Player of the Year for a reason.
She had a double-double in the first half, so she was ready to play today.
We've historically had some good games where we've been able to kind of limit
her a little bit, but you're not going to be able to do that for long, as she
showed today. She's just a really good player. She's had a great career, and
certainly happy she's graduating.  
  
Q. Is there anything in particular that she's doing differently compared
to before or anything she added to her game?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: We're still on Hiedeman?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I think I just gave it to you. I think she's been like that
since a freshman. She's shot it well. She's attacking. She's playing with
confidence. She's really good. I mean, I don't know how much more you want me
to give you.  
  
Q. Tiana was frustrated a little bit today, but yesterday she basically
controlled the game, showed the ability to do that. What does she need to do
this off-season?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Who did you say again?  
  
Q. Tiana, just for her to kind of take that next step, kind of
developing her game.  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Listen, the kid is -- her year this year I think was terrific,
and I think a little bit underrated, and for what she brings to our team and
when she's playing well -- she struggled today. That's why we struggled. But
she's never had help. She'll have help next year, so I'm excited about that
part where she's not going to have to play 35 minutes a game. She hasn't shown
her ability to be able to shoot as much second half of the year as she did, so
I think her scoring ability is a little bit underrated, but when you look at
how she distributes the ball and what she does, and I feel bad -- she's tired.
She plays 35 minutes a game. And I feel bad about that, but at the same time,
no one else feels bad, so you've got to get out there and play.  
  
So I think, looking at her game and what she did this year is really, I think,
showing the next steps of what she's done. Scoring I think will be a big
piece, and then defensively becoming a better defender, which she started to
do, will kind of finish that off for her as far as becoming a complete player.
But dynamic on the floor and athletically she's as good as anybody in the
country as far as getting off the bounce and being able to find people.  
  
Having T, Q, Alisha back, adding a couple kids that we have that are sitting
out with some other things, I'm excited about what we have in our youth.
They're getting good minutes in big games from last year to this year. So
Tiana has been fun to watch. I think she's one of the more exciting players
we've had in recent years.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Harry Perretta](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24923)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Georgetown - 76, Villanova - 67  
  
HARRY PERRETTA: I just think it was a game where they played very well and we
played good. That's what it was. Like I said, I don't think we played that
poorly. We shot 48 percent. We scored 67 points. But they played better. It
was kind of like the game at Villanova, not as extreme as that, but they made
-- what did they first have, 6 for 7 from three, we had made 10 threes in the
first half, can only imagine a four-point lead, and I didn't know whether we
could keep shooting the ball, and we needed to make 10 more threes in the
second half to win. The way that they were driving the ball, it started to be
difficult for us to keep them in front without helping, and when we'd help
they'd kick the ball to their other kids and their other kids made shots.  
  
I thought it was a game where the stars were obviously going to play well in
both sides, but I thought it was the other kids who were going to determine
who won or lost the game.  
  
Q. What did you see defensively in the second half?  
HARRY PERRETTA: Well, what they did was they started double teaming and
forcing us to throw the ball to the non-shooter, throwing the ball to Mary,
and that's why Mary had so many points. They were not letting our three-point
shooters shoot the ball in the second half, which is what I would do. You
double-team the three-pointer because Adrianna was killing them the first
half. So that's what they did the second half, they just double-teamed the
ball, forced us to throw the ball back to the non-shooters, and they played
from there.  
  
Q. Georgetown has now won five straight games this time of year. Why is
that?  
HARRY PERRETTA: They're playing extremely well, and they're almost unguardable
on the perimeter one-on-one. It's hard to keep them in front of you. And if
you do keep them in front of you, they can score over your head. So they can
make a shot that's contested. There's not many players in women's basketball
that can do that, score over your head. And they have two that can do it. And
they can beat you off the dribble.  
  
Now their other players are stepping up and making shots. It's kind of like
when we would isolate Mary and she would drive it and kick it and we would
make threes. It's the same concept. The only difference is they do it
differently than we do. We can't do it with speed and all that stuff. We do it
like the old-fashioned way.  
  
Q. You said last time you met them it was an aberration. Was the first
half an aberration?  
HARRY PERRETTA: I think the game was extremely well played in the first half
by both teams. I went into halftime, I said to our guys, I said, look, we're
probably playing the best we can. But Georgetown is playing really good, too.
And it was a question of who could sustain making shots in the second half.
Like I said, Jannah got some good looks at it. I don't know what she wound up,
but she got some good looks in the second half. She wound up 3 for 13 from
three. And first half she had made a couple of those shots. So it boils down
to you've got to make the shots when they present themselves, and we didn't do
that in the second half, and they did.  
  
Q. (Inaudible) took away your three-point shooting, like you said. How
viable did Mary prove she was inside where she was making buckets?  
HARRY PERRETTA: Well, she scored -- she's, what, the third leading field goal
percentage shooter in the country. So the problem was once they got the lead,
you're just trading baskets. So holding the lead was vital. Once we lost it,
then you're basically trading baskets with them. But she can score the ball
inside on a lot of kids.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Carolyn Kieger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28387)

### [Danielle King](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32736)

### [Natisha Hiedeman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30444)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Marquette - 88, St. Johns - 57  
  
CAROLYN KIEGER: I'm just extremely proud of our team tonight. I thought -- or
today. I thought they were extremely mature. This is the most we've been
locked in defensively. I thought they followed the game plan pretty much to a
tee, and it really showed up on the defensive end, which got our offense
rolling.  
  
The main thing we've been talking about all week is having energy and being
tough, and after our response to them when we lost up at their place, I think
we couldn't have asked for a better response from this entire team, but it
didn't just start today. We had an amazing week of practice and they've been
really bought in since the Providence game, and I can't say enough about their
maturity, and that starts with our senior guards right now, and just extremely
proud of them, and one game down.  
  
Q. How does it feel to be moving on to the semifinal game today?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: It just feels great. You know, we want to go as far as we
can, and we know that this is going to prepare us for the upcoming games.  
  
DANIELLE KING: Yeah, we've just been working all week for this, and we're
hungry to get to the championship game, so we're taking it 200 feet at a time
is our culture, and one game at a time.  
  
Q. How much of a redemption is this? Last time you guys were here it
wasn't quite so pretty.  
DANIELLE KING: It just feels like every loss, we take it as a lesson, and we
let it fuel us for the next game and the next season. We know we came up short
last season, and we're just staying hungry this time.  
  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Yeah, we came into this tournament with a chip on our
shoulder, especially after what happened last year, and we know that you've
got to show up every game, and any team can win, and we know if we bring our
energy and intensity that we're going to be playing at our best.  
  
Q. Was there also a bit of a chip on the shoulder after losing to St.
John's?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Yeah, we don't like losing (laughter). And after that game,
like we just looked at all our mistakes, and we learned from it. So you could
tell that we learned from it, and it paid off.  
  
DANIELLE KING: Yeah, I agree with T. We don't like losing. We don't take it
nicely. And we just fixed our mistakes and bought into the game plan.  
  
Q. Natisha, you pulled up that D three in the second half. Was that just
all-time confidence there taking that shot?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: Yeah, I just felt like I was open so I shot it, and I think
it was the dagger.  
  
Q. Danielle, how did you feel in today's game after coming off an
injury?  
DANIELLE KING: I felt great. I'm back to 100 percent, so nothing slowing me
down. Full speed.  
  
Q. Natisha, you really had it going. Did you kind of just feel like the
shot was -- did you kind of see something on defense? What led to that?  
NATISHA HIEDEMAN: We just prepared for that all practice being face guarded. A
lot of players on the team being denied, and Coach had a great game plan going
into it, and she fed us a lot of confidence, and we used it as fuel.  
  
Q. How were you guys able to stop St. John's offensively today?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, I think it all had to do with our close-outs, and our
game against them at their place, I thought we weren't paying attention to
personnel. We were running out penetrators, we weren't high and tight on the
shooters, and we talked about that a lot this week. We had locked in mentality
last night from the moment we found out who we were playing, and I think our
girls were just such at a different level of focus. And I'm just really proud
of that because the last four games it hasn't really been like that. So you
can tell they've learned lessons. You can tell all the film sessions are
paying off.  
  
Q. How has playing with that underdog mentality helped you get to where
you are so far in the season?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, I think for us we play better when we have a chip on our
shoulder as they say, or when we play like we have something to prove, and
that's been their MO for their whole entire career here. No matter what our
ranking is, no matter where we've come as a program, we still have to play
like that. And we still have to come out every night with a no doubt, a no
mercy mentality, and I think they're really catching on to that. We talk about
it every single day about how we're going in and we're going to play every
possession as hard as we possibly can and the score is always 0-0.  
  
Q. What did you think has led to Natisha's confidence?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Well, I think she's always been a really confident shooter. I
think where she's really elevated her game this year is she's taking smarter
shots. She's taking better shots. She's penetrating a little bit more, which
is opening up her three-pointer a little bit more because they have to pay
attention to her penetration as well as the three ball. So for her, I just
think she's really confident right now, but it also stems from her teammates.
When Allazia is playing the way she did the second half, when Dani is
penetrating and Amani had just let the pressure get off her a little bit so
she can play free and she can have that green light that we've given her.  
  
Q. What about her rebounding, too, she had a double-double before even
the first half was done?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: Yeah, I've been saying it all year, when Natisha is locked in
I think she's an All-American candidate. She's playing at a really elite
level. I think her biggest thing is consistency, and once she figures out that
it's all based on energy, she's really hard to stop. Obviously I'm biased
because she's on our team and she's our player, but I think she's really one
of the best guards out there.  
  
Q. You had 48 points in the paint. Can you talk about that mentality
when you were down low?  
CAROLYN KIEGER: So we missed 33 lay-ups combined in our first two St. John's
games, and we talked about that a lot, about being tough and making sure we're
finishing. And we only had six 3s combined in the two games, so we came in
offensively wanting to pack it inside and make sure we were getting points in
the paint and finishing strong, where we also needed to stress the court and
hit 3s, which we ended up hitting eight tonight. So I think even offensively I
think we really followed the game plan. It's been something we've been talking
about for five straight days right now.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [James Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34798)

### [Dionna White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34800)

### [Dorothy Adomako](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28401)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Georgetown - 76, Villanova - 67  
  
JAMES HOWARD: It was a tough game out there. We take our hats off to
Villanova. It was very hard to play them again after playing them in that
second game up there, and the outcome of that game, we knew our team was
better than what it showed that night. I think our young women rallied around
that and really came in with a different focus.  
  
Q. How would you describe what it's like when you and Dionna are feeding
off each other like you did today?  
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: It was good. We know that we can play hard together, and
we're unstoppable together. So when we start going, it's good, and it's great
for our team, and it can get our team going, as well.  
  
Q. Dionna, it was a crazy first half. What was this game like just
playing in it?  
DIONNA WHITE: I think it was fun. The first half we felt like we gave up a lot
of threes. That's where they got most of their points from. So at halftime we
really talked about just running them off the three-point line, not letting
them get hot, and keeping our composure and just having fun.  
  
I think in the third quarter we really did that. We were playing together,
feeding off of each other, and just playing ball.  
  
Q. Adrianna had 15 in the first half, scoreless in the second half. What
changed defensively on her?  
DIONNA WHITE: Making sure that she didn't get hot again. She's a great
shooter, so once she gets going, it's hard to stop her, so in the second half
we really focused on not letting her get the ball, not letting her get in
rhythm.  
  
Q. Dorothy, this team has won five in a row. Why has this team been able
to put it together in March?  
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: We're playing together and having fun, just buying into what
Coach asks us to do. Yeah, we've got to keep it going.  
  
Q. In the first half it was an offensive battle, back and forth, you
guys would make a three, Nova would make a three. How did that fuel your fire
offensively to just keep it going?  
DIONNA WHITE: I think we always have confidence when we're hitting shots, and
just knowing that Villanova, they're a great shooting team. In order to keep
up with them, we have to score the ball, too, and just having that in the back
of our minds and being aggressive, everybody always tells us that we're one of
the best scorers in the league, and when we really want to play, we're
unstoppable, so just having that mindset.  
  
Q. Dorothy, Coach Albert says that you guys saw Captain Marvel; do you
believe that Captain Marvel helped you today?  
DOROTHY ADOMAKO: Honestly, I fell asleep during the movie. (Laughter).  
  
Q. So is that no? What about you, Dionna? Did you fall asleep?  
DIONNA WHITE: No. Just, I think, in the movie, she fell a thousand times, and
she always got back up. So just having that same type of mindset. We're going
to be down, we're going to -- they're going to score on us, but it's how we
come back from that that matters.  
  
Q. What was the biggest difference for you defensively in the second
half that you were able to stop them? You held Villanova to 14 points in the
third quarter, 11 in the fourth.  
JAMES HOWARD: I thought we started to play the scout a little bit the way we
wanted to. They make Gedaka the outside shooter or not allow her or anyone
else to get anything off of flips and cuts to the basket, which we were able
to do.  
  
The thing in the second half, I thought we touched up on their three ball.
They didn't get as many open looks as they got in the first half, and then
once we started to get a lead, they started to believe again, and then their
defense turned up even more. That's what it takes with our group. When they
see that they're having some success, now we're hard to beat.  
  
Q. When you see them having that kind of confidence and wanting to guard
someone else, how much confidence --  
JAMES HOWARD: (Inaudible) coming out, and that young lady right there, I know
we might have a different defensive Player of the Year, but when you play in
man-to-man all year and she's locking down the best and players don't want to
dribble the ball in front of her, she's one of the best defensive players in
the country.  
  
Q. What worked offensively so well today?  
JAMES HOWARD: We had great flow. I think our kids came out and they hit shots
early. And to withstand that Villanova run in the first, to get so many
points, we was not able to do that up there. We couldn't score at Villanova.
We couldn't throw it in.  
  
But when they're shooting the ball the way they shot it in the first half,
Hahn hitting threes and then with Tucker hitting threes, we were able to score
to stay close. And I think we went down four at the half, and that kept us in
striking distance to go back in the locker room and make some adjustments, and
those adjustments kind of worked in the second half.  
  
Q. You were just on the sidelines watching these two seniors will you to
big-time play after big-time play.  
JAMES HOWARD: I don't know if we'll ever have two like them again because
you're talking about Dionna White who's closing in on 2,000 points, Dorothy
Adomako is about 1,600. They're special. They are very special. It's a
blessing to have both of them.  
  
And each season your team looks differently. But I can -- I wake up every
morning knowing that I've got two of the best players in the conference on my
team and that they're competitors, and when you have that and they are playing
together, as I said this week in all our interviews, the power of my three,
the power of my three seniors is they're together, and Mikayla Venson worked
defensively. It might not have looked like it in the scoring column, but
defensively her leading was really huge. So the power of those three, if
they're there every day and they're scoring and they're defending, we're hard
to beat.  
  
Q. You just mentioned how special these seniors are. How is that a
testament to this program with what you are doing, five in a row now that
you've won, this push that you're making in the tournament?  
JAMES HOWARD: I think it's huge. Us coaches have to make decisions, and I know
a lot of people probably wasn't happy about the decision that I made at
Villanova when we lost almost by 50. But I pulled all my starters early
because they wasn't in it. Sometimes people might say you're trying to send a
message, but it's a learning. It's time to learn from things that we go out
there and we compete every day, and this is not how we play. And I think since
that game, they have rallied. We had meetings. We talked about it. But getting
them to understand, this is it for you, this is it, you can't have a do-over,
and if you have no more do-overs, what is tomorrow going to look like? Am I
going to give it my best that day? And that's all we're saying to them. We're
not doing anything different. We're just challenging them to go out and finish
their season, their senior year in a fantastic way and try to do something.  
  
And I say try. We tried the last two years, as you guys said. First time in
history, been to two semifinals. I want this group, and we started as -- Coach
Bolton and I have talked, we started when we got the job that I want to do
something special that never have been done at Georgetown. I want to win a Big
East Tournament. One day I want to get to an Elite 8, not a Sweet 16, because
those banners are there. We are here to try to do -- to turn this program
around, and the culture that those seniors are leaving, two straight
semifinals, I'm proud of them, and the rest of the kids who played night in
and night out who have to work with them.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Kurt Godlevske](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28442)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Creighton - 60, Butler - 51  
  
KURT GODLEVSKE: Well, first of all, I'd just like to say congratulations to
Creighton and Jim. I thought they did a phenomenal job. I thought their kids
were really engaged. But overall, I thought it was a really good game. I think
both teams competed. I thought my kids really competed. They just seemed to
have a little better flow offensively and took away some things from us, from
the first two meetings that made it extremely difficult offensively.  
  
But other than that, I was proud of my kids. I thought we battled and gave
ourselves an opportunity late.  
  
Q. Kurt, it was kind of an interesting situation with where this team
stands. What do you think makes this group worthy of the NCAA Tournament?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: Well, I think, first of all, the number of wins that we have I
think is the first thing that I would argue. I think the quality of wins that
we have. When you look at that we beat Ohio State on a neutral court and they
finished fifth in the Big Ten, we've got a top-15 win over Marquette, and just
the whole complete body of work that I think we've done throughout the season.
The Big East, in my opinion, does not get enough credit for the quality of
teams, and for us to finish third in the Big East, I think we're very
deserving of being in that tournament, yes.  
  
Q. How cool has it been to lead this turnaround for this program?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: It's been an amazing feeling, but it's not something that me
personally, like I take -- or relish, I guess, for me personally. It's more of
a pride thing for my kids, like to hear Michele and Tori and Whitney and
Taylor talk about where they've came from and where we are now. It's more of
me like getting the glow from my kids having that positive experience.  
  
Q. What was the missing piece for your team tonight offensively that you
maybe weren't able to get into the same flow that you saw Creighton get
into?  
KURT GODLEVSKE: That's a great question. I think that we just needed to have
-- not having Kat through the second half of the season changed a lot of
things for us, and when you're getting ready to play a game like this in a
tournament setting, that's a big game for us, whether or not if we win or
lose, no matter who we're playing, it's a big game for us because of the
tournament ramifications overall.  
  
Having someone that you can throw the ball to and settle you down and get a
big basket for you is huge because then it gives us that fourth or sometimes
even fifth person that we can do that to, and it makes us much tougher to
defend.  
  
Now, with that said, I think Shae has stepped up and had fantastic and maybe
the best season she's had as a bulldog. But those are things that we've got to
continue to grow and work on as a team, especially when we get in those
situations where they weren't guarding Shae, and we were running some things
to kind of take advantage of that, and Creighton just did a phenomenal job of
rotating and recovering.

### [Jim Flanery](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28426)

### [Ali Greene](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36681)

### [Jaylyn Agnew](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34788)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Creighton - 60, Butler - 51  
  
JIM FLANERY: Well, first of all, congrats to Butler on a terrific season.
They're not through playing, but we knew how good they were. They were really
good the first two times we played them, and we were not. The first game we
weren't in the same gym. The second game was a little better, but they really
put it on us late.  
  
But you know, we also saw a lot of things that we felt like we could do
better. You know, I think that the more familiar you are with somebody, the
margin kind of shrinks. But our kids were tough tonight.  
  
We got off to a great start, which I thought was important, based on how they
had handled us the first two games, so even though the second quarter was --
we really muddled through the second quarter and the first part of the third
quarter, our start kept us in the game and kept it close.  
  
Just a word about Ali, just so happy for her. I did not -- I don't think any
of us believed that she would be playing tonight a couple months ago. But I
think she's shown tremendous courage and love for her teammates. So it's
really neat to have that.  
  
And then this one right here was, I thought, really, really, really good
defensively. I thought we made some mistakes on Jennings in that second
quarter, but the second half I thought we really, really made things hard for
her.  
  
But anyway, just -- also with regard to the Butler seniors, just really,
really great players. Schickel and Jennings and Weaver, those kids have done a
lot to lift that program and just really complimentary of how good a players
they are and how they represent Butler.  
  
But we're excited to move on. We have a tall task, but it beats the
alternative.  
  
Q. Ali, eight days ago the perception from an outsider looking in was
that you were retired from basketball and maybe you'd give it a shot on Senior
Day. That turned into what you did on Senior Day and then what happened
tonight. Can you take us through what went through your mind after that Senior
Day performance that led you to play tonight?  
ALI GREENE: You know, I was just so -- I didn't really know what to expect
from Senior Night. Flan asked me, how much do you want to play. I was like,
we'll see how the first two minutes go. I haven't run in about three months so
we'll see how it goes. My teammates were just like so encouraging and so
positive, so that really helped me through the game.  
  
And then after, I was like, I'm going to keep going. Like I'm not ready to be
done yet. I think my body is trying to tell me no, but I want to play for my
teammates and I want to win this thing, so I want to do whatever it takes to
help them.  
  
Q. Jaylyn, what has Ali's comeback done for this team?  
JAYLYN AGNEW: It shows us what having fight can do, and this girl, she's been
like my roommate for four years, and she's a rock star. I have no words. She's
gone through so much adversity, and her fight and her willingness to go out
there and fight for us, even though she's in so much pain, just says so much,
and we're so appreciative and so proud of her.  
  
Q. Ali, how emotional is a win like this for you?  
ALI GREENE: It's so exciting. Like I just can't stop smiling. Like I'm just so
happy for my team. I can't wait to beat DePaul.  
  
Q. The first two games against Butler, it's kind of crazy to think about
you were beat by a combined 52 points. What was the difference tonight?  
JAYLYN AGNEW: Like he said, our toughness. We were just tough the entire game.
The second quarter we let up there, but we just had to be tough, and they say
it's hard to beat a team three times. So we just had that in the back of our
minds and knew if we were the tougher team today that we would get a win.  
  
Q. Ali, you spent the last few weeks or months working on a three-point
shot?  
ALI GREENE: I don't know. I don't know what happened. No, I just was wide
open, and I just said, here we go.  
  
Q. For either of you can you weigh in on Glenn's scooter?  
JAYLYN AGNEW: We've actually seen that scooter in previous years when Bri
Rollerson had it, so we're pretty familiar with it around. But we saw him roll
in, and we were like, what's up, dude. Come on, now. We're hoping he gets back
off that thing soon.  
  
ALI GREENE: I think he needs a little horn or something.  
  
JAYLYN AGNEW: Seriously, though, big J sticker. Yeah, just no one else needs
to be on it.  
  
ALI GREENE: Yeah, true.  
  
Q. What will it take for you to beat DePaul tomorrow night?  
JIM FLANERY: Luck. Just kidding.  
  
Toughness and just -- you know, if you watch DePaul enough, they're -- they
can look great. They shoot so many threes and they put so much pressure on you
that they're just -- they make you uncomfortable.  
  
I think when we've talked to our players about how do you play them, well, you
might have a quarter where you beat them by 10 or 12 or 15, and the next
quarter they're equally capable of beating you by 15 or 18. They're just so
good in terms of just kind of staying the course.  
  
Both games were really close. They played really well the last probably 13 to
15 minutes in Omaha last week. But they sputtered for a long time. I mean, it
was 28-23 at half, and I said, you know, part of our issue was we weren't
ahead -- to hold them to 23 at half and only be up five instead of being up 10
or 12 or 15 was big because I thought once they get going, they get in rhythm
offensively, and you saw that tonight against Providence. They got off to a
great start.  
  
But they also are a little like us. They're perimeter enough that they're
going to hit a lull here and there, too, which is kind of what we are.  
  
But ball security is going to be important and defensive rebounding. We have
to be better against their press than we were, especially in the second half
last weekend, and then I've always thought they're a really good offensive
rebounding team. You look at how they got off to a good start today, it was
second-chance points early because they didn't shoot the three very well
early, but they got a lot of -- they put themselves in a great position in the
first quarter just on the offensive glass.  
  
I mean, those things are going to matter. And then I thought they did a good
job last weekend of posting Grays in the second half and she had a big half.
So we go from guarding Schickel to guarding her. But we'll have to do a little
bit better job on her than we did last weekend.  
  
You know, we know it's a challenge, especially when you've had a really tough
game today, to play against them the way they play for 40 minutes.  
  
You know, in terms of using our bench, that will be something that we'll
probably have to do a little bit more than we did tonight, just based on the
pace of the game and how much they're going to press us and push pace on the
other end.  
  
Q. I don't know how much -- coaches have different opinions on plus,
minus, but the leader was Tatum, seemed like she made big plays, she had like
six assists for you as well. What did she do in this game?  
JIM FLANERY: Yeah, well, her nickname is Tornado, because she makes things
happen, and if you see -- she had some turnovers, but she made a lot of big
plays, and she -- I thought she really -- the offensive rebound, she had a
couple really big plays there at the end, too. She corralled a loose ball and
tipped it to Audrey for a lay-up at the end of the shot clock, and I thought
she attacked with the cut. But yeah, I'm happy for her. She was our starting
point guard for quite a while this year. She hurt her elbow, her shooting
elbow and sat four games, and then when she came back, she -- it's tough, I
think, for a younger player because we inserted Jade who's a senior, so her
minutes were a little more erratic, it took her a while to get her confidence
back, but she's played really well since Xavier, so really the last five games
I think she's kind of found herself again, and we're going to need her
tomorrow against DePaul and their pressure because she's got better quickness
than Jade and Olivia, our older players who have injuries that have slowed
down. So she's got a little bit more ability to get by somebody or relieve
pressure with her quickness.  
  
Q. Your players -- and you have mentioned toughness multiple times in
this press conference alone. When you look at your team, where do you feel
like you are the toughest?  
JIM FLANERY: Well, what I told them is that this win doesn't happen if we --
if through late January and early February when we really kind of hit rock
bottom, we didn't really hit rock bottom, because I felt like we still came to
practice every day, and our younger players were eager to get better, and you
know how a season can get long, especially for freshmen, and our upperclassmen
who were disappointed with probably -- who were probably disappointed that we
hadn't had the year we thought we could have, kept coming to practice and
working to get better, and they lifted each other up.  
  
I think that's been the thing that I'm most proud about this team is that when
we lost five in a row, we didn't -- we became a better basketball team because
we kept practicing the right way, and so I think that's -- and so you see it
out there tonight, but it's really a reflection of the fact that we had a lot
of people rowing the boat in the same direction in that stretch where we lost
five in a row and we didn't say our season is over or, like I said, our young
players didn't give in to the length of the season and our older players
didn't give in to the disappointment that we had had through that point in the
season.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Jim Crowley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32727)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 85, Providence - 60  
  
JIM CROWLEY: I mean, I think the first thing that comes into my mind is that
DePaul does not get enough national credit for how good they are. Not just the
consistency, but this team in particular, how good they are. Their shot making
is exemplary, it's outstanding, and they really put a lot of pressure on you
because you make a mistake and they make you pay, and they did so to us.  
  
Playing these last two games against us so close is going to be really good
for our off-season stuff because it shows us and our young kids the level.
Now, it's easy to show, but again, credit to DePaul. They play uncomfortably
hard. We play pretty comfortably hard, they play uncomfortably hard, and
that's just a credit to Doug, his staff and obviously their great senior
leadership.  
  
Q. What made defending DePaul so tough?  
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, some of those we didn't have a chance to because they were
run-outs, whether they were turnovers or our shot decisions, we had no balance
on some of the shot decisions, and obviously on some of the turnovers we had
nothing.  
  
You know, in the half court, again, their pace and tempo is so good, and when
you have the number of kids they have, they have four kids who have played
together for a long time, and you could see it. You jump out on a screen, they
slip it. You stay in a screen, they pop, and the ball is right there waiting
for them. And again, they make that look easy. That's not easy. And they do it
really well. I mean, I just don't think they're getting -- maybe it's good for
them to stay under the radar like that, but they're not getting enough credit
for how good they are and how well they're playing with that.  
  
Q. What kind of a step do you think your program took this year?  
JIM CROWLEY: Well, hopefully we can keep going. I mean, having coached in the
WNIT a few times, we think that's an amazing opportunity and we'd be honored
to be a part of that. But we learned how to win. We learned what that takes,
both on the road in close games, we learned how to stay with things. We had a
number of wins that we came from behind. And we learned to trust -- a lot of
players learned to trust themselves, trust each other, and trust what we do.
It's on us as coaches to keep moving that forward. It's on players to keep
moving forward the way we need to.  
  
Q. Focusing on the freshman class, what did they add to this program's
culture?  
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, again, you know, they really responded to our upperclassmen
and allowed themselves to be part of that, and then they've had a lot of
success in their past. We got a chance to see a little of what Alyssa Geary
can do and we're excited about what she can do. Earlette Scott is going to be
a good player. And Sophia only played a couple minutes at the end, but they're
all pretty good. And our sophomore class is not bad. But again, that means
nothing if we sit on our butts all off season. That means nothing if we don't
react to the improvements that we need to make.  
  
We're excited for that because we feel pretty good about what we have, but we
feel even better about where we can go, and we need them to be a big part of
that.  
  
Q. You mentioned how DePaul plays uncomfortably hard and you play
comfortably hard. What do you need to do to take that step to start playing
uncomfortably hard?  
JIM CROWLEY: That's a great question. That's what we're looking forward to the
off-season for. Obviously a lot of that is on me. The higher level of
accountability to that. And then we need to be that partnership with our
players. A lot of people don't want to go there. A lot of people don't want to
go there, and then some kind of revolt against that, but we don't have those
kind of kids. I think our kids are up for that. We've got a great example of
DePaul with that.  
  
And people get so caught up -- and again, I keep kind of rambling on about
them, but people get so caught up in this offense, and it is really something
special. But the execution level that they have, and again, the level they do
that at, I've been at this a long time, it's really, really unique, and
they've got it going really well right now.  
  
Q. What makes DePaul such a tough team to defend them on the
perimeter?  
JIM CROWLEY: Well, they all shoot it. And again, that experience they have,
and their young kids are really, really good, but their young kids are going
against those guys every day. And obviously Doug makes them work so hard that
they're getting better quickly.  
  
But they're experienced and they all shoot it and they all have drilled at a
high level to do that. But that experience, as I mentioned earlier, of how
they read off one another and how they read the defense so, so well.  
  
You know, this is only -- the year before I got here, I coached against Doug
and then we've coached these last two -- the way they're playing right now,
and I really hope this isn't any kind of silly jinx, superstitious coaches,
but the way they're playing right now and that level of execution, it's really
fun to watch and awful to play against.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Doug Bruno](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15667)

### [Kelly Campbell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34805)

### [Mart'e Grays](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34794)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
DePaul - 85, Providence - 60  
  
DOUG BRUNO: The Big East is a great league, and Coach Crowley and the
Providence Friars have had a really, really good year. The quirk of the
scheduling gods have us playing the first weekend of the season, the last
weekend of the season, two months apart and then eight days apart. And this is
a really good Providence team that's only going to get better, so we were
really just -- we don't ever play scared or come into a game with fear, but we
knew we were going to have our hands full. And the score at the end of the
game is not indicative of how hard we had to fight to be able to win this
basketball game. We had it at 19 early, they cut it, they cut the lead back to
10. We had it -- it took a long time for us to be able to pull away from this
Providence team. So great job by Providence.  
  
Our players I thought were focused and ready to play, and that's always a
concern that you just -- at this time of the year, I don't know how you could
ever not be focused, but sometimes stuff happens. So I was just -- I think our
players came out with a good solid edge on. I thought they maintained it. We
still had some ups and downs throughout the game. It was nice to have Mart'e
Grays play the amount of minutes she played because it was our choice, not
because it was a situation, a foul situations choice.  
  
Kelly Campbell did what she does, and Mart'e had a really strong ballgame. And
then Kelly had the 12 assists and multiple rebounds, and Coach Bruno still got
mad at her at that one possession where she actually made the play to get the
ball and then gave up the ball to a jump ball, all right. I was irritated that
-- once she got the ball she didn't keep the ball.  
  
That's about what Kelly Campbell does for us. Mart'e did a really, really nice
job, and their defense was packed inside, so I thought Mart'e did a good job
of getting a good strong effort and good strong production but still shared
the ball, all right. So again, it's a good strong Providence game, and now
we're going to play a very good team tomorrow in either Creighton or Butler.  
  
Q. Why do you think you were able to have so much success in the paint
tonight?  
MART'E GRAYS: Just I wouldn't say it's the offense we were in, but the way our
team executed the offense, my teammates looked for me inside, and they
delivered the ball.  
  
Q. Kelly, can you talk about the start you guys got off to tonight?  
KELLY CAMPBELL: Yeah, we've really been focusing getting off to a quick and
efficient start, especially now that it's one-and-done time, so it's been very
important for us, and I think we did a great job of really getting off to a
quick start today.  
  
Q. Mart'e, what makes Kelly such a special passer?  
MART'E GRAYS: She measured twice and passed well once, hit the open
(laughter).  
  
DOUG BRUNO: I didn't say nothing.  
  
MART'E GRAYS: Seriously, though, she does a great job of measuring twice.  
  
Q. Kelly, you had five steals tonight. Can you talk about your defensive
effort and the team's effort as a whole?  
KELLY CAMPBELL: Yeah, I think the steals are just a result of our pressure. I
mean, our guards up front were wearing the ball handlers down. I feel like I
was just in the right place at the right time a couple times.  
  
Q. Kelly, could you speak about the play of some of the younger guards
and how big they were?  
KELLY CAMPBELL: Yeah, Lexi and Sonya definitely had great games today. Lexi
had like four threes tonight, so she was definitely hitting tonight. And then
some great play from Sonia, some big offensive rebounds, and nice to see them
playing this well at the end of the season.  
  
Q. As an upper classman, when you are seeing some of the younger players
having success in the tournament, from your experience how much confidence is
that going to give them going into the next round?  
KELLY CAMPBELL: Yeah, I mean, the tournament definitely brings a whole new
level of pressure, so to come out and play well in the first game, I think
that really gives a lot of confidence, and going into the next game, you'll
have that confidence from the first game, so that's super important.  
  
Q. Mart'e, you guys had a 42-23 rebounding advantage tonight. How big
was that for you guys?  
MART'E GRAYS: Yeah, that was very big for us because the first game -- I mean,
the second game we played Providence, we had trouble offensively rebounding,
so we made a big emphasis on rebounding the ball and getting second shots.  
  
Q. Mart'e, how big was that run that you guys had at the end of the
third quarter?  
MART'E GRAYS: It was very big because coach Bruno came in at halftime saying
that we were up 15, I believe, but if we would have took care of business, we
could have been like -- had the game to our advantage even more, so that run
was very big, and I'm glad we made adjustments to have that run.  
  
Q. What do you think makes Kelly just that special initiator for your
team?  
DOUG BRUNO: I just think Kelly Campbell is a very, very -- she's a consummate
competitor, number one. She loves to compete. She really does care more about
facilitating than scoring, and I think she also knows how to use her vision.
The measure twice, pass well once, the carpenter's rule, measure twice, cut
once; we turned it into a basketball rule, measure twice, pass the ball once.
That just means you make sure your eyes lead your ability to pass. I think
Kelly has got great vision, but I think she uses her vision very wisely. So I
think those are a lot of the factors. But her tough -- it really is ironic
that I'm irritated at her because she gets -- she gets a ball and they turn it
into a jump ball and I'm actually irritated at her. But she just does a lot of
dirty work.  
  
You have to play the game, and you have to respect the game, and when certain
things happen within the game that the media love afterward, it's great. But
she's not -- it's not like, okay, somebody comes whispers in my ear, she's
three points away from getting a triple-double. Well, we're not just all of a
sudden trying to turn the game into -- that's not what we do here. I think
respecting the game is just play the game and had -- I put her back in late
because I didn't like the stability on the floor with the group. It wasn't
late.  
  
I still felt that Providence could have had at run at us because we had it at
19 and 20 before and they cut it back. So I just didn't like the leadership on
the floor. I put it back in, but we didn't run stuff. But that's Kelly. She
doesn't care. She don't care about the personal -- she really just cares about
the team.  
  
I really do think she's a special player.  
  
Q. Looking at the bigger picture when you do have a player like Kelly
who's a facilitator, how valuable is that to a team?  
DOUG BRUNO: I think it's one of the most important -- it's not just that she's
a facilitator, it's just that she's got this toughness to her, and she goes
and rebounds the ball, and that's -- she can't jump. I mean, she jumps that
much, and yet she gets more rebounds than players than can really get off the
ground. So it's just a statement to her toughness and her want-to, and she's a
throw-back.  
  
Again, when I've had this conversation with many people about the triple-
double, it's one thing to get a triple-double when you're Oscar Robertson and
you're the greatest of all time and the ball is in your hands for 22 seconds
and you're going to shoot it or pass at the end of a possession. It's another
thing to get a triple-double when you're Russell Westbrook and the ball is in
your hand. But to even come close to a triple-double when you are a
facilitator, a player that does all the dirty work, that's just a tribute and
statement to what she's all about. And I think the rest of the team feeds off
of her and appreciates it, and that's Kelly Campbell.  
  
And again, I don't really -- I think all the Big East awards must be earned,
and I don't get into picking fights with anybody. This is a great league.
There's a lot of great players. Everybody that earned an award deserved an
award, all right, and just -- I just think she's a very special player that
didn't get anything this year, and I think she's probably a little better than
that. But that's life. I don't get to vote for mine. I don't campaign for
mine. And that's just the way it works.  
  
And I think she'll be happy to prove people wrong as she plays basketball
games.  
  
Q. In this nine-game winning streak, your defense has really improved.
Can you talk about how you guys have been able to be a much better defensive
team?  
DOUG BRUNO: We're better, but we still have a long way to go. We're better,
but when you ask me how, we just -- people don't realize unless you come watch
a practice that they think all we do in practice is shoot threes. I mean, they
don't understand that we really do work very diligently, very hard on the
defensive side of the ball. I have a philosophy and a belief that defense is
nothing more than offensive behavior, offense when the other team has the
ball. All right, the rules of sport give the other team the ball when you do
something good, all right, so it just so happens that they got the ball. It
doesn't mean you're defending. You can be on offense when they have the ball
when you're focusing on it. We work on it. We're small, and we still have a
lot of work to do.  
  
Q. Can you speak about what you told your team in the third quarter just
to get them refocused?  
DOUG BRUNO: Well, we pre talked about it at halftime. A week ago we were up 10
at halftime, and we came back and we put them in the bonus in a minute and 30
seconds, and the next thing you know, it's a 53-50 ballgame with nine minutes
to go in the game last week. Marquette, they were only down eight against
Marquette last Sunday with a couple minutes to go in the basketball game.
Marquette ran the thing out at the end. We know that they're capable. And if
you don't stay focused, this is what you're going to get. And I just thought
we lost our focus and lost our attention to detail, and when you do that, all
of a sudden a really good team, a well-coached team like Providence will come
back and fight you for not paying attention to detail, so that's really what
we talked about. But we talked about it at halftime, too, because we just had
practice with this a week ago.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Joe Tartamella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24904)

### [Curteeona Brelove](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36655)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
St. John's - 76, Seton Hall - 51  
  
JOE TARTAMELLA: Our kids really played well. So we're excited, obviously, to
be able to get a W. It's certainly no easy task as you look to play four games
in four days, but certainly we're taking one at a time. We know that we've got
to play well over the next few days and especially tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, anything else that real allowed your offense to start
clicking?  
JOE TARTAMELLA: I thought we did a better job of getting into our offense more
quickly than we did last week. Certainly making shots helps. I thought we were
more aggressive in the lane, being able to get the ball to the right places.
We made some great passes. To have 21 assists in the game usually bodes well
for your team. So obviously that was important. I thought we did a great job
sharing it. I thought we made some really good decisions. I thought Tiana was
great in distributing with having nine assists and two turnovers. And we made
big shots at the right moments, outside of the one that I took away from Q.  
  
Q. What was the difference between the game on Sunday and today's
game?  
CURTEEONA BRELOVE: The difference was we just needed to make sure we played
better defense and made sure we just helped each other out, and talked and
communicated. We know that she's a great player and to take her out of the
game would help us, so we just made sure we stayed and were alert watching her
and just communicating back and forth.  
  
Q. (Inaudible)?  
CURTEEONA BRELOVE: Same as last time. We made sure we worked on the things we
needed to work on and just made sure we were great at everything we did. We
had a lot of energy and we played together, we talked, and we just had to take
it one play at a time.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Brian Neal](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28397)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Providence - 70, Xavier - 62  
  
BRIAN NEAL: Well, we wanted to come here and play what we hoped was our best
basketball to finish the year, and I don't think we did that. I thought we
played with a lot of questions going through our brains and on our faces, and
I thought Providence played like they had a lot of answers and was very
committed to things, were really on time, and I thought we were second-
guessing, and that made us hesitant, and when they were on time, it was just a
bad combination.  
  
Q. (Inaudible) her development both character-wise and as a player?  
BRIAN NEAL: It's amazing what you can do with just a little spirit, right?
It's been an awesome story, and she just plays her butt off, and certainly not
perfect and makes her share of mistakes, but she sure is fun to watch.  
  
Her development, she got a little confidence earlier in the year, and she just
ran with it, and I wish we could have gotten a few more players to get that
spark that she had. But I think she's going to be a good player in this league
for a couple years.  
  
Q. You talked about how you played with a lot of questions and you were
second-guessing. Where were you second-guessing?  
BRIAN NEAL: Well, there's a lot of things. You know, there's a lot of things
like we front the post, and we got stuck behind posts, whether you're big or
small. We got stuck. So when you're doing things like that, it's obvious. If
we're supposed to fill certain spots, then we weren't there, it's obvious that
your players aren't locked in. So there's a million little things like that.  
  
I really -- I don't know if it was just the moment of being at the tournament
for some of our young guys, you know, maybe that's part of it. But they have
20 assists, so they make us pay, and I felt like they were really looking for
each other, and I felt like we were fighting everything, and as a result of
that, we were looking for ourselves too much, and I think that's probably
where we just got tied up like a pretzel.  
  
It felt like in our huddles, I felt like maybe I contributed to that. But it
felt like we were down 50 points sometimes when the game was not over, and we
could have made some pushes. But then we'd have a breakdown and they would
make us pay for that, and it just got away there, and we just couldn't get
close enough to make them really get nervous.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Jim Crowley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32727)

### [Maddie Jolin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36660)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Providence - 70, Xavier - 62  
  
JIM CROWLEY: A lot of credit to Xavier. You know, they kept coming. I thought
we had a lot of chances to really kind of put it away, and they wouldn't let
us, so credit to their coaching staff and players.  
  
Very proud, and that's the word I've used a lot with this group, of our
resiliency. We didn't finish the way we wanted to, but we really locked in and
stuck to our game plan. We did a good job on the boards. And we really took
care of the ball. And when we do that, we're pretty decent offensively, so it
was really good to see that not only we were capable but we executed that. You
know, I just thought we got contributions from a lot of people in the first
half. We had a lot of foul trouble. I thought everyone who came in gave us
really, really good minutes, and that's what you need to have success and to
move on.  
  
Q. Maddie, just talk about the seniors. Your career has been a roller
coaster, but to have the success you're having now as a senior, just talk a
little bit about that.  
MADDIE JOLIN: Yeah, it's been a wild ride for the past couple years. But
wouldn't change it for the world. Obviously this year has been super fun,
winning and being around the people that I'm around. Honestly couldn't have
gotten any of the wins without the coaching staff and without playing
together. We play so hard for one another, and I think that's why we do well,
and it's exciting to see. I think you can see how happy everybody is when we
assist or get an offensive rebound or pass the ball to one another. It's just
the chemistry we have has brought us to where we are today, and I couldn't be
prouder of my team.  
  
Q. In addition to your leadership as a senior, talk about the young
girls on your team. You have no juniors, so it's really underclassmen.  
MADDIE JOLIN: Yeah, they've really had to step up. Early on, too, we've
started freshman before, and like you said, no juniors, so that's -- we don't
even call them freshmen or sophomores, we just see it as our teammates because
they've got to play a lot of minutes and we've got to trust them with the
ball.  
  
I usually say at the end of games, we've got to make mature plays and keep
going, and they know what that means. They know don't turn the ball over,
don't do a freshman mistake because they're not freshmen to us, they're just
players, because they play a ton of minutes.  
  
Q. Maddie, in the wild ride that you described, as this senior class,
you have been through so many ups and downs together. How would you describe
your senior class as a unit, everything that you guys have gone through?  
MADDIE JOLIN: I'd say that we have a lot of grit. We have a lot of -- we're
super together. I mean, you have to be when you go through changes like that.
But I think that's -- yeah, we've stuck together the most, and I think that
has helped our leadership, too, and integrating the freshmen and the
sophomores in, because we've been through difficult times, and they have, too,
and seeing us as leaders go through it and hear about our stories and our
past, I think it's really helped them mature and grow up and helped us, too,
as seniors.  
  
Q. How much has that grit been in the back of your mind today saying we
want to get this win, we want to make history?  
MADDIE JOLIN: Yeah, there was no doubt in my mind that we needed to win today.
I knew we hadn't won, at least in my four years here a first-round game, so
that's what I was thinking about the whole day, and my teammates were, too,
and they play for our seniors. They play so we don't have a last game. I don't
know if they knew it was 2001, but they definitely knew that we needed the win
tonight for us.  
  
Q. Orlando had a career-high scoring night. Her contribution tonight
really kept you guys on an upward trajectory.  
MADDIE JOLIN: Yeah, she played huge and she's one of the best players to play
with ever. She has the best IQ I've ever seen. I say to her all the time,
you've got to shoot more. And the whole week at practice we were saying
they're going to play way off you, it's gonna be four on five out there
because you don't shoot the ball. And today I said, you need to shoot the
ball. Every single time you're open, shoot it so that they play you. And she
did that. And she can score. She loves to pass the ball, which is great, we
love that, too, but we need her to score, and today she did that she really
stepped up. She played awesome. I'm super proud of her.  
  
Q. You talked about how today you had contributions from a lot of
players. How much confidence does that give you leading up to tomorrow?  
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, I mean, we're going to need them. Obviously DePaul is a
great team, incredibly well-coached, very experienced and disciplined, and
they run the bodies in and out and they play as hard as anyone in the country.
We're going to need all kinds of people, and you know, and very fortunate that
all year we've played a lot of people, and we've had a lot of people at
different moments come up really big for us. You know, we had the two all-
rookie kids, Maddie and JoJo have been incredible for us, but. Coop was big
today and Alyssa Geary gave us great minutes today. Earlette Scott has won
games for us. Chanelle is really, really tough to defend and makes great
things happen. Kyra Spiwak had a great game today. So we need them. And that's
one of the things we talked about is how locked in everybody has to be,
because at this time of year, you can't have a basic mistake. Maybe someone
makes a play over you, but you can't reach, you can't be too low, those kind
of things, and those are all correctable, and we did that pretty well today.  
  
Q. Talk about today just eight turnovers.  
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, and again, they have the ability to respond to that, and
they did. We have very little chance tomorrow if we turn it over a bunch like
we've done the two times we've played DePaul. Now, they force it, they play at
a really high pace, but we have to be better taking care of the ball. We're
fairly efficient offensively when we do take care of it. So I'm excited, just
a couple weeks ago we didn't take care of it very well against them, so I'm
excited to see our growth and our ability to get better with that.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about the ride the team has gone on this year
and the success. How do you feel as a coach earning this first win since
2001?  
JIM CROWLEY: Yeah, I mean, it has nothing to do with me. You know, our kids
bought into one another right away, and I'm old enough to know that doesn't
happen very often. And we've had bumps, but when need be, they know to get
back to one another. You know, when you're lucky enough to have a group do
that, you just kind of enjoy it and things happen that maybe other people
don't think should or could. But in this game, if you're playing for one
another, you can do some pretty special things, and for the most part, this
group has shown that.  
  
It's hard to give up some of yourself to want more for the group, but we have
a team that does that for the most part, and we're able to do some good things
with it.  
  
Q. With this senior class specifically, they've been so together, and
you've mentioned how proud you are of them, and then to hear Maddie talk about
so highly of the underclassmen, what confidence does that give you -- what
impact is this senior class leaving on your program?  
JIM CROWLEY: Taught them how to win. I mean, and how to do it the right way
and how to put -- today, JoJo passed the ball unbelievably. I mean, she drew
so much attention and she was such a willing passer. And you look, she had six
or seven assists. Maddie had four or five assists. And when your two leading
scorers are that willing to pass the ball in this moment, I mean, that
empowers people. And those are the kind of things that are really important to
us as we build our program is that you want to play for the person next to
you, and they have exemplified it all year, and it's become a standard.  
  
You know, it's on us. They've put it back on the coaches and the players, the
younger players, that this is what we're about, and this is what we gave and
worked for; keep it going.

# [BIG EAST CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+EAST+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Tony Bozzella](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36654)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
St. John's - 76, Seton Hall - 51  
  
TONY BOZZELLA: I'll make this quick. Congratulations to St. John's. They
played very well today. They got down and they fought back, and when we got
back down, we struggled to score, and I thought they did a good job in their
game planning, and we didn't have an answer for it, so I give them credit, and
I'm sure if they play like this tomorrow, they'll have an excellent chance of
being successful.  
  
Q. Anything about your outgoing seniors that you'd like to say?  
TONY BOZZELLA: Yeah, I think our outgoing seniors played hard all the time.
They were tremendous ambassadors for the program. They were really great
people. I don't think -- you watch them play, you don't understand what
special people they are, from Victoria to Cole and Inja, who came in this
program and got us back to respectability, to obviously Kaity has been a
tremendous, tremendous ambassador in everything.  
  
I'm really proud of the kids. This is obviously not the way we wanted to end
our season, but someone has got to lose, and it wasn't because they didn't
try. We actually had our best two weeks of practice in months this week, so I
just -- you know, I'm as surprised as anyone. But I think we looked bad
because St. John's played well.  
  
Q. What can you say about Selena Philoxy's play today?  
TONY BOZZELLA: She is. She's been getting better all the time. She plays with
a lot of toughness, a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of confidence. It bodes well
for the future. She's only a sophomore, and hopefully her and Shadeen and Des
and some of our other forwards returning will be a formidable front line in
the future. But she can hold her head high for sure.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.) What do you hope to see her develop in the future?  
TONY BOZZELLA: Well, I just want her to continue to get better. She's a great
kid. She works extremely hard. She was obviously very frustrated today. I
thought St. John's did a great job of crowding her and making it difficult for
her to succeed, and I just think her timing was a little off. She wasn't as
crisp as she's been. She still battled and did everything she could, it's
just, you know, we could never open up the floor space for her. They did a
good job of making us take jump shots, and they did a real good job of it.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

### [Kaila Charles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32703)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Iowa - 90, Maryland - 76  
  
Q. What were your main takeaways from this game that you shared with the
team?  
BRENDA FRESE: Just I was proud of their fight. I thought a game that had a lot
of adversity for us with a lot of foul trouble that we continued to just keep
putting our head down and keep battling. I thought Iowa was terrific. I
thought we had no answer to be able to stop the All-American in Megan
Gustafson. But just proud of the fact that we just continued to keep trying to
stay in there and never gave up.  
  
Q. For Kaila to have two (points) the first time you guys played and 36
tonight, what did you see from her?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, just continues to speak volumes of Kaila and just her
will to win, her competitiveness and not to be denied. She just wanted to do
whatever she could to be able to put this team on her back to be able to help
us in any situation possible.  
  
Q. You mentioned the foul trouble in the first half. Can you elaborate
how that impacted the game?  
BRENDA FRESE: It was tough. I think from the very first possession they showed
that the game was going to be called really tight, and that impacted us
greatly. Megan is so strong, so physical, and so just a very difficult match-
up, obviously, for us. It just really impacted us because of just the
tremendous foul trouble that we were in.  
  
Q. It didn't seem like when they would go on runs it was defensive
breakdowns or anything. What was your takeaway on defense? Was it just that
she is that strong?  
BRENDA FRESE: She's just that good. I mean, she's just that good. The first
time we played them, we tried to run a lot of triangle-and-two and different
looks at her, and it didn't pay off. All the supporting cast hurt us. And
again tonight, just trying to figure out who you couldn't guard. I just think
Iowa is a great team. You know, if you stop one, they know how to go to their
other options.  
  
Q. Gustafson was unstoppable for much of the game. What, if anything,
could you have done differently, I guess, defensively?  
BRENDA FRESE: Like I said, the first time we tried everything at her, and she
still had 30 on us. You talk about -- we tried to front, we tried to have
great help-side defense. I mean, obviously we were impacted greatly when you
don't have a lot of bodies to be able to go at her when they did a tremendous
job pumping it in to her and getting us in severe foul trouble.  
  
Q. Olivia Owens gave you some great minutes. Can you talk about that?  
BRENDA FRESE: Olivia was huge. We always talk about be ready when your number
is called, and she's been working hard behind the scenes. Her opportunity and
her window came tonight, and I thought she gave us a tremendous boost in the
first half.  
  
Q. What mindset does this put you guys in going into the rest of the
postseason?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, we're excited for what lies ahead. I mean, this is not
a bad loss. We got beat by a great team. Selection Monday we get to hear our
name and what our seed will be, and more importantly what our bracket is and
what region we're put in. For us, it's only our fourth loss. It's being able
to take the lessons that we've learned from all four of those losses and being
ready for our last tournament.  
  
Q. I think we know how much you guys hate to lose. Do you hope your team
holds on to this feeling almost?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I could say when they walked off the court, when I walked
in the locker room, this team hates to lose. The beautiful thing, like I told
them, this isn't our last game. But I know the fight. We don't want it to end.
And obviously for Bri Fraser, we want to continue this ride as long as
possible.  
  
Q. How difficult is it to go up against Megan when it seems like
everything you do there's fouls? How do you manage your game like that?  
KAILA CHARLES: It is hard. She's a great player. She's an All-American. She
knows how to finish, either shoulder, great touch around the rim. But it's
just we've got to be present. We can't be stuck in the calls. She was getting
a lot going her way, but we should have known that might happen because it
happened last game, and we just had to be present and just keep moving
forward, but we were kind of stuck in the past, and that's just something we
have to keep working on.  
  
Q. Did anyone speak in the locker room afterwards?  
KAILA CHARLES: I mean, I came in a little later than anybody, but they were
all keeping heads up. And I just said, we're good, our season is not over. We
still have the NCAA Tournament. We fought hard for 40 minutes, never gave up,
even when we were down however many with a minute left. We're not done. We're
far from over, and we're going to keep working and try to go as far as we can
in the NCAA.  
  
Q. How much are you looking forward to the NCAA Tournament, the type of
defense you guys can play?  
KAILA CHARLES: I mean, especially after this loss, which you know is going to
give us motivation for practicing and going forward, we're excited for the
NCAA. I think we have a well-rounded team with so many weapons. We have a team
that can play very well at defense as well as scoring, so I'm excited to see
how far we can get. I think we're all committed and ready to play again and
just get a win back.  
  
Q. They did a really good job on Taylor tonight. How much does that put
extra weight on you or the team as a whole?  
KAILA CHARLES: I mean, I'm not going to say it hurt the team. Everybody is
going to have an off-game. I had an off-game the last time, and they were able
to carry us. Even though we didn't win, my teammates were still there to
score, and they kept encouraging me, and I just told Taylor to keep shooting.
That's the only thing there is to do, stay confident, keep driving, because
the minute she's in her head, that's a disadvantage for us. I was just telling
her, she'll be good. We still have the NCAA, she still has three more years,
and she's going to be a great player when she's done.  
  
Q. Can you just talk a little bit about the game today, how you
played?  
KAILA CHARLES: I mean, the game was a tough game. Iowa played probably their
best game ever as a team. Megan is a great player, All-American for a reason.
But I think we fought really, really hard. We never gave up. That's what I'm
proud of my team for. Iowa deserves this one. They were fighting for their
seniors. They were working all season for this, and credit them for the win.
But this speaks volumes of our team, that we're never going to give up, not
even until the last second. I'm just excited to keep going for the NCAA
Tournament and for next year, too.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Megan Gustafson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32141)

### [Kathleen Doyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33245)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Iowa - 90, Maryland - 76  
  
Q. Does it give you confidence with the win tonight?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, this team has had confidence in themselves all year. We
really feel like we just stumbled a little bit during the Big Ten season. We
believed we were the best team in the Big Ten, and today they came out and
they proved it. We got the best player, one of the best players in America
with Megan, the best supporting staff that she has. Just absolutely amazing.  
  
Q. Have you seen a better performance from a player than Megan?  
LISA BLUDER: Nothing she does surprises me anymore. I mean, whatever we give
her, she just goes after it and she does it, but I'm also so proud of the rest
of the team tonight, knocking down free throws, controlling the ball at the
end of the game. Hannah played a great game, as well. All of them. I mean, I
hate to single out somebody, but obviously Megan, pretty special kid.  
  
Q. And Kathleen Doyle when it was tied, she went to the hole twice and
made big baskets.  
LISA BLUDER: She had a great steal, as well, had a steal at half court. She's
our defensive presence, and she showed it tonight.  
  
Q. What's it mean for you? You've done this before, but to see these
guys finally get it?  
LISA BLUDER: Every time is special. I mean, these guys, this is a bond that
we'll carry with us for the rest of our lives. They will always be Big Ten
champs, and we will always carry this journey together, and that is something
nobody can take away from us ever.  
  
Q. What can you say about all the effort they put in?  
LISA BLUDER: They're so tough. They're so physically and mentally tough.
You're playing three games in three days, it's really easy to let a few aches
and pains bother you. Not those guys. They were mission focused, and they
wanted this.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
LISA BLUDER: It's been like this all year. Tonight, yeah, she went down hard,
but she's bounced back from back to back ACL tears. The kid knows how to be
resilient. Hannah went down with an ankle sprain. Megan, three games, three
physical games in three days. We had to also overcome some foul issues, and
again, mental toughness, so strong in the third game, and again, in a
conference like this, one of the best basketball conferences in America.  
  
Q. Have you ever had a game like this?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I don't think so. I mean, this is a game I'm going to
remember for the rest of my life. We did a wonderful job of just preparing for
this tournament. We had a chip on our shoulder. It's all worth it right now.  
  
Q. Your teammates found you time and time again.  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: They did. They did a real fantastic job day in and day out,
and I have to credit them.  
  
Q. Do you know how many points you scored?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: No.  
  
Q. 45.  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Okay.  
  
Q. Did it seem like that?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I don't know, I just wanted to really, really win, and I
wanted to put everything into it, and my teammates trust me and I trust them.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: You know, they're amazing. We were able to buckle down and
get some stops, and I'm just so, so incredibly proud of how competitive -- and
our coach, too. Credit to Maryland, they're a great team.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, I mean, it's incredible, that perseverance that we
have. Every single game leading up to this game, we knew they were going to be
difficult teams. They wanted it as bad as we did, but we just focused on our
mission and what was important to us. We weren't going to get upset at any
kind of calls or anything.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: It means everything. This is the only thing I really cared
about is winning with my team, winning this championship, and I couldn't be
more proud of our team and how we showed resilience despite everything that
was thrown at us in this tournament.  
  
Q. What gave you confidence on the court today?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I wanted to win a Big Ten championship. That was it. We had a
couple games where the adrenaline -- we needed that adrenaline, and today the
adrenaline was there, and thankfully it was because I know a lot of us are
tired right now, but we're going to soak this in and really bring it to the
NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. What was your biggest challenge tonight?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: You know, I think their physical level. They were very
physical in the low post. They were really working hard and I had to make sure
I put myself in the best position possible so my teammates could get me passes
inside.  
  
Q. Coach calls you guys a family. What does this mean to share this
whole tournament with your family?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: It's incredible. You know, this team has been amazing this
past year, and I wouldn't want to be on any other team, that's for sure. When
we got those warm-ups with "Family" across the chest, it really kind of
embodied us. And another thing is our mantra is unbreakable this year. That's
our mantra. We embody that every single day. We try to, and it really showed
how unbreakable we are as a team right now.  
  
Q. Is this the most important day of your life?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yes, no doubt about it. This was the most important. Every
single game is important, but this one meant so much. This is what I wanted
coming to Iowa. I wanted a Big Ten championship. I just couldn't be more proud
of how our team played, and it's a dream come true. That's for sure.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about your teammate and Hannah being named to the
all-tournament team?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: It's amazing. You know, Hannah is an incredible post player
down low with me, and she's really going to battle every single day, and she's
just an incredible finisher, an incredible person. She works so hard in the
post down low with me. You know, we went to Brazil this summer together and we
worked hard there, and just to be able to keep playing with her has been
really special.  
  
Q. (Inaudible).  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I was just crying, to be honest. I couldn't really get much
words. But I think Hannah was like, we did it, we finally did it, and that's
just been incredible -- it's really been a dream come true.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: You know, we poured our heart into that game. And if we
wouldn't have won, we would have been proud of our effort, that's for sure.
You know, just the emotions that come with it, it's been pretty special. It's
been hard to keep the emotions in check at the end. I knew we were going to
win, and I was trying really hard to relax, but it was pretty tough.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, it's incredible. This is a dream come true for me, it
really is. You know, I visualized this for four years, constantly, throughout
every single season. To get this, it's pretty special, that's for sure.  
  
Q. Kathleen says she's never going to take the hat off.  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: No, I'm not taking this off anytime soon. I'm probably going
to sleep with it on, to be honest.  
  
Q. Will you wear it to classes?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I'm for sure wearing it to classes, for sure. I'm not a hat
wearer, but I'm wearing it to classes.  
  
Q. What did you think of Megan's performance?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Megan is the GOAT. There's no denying that. She's a great
teammate, an even better person, and there's nobody I'd rather play with.  
  
Q. Now you've got to regroup, you've got the NCAA Tournament now.  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, I think winning this championship puts us in a great
position going into the NCAA Tournament, gives us confidence to hopefully get
a high seed, and let's get Carver rocking. It's amazing. I had so much
confidence in this team going into this tournament, and we got the job done.  
  
Q. Resilience, every time, every game, teams made a run on you, you guys
were able to answer and get it done. What is that?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, I mean, our team motto is unbreakable. In those tough
times if we break up and don't stay together as a team, then teams can break
us. When we stay together as a team, 13 strong, nobody can break us, and that
showed today.  
  
Q. What does it mean to get this tournament title?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, we basically lost the Big Ten regular season title, and
that doesn't sit well with us, so we came out here. We knew that winning the
tournament would feel just as good, and we didn't get both of them, but this
is pretty special.  
  
Q. It was a tough, physical game, a lot of players going down on the
sideline. Can you just talk about the perseverance of your team?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, I mean, it's Big Ten championship basketball. You know
you're going to get a physical game. Maryland is a physical team in general,
and we just came ready to play. I just want to give some credit to Maryland.
They're an amazing program, and they played great today, but we just came out
on top. We played strong, played together. I don't have any other words for
it.  
  
Q. How much of that unbreakable thing that we were talking about
yesterday, how much did that enter into this?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: I mean, they went on runs today, but we stayed together as a
group. Everyone stayed composed, and we were unbreakable. I mean, we got the
championship. We cut down the nets, so unbreakable. It fits us perfectly.  
  
Q. Is this the most fun game you've ever played in?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Probably. I don't think high school state championships live
up to this. This is fun. This is amazing.  
  
Q. What's next for you guys?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: NCAA Tournament, make a deep run, hopefully get to that Final
Four.  
  
Q. What were you thinking when they came out 5-0 before you guys even
took a shot?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, I mean, we were just a little frantic to begin that
game, but we settled in and got the job done. Maryland has been in the Big Ten
championship game the past couple years. They've got players that have been in
that situation before, but that was our first time in that game, so we just
needed to let our nerves settle down, and we did that.  
  
Q. Do you know how many points Megan had?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: A billion. How many did she have?  
  
Q. 45\. You guys, foul trouble, injuries, seemed like you guys
(inaudible) --  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, definitely. Our coaches do a great job of coming up with
a great offense, and obviously Megan is pretty much automatic. So we have
really great guards who just focus and try to get her the ball. And Hannah
Stewart comes in and makes plays for us, too. You can't discard Megan because
we have other players on our team that will make you pay.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

### [Blair Watson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36661)

### [Channise Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34743)

### [Kaila Charles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32703)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 73, Michigan - 72  
  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, obviously just a tremendous game by both teams. No
team deserved to lose this game. But proud of our finish. I thought it was a
hard-fought game by both teams. Came down to being able to make one more play
and one more stop on the defensive end, something that we've been building for
and have put ourselves in a lot of great situations to have great confidence
to be able to finish it out. Just really proud of our resiliency there to stay
the course.  
  
Q. Kaila, you've been a part of a lot of milestones at Maryland,
especially some this year. What does the 1,000th win mean to you, to be part
of that for the program?  
KAILA CHARLES: I mean, it's just a blessing. I'm glad that I was able to get
the opportunity to play for this program under Coach Frese and I'm glad I'm a
part of making history here in the program. Like I said, I'm just grateful to
have this opportunity.  
  
Q. Blair, what did you see during the first half to kind of give you --
to pull away second half with the lead?  
BLAIR WATSON: I'd say like the way we pushed in transition. Coach B was
emphasizing that, that we had to get out and run and definitely helping in on
the bigs and sinking in on Thome and getting her out of her rhythm and I think
that helped us a lot to pull away a little bit in the second half.  
  
Q. Kaila, I spoke to Bri after a couple of you guys' close wins during
the regular season. She said she felt like you were never going to lose those
games like against Minnesota. Was it the same feeling tonight?  
KAILA CHARLES: Definitely. I have all the faith in my team. Especially when we
come together, we put our mind to one goal. And we've been playing for Bri all
season, and we want to send her out the right way. I had faith, and I think
they did, too, and we all believed we could win.  
  
Q. Channise, you had some big baskets in the third quarter. What did you
see from Michigan's defense because you seemed to be more aggressive?  
CHANNISE LEWIS: Yeah, of course going into the half I was on the bench for
foul trouble, so I definitely saw what we could change going into the third
quarter, so I just had to be more aggressive going off the screens, more
aggressive to the hole, and it was just opening up for me because there was
more focus for everyone else on the team, so that helped me out.  
  
Q. Kaila, they seemed to have been denying you the ball a lot in the
fourth quarter, but again and again you got open and coming down the stretch
you had those last two free throws. Talk me through that.  
KAILA CHARLES: It was my teammates setting screens for me to get open. Yeah,
basically that, they were setting me screens and then at the end Taylor set me
a good screen and the girl happened to foul me and we were able to get on the
line to get two opportunities or two shots to get the lead. So just my
teammates getting me open.  
  
Q. Kaila, you were emotional towards the end of the game. What were you
feeling?  
KAILA CHARLES: Yeah, fired up. I'm really passionate about this game. I love
it. I love the fact that our league is so competitive. I love competition, and
I was just excited. I love a close finish. I love to get the adrenaline, so it
was just fun.  
  
Q. Tonight you were able to pretty much take -- more or less take care
of Thome tonight for Michigan. She only had two points and two rebounds
compared to last game against you guys, where she had 30 points. What was the
game plan for tonight to try to limit her?  
KAILA CHARLES: Yeah, just making sure we knew who the shooters are and the
drivers were. And if we were guarding a driver, making sure we were sagging in
to help dig off of Thome because we know she makes a big impact in the paint.
There was a lot of team defense on Thome that I think Steph and Shakira and
Bri came in and did a good job of keeping her out of the rhythm. On the
flipside, offensively, we were attacking her, hopefully getting her into foul
trouble, and I think that's what really caught her off because she had to sit
most of the game.  
  
Q. Blair, you guys were so back and forth and trading leads so often in
this game. Why couldn't you guys get any space or momentum? What were you
seeing on their end?  
BLAIR WATSON: I would say Michigan is a really good team and they played their
best game of basketball against us tonight. Yeah, they gave us their best
shot, and at the end of the day, we just came out and got it done.  
  
Q. Channise, then Kaila, you guys find yourselves again going into the
Big Ten Tournament championship. What are you going to take into this year as
opposed to last year, just trying to get that win?  
KAILA CHARLES: We're just going to make sure we stick to our standard and our
brand of basketball. Last year we came really close and we lost it, so we have
that chip on our shoulder. We want to get back and hopefully get the win.
We're just going to stick together and get the win.  
  
CHANNISE LEWIS: We've got to stick together and play for 40 minutes and play
to our standards. We're ready for this game tomorrow, and we're just going to
play hard from the start.  
  
Q. Channise, at the end of the third quarter, Kaila was taken out, and
then Coach came up to you and Taylor about like a minute and five left in the
third quarter if you can remember. There was a message that she sent to you
guys and then you immediately drove to the basket after she met with you. What
was the message behind that, and what did you try to do to take advantage of
it?  
CHANNISE LEWIS: I don't remember, but I'm pretty sure it was to be aggressive,
and that's exactly what I did, and I got to the hole.  
  
Q. Kaila, since you scored a lot of points, what was the hardest thing
you had to do during the game?  
KAILA CHARLES: Just make sure -- honestly, just stay present. We knew Michigan
was going to come out and score baskets, and they would go on their run, but
as long as we stayed present and I was able to be a good leader to my team, we
could ultimately come together and get the win. I was just trying to be a good
leader and not get focused on when I made a basket or when they missed a
basket and just try to be present.  
  
Q. Coach, could you really just put into words what 1,000 wins means and
I guess really you hoped to celebrate it with cutting down nets tomorrow,
right?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, that would be a special feeling. But I think it speaks
volumes of the University of Maryland and the program and the legacy. And I
can't say enough about the two coaches before me with Dottie McKnight and
Chris Weller, who set the bar and set the standard for me to follow. It's all
of us that have continued on that tradition, the great tradition that we have
here at Maryland, and obviously we're one of very few programs in the country
to be able to own a milestone like this, so it's pretty special.  
  
Q. Coach Frese, how relieved were you late in the game there when Kaila
went to the free-throw line, making seven free throws already and then
knocking down those last two?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I don't know if relieved was the right word. I was
relieved that she was the shooter at the free-throw line, but I knew there was
still a lot of time left that we were going to have to be able to get a stop
defensively. So just staying in those moments, but if there was anyone out
there that you wanted on the free-throw line, I knew she wanted that
opportunity.  
  
Q. Going into halftime, you guys were down 40-37 and then you guys came
out of halftime on a 16-8 run. What message did you give the team?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, we were actually -- I mean, we just talked about poise
and composure. We kind of became rattled in their press. A big piece of that
was having Channise on the bench. Just kind of collecting ourselves. We needed
that time at halftime and just knowing what we were more than capable of and
being able to go out and being able to execute it.  
  
Q. What was it like playing and defending against Amy Dilk? She's a
freshman, but it seemed like she was playing kind of beyond her years and
seems like she's been doing that all year long. What was it like having to try
to stop her?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I mean, obviously an extremely talented player. I thought
she played with even probably more energy, probably with a lot of family in
the stands, being back home, and she's just a hard match-up with her length
and her size, her court vision. Obviously when you look at her 11 assists, she
had a tremendous presence for them I thought on both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Late in the game there, you guys made a basket, but referee blew the
whistle and there may have been a mistake timeout. Talk me through that and
what happened or what didn't happen.  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, I mean, a timeout was called. That's what they heard. And
so it's -- I mean, there's really nothing else you can do. At that point the
decision was made, so we had to move forward. When you talk about moving to
the next play, just moving through that.  
  
Q. I understand it's a big win today, but I want to look toward tomorrow
a little bit. Can you talk to me about how you plan to get your players ready,
and what mentality you want them to come with tomorrow?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, well, I think if you don't have players that are motivated
for tomorrow, you probably have the wrong team. It won't be hard at all. This
team is highly motivated and excited for the opportunity that we have that's
ahead of us for tomorrow. We know every time you advance how hard it is, that
we're going to have to play a complete game. We need to play better tomorrow
than what we did today. But it won't be hard to motivate our team to be ready
to play.  
  
Q. Brenda, how much did those games against Minnesota and Purdue prepare
you guys for today. And then I think Steph's left leg was taped up to her
knee. Did she just get hit or something?  
BRENDA FRESE: We tend to tape a lot of bandage, so she probably just had blood
and a cut. So it wasn't anything significant. You know, there was just never
any panic from anybody, between players, coaches. We've been in these
situations so many times that there's actually just a calming, peaceful,
collective mindset of what we need to do, and I think that's obviously because
we've been through so many intense games this season. The conference has
prepared us, just so many great teams, like you see the 4 seed with Michigan
and everything that they threw at us today.  
  
Q. The media timeout when you guys were up 67-65 and you guys came out
of that timeout with a layup, what was the huddle like?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, well, first of all, I've got to tell all the junior
journalists that you guys have done a phenomenal job asking your questions,
and that time-out for us, again, was just getting one more stop. We wanted to
put Shakira on the ball. She's 6'5", use her length, and we had a collective
poise to ourselves of just wanting to be able to finish it with one defensive
stop.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Tim Eatman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36642)

### [Arella Guirantes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32722)

### [Charise Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36668)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Iowa - 72, Rutgers - 67  
  
TIM EATMAN: First of all, I want to give Iowa a ton of credit. They played
like a 2 seed tonight. They came out, and they punched us in the face from the
beginning. But to our kids' credit, they fought back, and they didn't get
knocked out. They kept up the fight, and we continued to find our way during
the basketball game, and we started to believe a little bit more in ourselves
and what we were trying to get accomplished, and once we got our belief
together, we played a good basketball game. We wish there was another five
minutes. We felt like if there was another five minutes we would have been in
good shape. But we hope the people at Rutgers University and the
administration and all of our fans are proud of these kids because I am. I am
extremely proud of them because they played with the Rutgers kind of attitude
that we should play with.  
  
Q. When you guys were down 20, you continued to fight back. What led to
that? Was it just forcing turnovers or the press or what kind of led you guys
to get back in the game?  
ARELLA GUIRANTES: I just think that we just never got down on ourselves. I
think we stuck to the 55, and it kind of put a lot of pressure on them. We
weren't getting too many turnovers out of it, but we were okay with it, them
starting their offense at 20 seconds basically, and then we were just
converting back on offense, pushing the ball. Charise did a good job of
pushing the ball, pushing the tempo. When Zippy came in and Noga hit some
shots, everybody just stepped up at the moment.  
  
CHARISE WILSON: It's a mentality that we have. We're going to play hard
regardless, whether we were down 20, 10 or 6, we're still going to play our
game, do what we do, and moving forward that's what we're going to do. We're
going to play hard regardless of the winning score, and we're going to play to
win.  
  
Q. It took you a little bit to get going tonight. What are the defense
like of some of their big guards and forwards?  
ARELLA GUIRANTES: I think I didn't realize that they were pretty much face-
guarding me. I think they played as a triangle-and-two in the first half at
some point, but I think what got me going was when Charise came in and she's
just like, run, just run, and I just started running, and that was it. But
yeah, I think when we just pushed the ball and were not standing there. We
were pretty stagnant in the first half, and Coach said that to us. So the ball
wasn't moving as well. I think we fixed it in the second half, and that's when
I started to feel myself and get going.  
  
Q. Coach, Victoria Harris found herself in heavy foul trouble early. You
pulled her from the game with two fouls, you pulled her from the game with
three fouls. When she came to the bench, what was your message to her each
time?  
TIM EATMAN: Well, I didn't actually take her out for the fouls. I felt like
she wasn't getting to her match-up defensively, and I felt like they were
getting the basketball into Megan who was allowing them the opportunity to
make the next pass. And we talked about it during shootaround, that in this
game we had to come up and all five players had to match up. So once we were
able to talk about it -- Victoria is the type of young lady, if you can tell
her something, she can digest it and go. And I said, don't forget, you've got
to come up and get Megan, don't get back. She's like, my bad, Coach, my bad, I
got you. To her credit she wanted to get back out there, and she was like, my
bad, I got you. It wasn't the foul trouble, because I probably would have
played her with two in the first half, it was just getting to the match-ups.
But to her credit, she played like a senior, and a senior plays like they
don't want their season to end, and I thought she got back out there and
fought for us.  
  
Q. Iowa started pretty fast, pretty early, and you guys were having some
defensive breakdowns. What kind of led -- was there anything else that led to
Iowa doing what they were going to do as far as breaking the press or anything
else?  
TIM EATMAN: Well, in order for the press to work, you've got to get to your
match-ups, and we never got to our match-ups. They spaced us out, and so we
came in at halftime, we talked about getting back to our base, and our base is
the 3, 4, 5 have got to go to the boards, and the 1 and 2 have got to form a
tandem on the flight of the shot, and we wasn't doing that. We were all over
the place. Once we got back to our base, that 3, 4, 5 started going to the
boards, now the 4 it's easier for her to get on the ball because she's under
the rim. The 5 it's easier to get to Megan because she's underneath the rim.
But when we wasn't doing that, we couldn't get to our match-ups, and the
second thing is our protector wasn't getting back to form a tandem on the
shot. So when the ball was shot, when we scored, they were just pushing it up
on the floor. So once we got that settled down at halftime, I thought now we
took away the first pass, and we took away Megan in the middle, and then we
made them work to get it up the court. And we forced them into 17 turnovers,
and they're a good basketball team, and I thought that was something really
good.  
  
Q. What was your message to your team when you got down 20?  
TIM EATMAN: Believe in what we're doing. Believe in what we're doing. Look
around at each other and say you've got each other's back, and we're going to
believe in the process, and if we believe in what we're doing, we'll be fine.
But everybody has got to do their job right then and there. Don't point
fingers, point it at yourself and say, I'm going to do my job, and if I do my
job, my teammate is going to do her job, and we'll be fine. And once we
started believing in what we was doing and what we started to get
accomplished, then we started making progress. Then we started to get them on
their heels, and once we could get them on their heels, we had an opportunity
to win it. I'm going to say this to you, I know it wasn't part of the
question, but they not only have belief in what they're doing, they have to
learn from this moment, because the next time we play, we have to earn the
right to play 40 more. No one gives you anything else anymore. If you want
something the rest of the way, you've got to earn the right for that. And so
they've got to believe in the process in practice, believe in it every day so
we can get a little bit better.  
  
Q. Almost certainly a bid coming to the (NCAA) tournament. What does the
next nine days entail for you and your girls?  
TIM EATMAN: Well, we've got to make sure we take care of academics. They've
been away from school for a while so we've got to get back home and get with
our academic people and make sure everybody has got everything taken care of
academically first. Then we've got to take care of our bodies to make sure we
can get healthy and strong, and then we've got to get back and get our minds
ready to play, by working on things that we need to work on to get better.
This is a great opportunity for us. We got punched in the face by somebody, so
now we get a chance to watch that, and now when we come back and watch those
things, we'll get better for the next time. The first couple days will be
about academics and getting their bodies right. Then the next couple days will
be about, okay, what can we do to get better and what we're trying to get
accomplished. Then we'll start worrying about letting the chips fall where
they fall.

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Makenzie Meyer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34740)

### [Hannah Stewart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33244)

### [Megan Gustafson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32141)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Iowa - 72, Rutgers - 67  
  
LISA BLUDER: We're pretty happy right now. You know, I consider the Big Ten
one of the toughest conferences in America. There's 14 teams. We're down to
the final two. It's pretty exciting for us to be playing the championship
tomorrow. We're excited to get back, get our scouting report done.  
  
Q. Megan, could you just talk about the physical battle that you had
tonight and your approach to it, and how long did it kind of take to get
adjusted there?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, I thought Rutgers did a nice job of being physical,
which every team is going to be able to be doing that against me. I just
didn't have -- a couple shots didn't go in in the first quarter, but my
teammates did a nice job of uplifting me, keep encouraging me. And I was
really focused on other things, especially in that first half, whether it was
rebounding, blocking some shots, getting my teammates open for threes, that's
what I was really focusing on, and then I was able to really refocus on the
offense in the second half.  
  
Q. Megan, the wrist, the ice thing on your wrist, is that something from
today or from earlier, and did that hamper you today?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, it's just a little tweak, nothing serious. We've had a
couple games in a row, and it's a grind right now, but we're excited to still
be playing.  
  
Q. Hannah, they were able to kind of get back in the game after you guys
had them down 20 points. How do you think they were able to do that and how
did you guys kind of keep them off and were able to get this win?  
HANNAH STEWART: Yeah, Rutgers is a gritty team and we knew they were going to
go on some runs. I think some of that was accredited to our turnovers and
maybe being a little too lax when we had that 20-point lead, but I don't think
there was ever a doubt in any of our heads that we weren't going to win that
game. And huge credit to Tania Davis, our point guard, and she did a great job
of bringing us together as a team and saying, hey, we're winning this game,
everyone pick their heads up and let's get to work, especially when they got
it close in those last couple minutes of that fourth quarter. There was never
any doubt, but it definitely went a little gritty there.  
  
Q. Hannah, you were a little more aggressive taking those jumpers from
the free-throw line early in the game. Was that a focus going into the game?  
HANNAH STEWART: I mean, that's kind of a focus for me every game. That's a
shot that we practice a lot. I was feeling it a little bit in the game
yesterday, so today I knew that I wasn't going to let anything stop me from
taking those shots, especially when Megan wasn't hitting as much as she
usually does, but we also knew that the odds were in our favor when we're up
10 and Megan goes 1 for 7 in the first couple minutes, like obviously she's
going to come back and have a million points. So yeah, things are -- when my
shot was falling, my teammates just gave me so much confidence to keep
shooting it when it's there.  
  
Q. Hannah, you talked a little bit about Tania. Last night she had the
three-pointer after Indiana went up one. Tonight she had the three-pointer
after Rutgers had gotten back to within three. Tell me about her big plays
there late.  
HANNAH STEWART: Yeah, she's got ice in her veins, that's what we always tell
her. Gosh, she's just a good point guard, it's so fun to be on her team. She
really, I think, brings us five starters and our whole team together as a
whole. She can do it all, and she knows that it's not her job to necessarily
score a bunch of points, but she'll hit those shots when they need to be hit
and she'll take what's given to her. Yeah, it's just awesome being on the
court with her.  
  
Q. Megan, can you put into words what it feels like for you to have
gotten to the semifinal game and now to have gotten to the championship game
after you got knocked out in the first game throughout your career, right?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, so it feels pretty great. Today this is the first time
I've been playing in a semifinal, let alone to be able to -- get a chance to
play in the championship game. You know, Hannah could probably agree with me,
but right now this is kind of all we've got, and we've just got to keep it
going. We're going to fight every single day and we're going to prepare well
tonight, and I'm just blessed to be on this team with these girls, and I'm
just really excited to put it all out there tomorrow.  
  
Q. Makenzie, Coach obviously had a lot of faith in you because you
played every single minute tonight. You were there for everything, all the
back and forth runs that you guys went on (indiscernible) --  
MAKENZIE MEYER: Yeah, well, I feel like I'm in pretty good condition after
this season. Our strength coach, Coach D, does a really good job of that, so I
felt prepared. There was a couple of minutes that I felt tired, but then you
just think back to how much this game means and how bad we want to play that
game in the championship. We knew Rutgers was a feisty team, and when we got
that 20-point lead we knew they were going to come at us with their press, and
they got us tight a little bit, and like Hannah said, Tania really brought us
together and we really came together as a team and were able to keep our
composure there down the stretch.  
  
Q. Makenzie, it looked like it was a real struggle, but could you talk
about the Rutgers press?  
MAKENZIE MEYER: Yeah, and we were prepared for that. They do a really great
job with that press. They press all 40 minutes, so we were ready to go. We had
a couple different options for press breakers, and I think we just did a
really good job preparing for that, and we were really confident in ourselves.
We have two great point guards in Kathleen and Tania. They did a really good
job down the stretch of being able to get it across the court and break it.
And I think we did a really good job, especially in the beginning of the game,
there was a couple of times that we were just able to shoot right through the
press break and get lay-ups. I think overall we did a really good job.  
  
Q. Coach, we asked your team about it a little bit, but you were up 20,
they were able to come back and get back in the game. How were you able to
pull away and get this win?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, thank goodness we were up 20, right? Good thing we weren't
just up 10 or 15. You know, I thought, this team has really good composure,
and I think when you have good leadership, when you have good seniors,
experience, been around the block a little bit, they can handle those
situations a little bit better. But I do think Tania, as you can tell, these
guys have so much faith in what she's saying to them and how she's bringing
them together, and she is very good at that. She's very calm, and when she
talks, you just believe her. I think that was a big part of it. But yeah, glad
we had a 20-point lead.  
  
Q. Megan is obviously a great offensive player, but I think she's kind
of an underrated defensive player. Can you talk about what she brings to your
team defensively?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I mean, we talk about every time you've got to finish the
defense with a rebound, and what did she have tonight, nine defensive
rebounds, three blocked shots? She changes people's shots inside there, and
so, yeah, she does a great job on both ends of the floor for us. Everybody
talks about her offense all the time because that's so remarkable.  
  
Q. You mentioned the seniors. They scored 15 points in the fourth
quarter. Could you just see it in their eyes that even Rutgers was making a
run, they weren't going to give it up?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, again, those guys have played so much basketball, and
they are confident in each other. We're confident in them. But it didn't
matter who was going to make those baskets. I believe Makenzie is going to be.
I believe Doyle is going to be. I believe in all of them, honestly, but it was
really nice to see Tania stick that three when we were only up three and then
make those free throws, as well.  
  
Q. They had a very strong press, and they like to press a lot. How were
you guys able to kind of defend every single time and then actually turn those
into points?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, it kind of hurt us when they took the press off, actually.
We were scoring some good points, they took it off and we kind of relaxed, and
when they put it back on, we weren't as focused to break it. But I thought the
first 25 minutes of this game, we broke that press really, really well and
made them pay for it, too. You know, just practice, right? You practice those
situations, and took advantage of it today.  
  
Q. You're facing Maryland tomorrow. It's going to be a great game. You
were able to defeat them earlier in the year, but of course they have more to
play for, you guys have more to play for. How are you going to be able to
defeat this team?  
LISA BLUDER: I don't know yet. You know, we're going to go back and get to
work on that. We have not looked ahead to Maryland or anything like that. You
know, we beat them by 13 on our home court, but it was a close game. It was
three points with two and a half to go, so we know it's going to be a battle.
They're better with Brianna Fraser back now. She was out for a little bit. But
they're going to be -- they're better with her back. It's going to come down
to -- I think in these type of situations in March, limit your mistakes, we've
got to knock down shots, and we've got to knock down threes, and that's really
what it comes down to this time of year is limiting those mistakes as much as
possible.  
  
Q. Do you think it's going to be the seniors that are going to be
leading the game or is it going to be more you or are you just going to let
them play?  
LISA BLUDER: Oh, I think they'll get them pumped up. They want to play -- this
team cares about each other so much. They don't want to let each other down,
and that's the best motivation that you can have. That's why we work hard in
practice every single day, because they don't want to let each other down, and
that's what's made them a really, really good basketball team. So in my mind
it's always your seniors. Your seniors set the tone for the team. Your seniors
lead. They kind of set the standards for the team, and I've got three really
good seniors.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Kim Barnes-Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36625)

### [Nicole Munger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36662)

### [Amy Dilk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36663)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 73, Michigan - 72.  
  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Were you guys there for the game? That was a pretty awesome
basketball game, wasn't it? Pretty exciting. I thought we should have won.
Great basketball game. Maryland is a great team. I think Michigan has a pretty
great team, as well. Really proud of the way we played. I can get really
emotional about it because I thought we had a chance to win the game. I have
some great seniors, and one of them is here right now in Nicole Munger and
Hallie Thome that really left it all on the court today, and our goal coming
into the year was to win a Big Ten championship, and we thought we put
ourselves in position to do that tonight and just kind of fell a little bit
short. But proud of our team, proud of the way we fought back when we got
down, and I think we play in one of the toughest leagues if not the toughest
league in the country, and that was on display tonight. Just a great
basketball game and proud of our team.  
  
Q. Amy, not the outcome you were expecting but can you tell me what it
was like coming back -- this is as close as you're going to get to your home
turf coming from Carmel. Can you tell me what that was like and being able to
put a career-high 11 assists up?  
AMY DILK: Yeah, coming back is always great. I've got a lot of people in the
stands rooting for Michigan. You know, the Big Ten Tournament, it's really
competitive, as you can tell. We had a great run, not what we wanted to finish
like, but for next year, you've got to remember this pain, and you've got to
learn from it, learn from your mistakes, and we've still got season left, so
we've still got to learn from this and grow.  
  
Q. How do you feel with the refs? There was probably a lot of fouls but
they never called them.  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Be politically correct.  
  
NICOLE MUNGER: That can be a tough one, but the refs are doing the best to
make the game as even as possible and to call the best game. They have a lot
of things going on in their mind, too, but being a captain we're allowed to
talk to the refs, so I always try to ask them in a polite way what was the
reasoning for the call and if it's for me I'll take note of that. They called
me for a block, which I thought it might have been a charge, but I just asked
why and they said I was a little late. Next time I try to get there a little
earlier. If it's for somebody else, one of my teammates, I'll let my teammates
know right away. I'll ask them, hey, what was that about, they say they're
moving or something, I'll just let them know that they got there too late or
they got their arm or something.  
  
Q. Not the outcome you wanted, Nicole, this is your senior year, what
legacy will you leave for your underclassmen?  
NICOLE MUNGER: First and foremost, I hope they know how proud of them I am. I
know Hallie is, as well, and Sam and Taylor who came in this year, all four of
us are just exceptionally proud of them, the way they fought, the way they
bought in, they believed. We made a bold statement coming out at the beginning
of the year saying we wanted to win this. And I think we put ourselves, like
Coach said, in a position to win it, and I think that's what's so tough. We
played a heck of a game today. We left everything out there and the ball
bounced the wrong way a couple times. That's nothing that they should be
ashamed of because we played our hardest.  
  
But moving forward I talked to each of them during the game and told them they
have one, two or three years left. They only have three more shots at this,
and to make each one count, and that it's limited, and that I see it now
because I'm older and I'm done playing in Big Ten basketball, but how fun it
is, and like Coach said, it's the best conference in the country, so just have
fun with it.  
  
Q. What have you seen from Amy all season long in terms of her maturity
and her growth?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Amy is an incredible, incredible player. I feel like I have
the best point guard in the country on my team, and I say that all the time.
And maybe there's some coaches out there that feel like theirs is the best,
but I feel like I have the best point guard in the country on my team, and
she's just a freshman. She controls the entire game. She has incredible
vision. She has incredible pace. She just sees things. She has incredible
length. She has great size. She can affect the game on the defensive end as
well as she can on the offensive end, and she has the ability to rebound the
basketball. I mean, she gets up and grabs the rim. That's how athletic she is.
So she's just a special player for us. I'm so happy to be her coach. She's a
competitor. She's a winner. And I'm just a proud coach, and I'm glad she's at
Michigan. I'm glad she left Carmel, Indiana, and came to the University of
Michigan because she's certainly a difference maker for us.  
  
Q. What do you think you can do better for next year?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Hmm, well, to get a shot with 10 seconds left, I think we
have got to get a shot, so that will be something we work on, making sure we
try to get a shot and have the confidence to take the shot when the game is on
the line. And just continuing -- each individual player just continuing to try
to get better.  
  
Q. What will you take away from this game?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I probably won't sleep for like three days. It's going to be
horrible. But just really proud of the effort of our team.  
  
Q. The game kept going back and forth, and I could see you pacing on the
sideline. You called a big timeout with 29 seconds left and you came out of
that timeout and executed. What was the mentality going into that play?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: I thought we did a tremendous job of executing in the fourth
quarter all the way down the stretch. I mean, we outscored them 16-6 until
those two free throws at the end. So we were really confident in our offense.
We were really executing. Nicole Munger was hitting big shots and we were
going inside and out, and I thought that our kids were locked in. We've been
in this position a lot of times this year, so we really felt confident that we
were going to be on the winning end of it coming out tonight.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

### [Tamara Farquhar](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36641)

### [Ae'Rianna Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36611)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Rutgers, 64 - Purdue, 49  
  
SHARON VERSYP: I was just really proud of our kids this week, just really had
a clean slate, came in, regrouped, really had a great postseason run, and it
was nice to -- they just had a different sense about them, togetherness,
energy, communication. It was good to have a clean slate. Just really proud of
how hard we played the entire time. These two just were amazing the entire
tournament, defensively, offensively, rebounding. They stepped up for their
team three straight games they delivered. So it's just nice that these two
obviously will be back next year.  
  
Q. When they hit the three-pointer at the end of the third quarter, how
deflating was that and how tough was that to overcome in the fourth quarter?  
AE'RIANNA HARRIS: More of an energy thing, us trying to maintain our energy
and then moving on from it, executing offense, just going forward.  
  
TAMARA FARQUHAR: Well, we knew that she was a shooter, we just needed to be
more focused, and I mean, it obviously gave them the momentum to get into the
fourth quarter.  
  
Q. Ae'Rianna, how difficult was the press that Rutgers ran?  
AE'RIANNA HARRIS: They were just intense. They got after it every second. We
knew it was coming. They just played really hard.  
  
Q. Tamara, obviously you had a tough task to try to play five games in
five days to win the championship. What has to happen next year so you're not
in this position so you get a more favorable situation to be in when you get
to this tournament?  
TAMARA FARQUHAR: Well, definitely not being an 11 seed. I think that we're
definitely way better than that, and we should have taken care of certain
games, and we just lacked focus. So just being mindful of what we went through
this year and making sure that we remember it next year and do better.  
  
Q. Ae'Rianna, how do you build on the kind of year that you had
individually and translate it into a better year for the team next season?  
AE'RIANNA HARRIS: I mean, my year is because of the team. I can't score points
if they don't give me the ball. Defense comes to all of us, but I've said it
before, it's a decision you make. I feel like I made that decision, my team
has made that decision. So just moving forward, taking that next step, going
harder, getting in the gym, little stuff.  
  
Q. Sharon, just with the game, the three-pointer kind of seemed to
change momentum. Was it hard to get a little more energy out of your club in
that fourth quarter?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, you know, we're on our third game, and they're on their
first if we both played the same -- just one game like we did at Rutgers,
obviously you have a little bit more legs that fourth quarter. Just like us,
when we stole the ball against Illinois the other day and were able to score,
it does, it's a momentum change. You know, it was one point, and then it's
four points, and then all of a sudden we miss some shots because we're short
and we weren't able to get back on defense. KT did, but we didn't get that
second person back. And they can score in bunches, especially in transition.
But that was obviously a changer.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about how this was their first game but this
was your third game. Do you think that really helped them out, especially when
they were kind of switching five in, five out pretty much the whole first
half?  
SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, that's what they do all year, so if both teams are fresh,
obviously you get fresher legs, you're going to make lay-ups that we missed,
make a few more shots in transition. You know, you want to be able to do that,
make those shots in transition and lay-ups and stuff, so hopefully they'll
take the pressure off a little bit. But they do a great job. They move bodies
in and out. But I thought we handled it fairly well, but when we attacked, we
needed to finish, and that's when we didn't finish, and that's when we got
beat a little bit.  
  
Q. You've got such a talented young core. It seems like the only thing
missing is the depth this year. How do you feel about that going forward?  
SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, thank you for noticing that. It's kind of like we're kind
of that one or two kids short with the depth, with some losses from last year.
The biggest thing right now is now we'll have two seniors that will have
better leadership. We really have three kids coming in next year, and we're
adding two. We're going to all these babies that came off the bench, they
obviously now have gone through it, and you don't know what you don't know
until you experience it, so I feel really good with our core and our
leadership has to step up even more. So actually I'm pretty excited with
returning everybody and adding three to five people.  
  
Q. Coach, neither team really shot particularly well from three-point
range, and I know you guys were kind of forcing some shots at the end, just
trying to get back in the game. As far as you guys shooting 4 for 23, did you
think that was more of just your defense or you guys were just taking
difficult shots?  
SHARON VERSYP: We had no legs. I mean, Karissa and 'Nique only shot 4 for 20,
5 for 24 or -- when they struggle shooting, we struggle. It was more by that
fourth quarter and stuff, we were short all the time, and that's just legs,
and then it kind of gets in your head.  
  
Q. What has to happen to make sure you're not in this position as far as
being an 11 seed or being forced to play five games in five days to win a
championship next season?  
SHARON VERSYP: Pretty much echo what Ae'Rianna said, everything that she said,
and then in February we should be playing and having the togetherness like we
had. But when you have six new ones, they don't get it. At least we came
together and finished strong. So I'm happy about that, but now we can't be --
next year can't be a young and immature team. We'll be a lot more mature next
year.

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Jonathan Tsipis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32631)

### [Kelly Karlis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36595)

### [Marsha Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32633)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan - 73, Wisconsin - 65 (2OT)  
  
JONATHAN TSIPIS: Obviously the last game of the season is always the hardest
when you know you have a team that is playing its best basketball and being
led by two seniors seated next to me. You know, in the last three days they've
played 38, 38, and then Kelly played almost 48 today, Marsha played 45. They
gave us everything they had, and again, we knew coming in -- this is our sixth
game in 11 days. We didn't share that with the team. We hoped they didn't do
that math. But it's pretty remarkable on this run we've had and history has
been made. We're the first obviously 13th seed to win a game. We win two
games, and we have opportunities at the end of regulation and at the end of
the first overtime to win the game. But I couldn't be more proud as a coach,
not just for this push, for what these two seniors have meant to our program,
as we're trying to move Wisconsin women's basketball forward. And as I told
them in the locker room, how proud I am of them, I don't have words to make
this hurt go away. But when you invest as these two have, it's going to hurt
because they gave everything they had. And as a coach, I love them for that. I
love them for how they've grown in their time, whether it's two years or four
years between Kelly and Marsha, and again, moving forward, they've helped our
program take steps, and I wanted to make sure our underclassmen know how
important that is as we're building the program. The game itself, again, back
and forth. You see how many lead changes, how many times it's tied. You know,
it never came down to one play. But I can just tell you that I felt like our
team never thought about, hey, we've played two games. We just left it on the
court, and the one thing I had told them is your heart doesn't get tired, and
I think these guys played with tremendous heart, and I couldn't be more proud
to be their head coach.  
  
Q. (Inaudible.)  
KELLY KARLIS: Our strength coach did a great job of getting us ready to play
each game. It was pretty tiring today going into the third game, especially
being so old, know what I'm saying? But yeah, it was definitely tiring, but
it's a big mental game for me, and I know for my teammates, as well. We all
knew we could push through it and get to those last few seconds.  
  
Q. What has this season meant to you and the underclassmen? What legacy
will you leave them?  
MARSHA HOWARD: They were already telling me the legacy that I left for them as
I was walking off the court or as we entered the locker room. But proud to say
that I was a part of a group that was able to expand our game to the third
round of the Big Ten Tournament, and to leave behind my underclassmen, the
will and the fight to power -- to power through, just knowing that nothing is
ever over. You can always overcome obstacles and to keep fighting until the
clock says zero.  
  
Q. When you maybe think back bigger picture, what are some of the
developments of the growth you think from your returning group that are going
to be translatable do you think from these three days or even better six games
in 11 days? What are some of the things maybe into next year that are going to
be translatable in terms of growth and progress?  
JONATHAN TSIPIS: Well, I think first, I think from day one that I've had --
been blessed to have the opportunity to be the head coach at Wisconsin with
that daily improvement, not just as a basketball player, but I've been
entrusted by parents to help watch a young woman develop, and that's obviously
on the basketball court, it's usually the first -- how that starts, but again,
I think you look and see what this season, what we were able to do from a
basketball program, from our non-conference success, to start 6-0, to be 9-3
in the non-conference, the ups and downs. Obviously I think the Big Ten is as
strong, at least in my three years, as it's ever been. I think we were trying
to count -- almost every team in the league beat a ranked team. But I think
understanding there's always work to do. And again, five days ago we're in Ann
Arbor and we've just lost to Rutgers handily, and we are down 24 in the third
quarter. And I think in today's day and age, that could have been, oh, we'll
just go play in the Big Ten Tournament and spring break is coming up, and our
team wouldn't do that. I think that's the translatable skill. There's always
more work to do. You need to enjoy the moment. You need to understand the
expectation of being more than just a basketball player at Wisconsin. In the
last two semesters, our kids have had the highest GPA last spring ever
recorded by women's basketball, and then went above and beyond that in the
fall. They're active in the community, and they're just great people. And to
have -- as basketball players, to have the memories that young women look up
to them and to be able to come to our games or come to our practice or
interact with them puts our women's basketball as a whole in a better place. I
know we as coaches, everything -- not everything, a lot of things look at the
final record. We did a lot of things that is better, and it's continuing to
grow. But that group, what happened these last three days I think showed what
they've done all year, and again, I think the underclassmen have to understand
how hard that is when you've done things that no program has done from that
seed spot and just the three-day experience. If you'd have told me in the
middle of the third quarter last Sunday, hey, you'll be playing -- you'll have
two shots at it to go to the semifinals of the Big Ten Tournament, I would
have taken that right there and then. But it's a credit to our kids and coming
back on Monday and practicing and getting ready, and I hope with this group
that is about to become seniors, with Courtney Frederickson, who's been out
with an injury, and Abby and Suzanne and Kendra, that was the first group that
came in when I became the head coach, and now as we've added kids on, to
understand the importance and the pride you have to wear to represent the
Wisconsin uniform.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the tournament overall, you guys came in and
played Penn State pretty tough and then you played a pretty decent Ohio State
team, lost to Michigan. Can you talk about what it means to come in as a 13th
seed and make it almost to the semifinals at the Big Ten Tournament?  
JONATHAN TSIPIS: Yeah, I think the understanding is in the Big Ten, if you
start looking and trying to say, hey, I'm going to play against this program,
you're going to be in trouble. And again, the games did not go the way we
would have liked against Penn State the first two times. I thought our kids
put that behind them. Yesterday we didn't really care who believed that we
could win, and I think at halftime there were a lot of people saying it's
going to play its course. And again, I think our kids understand when we try
to emphasize the things they're doing well, the things that will put them in
position to be successful, and they gain great confidence from that, and
that's what put us in a position today to have an opportunity to win. There's
a lot of working to have young women be better basketball players, better
students. I think the encompassing thing I can tell you is my No. 1 job is
making sure they're confident. And I think that's something that our world
needs for young girls but also at college age when they're developing that
because then they're going to be confident in whatever they do when they get
out of college. I think that confidence at halftime yesterday -- I walked in
and I had a group that knew we had not done things the way we were capable of,
and they came out and fought. Even today when Michigan made the run at 5 and
I've got kids that have played a lot of minutes, that's mental toughness, and
I think those two things go hand in hand to give you an opportunity to be
successful.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about how your team has grown and the
leadership, but how would you describe the senior leadership, especially
coming into the Big Ten Tournament where you were a lower seed in every
game?  
JONATHAN TSIPIS: Yeah, you know, one of the examples I used, so our
underclassmen understood, you're not titled to any of this. You're not
entitled to have a shot every time. Where we were seeded is obviously how our
regular season played out. But to even be here and be a part of it -- Marsha
Howard was not on the bench her freshman year at Wisconsin for the Big Ten
Tournament. We have four young women who are injured, and they're not able to
be here. And I just think that they had to understand that journey. And to get
ready -- and again, we put a bracket up, not that I'm making life-altering
statements on when you enter tournaments, a lot of people do that, but you
know what, let's go out and be as prepared as we can for Penn State, and we'll
go from there. Obviously when you've lost to a team twice as a coach, it's my
job to make sure they can see how they can be successful against a team. But I
thought they came in and they played -- as a coach, you hope at this time of
year you're playing your best basketball, and a week ago Thursday and a week
ago Sunday, we weren't. But they didn't allow that to dictate for them to
grow. Obviously to win the game on Wednesday against Penn State, I thought
that was probably one of our best starts in all Big Ten games. Obviously we
had to come from behind yesterday. That speaks to the confidence I think
they've gained, and then being right there, and obviously taking a Michigan
team that's playing as well as anybody in the league over the last 10 games
and scratch and claw and try to figure out a way to win. Again, not trying to
get in front of anybody, too far in front. You play one game, we use the
phrase one plus, and that's what Kelly and Marsha and Lexy Richardson had
going into the tournament. They had one, plus a chance to gain another one.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Teri Moren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27752)

### [Grace Berger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36632)

### [Ali Patberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36606)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Iowa - 70, Indiana - 61  
  
TERI MOREN: Well, really loved our effort tonight. Loved how we battled back
from an earlier deficit. Struggled tonight from the outside. We had four
starters go 6 for 28 from the field. The two young ladies next to me really
kept us in the game offensively. I thought Linsey Marchese was great in the
low blocks, especially defensively against Megan. I thought she did a really
nice job overall. But we're disappointed. We're disappointed because, like I
said, we got the lead and then couldn't build on it, got some good shots. They
went to the old triangle-and-two, had some open looks that just didn't go down
for us. Unfortunately wish we could have shot it better. Wish Jaelynn Penn
could have shot it a little better tonight. I think maybe the outcome could
have been a little bit different for us. But really proud of our group.  
  
Q. Grace, your mid-range shot has kind of been a strong suit of your
game, but today you were really able to get into the paint and pull up. What
was working for you?  
GRACE BERGER: I mean, I knew my shot felt good in warm-ups, and I got in and
hit a few, so I was just pretty confident, I guess, in that first quarter.  
  
Q. You guys have given pretty good effort since that Northwestern game.
Do you feel like you're playing the right way at this time of year?  
ALI PATBERG: Yeah, after that Northwestern game, our team was pretty
disappointed in each other just because we know that's not how Coach wants us
to play. That's not how we're supposed to play and represent our school and
our program. I think since that game, like you said, we've given it all. We've
given everything we've had out there, and we've tried to execute the game plan
that the coaches give us. I think that's how they want us to play, and I think
that's how we'll continue to play.  
  
Q. Ali, Gustafson is obviously a great player offensively. How hard is
it to get out to shooters with how much attention you have to give her on the
inside?  
ALI PATBERG: Yeah, she's an amazing player, and our game plan was to make it
tough for her, to clog the lane, kind of take passing angles away into the
post. And like Coach said, Linsey was awesome. She did a great job. I think
she left it all out there for our team. And you know, their guards, they're
great guards, and they hit shots tonight. It's a credit to them.  
  
Q. Ali, you guys forced a lot of turnovers there in the first half, and
in the second half they were able to control the ball a little bit more. Did
they change anything offensively in the second half that made it a little bit
harder to create pressure or take the ball away?  
ALI PATBERG: Yeah, I think they hit shots in the second half. We were really
active in the first half and we got steals. But I still think we made it
pretty difficult to get the ball in the second half, as well.  
  
Q. Grace, in a game where Jaelynn kind of struggled to shoot the ball at
the beginning, when you came in did you take it upon yourself to slot into her
role and try to get some buckets for your team?  
GRACE BERGER: I mean, I wouldn't say I was trying to fill any roles. I was
just getting open shots and my teammates and coaches were encouraging me to
shoot it, so I was shooting it with confidence.  
  
Q. The team struggled offensively in the first quarter against their
zone defense. What made theirs tougher than some you've seen throughout the
season?  
ALI PATBERG: I thought in the first half -- we came in at half, and Coach said
the ball was sticking. I didn't think we were moving it as well. Personally I
wasn't getting us into our offenses as quick as I thought I could have, and
you know, I thought the middle was open. I thought once we got the ball to the
middle we started to create things. Brenna hit a couple of shots. Grace got in
there, got some passes out. So I think it was more us offensively in the first
half not executing as well as we wanted to.  
  
Q. Obviously you've been talking about this for a while now. You guys
have been beating up on each other in the Big Ten. To get one win in the Big
Ten Tournament and to battle a team like this, do you feel like you've put
together enough resume to --  
TERI MOREN: Oh, yeah, without question. It's just not in the Big Ten play. Our
non-conference schedule was extremely difficult, and I think that's one of the
things that the committee wants you to do. They want you to go out and play
people and they want you to beat people, and we've proven that we can beat
people, whether it's at home or whether it's on the road, like the road win at
UCLA. But then the Big Ten, just the parity, night in and night out. It's
always interesting to look up when they'd flash your resume across the TV, and
you see Big Ten teams that are bad losses, and I think that that is simply
because of the RPI. But I don't know if you ask any Big Ten coach if we think
a loss to another Big Ten team is a bad loss. It's just that good of a
conference.  
  
Q. Jaelynn got off to a poor start shooting, but what does it say about
her and her attitude that she came in and hit two big shots in the fourth
quarter?  
TERI MOREN: That she wasn't going to quit shooting, which is good, which is
what any great shooter does. They have a short memory. But we needed her in
that first three quarters to hit some shots for us, and I think, like I said,
the outcome I think probably could have been a little bit different for us. So
I think it was a frustrating night for Jaelynn, even though she had a couple
of those late at that point. Like I said, wishful thinking, but I wish she
could have hit a few of those earlier.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the way Ali Patberg played yesterday and today?  
TERI MOREN: Well, she's pretty special. Obviously she's new to the Big Ten and
a lot of the fans from the Big Ten haven't had the opportunity to watch her,
this just being her first year for us. But I think everybody walks away with
an appreciation of how she plays the game, how she carries herself, how she
handles herself, how she handles herself with her team. But her ability to
score it, her ability to facilitate, the energy that she plays with, this is a
kid that is very passionate about the game. But I thought Ali, AP, was really,
really good the last two days. But it's not anything -- none of us are
surprised by it. That's how Ali Patberg plays.  
  
Q. What are some of the challenges of facing a player like Megan twice
in such a relatively short span? And would you say it was, I guess, more or
less challenging the second time around?  
TERI MOREN: She's challenging, period. You can play her five times, 10 times,
it doesn't matter. She's going to be a challenge. She's not just a Big Ten
Player of the Year, I think she's nationally one of the very best post players
right now in the country. But as Ali said and I said in my opening statement,
I thought Marchese did a great job. She goes to the free-throw line, went and
goes eight for nine, I think. And has, again, 30, but you think about those
points that don't come from the free-throw line, that's a pretty good night
defensively on her. And I thought Linsey -- you know what, there's no recipe.
I've said that. What we try to do was just make it difficult. We tried to dig
as much as we could just to create some activity every time she caught it we
wanted a second defender to be there. But then you get -- you worry about,
again, if you don't recover quick enough, you're going to leave some of their
terrific shooters on the outside open. But Megan is a terrific player, and
she's going to go off and hopefully I'm certain have a great professional
career, wherever she ends up.  
  
Q. How big was Grace coming off the bench and kind of providing a spark
for you guys, especially early?  
TERI MOREN: Sure, and on a night that JP was struggling, she was huge. I
thought in the second half particularly for Grace, she might not admit this,
but I think she started getting a little tired. Her shot was pretty flat going
down the stretch there. I think it really just came down to her being
fatigued. She doesn't normally play that many minutes for that long of a
stretch. Now, she plays minutes for us, as you all know, but the stretches
that she was playing for us and having to produce some shots for us, that's a
little bit longer than she's used to.  
  
Q. You talked about Grace maybe being fatigued. From playing yesterday,
did the team look fatigued at all?  
TERI MOREN: No, I think, like I said, I loved our effort. Again, that's a --
what are they, top 10, 11 in the country, and you're behind and then you catch
up and you tie it up and then you go up. So there's no time right now to be
fatigued. We were great today at our shootaround. I thought we had a lot of
energy. I know that just in checking in with our kids, they felt really good
physically. So I don't -- fatigue is not -- it's only the second day, so that
didn't play a part in it. What played a part in it was the fact that we just
couldn't hit shots. I don't think that that had anything to do with fatigue,
though, at least for Jaelynn and Brenna Wise. Brenna didn't shoot it as well
as she has been, either.  
  
Q. You mentioned the good play on defense of Linsey Marchese. She played
27 minutes in this game, only three fouls. What have you seen in the
development of her game recently that you can keep her on the court longer and
she stays out of foul trouble?  
TERI MOREN: I just think her confidence. It started, I think, with Iowa, the
big win at home when we asked her to help Kym, help us guard Megan, and I
think she just got -- gained some confidence. And then she's been practicing
better. She's been practicing more confident, and now we're seeing sort of the
fruits of her labor. She's stayed after it, and her attitude has been great,
and she had another task against Purdue to help us guard Harris, and I
thought, again, she did a great job.  
  
And so just really pleased with the amount of work that she has put in. But
her improvement has really been great down the stretch here for us.  
  
Q. Every time you guys got within a few points or took the lead, it
seems like Iowa would hit a big shot. How does that sort of affect the
mentality of the team?  
TERI MOREN: Well, it stinks. You know, you get the one-point lead and then you
give up an open three. And our intentions were in the right place, right. We
knew that the key for them stopping them starts with how you're going to guard
Megan. And so we were, we were risking it all to have it all tonight, and we
were going to try to clog it up as much as we could. But what you risk with
that is, again, not getting out to those shooters. And I don't know if it was
Meyers or it was Davis, she stuck that three on us when we went up by one, and
that does, that deflates you a little bit because now you get the crowd behind
you, you feel like you've got some energy, and like I said, Brenna Wise, it
was her kid that stuck the three. Her intentions were right where they needed
to be, she just couldn't climb out fast enough in order to get out there and
contest that shot.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

### [Jenna Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36618)

### [Shay Colley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34715)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 71, Michigan State - 55.  
  
SUZY MERCHANT: I just want to know if we can play that third quarter over.
Just give Maryland credit. I thought they just definitely had a little more
edge to them. I thought the first time we played them and being at our place,
I thought we definitely had that kind of edge to us, and give them a lot of
credit. I definitely thought that they were consistent in the way they
attacked us. It just seemed like there were times when we fought back so hard,
I loved our fight in the second quarter. We came out, we scored that quick
bucket. It was a one-point game, and then they just kind of got away from us
and a lot of late clock situations that could break a back, so I felt like
they hit a shot or they got a rebound at that time or we ended up with a foul
instead of a stop when it was 3, 2, 1, that kind of thing. They did a great
job executing. Give them certainly a lot of credit. It's hard to win games
when -- collectively we were 29 percent from the field and 22 from the arc. So
that's not typical of how we normally play. But give them credit, too. I
thought they were exceptional today, especially on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Jenna, could you talk a little bit about you got off to a great start
and then it seemed like they kind of focused on you a little bit after
halftime. You guys made that run in the second quarter. Do you think that the
emphasis of the third quarter was mainly to kind of slow you down a little bit
and force you guys to shoot from the perimeter more?  
JENNA ALLEN: Probably. I thought my teammates did a good job of giving me the
ball in the first half. I got hot, and I thought they really did a great job
of them putting me in positions to be successful, the coaching staff.
Probably, but honestly, I felt like our defense in the third quarter is what
really had us struggling.  
  
Q. Shay, you guys have played Maryland as good as anybody has in the Big
Ten through basically almost seven full quarters. What's your takeaway as a
veteran player in the third, just maybe when -- it snowballed on you, and just
from an energy perspective, just feeling it in the arena, just wasn't the same
from you guys, as you reflect on that?  
SHAY COLLEY: Yeah, you know, coming out in the third quarter, like Coach said,
that first bucket kind of got us going, then after that, we dropped from
there, and I think we need to come together as a team to get that confidence
back and regroup and know that we can go on a run just like they did.  
  
Q. I know you probably don't want to talk about that third, but it's
rare that you see one team shoot 81 percent and another team shoot less than
13 --  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, it's hard to predict that, yeah. We've had a few
instances at times this year where that's happened, and I think what hurts us
a little bit on our team is collectively we have a night -- like with four
kids in double figures. The go-to guy, I guess, had that. I thought Maryland
has that in the Charles kid and they have some other people, too, but you can
tell when the game is on the line, that kid wants the ball in her hands and
single-handedly can take a game over. We didn't have that this year. We don't
have that this year. So on one hand I thought it made us difficult to guard
when everybody collectively is part of it, but when things kind of falter a
little bit, who do you look to. We needed Taryn today. She was 1 for 8 today,
1 for 7 from the arc. She needs to shoot the ball better for us. And then our
bench was something that surprised me, too, because those are veteran kids.
They've contributed, Sid, Drek, Nia Hollie, those three in particular played
minutes this year, been part of the rotation, and some have even started on
and off throughout the year. I felt like if we could just get a little bit
more off our bench when those other kids were struggling a little bit, it
might have gotten us going. But give Maryland credit. It's hard to predict
that. I don't know. I mean, it's the same offense. It's the same kids that cut
it to the four-point game, and it was a -- what, it started the third quarter
and we scored -- it was our ball, we scored, and it was a one-point game. Then
all of a sudden it was like, crash. We didn't change much what we were doing.
But give them credit; I thought they had a little more fire in them. I thought
those late clock situations, they ended up hitting those shots or getting a
foul call, and it just kind of broke our back, our spirit a little bit.  
  
Q. Over the season you've had a couple games that you've had the third
quarter slump. How are you going to manage to fix it for the next season?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, for the NCAA Tournament. That's what's the next season.
Obviously we've got to get to that. I mean, some of it is just leadership and
toughness, to be honest. I think we just have to collectively -- when we're
clicking on all cylinders, we're certainly a talented team. I think what hurts
us is the inconsistency night in and night out on the offensive end, which
obviously from my team affects our ability to defend.  
  
So how do you fix it? I think you've just got to put yourselves in competitive
situations, winners, losers. I think you've got to put yourself when you're
down six, down ten, you've got to make a run, that kind of stuff in practice
and just keep simulating where things aren't going your way and you've got to
keep fighting your way back and fighting your way out of it.  
  
Q. You had a couple players struggling shooting. You had Sidney and
Taryn struggling to get things going. Do you think it was more your offensive
struggles or Maryland playing good defense?  
SUZY MERCHANT: I don't know, probably both. I think because I watched a few
shots that were wide open. Sid had -- I know Sid had a few, and I know Taryn
had a few. I also know there were some that were probably heavily guarded, as
well. I think that was part of it, and I don't think Shay was herself, either.
She got hit pretty hard and her tailbone was really sore playing today, so I
don't think she was as good as she could have been today just due to that. But
in terms of Taryn, I mean, Taryn for five or six games prior to this was
struggling, too, so I don't think it was -- I think it was just a little bit
more -- she needs to toe up to the line a little bit more. She takes too deep
a shot all the time, and that can't be something we do every shot. She's got
to -- I was talking to her a little bit about that, get one more step in,
especially like Northwestern, I thought that helped her a little bit. She
scored the ball better, instead of shooting a 26, 28, 30-footer when you don't
need to, you're open at the three-point line. For her sometimes she needs to
get a little more disciplined in that. With Sid, I'm not sure what goes on
sometimes. I thought she had some nice turnaround jump shot looks that just
didn't fall. She had a couple nice jumpers that normally she hits. Drekia
didn't score the ball like she can. Nia Hollie is kind of more of a hustle guy
that sometimes you're just not sure what you're going to get out of her, but I
thought she had some good looks and played hard, and the ball just didn't go
in.  
  
Q. You mentioned that you thought Maryland maybe had the edge this game
whereas earlier in the season you guys had that. What growth from their team
have you seen specifically or what were they doing particularly well today?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, I think moving the Charles kid around a little bit, she
started today at the 4. That's a tough match-up. She's a tough match-up at the
3, too. But when we played them the first time, she definitely played mostly
3. Her pull-up jumper is as good as anybody. It's a really hard thing to get
to, and she's powerful on the drive. I think they're pressing a little bit
more, changing their defenses up, that kind of thing. So I thought they had a
little bit of that going for them, and I think that helped them some. I'm
trying to think of what else I saw. I think they played more downhill, I
guess. When we played them the first time we did a good job of cutting off
their drives from the high post, and today we didn't do a good job. I think
their gift is they can really get downhill at the rails. And then you put
Charles in there, who you can move around a little bit. Then you gotta worry
about Mikesell who is coming off double stag after double stag and she's a
quick shooter. So they have really nice pieces around them. There's no
question. I thought they played a little harder, too, quite frankly, from the
first time we played them to now. They definitely had a different mentality.
I'm sure they were mad we beat them the first time and disappointed in how
they played and wanted to prove something. But they were edgier for sure, and
I think attacking the basket in the offensive rebounds were the two things
that we noticed the most in this game compared to the last game.  
  
Q. You mentioned something before the NCAA Tournament, fixing is
something intangible, not like you're working on a specific shot. How much
does that have to come from veterans on the team and people who have been in
the tournament before?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, I mean, definitely it has to come from them for sure. I
think Jenna is our only senior, so I thought she was really good today. I
thought she played hard, 19.7 rebounds. She got to the free-throw line. We
just need more kids to get in her camp a little bit. Even our juniors and
sophomores, who have been here, or redshirt sophomores, those kids just need
to be better, quite frankly. I thought if you look at our season, probably the
most consistent kid we've had on our team all year long in terms of night in
and night out you know what you're going to get has been our freshman Nia
Clouden who made the (Big Ten) all-freshman team. Does she make mistakes? Yes.
Does she struggle at different things? For sure. But kind of night-in and
night-out, she plays the same way. She hasn't had too many nights where she's
kind of been "0 for." I think she's had one bad game out of 18, which is
pretty impressive when you're playing the point guard position in this league.
She's an exciting kid to kind of look forward to. But you're right, postseason
is veterans, and we didn't really get enough of our veterans to kind of step
up and answer the call today, but that's something we can learn from and get
better and move forward for the next game and the next postseason, I guess,
the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. After today's performance, do you feel that the team can play at a
higher level in the NCAA Tournament?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, yeah, I think so. That's what your goal is. I know we've
seen it before. To me we've demonstrated the ability to do it. There's no
question about it. We've just got to kind of continue to move forward, get a
little bit of a rest here, give our kids a chance to kind of mentally get
rested, physically get rested and then just go back to work next week and
start preparing for what may come and continue to keep making sure we're in
shape, we take care of our injuries. I'm playing two kids with torn meniscus
and they're out there hobbling around trying to play and all kinds of things,
just like everybody else has their issues.  
  
To me this time is about refresh, regroup, get them healthy, and then roll up
our sleeves and what can we do about that third quarter, what can we do about
that inconsistency at times. We can really catch fire any time. I really felt
we were going to perform better today. I felt good about this game. I felt our
kids were really mentally focused. And I loved our fight, and we got right
back where we needed to be. But then all of a sudden -- it's hard for me to
predict what happens. I don't know. And it's happened to us a few times this
year, three or four times, and it's always a quarter, and it's -- we got to 10
points this time. Normally we only get to six. I guess we had four more points
in this quarter than we normally do, which I know sounds pathetic. But we're a
better team than that, and that's where our leaders and toughness have to come
out for sure.  
  
Q. How much do you feel fatigue may have factored in from last night's
game and that great first half --  
SUZY MERCHANT: I don't know, these are 18 to 22 year old kids. I don't ever
remember being tired at game time, practice. That was never a reason for me. I
don't know, maybe it is for them now. I know we're banged up a little bit and
they're a different mentality sometimes, these kids. But it's game time. You
have to step up. I thought we had some good minutes and some good quarters. We
just didn't play four quarters, and against Maryland you've got to play four
good quarters. And when we did, the last time we played them, we beat them. We
did that against Oregon, we did it against Iowa. We just haven't always done
it night in and night out. We've got to look at that a little more. We've
tried. We've tried to predict it, called timeouts and kind of tried to regroup
them a little bit. But if you keep getting the same results, we've got to
figure out what it is that we can do to manage that storm a little bit better,
I think, so that we can stay in the game and make sure we're in firing
distance.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Brenda Frese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15652)

### [Stephanie Jones](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36619)

### [Taylor Mikesell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36620)

### [Kaila Charles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32703)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Maryland - 71, Michigan State - 55  
  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, I thought it was a tough, hard-fought win for us
against a really good Michigan State team. Like you see during tournament
time, I thought our vets were tremendous at understanding, knowing the
atmosphere without a shootaround being from an early tip. I thought they came
out ready to play. Just love our response. Obviously at halftime, specifically
with Kaila, I thought wasn't able to kind of work through some things in the
first half, but I thought she just kept her poise and composure, made big play
after big play to help us separate. I thought Bri Fraser showed an enormous
amount of toughness for us, as well. For us it's survive and advance, and
we're excited about the 40-minute effort we put together.  
  
Q. Stephanie, can you talk a little bit about was there a concerted
effort after halftime to make sure that Jenna Allen was not going to have the
type of (second) half she had in the first half? And then if you wouldn't
mind, talk about the defensive effort holding Michigan State to only 13
percent shooting in that third quarter.  
STEPHANIE JONES: Like going into the game, we knew that her being a senior
leader that she was like a big part of their team, and like getting their
energy, so we knew that if we just kept her out of the game, kept her rhythm
off that they would be off, too, and I think that also goes into keeping them
down to 13 percent, like you said, in that third quarter, because I think we
did a great job of really locking in and making sure that we got stops in
order to get some separation.  
  
Q. Kaila, what did you see at the end there when they went on the 12-1
run at the end of the half? Was it defensive breakdowns on your part or was it
more Allen getting hot?  
KAILA CHARLES: They're a great team, but I think most of it was just us having
defensive breakdowns. We kind of went away from what we were doing in the
first quarter, and Coach challenged us in the locker room to just lock in and
focus on our defense and it will eventually lead to our offense. It was just
basically us not paying attention to the little things. We knew she was a
shooter but we would leave her open so we had to just lock in on the scout and
make sure we were doing what we were supposed to do.  
  
Q. Kaila, you've been through it before, having the double bye, a team
coming in that's already played. What do you make of maybe the first half you
guys played, how that may have factored in, not having a shootaround and
looking so different in the third quarter, how that may have factored in?  
KAILA CHARLES: The double bye is definitely helpful in terms of rest, but
being able to play a game the day before gets you in the rhythm, so we knew
that we had to lock in, because they already had that rhythm. They played
yesterday, and they knew -- they went through just the lull of not playing for
a while. What we notice is once we started playing in the first half and we
were a little slow, we locked in the second half and were able to create that
separation.  
  
Q. Taylor, were you able to get your shots up this morning with no
shootaround, and what was the first experience like playing in the tournament
for the first time?  
TAYLOR MIKESELL: No, I was not, but obviously it was an early tip. But first
experience was good. You don't really know what to expect besides what
everybody was telling me, how it's a grind. Hopefully we play three games back
to back. We responded well in the third quarter, we started getting more into
our transition game, and that ultimately gave us a little bit of separation
and gave us that lead that we needed at the end.  
  
Q. Taylor, just from the standpoint of the way that the game, the ebbs
and flows in the first half, if you look at the score sheet, we're talking
about one time you go on a 6-0 run, 7-0 run, they come back and do the same
thing. How do you explain how that happened in tournament play in the first
half, the way it flowed?  
TAYLOR MIKESELL: I mean, that's just the way the basketball goes sometimes. We
started clicking a little bit in the first quarter, and then we locked out a
little bit, like Kaila was saying, with our personnel, and they started going
on a run, so coming into halftime we had to lock back in with who our shooters
were and we had to get back to our own, the way we wanted to play.  
  
Q. Coach, you're a veteran at the double bye, but I don't know if you've
ever had or not had a shootaround before. What's key that you've noticed over
your time as a coach to handling this well and to come out in a better rhythm?
It wouldn't be the first time a team lost basically being one-and-done. What's
key from a team perspective to handle this facing a team that's already played
in a different sort of rhythm?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, we talked about it, you know, because we have
been in those situations, and with an early tip, being ready to go, it starts
in your preparation. Obviously our warmup, we wanted it to be very hard, so
once the ball was tipped we had the energy and the aggressiveness to be able
to go. I thought we responded well in parts of that in the first quarter.
Obviously the second quarter I thought got away from us a little bit. But I do
think they responded well, being ready to go.  
  
Q. Brenda, it looked like your game plan to start was to pound, pound,
pound Michigan State and make them guard your inside game. Was that it, and
was your goal to overwhelm the inside game?  
BRENDA FRESE: Yeah, you know, we thought we did have an advantage obviously
with Kaila and Steph in there, some of those match-ups were match-ups that we
really wanted to be able to go to, and then I think our mentality was to be on
the glass. That was an area that they exposed us the first time we played. So
definitely one that -- wanting to be aggressive on the glass.  
  
Q. That loss to Michigan State this season was obviously a big turning
point for you guys. How much was that a motivation?  
BRENDA FRESE: You know, they might have seen a few clips from the first time.
What I love about this team is yesterday this is who they wanted to play, and
so again, they're just extremely competitive when they learn lessons. They
take those lessons and want to get better, and I thought they were able to do
that today.  
  
Q. Which is more impressive, holding them to 13 percent shooting in the
third quarter or you shooting 81 plus?  
BRENDA FRESE: I'll take them both. You know, definitely for us, I would say
our defense, to hold a team so talented like Michigan State defensively I
think is huge. Obviously offensively we feel like we have a lot of weapons
that we're able to be able to go to. But I thought our defense, holding them
to just 18 field goals in a game I thought was critical to our success.  
  
Q. You went small today with Channise in the starting lineup. What did
you see going into the game that made you make that choice?  
BRENDA FRESE: Well, you know, I mean, obviously our depth has been impacted
through Bri's injury. So more strategic of just trying to -- we saw we've been
in some early foul trouble and just kind of protecting our bigs. I thought we
were able to use that to our advantage in this game.  
  
Q. On Bri, do you like how she was moving, and do you feel like she's
back at 100 percent?  
BRENDA FRESE: Nowhere near close to 100 percent, but I thought -- we needed
every single one of her 13 minutes that she gave us today. I thought she was
big. Now we evaluate obviously how she comes out of this, and with multiple
games in a row. But I thought she played like a senior should play.

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Tim Eatman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36642)

### [Stasha Carey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36643)

### [Arella Guirantes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32722)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Rutgers - 64, Purdue - 49  
  
TIM EATMAN: Any time you get a chance to play in the Big Ten Tournament, you
just get excited for being in Indy with all these great competitors and great
teams. We're very fortunate that our kids played extremely hard. I thought
they played with a lot of toughness and I thought they played with a lot of
sense of urgency that we came here to get something done. We're excited about
Purdue, the way Purdue played. We knew that they were going to hit the boards
extremely hard. I think in the first half they out-rebounded us, but I thought
in the second half we dug in and we got to our match-ups and our 55 in. We're
just excited about the opportunity tomorrow.  
  
Q. Stasha, how hard have these past few weeks been, and how have you
worked through that to play as well as you guys have?  
STASHA CAREY: They've been tough, but every day we come in, we set team
standards for ourselves, and we just come in, we remain -- we try and remain
focused as much as possible. I know we had a week off, kind of, but we just
stayed focused. We continued to practice hard.  
  
Q. You pulled within one; talk about the resilience this team has to
always punch back.  
ARELLA GUIRANTES: Coach just says just keep the gas running, basically. Our
55, he just said to never give up on it, never give up on it, never give up on
each other. We know teams are never going to give up in March. It's March. The
ball and the hoop is wide open in March. We just know that there's going to be
runs, and we've just got to fight through.  
  
STASHA CAREY: We know that we played them during our regular season, and we
came out with that win, so we knew tonight that they were going to come and
give it all they had, especially with it being the tournament. And one thing
that we just focused on is staying together a lot, so we knew that when they
were going to come back and give us all they had that we had to stay calm,
collected and together at the end of the day.  
  
Q. Just subbing five in at a time, was that just the plan maybe to wear
down Purdue playing its third game in three days?  
TIM EATMAN: Well, it's not to wear down Purdue, it's to maintain our
intensity. We want to get into the 55, and so we want to put pressure on the
basketball, we want to get to our match-ups and we want a defensive rebound
every possession. When I feel like we're not getting to our match-ups it's
time to sub because we want to keep fighting and keep pushing. The way we want
to play is we want to play hard every possession. It doesn't matter who and
what person it is. Everybody has got to give maximum effort. You'll see it
again tomorrow, and we're going to continue to do it hopefully throughout the
whole tournament.  
  
We're happy about it. Any time you're playing Purdue, you remember last year,
Tyler Scaife had to hit a fadeaway jump shot to get a victory for us. You
never can write Purdue off. They've got great coaches, great kids, and they
play hard.  
  
Q. In the second half, subbing those five and five and then that full
court pressure, just balancing Purdue, just talk about that and how aggressive
they were that entire time.  
TIM EATMAN: Well, we felt like if we could get to our match-ups that we could
get a couple traps, and if we could get one to two traps every possession I
think we kept fighting hard to get to that 10-second violation. I think with
we got one or two in the basketball game. So if we can continue to get into
the traps and then make the rotation that we need to make and then guard them
for the rest of the 15 to 16 seconds, I think we've got an opportunity to be
successful. Purdue runs so much stuff. You see them run three patterns in the
same 30-second possession. So we wanted to disrupt it as much as we could and
to keep them off balance. That's what we was trying to get accomplished.  
  
Q. How big was that Peleg Pelc three to end the half? What was that
momentum like for your team? I saw you over there fired up, and including that
it was 22-8 the rest of the game in favor of you guys.  
TIM EATMAN: Well, when Noga is such a great shooter, and because she's a great
shooter, we have tremendous confidence in her. She's a good kid. She works
extremely hard for us every day, day in and day out. We was happy for her
because of the fact that she made one, and so hopefully tomorrow she'll get an
opportunity to make some more. But the three that she hit was huge. The three
that Charise hit was huge. I thought every time they made a run at us, we had
someone step up and make a play, and it wasn't the same person every time.  
  
Q. How do you game plan for a player like Megan Gustafson tomorrow?  
TIM EATMAN: Well, first of all, we've got to give credit where credit is due.
She's the Big Ten Player of the Year for a reason. She's a kid that plays
extremely hard every possession, and they can depend on her, and that's one of
the things that she's reliable and they look for her all the time. We've got
to do a better job in this game not really guarding Megan but getting back in
transition defense. The last time we played them they got like 14 to 16 points
in transition. So we've got to do a better job playing transition defense, and
then we've got to do a better job sitting on her and making sure she doesn't
get easy looks. But she's going to get hers. We've just got to make her work
to get everything she gets tomorrow.  
  
Q. You were switching five in, five out, you said you did that not to
really stop Purdue but to keep your intensity. Towards the end of the game you
started to go away from that. Was there any reason you stopped doing that?  
TIM EATMAN: Well, I thought down the stretch we needed to execute, and we was
trying to run more clock. Normally when we're subbing five in and five out --
we're coming down one or two or three passes and we're taking a shot, then I
thought when we had like a 10-plus lead that we needed to get within the shot
clock and not take shots within eight seconds. I felt the group that was out
there was working, running their cuts hard, and because they was running their
cuts hard I felt like we could just stick with them and we could make plays.  
  
Q. Last time out in Iowa City playing the Hawkeyes, Hannah Stewart,
Makenzie Meyer kind of gave your guards a little bit of trouble. How are you
looking at that match-up for tomorrow?  
TIM EATMAN: Well, we're going to start working on it in about 10 minutes from
now, and in about 10 minutes we're going to go back and watch personnel. We're
going to talk about how they got into the lanes and we didn't stunt the wings
very hard when we played them the last time. We got flat and we gave them the
elbow drive too much. They got into the lane, into the gut of our defense too
much. Hopefully tomorrow we're going to get some better close-outs, and we're
going to get -- again, it started from transition defense. We were on our
heels the entire night. We've got to fight back and not be on our heels, and
when we're not on our heels we can have a better opportunity to defend on the
perimeter.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Makenzie Meyer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34740)

### [Megan Gustafson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32141)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Iowa - 70, Indiana - 61  
  
LISA BLUDER: You know, I always think the first one is the hardest. Indiana is
a great team, and we knew that coming into this game. They obviously got us
during the season by two points on their home court, and we wanted this one
back. It was kind of a goal of ours that we wanted to beat everybody in the
Big Ten, and we've done that now. And I thought our first quarter was good and
I thought our fourth quarter was good. We missed the first several three-
pointers, but when Mak hits that one at the end of the first quarter, I think
that just kind of gave us a huge momentum and really opened up the threes for
us.  
  
Q. It wasn't a great 34 minutes for Kathleen to start the game, but boy,
she was really clutch there at the end. What did you see out of her coming
down the stretch?  
MAKENZIE MEYER: Yeah, she came in strong when we needed her. And Kathleen is
one of my best friends, and she's such a competitive player, and she was
getting frustrated with herself, but we all kept telling her how great of a
player she is. She's first team all-Big Ten. She's an excellent distributor.
She still was able to get a good amount of assists tonight, and when she
knocked down those two shots at the end, that was huge for our team.  
  
Q. Megan, incredible physical game. Have you ever gotten used to being
like tackled 19 times a game?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, it's pretty normal, something that I've gone against
throughout this entire Big Ten season the past couple years. I have a big
target on my back and Indiana did a nice job of sending in extra players, and
fortunately I was able to find my guards outside so they could hit some
threes.  
  
Q. Sometimes shooters are surprised when they're so wide open, but with
Megan, the attention she draws, are you almost expecting open threes as
shooters?  
MAKENZIE MEYER: Yeah. After playing Indiana the first time we knew we were
going to get open with threes. And Megan does such a great job of passing the
ball out. And the in and out three is such a good look for us, and we were
really able to convert that tonight.  
  
Q. Makenzie, both you and Hannah had kind of big games today. With
injuries and everything, it's kind of been a long season. Can you talk about
kind of the season that you guys have gone on and how it's transformed into
today?  
MAKENZIE MEYER: Yeah, we all know the Big Ten season is a grind, and this year
we played two more games. It's a really long season, but we're able to just
keep grinding and pushing through, and we have a goal to finish out the season
with a Big Ten championship, so we're just going to keep grinding and hitting
open shots when we get them.  
  
Q. Megan, it wasn't just you inside, Hannah had 13 rebounds, I think,
Monika had a couple big baskets early. Tell me about the progress both of
those two have made.  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, inside it's not just me down there. We've got some very
good post players on our team, and we battle against each other every single
day in practice. We make each other better. I'm not the player I am without
those two for sure, and they really did help us out a ton. Monika a couple
shots early on, and Hannah just being consistent as she always is. When we
have more than just one person really battling down low, we're pretty hard to
stop.  
  
Q. Megan, tonight you had 30 points and 17 rebounds, and then coming off
a double bye, what makes the physicality of a game like this different when
you've been resting and all that stuff, and then boom, you're immediately hit
with the physicality down low in the paint tonight?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, having that double bye is nice so we can have that
rest, but at the same time we're preparing and practicing for that day in and
day out. I thought we felt pretty prepared for it. But again, you just have to
work as hard as you possibly can. I'm not doing this for myself. I'm going to
take those hits every single time so I can get my teammates open.  
  
Q. It seemed like any time Indiana would make a run you guys had some
kind of an answer. How did you weather the storm and keep the lead most of the
game?  
MAKENZIE MEYER: Yeah, it was just a back and forth game the whole times, and
those are fun games to play in, and we just stayed confident. And I missed two
free throws early and that's tough as a shooter. You like to see one of the
first couple shots go down. And once I saw that three go down at the end of
the first quarter, it kind of took a lid off the rim for me. And then
throughout the rest of the game, we were just confident shooting that three.  
  
Q. Makenzie, you've probably had a rougher season shooting from three-
point than you had hoped. How good is it to have such a good game the first
game here in March?  
MAKENZIE MEYER: Yeah, it's fun. This time of year it's just about grinding,
and we want to play as many games as we can in March, and we want to just keep
being able to play with each other, I guess. We love this team so much. It was
just nice to see the shots fall today.  
  
Q. Megan, what was the mood in the huddle five minutes to go, you're
down a point? What was said in the huddle and how were you able to finish the
game?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, I think one of our coaches just told me to rally the
troops, and that's what we did. Our leaders were able to talk to people and be
like, we're a good team, we're the 10th ranked team in the nation. We've got
to show it right here, right now, get stops, back to back stops is really
important. So just really putting an emphasis on defense is what we really
said in that huddle, and that's what transformed on the court.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, she's a really good player. She can create, whether
it's shooting from the three or really penetrating and making some really
tough shots, and so credit to her and her teammates do a nice job of really
setting her up, too.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a little bit about Doyle struggling shooting the
ball, but it seems like she's more important to your offense in the way she
moves the ball. How important it her ability to move the ball?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, she led us with six assists tonight. It's interesting, it
takes a lot of mental toughness, I think, to do what she did tonight. She was
struggling a little bit in the first three quarters. And then she gets a
charge, she gets a big three, she hits another basket for us, again leads us
with six assists. And at the same time, she's trying to guard Patberg, which
is not easy. That kid is a really, really good player. She brings a lot to our
team defensively, as well.  
  
Q. What was the mood in the huddle there the last TV timeout when you
were down one with five minutes to go?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, it wasn't a panic situation at all. It was kind of like,
it's our time. Like every game has these momentums. Like we're up 10 and then
they cut it to one. So I feel like our team really just stayed level headed,
and I think when you have a lot of seniors on the court, that's a little bit
easier to do because they've kind of been there before. I just think they keep
believing in themselves so much, and they also know they've got Megan. So I
think that's kind of a big relief for everybody, too.  
  
Q. You smirked a little bit there about Megan's double-doubles. When you
consider the physicality she's gone up against, how much more significant is
that number to you?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, she's got three -- sometimes more people around her all the
time, and she's still able to put up those kind of numbers. I think the
defensive rebounding is really amazing. And Hannah did a great job, too.
Hannah had 10 defensive rebounds today. Those two women, Hannah and Megan, had
almost as many rebounds as the entire Indiana team.  
  
I think you've got to finish up your defensive possession with a rebound, and
those two did a great job with that.  
  
Q. On the defensive possession toward the end, I think you were up maybe
four and Patberg had the ball. What could you say about Kathleen's defense?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, that's -- Kathleen knew how important that was. You give
Kathleen a challenge, she's going to step up. She's going to give you
everything she has. That's a challenge to guard Patberg. She is hard to
defend, and I thought she did a really good job.  
  
Q. What have you learned from the last time that you guys faced Indiana,
and how did you guys kind of take your experience there and how does that kind
of impact what you guys did today?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, you know, we knew it was going to be a tough game just
because the game they gave us at their place. We knew it was going to be down
-- they have incredible fight. They're not going to give up. This is a team
that really works hard and executes well and has so many weapons. So I think
what we took from it, we knew how they were going to guard Megan a little bit
more, and that was kind of nice, coming into the game kind of knowing what was
going to happen. I thought Hannah started us off really well, though. We were
anticipating the double, and I think Hannah did a good job of cutting back
door and getting that for us.  
  
Q. You guys struggled with turnovers in the first half. I think you guys
had nine. In the second half you only had four, which was pretty good. Were
they out of focus at halftime?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, we talked about it a lot because we were forcing the ball
in. We don't need to force it in. We can keep running it and working the ball.
We don't have to score in eight seconds. Sometimes we like to score so much,
we think we have to score in eight seconds. Well, we don't. Don't force it if
it's not there. We only had four turnovers in the second half and two came in
the first minute and a half. So for the remaining 18 minutes of this game, we
only had two turnovers. So they did a much, much better job of valuing the
ball and making good passing decisions.  
  
Q. You said Indiana is a great team. Do you feel like this conference
deserves more teams in the NCAA Tournament? Is Indiana one of those teams?  
LISA BLUDER: Oh, absolutely. I think there's no doubt. Indiana, they were in
the top 25 early in the year. I know they suffered through some injuries with
Patberg. You take Patberg out of the team, and yeah, they're a little bit
different. But now she's back and she's healthy, and they definitely deserve
to be in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Your first season defending against a player like Patberg, this is
the second time around and it didn't seem any easier for the team. How tough
is she to game plan for?  
LISA BLUDER: She's just so good, trying to keep the ball out of her hands
because when she gets it she's so crafty. She's able to create, and not only
shoot threes, she's great off the bounce, and then she's got a little floater
that's really -- it's really hard to defend that. So she's a really good
player. Good get for Indiana.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Kim Barnes-Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36625)

### [Naz Hillmon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36626)

### [Hallie Thome](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34722)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan - 72, Wisconsin - 65 (2OT)  
  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Great win for our program. Wisconsin obviously is playing
really well right now. They're playing without any pressure. They're playing
loose, and they're playing confident. And they challenged us to two overtimes
tonight. Just a great basketball game. We had to figure out a way to grind it
out. Thanks to Hallie Thome doing a little bit of everything. She scored the
basketball, she made some free throws down the stretch, but she also passed
the ball exceptionally well. So our inside presence was able to get going down
late. We picked up some fouls, which was really critical to our success. But
for our program, this is the first time since 2001 we are advancing to this
point, so I just think that speaks volumes to our senior class and kind of
what they've meant to our program. Obviously we have some young freshmen in
Naz and Amy Dilk who have made major contributions, but we're led by our
seniors out there, and I thought -- I was really happy with the way that they
hung tough, even when things weren't going our way, to figure out a way to
grind it out. Hopefully we're not feeling that much pressure tomorrow and we
play a little bit more confident, a little bit looser than we did today
because we're playing against a great Maryland team. My last thing that I'm
going to say because I want this to be a shout-out to the world, our league is
stronger -- I've been here for seven years. I came from the Big East with the
likes of when the Big East was the Big East of Rutgers and Notre Dame and
UConn and on and on and on. Our league is stronger than it's ever been, and
it's stronger than it's ever been from top to bottom. And any team can beat
anyone on any given night, and I think we saw that yesterday. So it's just an
exciting time for the Big Ten.  
  
Q. Naz, how are you feeling about this, about this win, and what can you
take from it moving forward?  
NAZ HILLMON: Yeah, this is very exciting. Big stage, big lights, but had my
teammates behind me and carrying me through this experience. It's been just
amazing. We've had our seniors and juniors all the way down. They've been in
this situation before, so they know the likes of what's going on, and they've
just been helping me throughout this process. But it's been amazing, great to
play with my teammates, and it's awesome to get a win.  
  
Q. Hallie, you've been through these battles before; what is it like
getting ready with the double bye? You're playing a team with a lot of
momentum generally these last couple years. What are the challenges there?
What do you communicate to your teammates? How do you handle it differently
than other games?  
HALLIE THOME: Definitely this year coming in, we saw Wisconsin kind of like
the Cinderella story, so can't take any team lightly. So you've got to go out
there and play like it's your last game. And then also just making sure we're
mentally prepared and focusing on that, and then realizing we're fresh, we
have legs. So the two other times I feel like if we were like a Wisconsin team
it would have been harder, but I feel like we were able to get up-and-down the
court very fast and get easy buckets in transition.  
  
Q. Hallie, it was a physical game the whole game, a lot of bodies
hitting the floor. How were you able to kind of take control of the game in
the second overtime with those lay-ups and with those openings that you were
getting?  
HALLIE THOME: So with that, I think our teammates did an outstanding job of
putting us in position to score, and then having two posts, Naz and I, you've
got to pick and choose your battle, and having Nicole Munger on the perimeter.
With that, either you give up a two or you give up a three. With that we have
to make sure we're moving the ball easily. And at the end of the day the
guards are putting me in the right position to score, so I don't really have
to think about it, I can just go up.  
  
Q. Naz, I'm sure some history or creating a legacy for yourself on this
team was probably important to you when you committed, but it's the first semi
since '01 that the program is going to in the Big Ten Tournament. Does that
have any significance for you as a young player with big dreams?  
NAZ HILLMON: So just being able to be a part of something like this, like
Coach said, 18 years, finally getting in this position, I want to do anything
that I can for my team and just being a part of this has been amazing. It is
special. I mean, as much as the accolades -- personal accolades are great and
good, but we want the ultimate Big Ten championship. That's all we're focused
on right now, and of course it's amazing to be a part of this game and have
that, being an 18-year fan.  
  
Q. Handling the double bye, you've been through this. What are the keys
from a team prep standpoint that there always seems to be -- most teams seem
to get tripped up by or it can be a struggle? What's different?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: You know, I thought about this, and I didn't even ask Sarah
to check it out. But I don't know personally if I've ever won a game where
we've gotten a double bye. You've checked it out, uh-huh, so I would think
about it leading up to it. I've never said that to these guys. But the year at
St. John's when we beat UConn and we went to the Sweet 16, tremendous,
tremendous team, we got a double bye, and we were upset in the first round. So
it's tough, and we tried to switch things up a little bit this year and come
and watch yesterday's game and try to change the mood. But then I felt like
I've been here since probably Christmas. You know, either way you go about it,
I think it's definitely tough, and I think that's why this first one was
really important for us, and our kids were tight. I think they were really
tight because the expectations were we've got to win. We're supposed to beat
Wisconsin. We just beat them twice, and Wisconsin had nothing to lose. I had a
pit in my stomach. I did. I think the double bye is great, but it doesn't give
you the mojo of playing. But finally, it's been broken. It's been broken.  
  
Q. Today was definitely March Madness for your team. It was pretty much
a chess match the whole game. What do you attribute that to? Do you think it
was offensive, or do you think it was more defense from both teams?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: You know, we just played Wisconsin last week, so they just
saw everything that we were all about. I mean, we did for them, too, so that's
why you're saying it's a chess match. And they were prepared for us, and we
were prepared for them. Things that we got them with last week, they handled a
lot better today in terms of our press. We really were able to frazzle them
last game with our press, and today we really weren't. But like you said, in
March, it's going to be madness, and you're going to see some different teams
that are going to step up and be able to make great plays and win games.
That's why I want our kids to really celebrate this and enjoy this for a
second because it easily could have gone the other way.  
  
Q. How do you, after a double overtime game, get your team rested up and
prepared for the match with Maryland?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I think that's what the Big Ten Tournament is all
about. That's what March Madness is all about. We challenged ourselves. We
challenged our team all year long with our schedule. And we went and played in
a tournament at Thanksgiving where we played three days in a row, and we
didn't just play, we played Missouri, we played Texas and we played
Washington. So we challenged ourselves against three Power Five teams to put
ourselves in a situation that we would be in tomorrow. Our kids are ready for
it. We're excited for it. You saw Wisconsin today, they had played three days
and still was able to grind things out. So we know we have an incredible
match-up tomorrow with a tough Maryland team who played exceptionally well
against Michigan State today. But our kids are -- it's survive and advance.
They're hungry. They're excited to be here, and we're excited to continue to
play.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Amy Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32621)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 75, Nebraska - 71  
  
Q. Coach, obviously a disappointing loss. Offensive rebounding for
Purdue played a huge role. Talk about their work on the glass.  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I thought they did a fantastic job. A couple times we had
some defensive breakdowns that forced us to rotate out of position and then
they really capitalized by crashing the boards hard. But they came into this
tournament with a mindset of rebounding. We knew that when we watched their
game yesterday against Illinois, and they came away with 18 offensive
rebounds. We knew if you want to win, you have to rebound, and we did not do
that today, give up 19 offensive rebounds, and they really made us pay.  
  
Q. The first couple minutes of the first quarter, first minute of the
second quarter, 15-0 run for Purdue, and if you condense it even more, there's
a minute and 33 seconds in there where they hit four consecutive three-
pointers and the score flips from you being up 4 to being down 11 totally
changed the game for you. Talk about what that stretch meant to your team and
how you were able to fight your way out of it later.  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, I mean, I think that is just a devastating stretch. You
feel like and you know coming into tournament games that there are going to be
runs, but you can't give up runs where you're giving wide-open three-point
looks to their three-point shooters, and I thought they did a great job of
getting out and pushing in transition to get some of those looks and just had
a few defensive breakdowns to give them some of those open looks, and that can
flip the game. I thought we scratched, we clawed, we fought, we dug ourselves
out of that 14-point deficit. But you can't dig those kind of holes and expect
that you're going to come out on top.  
  
Q. Fourth quarter, the end of the fourth quarter down by 13 points.
You'd been down by as much as 14 in the second half, and then you get hot,
knock down some threes, but it really started with Sam early in that third
quarter, one, going to the rim, two, knocking down a mid-range shot, then
hitting a step-back three and that kind of fired up your team a little bit at
that point. Talk about the way your shooting played a role in the fourth
quarter but also the levels at which you scored.  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, there's no question that Sam gave us a spark there in the
fourth quarter, and I think just showed a lot of maturity and growing up out
of a freshman who started the game 0 for 6 in the first half and then a lot of
players would really kind of pull back into their shell and kind of hide after
that. But I thought Sam did a fantastic job of staying aggressive, and she
gave us that spark. And then we knew that in that fourth quarter we could take
advantage because of our depth and our ability to push pace, and I thought we
found Taylor Kissinger open in transition for a few threes there. It really
sparked that comeback and put us in a position where we drew back to a one-
point game. We get to a one-point game right there, we give up an offensive
rebound, and you just have to have that board.  
  
Q. Looking at your season as a whole now just for a second, you go
through the season, and you go 4 and 10 in two-possession games. You take that
and you take the youth on your roster, what does this experience do to help
your team moving forward next season, or what do you hope it does?  
AMY WILLIAMS: Yeah, this is a tough question right now. I think we're all just
still kind of feeling the pain of this one. We had just a very special senior
on our team that everybody in this program wanted to scratch and claw and give
everything they could to extend Maddie's season as long as we possibly could.
She's meant a lot to our program. And so thinking about what this is going to
mean for the future, we're going to take some time to really think about that,
to walk away and step away and be able to process, but for right now we're
just going to be grateful to this particular team and all that Maddie poured
into this and just take us a little time to get over it.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Lindsay Whalen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13926)

### [Kenisha Bell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28389)

### [Destiny Pitts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36605)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Indiana - 66, Minnesota - 58  
  
LINDSAY WHALEN: They punched first, and for us, unfortunately it was just too
much to come back from. They had 20 points in the paint in the first half.
Second half they only had six. Our kids didn't quit. They stuck together in
the second half, but it was too much to come back from in the first half.  
  
Q. Did you ever feel like you actually got into a rhythm?  
LINDSAY WHALEN: No, not really. When we played off our defense a little bit,
then we were -- then we got some things going. But other than that, they kind
of sagged off of us, and they really crowded the paint. It was just -- you
know, they had obviously a really good game plan.  
  
Q. Seemed like you guys were sometimes trying to do a little bit of hero
ball and getting sagged on by three people and still trying to get the ball
out.  
LINDSAY WHALEN: Well, I think everybody was trying to make a play at a certain
point. That's what happens when you kind of get frustrated. We got a little
frustrated, and we weren't able to make some of those reads, like you said,
and get it to the open player. So yeah, we'll have to watch the tape back and
kind of see and learn from it, and we'll go from there.  
  
Q. Obviously your season probably isn't done. There's the WNIT I would
imagine that you're anticipating.  
LINDSAY WHALEN: Yeah, I told the guys we'll just see what happens. Two Mondays
from now, on selection night, and then we'll see where we go, and then we'll
just go from there.  
  
Q. What was it about their game plan that worked tonight?  
DESTINY PITTS: I mean, really they just packed the paint and just did a good
job of trying to keep their individual player in front of us.  
  
Q. How frustrating was it -- was this a little more frustrating because
it was so hard to get over the hump?  
DESTINY PITTS: Yeah, I will say it was definitely frustrating because I know
how good we are as a team and how hard we work together. Just to kind of not
see our shots fall in the first half and then us work so hard the second half
and not be able to get the success we wanted, I would say it's very
frustrating.  
  
Q. How did the game play out from your perspective?  
KENISHA BELL: I mean, we weren't hitting shots, and they was kind of coming
down getting every shot that they wanted. We didn't really play the defense
that we usually play. They had the momentum coming out, as well, because they
knew they needed to win to get to the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. How frustrating did it get? You guys were getting some shots, they
just weren't going down.  
KENISHA BELL: It was really frustrating just because you know you can hit
those shots, and this is a time where you kind of need them. In every game
you've got to come to play basically because you don't know if it's your last
or not.  
  
Q. You were able to kind of get the defense squared away there after
that first quarter, but it just wasn't -- you couldn't quite get over the
hump. You came within six a few times.  
KENISHA BELL: Yeah, we were fighting. We didn't give up. The whole game we
knew that it still mattered even though we were down 10. We've been in games
where multiple teams came back from a 10-point lead or down 10 and came back
and won, so we knew that we were still in the game. We just needed a little
more time that we should have made up for the first half.  
  
Q. What were they doing defensively to make it so difficult to find a
rhythm?  
KENISHA BELL: They were packing the paint. They had really their whole five
kind of sitting in the paint and we wasn't hitting shots, so it was making it
easy for them to kind of guard us.  
  
Q. Obviously in two weeks you'll find out where you're going, and
probably the NIT. It's not the NCAA, but to continue playing with this group,
are you looking forward to that?  
KENISHA BELL: I'm looking forward to anything, but I definitely would hope it
would be NCAA before anything. But I mean, if I can get one last shot playing
with the group of girls that we've got, then I'll take it.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

### [Dominique Oden](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32692)

### [Ae'Rianna Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36611)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 75, Nebraska - 71  
  
Q. Where have you found this offense the last two nights?  
SHARON VERSYP: They're just coming together. They're just playing well
together, confident, stepping up, just a new season, so everybody is just real
excited. When a couple balls go through the basket, they just build
confidence. You saw it in games today when people shoot 1 for 16 to start
games off, it's pretty tough, so we've been fortunate that the ball has been
able to get in.  
  
Q. How much has your offense been sparked by what you're doing on the
defensive end?  
SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, yesterday and today it was big being able to get some
transition buckets because that just builds your confidence, being able to get
some lay-ups has been big. We weren't able to do that for about a four-week
stretch, so being able to cause some issues in a lot of different areas, it's
been really good, and obviously it just builds your confidence and builds your
leads.  
  
Q. How important was it for you to get out in transition and play with
Kate Cain, a big girl in the middle? You were able to send her to the bench
for quite a few minutes there in the first half.  
SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, I mean, transition is big for us. Obviously if there's a
bigger player and we have Ae'Rianna running the floor and Tam -- well, we
played them the second time, our transition offenses really did a great job,
so we really talked about if we rebound the ball, don't let them make a lot of
shots, we'll be able to get up-and-down, and that really happened those first
probably three quarters, we really did a good job doing that.  
  
Q. You're facing off against Rutgers tomorrow. It's a much different
Rutgers team than you played before, no Ciani Cryor, no Caitlin Jenkins.
What's your plan of attack against Rutgers for tomorrow?  
SHARON VERSYP: You know, they press you the whole time, so you've got to be
able to handle the press and get it over half court. That's the big thing. You
know, and then we haven't put our game plan together, but you've got to be
able to do a good job on the boards. But you've got to be able to score the
ball. They are one of the top defensive teams in the league. People struggle
scoring the basketball. So we've got to be able to break their press. We've
got to be able to defend and rebound and then do what we've been doing.  
  
Q. The job that Tamara and Ae'Rianna did on the boards tonight,
especially on the offensive boards, maybe extending a couple possessions for
you --  
SHARON VERSYP: No, I mean, it was huge. When we've been able to rebound like
this, especially with those two, it's been big. You know, we were able to get
more put-backs, different possessions, kick out for a three, move the defense
quite a bit. So those are the things that we just talked about is we looked at
their stats sheet, and there's -- that was their weakness, so we really talked
about that, hit the offensive boards quite a bit. So it was good that we were
able to just keep going after it, just keep going and being as intense as we
can on the boards, so they kind of had to be back on their heels.  
  
Q. What's this quick turnaround like for you, conference tournament
season, you're playing less than 24 hours later? You're coming off a big win
and now you play tomorrow.  
SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, well, that's why we go to -- we take trips during
Thanksgiving, went to the Virgin Islands, played three games back to back to
prepare ourselves for tournament play. We know how to prepare. The biggest
thing just getting them rest, getting legs, feeling their bodies again.
Everything is mental right now, to be able to do what we need to do and be
able to play tomorrow night with a lot of energy.  
  
Q. Oden really showed her leadership in those transition moments, moving
the ball down, calling out spots for players. Does that almost out-shine her
offensive performance tonight?  
SHARON VERSYP: I just think both go hand in hand because we haven't been doing
that, so you can see when we have great communication (inaudible) and we're
directing and have that type of leadership, we're really good. She at one
point even pulled Ree over and said, hey, we need to do this, we've got to
finish this, you're fine, so it was great to see that they're starting to
really blossom and do the things that we need.  
  
Q. Is this coming at almost the perfect time, those two -- the veterans
on the team stepping up and leading the team in this tournament?  
SHARON VERSYP: Yeah, I mean, that's what veterans need to do. You saw today
Wisconsin, they had two seniors that totally scored three quarters of their
points. We don't have any seniors, so Ae'Rianna and Nique have played in this
environment. Their freshman year they played in the tournament all the way to
the championship game. So they're the only ones that have that experience. So
really proud of them. They're being vocal, and then both vocal and performing.  
  
Q. KT (Kayana Traylor) went 5 for 7 from the floor tonight on a night
where Karissa didn't do as well as she normally does. How does that help your
depth going into the rest of the tournament?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, KT has got to be aggressive, and I think she's been able
to do that over the last two weeks, shooting the ball well, looking for pull-
up jump shots. Karissa just has a lot of mileage on her legs, and people are
chasing her all over the place. KT is going to have open looks, so it's great
that she's able to knock them down. Whilby coming in has just played two
phenomenal games. We need that depth. We'll need Nyahoa tomorrow, we'll need
Fatou. We'll need our entire bench to be able to just rotate people in.  
  
Q. Looking at tomorrow, Rutgers is led by Stasha Carey, second team all
Big Ten. What do you see in her?  
SHARON VERSYP: You know, she's a tough one. You know, she's kind of the --
helps leading that team with their coach not being around, taking a leave.
She's a senior. She's going to step up. She needs to lead that team, and she's
tough on the boards. She scores well down low. She shoots the three. So she
kind of has every facet of her game, all skill sets. Again, we've got to do
well on the boards like we have the last two days.  
  
Q. Just for all the lower seeds to win today, what's that say about the
league and kind of where things are at right now?  
SHARON VERSYP: You know, that's all we talk about is how the league is top to
bottom, and I mean, this is history today, and NCAA still won't give us seven
or eight teams, so until that happens, I'm not sure it really matters.  
  
Q. Where have you guys found your offense the last two days?  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: Defense. Definitely from our defense. The energy before the
game has been tangible, and it's really helped us start off strong on defense,
which has led to our offense.  
  
Q. It must feel good to finally see some shots go down after the last
month or so.  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: It definitely does. It's great to get a win after the last
month or so. It's a great feeling, and we plan to have many more this weekend.  
  
Q. They had cut it to six in the third, and the more active you got on
defense on that stretch to at least pull away a little bit --  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: We definitely went into a timeout, we're like, y'all, we have
to pull this together, we can't let this get away from us like we did at
Nebraska. We have to bring more energy. We know we can do this. We did it the
first three quarters. Let's pull it together.  
  
Q. Just overall tonight, how are you looking to build off this win
coming in beating Illinois and then --  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: Keep the same energy, keep the same defensive intensity and
just keep building on the hype and how happy we are right now.  
  
Q. You guys played historically well in the Big Ten Tournament. Is there
just a different mindset coming into this, maybe being in Indy? What kind of
factors into that success in the tournament?  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: It's definitely historical background. We were shown the
situation a couple years ago when a team just like us in just the same
situation had to win Big Ten Tournament, and of course we want to get there.
We feel like we could have did more during the season, and right now
tournament time is the time to prove it.  
  
Q. Just with Rutgers now, what kind of challenge is that defensively for
you? You've played them once, but traditionally they're known as a very strong
defensive team. How important is it going to be to run those sets and get
those easy baskets against them?  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: Just because they're such a good defensive team, I think it's
important to keep up our transition, so playing defensively well ourselves so
we can get transition buckets, making sure we execute to the tee when we do
get into half-court sets and making sure we don't make lazy passes, because
like you said, they're really good at defense, so they're going to be jumping
passes, they're going to be aggressive, so we have to be aggressive just as
much as they are.  
  
Q. So what's gotten into Whilby the last two days?  
DOMINIQUE ODEN: I don't know, maybe it's what she ate, maybe it's the court,
maybe it's because it's March, and it's a great time of the year.  
  
Q. You guys have struggled offensively the last month; where is the
spark coming from? Where is the production coming from these last two days?  
AE'RIANNA HARRIS: Definitely playing together and actually executing all of
our plays. A lot of the times we get into something and we'd run the first two
parts of it and then give up on it, and it became a one-on-one game, so
playing together and finishing our plays.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you're being better on the defensive end which has
ignited maybe some run-outs?  
AE'RIANNA HARRIS: Most definitely, and I think that's what's getting us
transition points, easy lay-ups versus running through plays and maybe getting
a three, maybe getting a lay-up type deal. So definitely our defense, getting
lots of steals and stuff and transitioning that into offense.  
  
Q. It seemed tonight you were able to kind of get adjusted as the game
was going on. You started to get on the glass more but you were active. What
led to that, and what made you want to get in there and --  
AE'RIANNA HARRIS: It was just a personal thing. I just had to get myself
going. The team got me going. We knew I came out slow, and I had to do
everything I needed to do to help my team to make sure we were successful, so
it was kind of just to make that switch. It was a mental thing.  
  
Q. Why were you and Tam so active on the boards?  
AE'RIANNA HARRIS: I have no idea. I think a lot of it was they were trying to
box us out, and they would go one way and we would just go around them. They
made it pretty easy at some point, but I think it's just actively going for
the boards is what makes it easier to get more of them.  
  
Q. Everyone teamed up for something. Oden and McLaughlin had eight
assists combined. You and Tam had 29 rebounds combined, Kayana was 5 for 7
from the floor. How is this team kind of finding its identity together in the
tournament where they're so historically good?  
AE'RIANNA HARRIS: I don't know what the tournament does to this Purdue team,
but I mean, I love it. I mean, like I mentioned before, it's like some type of
magic that just gets us going and take us out of everything that we were not
doing correct before, and we just kind of gel, and it works out for us in the
end.  
  
Q. You tied the all-time blocks record tonight in your hometown. What's
next for you?  
AE'RIANNA HARRIS: Beating it. Yeah, if I would have known in the moment, I
would have looked at her like I did when I beat it each year because she's at
the top, and I told her when I got here, she told me she wanted me to break
all her records, so that's what I'm trying to do.  
  
Q. So far a pretty special year individually for you with a thousand
points and now tying the block record. What would push this season forward for
you?  
AE'RIANNA HARRIS: I still have to break the junior season block record. So
right now I don't know how many I had tonight -- three. I add that up, I'm at
101. I still need eight more to beat her junior record. So if I can get that
throughout this tournament, then I'll be set.  
  
Q. To do that, you have to play more games.  
AE'RIANNA HARRIS: Yes, sir.  
  
Q. What challenge is Rutgers going to present from a defensive
standpoint for you guys tomorrow?  
AE'RIANNA HARRIS: I mean, they have height, but Nebraska has height, too, so
it's kind of just adjusting to their style of play and then playing how we've
been playing.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Jonathan Tsipis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32631)

### [Kelly Karlis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36595)

### [Marsha Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32633)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Wisconsin - 73, Ohio State - 63  
  
Q. Coach, you got two wins in two days, the 13 seed. How are you hoping
to use that to continue to improve heading into your next match-up?  
COACH TSIPIS: Yeah, I don't think necessarily to sit there and say, like we
said, hey, we're the 13 seed. I think we looked and said, we get the
opportunity obviously to open the tournament up on the first day against Penn
State, a team that we're familiar with, had not gone our way in each of the
first two match-ups, and you could just kind of see the confidence. The kids
wanted that opportunity. It's not ever to say you want to play a specific
team, but I think knowing as the course of the season went along, if we got
that opportunity to play them again today, and then I think that confidence
built up, that we didn't play our best in the first half. Credit Ohio State
for that.  
  
Again, I thought in the first half we allowed maybe -- we took too many
jumpers. We took good care of the ball, only had one turnover at halftime. But
in the second half, just simple things like getting three stops in a row and
again, getting a couple transition baskets to make the hoop seem bigger. You
know, obviously led by our seniors in Marsha Howard and Kelly Karlis, Kelly
with a career day, four from the three-point line, Suzanne Gilreath came in
and knocked down a huge three for us, as well. But again, I thought
defensively, we're talking about we needed our offense to be better. I thought
we gained strength from our defense today. And again, last week we scored 50
points against Ohio State in a game, and we get 51 in the second half. You
could just see the confidence building and building with our kids. And again,
I thought our bench was great, keeping our kids -- again, you can't look and
say how many minutes you played because the reality of it is three of our
players won't ever get to experience this again, and the two that are on the
floor I think did a great job of making sure of bringing everybody else along
with them.  
  
Q. Just the way you guys have been able to overcome the way that the
season has played out for you and the way you played in the second half, and
in the first half you weren't able to get a lead, but to have that confidence
in the second half, what were your thoughts on just their overall effort?  
COACH TSIPIS: Yeah, I think we challenged them on things that we know they can
do really well. And we talked about if you miss shots and you're taking good
care of the basketball, can we get on the offensive glass a little bit more,
to help ourselves, to get to the free-throw line, to just give them
confidence. It's something we've kind of prided ourselves on all year is being
a better rebounding team. We lost the rebounding battle tonight, but I thought
we made a much better effort, and I think that activity helped us on the other
end, as well. I don't think we gave up nearly as many offensive rebounds in
the second half. And I just thought, you know, tipped balls, 50/50 balls,
challenging shots, we did a much better job in the second half, and I think
that gave us confidence to go the other way.  
  
Q. Overall, just the way you guys came out in the first half, not a lot
going for you, but there was a level of spirit and you guys were really
inspired in the second half, made some big shots. What do you think was able
to lead to that? Did Coach say anything to you at half?  
KELLY KARLIS: He always believes in us. He tells us to never give up, even if
we are the lower seed, just to keep fighting. We were all calm and collected,
and we knew we still had some fight in us, so we never let down.  
  
Q. You guys are the 13 seed, and you've won two. No other 13 seed has
ever done that in the Big Ten Tournament. How has that allowed you to be like,
13 seed, we've got nothing to lose, let's just throw the chips out there and
see what happens?  
KELLY KARLIS: Yeah, that's kind of our mentality. We've got nothing to lose.
We're the lowest seed. But lower seeds always come out with a big fight, so
that's kind of what we're coming out with every game, just to keep pushing,
each team that we just beat we lost to both times this season, so we've got
one more to do it to.  
  
Q. Marsha, how does it feel to be playing in your final tournament? How
does it feel as a senior to be advancing through the tournament? What does it
mean to you?  
MARSHA HOWARD: We worked for it. We knew we could do it. We went out there and
we competed. Even when we came in at halftime, our heads was held high, and we
just talked about one stop, one basket, and just continuing to do that, and
then once we took the lead to just continue to hit.  
  
Q. And then throughout your whole four years playing at Wisconsin, what
has it meant to you to be playing in the Big Ten?  
MARSHA HOWARD: It's a competitive conference. It's what I live for. The love
and the will that I have for this game is just tremendous, and to be able to
be here with these ladies and these coaches, to be able to fight to the finish
and finish out strong as a senior, it means a lot.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Teri Moren](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=27752)

### [Ali Patberg](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36606)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Indiana - 66, Minnesota - 58  
  
Q. For you, what does it mean to be playing in the Big Ten Tournament
here in Indy, in your home state in front of your home crowd?  
TERI MOREN: Well, it's a terrific thing. We're not lost on it, the fact that
we can just drive an hour. I think this is the best venue for it. One thing
about the state of Indiana, we love basketball, and we have a terrific group
of players and coaches in the Big Ten. We've had tremendous parity throughout
the entire season. We've already seen some exciting games, and that's just
going to continue.  
  
Q. So as a Big Ten graduate yourself, what does it mean to be coaching
in this tournament?  
TERI MOREN: Well, it's always special. Any time you have an opportunity to be
the head coach at a Big Ten school in a league that you played in, it's always
been special for me. And then it's just icing on the cake because I grew up
here in the state. I'm a very, very, very proud Hoosier.  
  
Q. Bendu played phenomenal defense on Kenisha Bell. What did you think
of her performance today?  
TERI MOREN: I think she was terrific defensively. I thought she got a little
bit gassed on the offensive end. She's not typically -- she had four
turnovers. That's not a typical Bendu. I thought Ali Patberg did a great job
on Pitts, and JP (Jaelynn Penn) did what she needed to do. But the key
tonight, I thought our post players -- and this is what goes unseen, just
their ability to rotate, come from the help side. We felt like any time that
Bell or any of them, their drivers tried to really get to the basket, they
were met by another teammate, and so that was terrific. I'm really proud of
our overall defensive play.  
  
Q. Was the idea to kind of pack the paint, force them to beat you?  
TERI MOREN: It was. You know, Bell is a terrific player. She can get inside
the paint. The key was not to foul. We did a much better job, I thought, in
the second half than we did the first. But yes, we were trying to -- we call
it wall up, right, just bring as many defenders as we could, just to not make
it easy for Bell to get to the basket, just a driving lane with being
untouched.  
  
Q. They just couldn't make you pay for it?  
TERI MOREN: Yeah, like I said, defensively we were pretty terrific. It was on
the offensive end, I thought we were great in the first half. But we got the
lead a little bit, and that press, I thought we started playing a little bit
like -- a little more timid than I would have liked to have seen us play. But
I'm really just really proud that they finished it out.  
  
Q. Do you feel like you maybe could have taken advantage of that first
half a little bit more, only being 14 points --  
TERI MOREN: I don't know that we could. Jaelynn came in letting it go. I
thought we were getting good shots, and Brenna got off to a hot start, so did
AP (Patberg). So no, I don't know that we could have built on it. The first
several possessions was frustrating because we were turning it over, had way
too many turnovers, especially in the first four minutes of that game. We
still have 18 for the game, but a lot of those came the second half against
that press. But happy, I thought AP did a terrific job running her basketball
team tonight.  
  
Q. It looked like they were generally having fun out there on the court.
Ali Patberg seemed like she was super engaged in the game. What does that say
about where this team is at in the season?  
TERI MOREN: I think they know what's at stake. They realize that we're still
playing for something. And they've always been like this. They've kind of
fallen in love with each other's success, and that's what you want your
basketball team to be about.  
  
Q. What did you see behind the scenes last year from Brenna and from Ali
in terms of how they helped each other through what was a challenging
situation for both of them?  
TERI MOREN: Well, and again, bringing them in together I thought was critical,
the fact that they could sit over there and learn our system offensively,
defensively, get in the gym. They're by far our gym rats. Love to be in the
gym, love to watch film, love to do all the extra stuff. And so they kind of
have each other in addition to the fact that they have a 3.8 G.P.A, they're in
the Kelly School of Business. So it actually goes beyond basketball. The Kelly
School of Business is no joke, so they lean on each other from an educational
standpoint, as well.  
  
Q. Do you think that they're maybe enjoying this a little bit more this
year because of what they went through last year?  
TERI MOREN: Oh, there's no question. I think last year our run in the NIT, I
think they were so much a part of that in terms of helping us prepare and get
ready, but when you've got the uniform on, it means something, and I'm sure it
is, it's special for them finally to be able to get out and finally to get to
the Big Ten Tournament and win their first game.  
  
Q. Bendu wasn't somebody who made the all-Big Ten defensive team, but do
you think she made somewhat of a statement today?  
TERI MOREN: She should have, and again, I don't know how that goes. I think
you have to not poll the coaches, maybe you've got to poll the players. Poll
Karissa McLaughlin, poll Kenisha Bell and some of the other guards that she's
had to guard throughout Big Ten play and realize that Bendu Yeaney is a
terrific defender, and she should have been on that all-defensive team.  
  
Q. You talked obviously about Ali. When you didn't have her when she was
injured you didn't have that three-point threat. How much does it add
offensively for you guys --  
TERI MOREN: Well, you could see. In the Iowa win, in the Purdue win, having
another scorer, scoring threat from beyond the arc, she's a great facilitator,
but she also gives everybody good juice. When she plays well, this basketball
team plays well.  
  
Q. Obviously Iowa a few weeks ago, coming back in game No. 2 against
them, does the game plan change?  
TERI MOREN: Well, we don't know if we'll tweak it a whole lot. Like I said,
there's no recipe for stopping Megan (Gustafson). She's just too good of a
player. No one has been able to figure out how to do that. What we were able
to do is get them out of rhythm in the second half by changing up what we were
doing defensively, and as luck would have it, I think, as hot as their guards
were in the first quarter, and you were there, you remember that, they cooled
off in the second half, and that was, I think, paramount to winning that game.  
  
Q. In a game of runs, Minnesota made a slight run end of the third
quarter, early in the fourth quarter. How were you guys able to get back to
Hoosier basketball?  
TERI MOREN: Well, we had to manufacture some shots, just really out of broken
plays. Doing that, I thought AP really was calm. Bendu at times, she got a
little sped up, which is uncommon, like I said, of Bendu. Jaelynn got a little
sped up. But I just thought Ali Patburg, she controlled the tempo for us, and
when things looked like they were getting ready to unravel, she was the
peacekeeper out there, I think, amongst her teammates.  
  
Q. How excited are you that this game did not go four overtimes?  
TERI MOREN: Yeah, we're going to be getting in a little bit earlier than
normal, getting to bed a little bit sooner. But this has been a terrific
afternoon of basketball, and this is what the Big Ten has been like all year,
us beating up on each other. Tonight's last game with Nebraska and Purdue is
not going to be any different. Big Ten has exciting players, exciting coaches,
exciting programs, and I hope we're garnering the respect that this league
deserves.  
  
Q. Obviously you didn't get to play the whole game against Minnesota
last time. How much did this game mean to you just to be able to play?  
ALI PATBERG: I mean, I try not to think about it, just getting hurt. But I was
just trying to do my best so we could get the win. That was the focus.  
  
Q. You were able to hit a few three-pointers. How much more confidence
did that give you guys do you feel like?  
ALI PATBERG: Yeah, we tried to come out, and we wanted to execute the plan
defensively. I think we did that early, and then shots were falling. I was
just trying to be aggressive for our team so they could be confident and be
aggressive themselves, so it worked.  
  
Q. I know Coach always talks about the first four minutes of each
quarter. You guys came out with an energy; how big of a focus was that for
you?  
ALI PATBERG: That was huge. I mean, Coach told us to come out with a lot of
juice, a lot of energy, come out the first four minutes, but then also keep
the foot on the pedal. And I think we did. We knew they were going to make
runs, and we sustained it and got the win.  
  
Q. At the end of the game you were kind of trying to slow it down, run
out the clock. What did you do to kind of overcome those last-second pressures
and finish off the game?  
ALI PATBERG: Yeah, we knew they were going to pressure us hard. They're a
really athletic team and they get up in you, and our goal was we knew time was
on our side, so we wanted to get a shot at the end of the shot clock, whether
that be a great shot or a decent shot, and that's what we did. We took the
clock out as far as we could. I think that kind of affects you offensively, if
you hold on to it.  
  
Q. Bendu, it seemed like made every shot. How important was she?  
ALI PATBERG: Bendu was amazing. Kenisha Bell, she's a great player, and Bendu
played awesome. She made her hit tough shots. The shots she hit, they were all
tough, and Bendu is an amazing defender. We had full confidence that was going
to happen?  
  
Q. You talked about you guys going on a run and you had to sustain a run
from them late in the third quarter, early in the fourth quarter. What did you
think was going on? Was it just them going on runs or was it you guys breaking
down?  
ALI PATBERG: Yeah, they weren't the seventh seed for no reason. They're a good
team. We knew they were going to make runs. It's a game of runs, and we just
had to stay calm, and once they started to cut it down, we just needed one
stop at a time or one offensive play at a time, and we sustained it.  
  
Q. Obviously Iowa, you guys had a pretty close game with them the first
time around. How tough do you think it's going to be to try to beat them a
second time?  
ALI PATBERG: You know, we beat them once, but that doesn't matter. They're
going to come out ready to play. But so are we. I know I'm confident, we're
confident that our coaches are going to have a great game plan, and we're
going to do our best to go out and play hard, play together and execute what
they want us to do.  
  
Q. It looked like you were genuinely having fun out there. Was there
like an excitement in this team?  
ALI PATBERG: I mean, we've said a lot recently, it's now or never. This is
what we've worked for all season, all off-season, to get to this moment. You
know, I wanted to make the most of it, and I think that our team is playing
our best when we're having fun, and when we're having fun, we're executing
what the coaches want us to do. We're playing hard, and we're playing
together, and that's fun. So winning is fun.  
  
Q. What's key for you guys going into the quick turnaround, coming back
tomorrow?  
ALI PATBERG: Yeah, you know, (strength coach) Mr. Rob is going to take care of
us. We're going to get a good dinner in tonight. We're going to get rest, take
care of our bodies, and we're going to come ready to play. You know, we're not
going to be able to use that excuse that we're tired. Right now it's
postseason. It doesn't matter. And we're going to come out and play hard.  
  
Q. I know the NCAA Tournament was a goal at the beginning of the season.
Is that on your minds at this point in the season, or is it just focusing on
what's at hand?  
ALI PATBERG: You know, it's focusing on one game at a time. That's what they
tell you to focus on, one win at a time, one team at a time, and that's what
we're going to focus on from here on out.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Suzy Merchant](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=17249)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan State - 68, Northwestern - 52  
  
Q. You turned up your three-point shooting and held them to 41 percent
(in the first meeting with Maryland). How are you feeling right now about your
chances (in the quarterfinals)?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, I mean, nothing in the past predicts your future, so we
know obviously they probably didn't play their best game when they played us,
and we were really -- I thought our kids did a great job. Everything was
clicking on all cylinders. We're just going to have to continue to move
forward. We've had some ups and downs. And Maryland is a heck of a team.
They're defending Big Ten Champions that we have to play, so it's not going to
be easy, and I'm sure they're looking forward to the battle tomorrow.  
  
Q. You really took advantage of the bench today. How do you plan on
using them going forward?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Yeah, that's the thing that I think we tried to do as much as
we could. I know there's kids on our team that we've played more, but I do
think we can go nine, ten deep. And even at the end of last game -- just
getting people off their feet for the last couple minutes in a game sometimes
helps to move forward when we have to play in back-to-back games. I know some
teams aren't that fortunate. They're five, six deep, and those kids log a lot
of minutes. I have a couple of kids on my team with long minutes, but I still
feel comfortable taking them out, even if it's just for one, two minutes and
get them back in.  
  
So the bench I think will help us as we continue forward and hopefully
tomorrow. They gave us a lot of good energy today.  
  
Q. The offense seemed to have some struggles at the start of the first
and second halves -- well, I should say the first and third quarters. How are
you going to be prepared to make a strong opening to, I guess, especially
against a great team like Maryland?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Well, some of that is -- I mean, sometimes it's a little bit of
nerves. I really don't know. But I thought the third quarter was the one that
bothered me the most coming out of the gates. They came and really scored the
ball well, and we just kind of had some easy looks we didn't really finish on.
So I called a time-out because we've had a few games that that's cost us. We
only scored six points in a quarter after scoring 27 in one. So we just had to
get some consistency and talk about it and say, we need people to step up.
This is kind of where it's do or die time. This is where the lulls of this
game, you can go for a minute or two, you can't go for a quarter like this. I
thought when we came out of that timeout we really started moving the ball
forward, and we got some stops. The beginning of the third we were scoring the
ball so our (indiscernible) wasn't as effective. So that was another reason we
weren't scoring as well.  
  
Q. What did you say in that timeout in the third quarter?  
SUZY MERCHANT: Just we've had quarters where we've only scored six points and
it's killed us. We can't have that. Like now is the time. We have to put our
foot down and get better and we need more leadership and people have to step
up. You can't miss lay-ups and then give up a lay-up, miss wide-open shots
that we leave. You're not going to get every shot you shoot, but it just
seemed like we were a little tentative and everybody was waiting for somebody
else to do it. And we wouldn't have survived that game if we had another six-
point quarter, because that's what happened to us at their place. It happened
three or four times throughout this year. And it's really bizarre because
we're scoring 20, 24, 27, then we just have a quarter where we just kind of go
away. That timeout was more about that, and I thought the kids came out and
did a really good job. And it's hard to design exactly what you want because
they're in the zone, right, so if it's a man, it's easy to come out and say,
all right, Shay, you're taking this or Taryn, we're getting Taryn a shot or
we're going inside or whatever. You can't do that against the zone
necessarily. You can kind of see what you're looking for. But it does take a
collective effort. So to be able to break that mold a little bit of us kind of
having a lull in scoring against the zone I thought was a real positive step
forward.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Joe McKeown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19252)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Michigan State - 68, Northwestern - 52.  
  
JOE McKEOWN: A hard-fought game. Offensively I think at times we just let our
offense affect our defense. In the first half, first quarter, we gave up way
more points than we normally do. When we beat Michigan State early in the
year, it was because of our defense. I thought in the third quarter we came
out, did a great job, came out, took the lead, but they made shots. They made
tough shots. They got in transition, and give them credit, too. Really proud
of our team. Had a lot of adversity this year with lineups and injuries, and
they fought through it all. We've got to give them a lot of credit. This is
Pallas' fourth Big Ten Tournament, and regardless, she ended up 5-4 playing in
this. I'm not sure anybody in any team over the last four years has played any
harder than her in this tournament. Really proud of her. I wish we could have
advanced, but again, give Michigan State credit.  
  
Q. (Abbie) Wolf had a great game today and obviously Pallas is a great
player, but next year she won't be here. What has she shown this season, and
kind of also today that's going to help her be a starter next year?  
JOE McKEOWN: I appreciate that. Abbie Wolf has had the best second half of the
Big Ten that we could even draw up ourselves. Really proud of her. She's grown
up. She has become such a threat on the block. Now she wants the ball. She's
much more aggressive. So really excited for her as a senior. She's got a great
work ethic. So I think this should be -- for us to play, too, hopefully we'll
continue to play this year, for her to get some postseason experience going
into her senior year. And, you know, she's a person that because of injury
hadn't played much this year, to now start to practice at a high level, too --
Courtney Shaw, that's a big, big off-season for her. She reminds me of Pallas
as a freshman. But Wolf, she's had a great finish for us in the Big Ten.  
  
Q. You touched on getting more experience in the postseason. What does
it mean especially for a young backcourt, Jordan, Lindsey, Veronica especially
going forward to get the postseason opportunities?  
JOE McKEOWN: Yeah, I recruited her, and I say this -- Jordan Hamilton is a
great college basketball player. She's been saddled this last month, so today
was rough for her. But to get her back, get some rest, with the way the floor
mats are, college basketball, our tournament, it ends this week. We won't know
until the following Monday if we'll continue to play. We hope we will. That
will give Jordan, Veronica, Lindsay Pulliam a chance to really get some
downtime. Really we could be a whole different team two weeks from now. But
they've all -- Veronica Burton, really surprised she didn't make the all-
freshman team. She's had an incredible year. I was a little disappointed in
that. She deserves it. But her, Jordan, Pulliam, Sydney Wood, we've got a
great foundation right now and great experiences that you learn from this and
you move on. You look at all the Big Ten games that came down for us, next
year we ended up .500, 9-9, could have easily been 12-6, and hopefully that
will -- we'll be able to do that next year.  
  
Q. You touched on that last year was four wins and this year had .500 in
the conference, maybe could have had more. What do you think have been the
biggest developments for you guys to take that stuff forward, and playing at
home has certainly helped, as well?  
JOE McKEOWN: Yeah, well, I'll tell you, to play well at Welsh-Ryan Arena, we
opened it, and the way we played against Duke, you know, that was just great
for our program. So I think we saw that all year, playing at home, what a
great environment it is. For us to go from four to nine wins in the league is
really important. We were close to cracking the top 25 a couple times this
year. We've got a lot to build on, a lot of positives. Obviously, as you said,
we'll miss Pallas and she's going to go on and play basketball for a long
time. But I think these guys are hungry and they're young. It gives you a lot
to look forward to.

CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Kevin McGuff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24835)

### [Dorka Juhasz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36593)

### [Carmen Grande](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36594)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Wisconsin - 73, Ohio State - 63  
  
COACH MCGUFF: We didn't play defense in the second half. We gave up 50 points
for -- in a half. We had talked about it before the game, we've got to be the
hardest playing team, and I think we were the hardest playing team in the
first half, but they played harder than we did in the second half, then we
quit defending, and that's what happens.  
  
Q. The way they shot, were those just open -- from outside, were those
just open looks?  
COACH MCGUFF: You know, I think they made some shots -- probably shot a little
better than they normally do, but we didn't adjust -- when they started making
shots, we didn't make an adjustment to get a little closer and contest those
shots to make them miss. Give them credit, they made a lot of big shots in the
second half.  
  
Q. Offensively you started it seemed in a pretty good flow and then just
started the second half, didn't really --  
COACH MCGUFF: We really looked -- we quit -- first of all, in the first half
we were running in transition and really playing aggressively, and in the
second half we didn't do that. We also just didn't move ourselves with the
ball very well in the second half.  
  
Q. It ended up being the same result as Rutgers the last time out,
leading all the way into the fourth quarter and then kind of a collapse. Did
you feel like the team put that loss behind it going into this game?  
COACH MCGUFF: I thought so. I thought we were fine mentally. Like I said, we
really got away from our plan, which was defending and rebounding.  
  
Q. How tough of a result is it to have it go the same way and you guys
were up the entire game?  
COACH MCGUFF: Yeah, it's tough, really tough. We've had success at this
tournament, and we didn't have it today. But as I told them, we didn't play
hard enough in the second half, and you don't get a chance to do it over.  
  
Q. You lost the lead at Michigan, you lost the lead last week against
Rutgers. What do you take away with this group from that?  
COACH MCGUFF: We've had -- on both sides of it -- we were down 18 at Penn
State -- we've been on both sides of it. But usually the thing that's really
been consistent for us has been our defense. That really was the key. We
didn't defend.  
  
Q. Did you feel like you guys put that Rutgers loss behind you, kind of
a similar result this game? You guys were up all three quarters and then
fourth quarter just kind of collapses?  
CARMEN GRANDE: I definitely thought it it was behind us because we had a good
first half against Rutgers, and then we kind of like -- nobody could pass or
catch against the pressure, so that's never helpful. But coming into here, it
was a fresh new game, and I don't think we thought about that much.  
  
Q. How would you kind of characterize that second half? Was it more
defensive lapses or did they just catch fire?  
CARMEN GRANDE: Well, I think that they were making -- well, in the tourney you
make shots initially maybe you don't make, but at the same time, we were not
there to contest them, so like there's more chance of them making them. And
just the energy, yeah.  
  
Q. How tough is this for you knowing that this is maybe one of your last
games?  
CARMEN GRANDE: Well, I mean, I've had four great years at Ohio State here, but
I definitely don't want it to end. Like if I could buy another year, I would.
So I don't like it.  
  
Q. Having played these guys twice and won twice, and I know you had a
lead at home and they came back, did that play into it, the fact that you were
so familiar with them? Did they do things differently in this game?  
CARMEN GRANDE: You definitely adapt when you've played them more, and we've
played them recently, so I think it played in favor of both of the teams
because like we knew each other's tendencies and stuff like that, and we
didn't have to like go back to three months ago and see what the other team
did. Like we just had it fresh.  
  
Q. Your team started so strong offensively and just seemed to be in the
flow, and then that kind of -- the longer it went, it seemed like you got more
and more frustrated with their zone. How did you feel you guys played
offensively?  
CARMEN GRANDE: I think that we were not getting the best looks that we get, so
props to them because they had a match-up zone that was tough. Just, I guess,
not making a shot, kind of getting ahead of ourselves, and then not getting a
stop. But yeah, props to them. Their defense was great, and we didn't have the
right mind to attack it.  
  
Q. Can you just talk about what happened from your perspective? You had
a strong rebounding game, but the offense just didn't seem to be what it
should be.  
DORKA JUHASZ: Yes, I would say in the first half we started really good. We
gave it a really good start, like toughness, and just like going for every
board, rebounds, and I don't know what happened, but we came out and they just
got I don't know how much run, but they got a really good run. They were
tougher. It's hard to say, but they were tougher. They got the rebounds. They
made every shot, every threes, and it's just hard if they start falling in.
Then we just didn't complete -- or I don't know what happened, but it was
definitely hard.  
  
Q. You prided yourself all year on being so tough and having to be
scrappy. How does it go away? Do they just -- Wisconsin just seemed to seize
on and became the tougher team today it seemed.  
DORKA JUHASZ: There were like harder moments when our shots did not fall. We
cannot score any -- they were just scoring and scoring from three, and they
shot around 70 percent from three, which is really amazing. And we knew that
it will be like we beat them twice, but we knew that tournament, it's another
-- all the teams are new. Everybody is coming for something, and we did not
achieve our goal.  
  
Q. What do you take from this season, this learning experience? You're a
freshman; this is painful. It'll be a whole new team this year except for a
few of you. What do you take from that?  
DORKA JUHASZ: I would think that this season was a great learning season for
me especially as a freshman. I got a lot of playing time, and I think after my
injury it was a good year for me. But definitely just like how the season
goes, how we have to start in the non-conference games hard, and we have to
win games there. So for the Big Ten we have to be the best team that we can
be. For the tournament, we have to focus every game just like step by step,
and definitely will be a good just like learning experience that now it didn't
go in our way.  
  
Q. The Big Ten Tournament ends early, but it looks like you guys are
going to be able to play a little bit more for the WNIT coming up. What's
there left to play for for the couple of seniors you have?  
DORKA JUHASZ: I think we should just give what we have left and show that we
are better than this, and for the rest of the games just give our best and
finish a great season together.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2019

  

### [Coquese Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18021)

### [Teniya Page](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32663)

### [Karisma Ortiz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36566)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Wisconsin - 65, Penn State - 57  
  
Q. Coach, you guys were able to kind of fight back in it in the third
and fourth quarter and get into a three-point game late. What does that say
about your group that's down double digits and able to still come back and
keep fighting?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: I thought we had some good spurts defensively in the
second half and showed a lot of fight. I thought the foul trouble, Lauren Ebo
picking up her fourth foul in the fourth kind of hurt our momentum there for a
second and allowed them to -- we were kind of coming back, and her fourth
foul, I thought that was a pretty big play for us.  
  
Q. You had two freshmen that started and three freshmen that got playing
time. What do you say about that group and kind of the experience that they
can get from their first postseason play?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, I think there's a lot of lessons for them to learn.
The first time you play in this tournament it's certainly a learning
experience, the atmosphere, the time and being here. I'm hoping it gives them
a bit of a hunger to come back next year and stick around a little bit longer.  
  
Q. Kind of on the flipside of that, you have seniors who are leaving the
program. What has that group meant to you and what are you hoping that they
can kind of pass on for the younger players?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, you know, it's always an emotional game for the
seniors, their last game. Being in the space where they've got to move on to
the next phase of their lives, and the one thing I can say about this group,
these five seniors that we have, is they're ready. They're ready for the next
level, the next step in their lives. They're ready to graduate from Penn
State. They've been tremendous scholars and the experiences that they had
being a Lady Lion and being a Penn Stater I think are things they're going to
carry with them the rest of their lives, so they're ready for the next phase
for sure.  
  
Q. What about Teniya specifically, what she's been able to do for the
program and all the accolades that she's --  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Yeah, she's a kid that has a tremendous work ethic and an
outstanding basketball IQ, and I think those two things combined helped her to
come here and put her fingerprints all over the record book and rack up
scoring titles and accrue some of the accolades that she has. It's definitely
a result of the work that she puts into her game.  
  
Q. You guys played Wisconsin twice close during the regular season and
then today. What's kind of the difference between this postseason match-up
today that you guys had versus kind of the first two?  
COQUESE WASHINGTON: Well, I think the first two games were fairly close. They
were competitive games, and I think that Wisconsin came in with a little bit
of a chip on their shoulder, feeling that they let two get away from them
during the regular season, and they wanted to right that wrong, so to speak. I
thought they came out and played with tremendous heart. I thought they came
out and played with tremendous energy. And I thought specifically Lewis and
Howard took advantage of the speed that they had, the speed mismatch they had
against our bigs, and then when we went small, they kind of went inside on us.
That was a tough match-up for us. And those two played with a lot of energy
and a lot of toughness.  
  
Q. Thoughts on the game today?  
TENIYA PAGE: I mean, there's been a lot of games this year we've fought
through, and I mean, it's just what happened. Everybody fell back and
everybody still had confidence we could win the game.  
  
Q. You guys had two freshmen that started and some younger players that
got some experience and things like that. What have you seen from that group,
not only today but this year, that they've been able to develop?  
TENIYA PAGE: Everybody has grown a lot since we started. I don't know when,
feels like a long time ago. I mean, they got the experience. All of them have
years of eligibility left, so it's good for them, and they have this
experience going for them the rest of their careers. Best of luck to them, and
I'm happy that they got the chance to get this experience.  
  
Q. Obviously it's a tough ending for you, but what does it mean for you
to wrap everything up but then also what do you look to kind of leave for this
group?  
TENIYA PAGE: I mean, they all know I didn't quit, and I kept fighting through
whatever I had to get through, and for the people that saw me last year
through my ankle injury and for the people that saw me this year with another
ankle injury, I kept fighting every day. I mean, I feel like it's something I
can lean on, the ability to work hard and continue to push through whatever is
going on. That's pretty much it. I mean, as far as it ending, things happen.
It was four years, and I've learned a lot of lessons through those four years,
a lot of lessons. Obviously I'm disappointed with the outcome, but it's life.
It happens, and all I can do is move on from it and learn from it.  
  
Q. Kind of looking at the game as a whole and your first kind of Big Ten
Tournament action, what were you able to take away just kind of an experience
of the trip as a whole and kind of what postseason play can be like?  
KARISMA ORTIZ: Probably just making sure you're valuing every single opponent
you're playing. Postseason, anything can happen. Every team is going to fight.
Every team is going to want it. At this point, it's whoever wants it more. It
doesn't matter what the rankings, the seedings are, anything like that.
Whoever wants it more is going to win the game.  
  
Q. Did you notice any differences from when you played them in the
regular season versus today?  
KARISMA ORTIZ: Not too many differences. I think they played really well. I
thought they did a good job of making reads off of our defense. Nothing too
different. They crashed the boards a little bit -- very well. We did a better
job of keeping them off the glass before. But other than that, they played
just about the same.  
  
Q. You guys were able to make a comeback in the third quarter there,
start of the fourth. What does that say about the group as a whole that you
fought back in it from being down double digits?  
KARISMA ORTIZ: It means a lot. A lot of hard work, determination. We've never
really been a team that's going to give up, and I think you saw that
throughout the season with every single team that we've played. So it was good
to see in the third quarter.  
  
Q. And then finally, just obviously the graduating seniors, what are you
able to take away from that group and what have they meant to you this year
and hopefully going forward?  
KARISMA ORTIZ: Definitely a lot, just having both Teniya and Amari (Carter),
both senior point guards, and being that that's my position, I was able to get
a lot of great information from them, learn from them, a lot of advice. Going
to miss them next year, but I think they prepared me very well for the
upcoming seasons, and I'm ready and excited for them.

## March 6, 2019

  

### [Sharon Versyp](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16880)

### [Lyndsey Whilby](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36569)

### [Karissa McLaughlin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36570)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 72, Illinois - 60  
  
Q. Can you speak to the performance from your bench today?  
SHARON VERSYP: Well, everybody has to step up, you know, and we got into some
foul trouble, and then others just played really well. And I thought Nyagoa
came in and did some great things defensively rebounding wise. And obviously
Whilby coming in and was a huge X factor on both ends of the floor. Scoring 14
points was big, attacking the hole as well as shooting the ball. Those are
things that -- the ball was falling in, and it was good because a lot of
people were shooting the ball well, so it kind of opened things up for
everybody.  
  
Q. Do you expect to get that type of performance all around from
multiple players today?  
SHARON VERSYP: I mean, everybody said they wanted to step up and help their
team, so this is what we needed all season consistently. But again, we're a
very immature young team, but we have to play consistent in order to do well,
especially in a tournament like this. We've got to have the right mindset,
everybody has got to be confident and bring their part and their game.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to next game, what do you want to bring to this game?  
SHARON VERSYP: Same thing. We just want to bring the same type of energy, same
type of offense, clicking, being aggressive. And then I thought our defense
was very solid for a good three and-a-half quarters, so that's something that
we want to do.  
  
Q. Are those all the things you worked on in practice?  
SHARON VERSYP: We've been working on it all year. Just when people start
knocking down shots, it just opens up for everybody else, and it just builds
confidence with everybody else.  
  
Q. How important was that third quarter run you guys went on?  
SHARON VERSYP: Oh, any time you can have a run in any of the quarters it's
important to try to cause a team to, I guess, doubt themselves a little bit.
So we really came out strong, were able to make a good stretch, and we did it
on the defensive end rebounding and then being able to get down the floor and
score in transition, which we haven't done very well.  
  
Q. How did you get your groove back a little bit today?  
KARISSA McLAUGHLIN: It felt good, especially now that we're in postseason. But
everyone had their groove back. Everyone was playing with energy. Our key
players were hitting big-time shots, and that's what we needed. So people
stepped up when they needed to, and it was phenomenal to see.  
  
Q. What was the game plan to shut down Alex Wittinger? She usually has
about 15 points.  
KARISSA McLAUGHLIN: Yeah, we were trying to double-team her and we were trying
to get the ball out of her hands as much as possible. Ae'Rianna and
(indiscernible), they did a great job making sure she got it out far away from
the basket so she wasn't able to score as easy. And we knew going in she was
rebounding like phenomenal, so we had key players that stepped up and played
great defense on her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Lyndsey's performance off the bench?  
KARISSA McLAUGHLIN: She was phenomenal tonight. I mean, she played out of her
mind. She was hitting the big-time shots that she needed to. This is the
confidence that she needed, so I'm so happy for her that she gained this
confidence going into the postseason, and hopefully she can carry it out
tomorrow, as well.  
  
Q. Was there an emphasis on kind of speeding the tempo up today?  
KARISSA McLAUGHLIN: Yeah, we tried to control the tempo from the very get-go,
and I think that we did that. Kayana, being our point guard, she tries to push
the ball as much as possible, and that really gets us going, and I think that
we continue to do that and we'll be successful.  
  
Q. What was your focus today off the bench?  
LYNDSEY WHILBY: Just wanted to win the game. Wanted to help the team anyway I
could.  
  
Q. Did you kind of expect to have the performance you did today?  
LYNDSEY WHILBY: No. I mean, I just wanted to help the team anyway I can. Today
was just the day that the ball went in for me.  
  
Q. Is this kind of the performance that you think you're expecting to
have because you're been doing this all season.  
LYNDSEY WHILBY: Yeah, just trying to be consistent and keep it going, yeah.  
  
Q. Can you speak kind of to the team performance once you went to the
team? Usually your team kind of struggles once you get to the bench, but today
you had an explosion.  
LYNDSEY WHILBY: We just played defense, and our defense turned into offense,
so that's what helped us.

## March 6, 2019

  

### [Jonathan Tsipis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32631)

### [Marsha Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32633)

### [Imani Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36567)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Wisconsin - 65, Penn State - 57  
  
Q. First off, when Imani picked up that third foul early in the third,
you sat her for the rest of it. You guys maintained the lead mostly and then
they started going on that 9-0 run towards the end. What happened in that
three or four-minute span?  
JONATHAN TSIPIS: Yeah, I thought I got a better -- we were still trying to mix
defenses up, and I thought they caught us a little bit in the zone. My
thoughts were 'could I stretch it and get her to the 4th? Could I sneak her in
and put her in the zone and everything?' And when they went a little bit
small, too, I thought that hurt us because I didn't feel like that would play
for us to be able to play man-to-man. And again, when they made that run, that
was the one time, too. I felt like they got a couple good pushes in
transition. And again, they're so explosive -- (Teniya) Page had 36 here last
year in this first-round game. All of a sudden they start stringing those
together. And again, we just kind of made that choice to try to keep her for
the whole fourth, and if she did get one, then at least we would get (Abby)
Laszewski rested a little bit, or if we needed to, we could have played
(Kelly) Karlis with four guards. Again, during that run, the one thing I
didn't think we gave up is we didn't -- we weren't giving up offensive
rebounds. All of a sudden, that's why I liked keeping both in the game.  
  
Q. Every game that you've now coached in this tournament has been a
single-digit game. I guess it's a good thing obviously on days like today when
you win, but what makes your team so tough in a tournament-style setting
because that's a trend now?  
JONATHAN TSIPIS: Yeah, I mean, last year we dug a big hole, came all the way
back, and Cayla McMorris drives and the ball goes in and the whistle goes off
in a three-point game, and if it's a block, she has a chance to tie it and
they call a charge. You've got to credit the kids. It's resiliency. You hope
-- we try to, again, when you're in March, you have some wrinkles in, but
again, I think we talk about this experience all the time with them of leading
up into it.  
  
We play a tournament at Thanksgiving, whether it's tropical or it was in
Nashville this year to simulate that, play three days and three nights. So the
kids, again, when they come in here, you don't want them thinking this is
something they haven't done before, and it's -- to steal and borrow from
different people, that's what we've done. And again, I just think -- I know
our staff did a great job preparing. Second year in a row we get somebody for
the third time. Again, I think making sure they believed -- I felt like the
first two games against Penn State we had opportunities to win the game, we
just didn't finish it out. And again, I think they saw that on film.  
  
I think the win today started about halfway through the third quarter of the
Michigan game because we're down 26, there's three and-a-half minutes left,
and it's easy to just pack it up, get on the bus and go to the Big Ten
Tournament, and our kids fought.  
  
Q. Your first-ever conference tournament game, and from the get-go,
first two possessions, you score and kind of set the tone and you really were
humming offensively. Second quarter, you didn't score as much, but defensively
you were making it happen. For you as such a young player in your first ever
Big Ten Conference Tournament, how were you able to make such an impact?  
IMANI LEWIS: Before the game, my dad talked to me. He said just play hard.
Just give everything you have, and he was like, you never know what could
happen throughout the game, but no matter what happens always keep your head
held high and never give up. And even for me, like the seniors said, we don't
want this to be our last game, and I said, I got you, it won't be your last
game. So it's just keeping my head always focused in the game and always just
listening and being mindful of what's going on.  
  
Q. When you were out with foul trouble in the third quarter, at the end
of the third, beginning of the fourth, they went on a 9-0 run and cut it
really close and then you get inserted back into the lineup. What were the
conversations with your team as they were making that run and getting close?
Did you tighten up at all or did you still feel confident?  
IMANI LEWIS: We felt confident, and I told them, I said, you guys, you just
got to go out there and be yourselves. I said, there's no need for you to be
worried, nervous or nothing. It's just basketball. We're all basketball
players, we're all the same. Don't worry, just do what you do, but no matter
what, just play hard and be physical.  
  
Q. Imani was talking about how she was going to make sure that this was
not the seniors' final game. Did you kind of feel the same way coming into
this game, like this is not going to be my last game?  
MARSHA HOWARD: I sent out a group text to everyone just letting them know like
this could potentially be it for me and Kelly, but we weren't going down
without a fight, and just for everyone to play confident, play together
through all ups and downs, just keep battling. And then the response I got
back from my teammates was just, let's go, like we're not going to let y'all
go out like this, like we're going to continue to fight, and whatever the
outcome is, we're going to do it together.  
  
Q. You really came on in that second half, scoring and rebounding
especially. What was kind of your goal there, especially as Penn State was
getting close for a while?  
MARSHA HOWARD: Offensively it was a slow start, but I continued to crash the
boards the entire game, getting us extra possessions or limiting them to one
shot a possession. With them just having so many shooters around the perimeter
and big bodies inside, just trying to get us as many possessions as possible,
and then when the opportunity presented itself for me to get a bucket, that's
when things started to roll in.

# [BIG TEN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=BIG+TEN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 6, 2019

  

### [Nancy Fahey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34685)

  
_Indianapolis, Indiana_  
  
Purdue - 72, Illinois - 60  
  
Q. You guys really played well in the first half, especially in the
second quarter. Offensively you guys were really clicking at a high rate, and
that third quarter you took a big dip. What was it that really made you guys
struggle offensively?  
NANCY FAHEY: Part of it was the boards. Let's talk the other end, because they
got several offensive boards. We were trying to run some triangle-and-two, and
they had several -- that's why I think they punched it, and I also think that
they decided to get up in us a lot. They switched defenses, which we knew they
were going to do, but I really thought it was the other end when they just got
two or three second opportunities.  
  
Q. Big picture, if you're outside looking in, you look at the win total
and go, oh, another tough year, but you did take some strides moving forward.
What steps did you take forward this year?  
NANCY FAHEY: I think the competitiveness of the team. I mean, like you said,
we were in a lot more ballgames. We fought a lot longer. Our margins were
bigger last year, but I think the attitude in the locker room, it hurts more
because we got closer, and the expectations are wins, and we understand that.
But there's things you can't see unless you come to every one of our games and
see, and like even today when they punched it, there would have been easy
chances for us to, okay, it's done, and we kept fighting, and that's all I can
ask right now.  
  
Q. You lose one of the better players in the program's history. I know
it's not an easy answer, but how do you keep moving forward losing a player of
her caliber?  
NANCY FAHEY: Well, I think every team in the Big Ten is going to lose an
impact player, and one thing you don't do is replace. You don't go, how are
you going to -- you let Alex, her legacy is fantastic, got her rebound record
today. There's so much she's done for the program. But you let the new kids
step into their roles and let them develop their own legacy and move forward
and let the things that -- like I told her, her effort, how hard she works,
that carries on with the team.  
  
Q. Moving forward to the next year, I know it's so immediate afterwards,
but what do you want to see in your team as they continue to move forward in a
positive direction?  
NANCY FAHEY: Well, you bring in players that -- the quickness of the Big Ten,
the size of the Big Ten, you have to kind of -- you have to go out there --
Harris just picked up a couple basketballs off our heads tonight with her
incredible leaping ability. We'll still be fundamentally strong, but you just
keep working and developing the players here and you go out and do your job
recruiting.  
  
Q. The seasons always end abruptly no matter when they are. Can you
reflect back on the things that have happened this season and the progress the
program has made?  
NANCY FAHEY: You know, part of it is just the locker room I left, I asked them
did you fight all 40, and the response of the kids is yes. And if you saw
their looks in their eyes and how competitive, that's what we try to -- that's
what we tried to be this year. Obviously someone asked me if we had a
successful season; no, we want to win more ballgames. But you have to look
beyond that and how we played our games this year and how close they were and
the fight in the kids' eyes. Success is defined in a lot of different ways,
and we have to define it in both ways, and we understand that.  
  
Q. The legacy of Alex Wittinger, she got the blocks record and the
rebound record today. Can you reflect back on what she's meant to the program?
Certainly nobody works harder than Alex does.  
NANCY FAHEY: Alex has an incredible motor. As a coach, you never want to coach
energy and effort, and she checks those boxes the minute I've got here. And
that's what translates. I think it's interesting to get the block record
because that's a lot of effort, timing, and just pure like -- like I said,
just a gut kind of player, and that's why it's so fitting that she got that
block record today.  
  
Q. On the flipside, you have a freshman Mackenzie Blazek that comes in,
Alex got in foul trouble, and we saw the growth of her over the year, but
certainly you can kind of see her potential today.  
NANCY FAHEY: Well, if you have to play Alex every day in practice, you hope
that that gets better. But her confidence, and more importantly, it didn't
just come because she thought it. She showed up in the gym, put extra time in.
There's an attitude with her that I think is really positive as we look
forward.  
  
Q. What can you learn from the game today? Purdue shot well, obviously
rebounding was a big factor. Anything else you take away from today?  
NANCY FAHEY: Well, we ran a triangle-and-two, and so you kind of gamble a
little bit. We left some kids open that -- and they responded. You try to play
that offense, defensive game, and when that kind of turned, then the boxing, I
thought that was a key factor that we just couldn't get -- we got the stops,
but we couldn't get the board. And I think that related to our offense because
then we had to go down and play five on five a lot.  
  
Q. The first half shot 50 percent, really shot well and was in the game,
took a lead. I liked the energy from the team, especially in the first half.  
NANCY FAHEY: Yeah, I mean, energy, and it's tough when they did that popping
just to maintain it. I think that's one of the things that we came into the
game believing we could do. It didn't work out in the second half when they
kind of got up and in us, but like I said, the things that are going on in
this team are positive.  
  
Q. Finally, how do you approach the off-season?  
NANCY FAHEY: Go back to work. As coaches, we go out and recruit, do our jobs,
and I know these kids will work hard, get better in a lot of little facets.
But this team has never lacked for getting back in the gym and working hard.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Gordy Presnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23338)

### [Marta Hermida](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32779)

### [Braydey Hodgins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34852)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 68, Wyoming - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State head coach Gordy Presnell and
student-athletes Marta Hermida and Braydey Hodgins. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH PRESNELL: I want to say congratulations on a great season to Wyoming.
Joe Legerski is a fantastic coach, and they're very, very hard to guard and
play against. And he has a great staff. And so they've had a great year.  
  
Really proud of our players. It's a great group. It's a great group to be
around. I've coached for about 32 years. It's the closest knit group as I've
ever been around. And I thought they played very well today.  
  
So with that, I want to also thank my family and our administration, our
athletic director and SWA and president, we're all here, and I appreciate
that. And thank all these players that have made my life so great in the last
three months.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. It's becoming old hat to go up the ladder and cut down the nets.
What's it feel like to go do it again tonight for the third year in a row and
the fourth time in five years and just the emotions when he you held up the
net and looked at the crowd?  
COACH PRESNELL: Just the culmination, it all started July 6, and we have a
terrific strength coach and athletic trainer, and it's just it's a long
process, and everyone believed and bought in. And I think we all put it
together today.  
  
And it's just a little moment, you take a little mental picture of getting up
on the net and looking around. That's a fun one, that's for sure.  
  
Q. Probably got tired of me asking throughout the season, I kept asking
are you going to be able to get in if you don't win the tournament. To be able
to not leave any doubt and to take care of business yourselves and get back to
the Big Dance, what's that feeling like?  
COACH PRESNELL: I'm just so proud of them and they executed so well, our game
plan. And our defense was terrific tonight. That's Cody Butler, he did our
defense and they communicated so well. And offensively we performed.  
  
And today I think we were 42 RPI and we beat a 60, so maybe we'll get in there
a little higher and possibly get a neutral-court game. We'll see.  
  
Q. Wyoming's coach just said in the press conference that he couldn't
match your guys' experience in that starting lineup. Obviously you guys work
on strategy as coaches, but how much do you guys have to kind of pump these
girls up and help them mentally? Is there anything left to do for you?  
COACH PRESNELL: They kind of are self-starters and we're just a team of early
risers. And everyone's always early for everything.  
  
And they're just really a wonderful group to coach. And I've done this for a
long time. And just so blessed to be a part of their lives.  
  
Q. Braydey, I saw you leave the court with about 1:07 left, got a big
cheer from the crowd and I think you hugged all your teammates. Did you say
anything in particular and what were you thinking at that moment?  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I didn't say anything in particular, gave them hugs. We
couldn't be here without all of them. Whether they played one minute or zero
minutes, I think everyone got in tonight, mostly everyone. So we wouldn't be
in this position if we didn't have them all season.  
  
And sometimes they go unnoticed because they're not in the box score or
they're not making those huge contributions on the floor, but what you guys
don't see is what they do in practice or what they do on the bench that maybe
goes unnoticed like making sure we're in the right defense, making sure that
we talk through switches or knowing who is where. So I think it's really
imperative that we have that experience on the bench and all those people who
contribute.  
  
Q. That second quarter you guys really started to assert yourself and
built a little bit of a lead. Talk about the second quarter there. And then in
the second half anytime that they tried to get somewhat of momentum you were
able to keep them arm's length the rest of the way?  
MARTA HERMIDA: Yeah, I think that we did a great job like trying to get the
pace of the game the whole time. And we did a great job on defense and we knew
like as soon as we stopped them, then we can run and do our plays and we did.
That's what we did today.  
  
Q. Knowing that it wasn't a sure thing as far as the NCAAs, did that
even focus you even more tonight?  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I definitely say no because we don't really look ahead like
that. And everyone wants to talk about, well, you're on the bubble; you could
get in; you could do this. But we just focus on the now and tonight it was
beating Wyoming.  
  
So we assert ourselves in that conversation and then we punch our own ticket.
So we don't need the outsiders or the doubters who really say we shouldn't be
in there despite our record and despite how successful we are. So we just had
to take care of business ourselves and punch our own tickets there.  
  
Q. I know you've been saying recently that Jayde is a good 3-point
shooter, but the one she hit from just inside half court, you were pretty
excited. It kind of really sealed the deal there. It was probably over anyway,
but to have her hit the shot and kind of know it was over, what was that like
for you?  
COACH PRESNELL: She went 3-for-3 from 3 and people weren't guarding her, and
they were going under her on ball screens. And so she hit a couple. And then I
think she got a technical. Well, she did get a technical. And I guess she made
up for it with about a 40-foot launch. And it was just kind of a culmination
of a long season and knowing that we kind of won it with that shot.  
  
Q. You mentioned maybe getting the neutral-site game, being a 12 or
higher. Obviously stuff can happen in the next couple of days, but having to,
the last couple of years, play the 1 and 2 seeds on their home court, what
would it mean to you guys to get the 12 or higher and be able to have more of
a fair shot in that first game?  
COACH PRESNELL: We just want to see what we can do. And it's pretty hard when
you go play a Tennessee or a Louisville or a UCLA or a -- who else we play? A
George Washington. It would be nice to be on a neutral site just to see. I
know it will be a very formidable opponent, but it would be fun preparing and
just see if we could play someone on neutral floor.  
  
Q. Braydey, you have played in the Mountain West Tournament championship
game every single year. Every single you've gone to the NCAA Tournament. Does
it get harder or easier as you go along?  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I definitely say it gets harder just because the pressure
gets bigger. Me and Riley just hugged after the game saying we're 9-0 in this
tournament. That's something we take pride in. We don't ever want to walk off
that floor crying. We want to be crying because we're happy about what we just
accomplished.  
  
We're just happy to be here and be in this position and have teammates like
Marta and others who are able to kind of lead the way. Marta is a senior.
She's been here before. It's not her first rodeo, nor is it ours. But backing
on that leadership is really something special. And I wouldn't want it any
other way.  
  
Q. Marta, as a senior, could you have drawn it up, the script, any
better to be able to win it as a senior, cut down the nets, get to go play in
the NCAA Tournament again?  
MARTA HERMIDA: No. No. Like I came here my first year. I lost the first game.
I promise I cried more than ever. After that I've never lost here and I don't
want to have that feeling.  
  
So I was leaving this year and I'm, like, I'm not going to leave here losing.
So, yeah, it's a great feeling. I'm glad that I did this with Joyce, since my
freshman year. And I'm glad to have teammates like Braydey and Riley and every
single one that was here today. Winning this together, that's the most special
part for me right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 13, 2019

  

### [Joe Legerski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13841)

### [Marta Gomez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36689)

### [Bailee Cotton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36690)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 68, Wyoming - 51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming head coach Joe Legerski and student-
athletes Bailee Cotton and Marta Gomez. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH LEGERSKI: I thought tonight's game, Boise State played as well as I've
witnessed. I thought they were really the aggressor tonight, both offensively
and defensively. Made us rush in some things that we normally take our time
with.  
  
We didn't get the shots to go down that we needed early. I thought we got off
to a good start. And then they made a run in the second quarter that it seemed
like we could never recover from.  
  
We had it cut to 11 a couple of times and missed some open looks. And then
Boise just came back and, like I said, they played extremely well. And I give
them all the credit, because definitely they were the aggressor.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach. Questions?  
  
Q. For any of the players, just as Coach said, seemed as Boise was
clicking on all cylinders tonight. What was the most frustrating thing? Was it
just shots not falling or you having trouble defending them? From your guys'
perspective, what was the most frustrating aspect?  
MARTA GOMEZ: Well, I think just, we couldn't get going. They were defending us
really well. And then they were just, on offense they're a really good team.
And I think it was hard for us to just get going both defensively and
offensively, and that kind of frustrated everybody. And then once they made
the run, as Coach said, we just couldn't figure out a way to come back.  
  
Q. Did you feel like -- they were hitting shots seemed like endlessly.
Do you feel like your defense was pretty good and they were just making shots
or were they doing something that was exploiting something that you were
trying to do defensively?  
BAILEE COTTON: Their offense with running their on-balls is well executed, so
when we were able to take away their shooters they were able to find their
bigs. So it was tough to defend it overall, and they were able to find their
open kids when they needed to. And honestly they just executed it better than
we did.  
  
Q. The second quarter, they really seemed to bog you guys down
offensively. Did you feel like that was the difference in the game when
they're scoring just about every time down the floor?  
BAILEE COTTON: Yeah. Yeah, it was a little -- they had all the energy in that
second quarter. And so it's tough to come back when your shots aren't falling
and they're getting everything that they shoot; they were getting 3s. We were
trading 2s for 3s. And so it was just tough to get our energy back.  
  
Q. I know you guys will probably play in the WNIT again this year, but
is this one a little more disappointing just because of how close you guys
were tonight in getting to the championship round?  
MARTA GOMEZ: Yeah, it is just getting here and getting beat is never fun. But
I think we need to stay with the fact that we actually made it here.  
  
We are the first one in Wyoming to make it. So I think that's pretty big. And
it didn't end up well for us, but I'm pretty sure that there's more of this to
come for the freshmen and for the rest of the team.  
  
Q. Joe, you guys obviously getting this far and it was competitive with
you and Boise State kind of on top of the regular standings this whole year,
is the program, this league closing the gap on Boise State, do you feel at
all? Or what's your take on that?  
A. I look back the last three years, we have been in the top 3. And last
year we played Boise State for a championship. And they ended up getting that
victory to secure the championship. So it's a situation where we split with
them a year ago. We split again this year.  
  
But there is no doubt they were the better team tonight. And I think their
experience of playing in these big games really makes a difference.  
  
When I take a look at this team that we played tonight, they basically had
five players in double digits scoring. You take a look at four in doubles, one
at eight, and that put a lot of pressure on us because they were scoring from
every position. So it wasn't like you could focus on one player.  
  
And I think Marta said it best in the locker room tonight: If you would have
asked us in September if we were going to be in the championship game, I don't
think anybody would have said yes.  
  
We had to replace Liv Roberts, the player of the year from last year, so I
give credit to this group. It's a disappointing night. But they'll figure out
that they were a team that got to the championship game, and that's something
that they need to hold their heads high about.  
  
Q. There will be postseason, probably WNIT. Is that something you look
forward to as seniors to continue to play even though it's not probably what
the goal was since you wanted to win this championship and play in the NCAA
Tournament? You look forward to playing another game, at least another game
here soon?  
MARTA GOMEZ: That's definitely a plus right now after losing this game because
we really have a special group this year. We really have a special team. And
we just want to keep playing as many games as we can together and just keep
enjoying the year that we've had. It's been pretty big so far. So we just look
forward to what's coming next and just keep enjoying the ride.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 12, 2019

  

### [Jaime White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28473)

### [Aly Gamez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34816)

### [Candice White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32758)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 89, Fresno State - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State coach Jaime White and student-
athletes Aly Gamez and Candice White. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH WHITE: Obviously, disappointed in the outcome. I thought we started
okay. I thought that we ended the first half and we're still feeling good
about things. I thought that third quarter bothered us. We let them hit some
shots.  
  
I mean, credit to them. They hit some big shots and stretched that lead. And
it was just a little bit too much that we couldn't get back into it. Proud of
these two. Aly's come to us last year and she's been running the point guard
spot, and really allowed Candice to be more of a shooting guard, and I think
that's helped her.  
  
But Aly's really given us toughness every day, and Candice has consistently
scored for us and been the leading scorer in the Mountain West consecutive
years, which has been nice.  
  
You're proud of your kids for the fight that they had. I don't think they ever
hung their heads. I thought Katelin Noyer came in and gave us a push at the 5
spot. And Maddi Utti was solid again. I think Boise is a good team and they do
some things that bothered us, and we were just a couple of baskets away from
making a good run.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. This is -- last game they set the single tournament game record with
37 points from Braydey. Tonight, Marta has 30 points, which is the third most
in tournament history. What is it about this Boise State team that seems to be
hard to control those scorers?  
COACH WHITE: Their 3-point shooting, I'm sure anybody would say. With Lupfer
and Hodgins and you have Marta, who doesn't always hit them but surely hit
them tonight. And we put her at the free-throw line there at the end for eight
of those points.  
  
So they're tough. I think they're tough defensively. They make you play out
away from the basket a little bit more. And they've got good speed with
Coleman, Coleman's one of the quicker posts in the league, and Harrell. I
think both of them defend well.  
  
And actually I thought we did a really good job on the inside game, but we
just didn't get to those 3s. And a lot of the 3s we didn't get to were in
transition so they were able to make those in transition, which a lot of teams
struggle with that.  
  
Q. You guys had an awfully young squad. I realize, Candice, you're a
senior. But to start four sophomores and to get into the semifinal and perform
as well as you did in the regular season, what would you say contributed to
that?  
COACH WHITE: I just don't look at them as sophomores. I really don't. Whoever
is ready to go, whoever can help our team, that's who we're going to put out
there. And tonight I felt like -- actually, both nights -- I felt like we had
a very good team unity, team balance.  
  
And I am excited that we have those sophomores for a couple more years. And
really in this league I do think having seniors like Candice, like some of the
seniors in our league, that's going to help us be successful. Candice has been
a staple for our team now for three solid years. And that's been great.  
  
And now with our sophomore class, three of them started last year and they
were a staple. So hopefully that continues throughout their next couple of
years.  
  
CANDICE WHITE: I'd just say this: The core group of sophomores, they're just
very competitive. Since they've gotten here their freshman year they've always
wanted to learn more. They've always tried their hardest and always put in
effort.  
  
And I think moving forward they're going to be successful in the end because
they don't ever give up and they don't go out without a fight.  
  
ALY GAMEZ: I think we came in our freshman year competitive and ready to
learn, and we didn't want to look at it as we were freshmen. We wanted to look
at it as we're going to come out and compete every day and just try to help
the team just get as far as we can. And I think that will help us down the
road next year and the year after.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Najé Murray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36687)

### [Mallory Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36678)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Wyoming - 75, San Diego State - 70 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State, head coach Stacie Terry and
student-athletes Mallory Adams, Najé Murray and Sophia Ramos. Coach, an
opening statement.  
  
COACH TERRY: What a fun game to watch again. Overtime again. Offensive
juggernaut. This hurts. It hurts, because I felt like this group of young
women put themselves in a great situation to be successful, and the ball
didn't bounce our way tonight.  
  
But I thought they played with so much grit and tenacity and heart for 45
minutes. So I know someone has to lose. I just hate it was us, because they
played their hearts out. I asked them not to leave anything out there. And I
think that they did that. Just proud of this team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Ladies, give us your thoughts about the tournament and how you
played.  
NAJÉ MURRAY: I was just telling the two of them, I don't think we went into
the year thinking we're going to put ourselves in a position to win the
conference. And I think that now feeling what we just did and what we just --
what we weren't supposed to do. No one expected anything like this.  
  
So, I mean, I'm proud -- it hurts for sure -- but I mean I can't say how
incredible this group is for putting something together that no one expected.
We flipped this conference tournament upside down for the wins we did. And I
think we kind of made our statement, and it's going to be different next year,
and I think people should be ready for it.  
  
SOPHIA RAMOS: I couldn't be more proud to be a part of this team. We fought
the entire game. We were the underdogs from the beginning. I think a lot of
people underestimated us coming in as a 7 seed. I know the 7 seeds have done
some big things the last couple of years, but coming in as a young team with a
lot of new faces, just I think we really made a statement for what's to come
for our future and how bright it is.  
  
MALLORY ADAMS: I'm just really happy to be part of this team. We're a great
group of girls. And, like, even Coach has said sometimes we're all the we
have. We might be the only ones that think we can do it. But that's special.
We know we can do it. And I'm just proud that we were able to make our
statement at this tournament and do some things that most probably didn't
expect for us to do. And I just think that we'll be back next year. And we'll
be ready.  
  
Q. Coach, I'm looking at a score -- I don't want to bring up a bad
memory -- but early in the season against Wyoming, a big lopsided loss.
Tonight you take them to the overtime and gave yourself a chance to win?  
COACH TERRY: We talked about that before. They knew. We watched film on it all
day today. And they saw how much we have grown from that first chance playing
them. So that was really a testament to how hard they worked.  
  
And they were so confident because they knew, they knew that they deserved
this moment and they worked hard for it. And I can't wait -- it's crazy
because you're, like, okay now it's over. I don't know if it's really set in
that it's over and that I'm not going to see them in practice tomorrow.  
  
After I give them a couple of weeks off I'm so motivated to get back in the
gym with them because these kids are going to be really, really good. They
already are good, but I'm excited to get back to work.  
  
Q. You started a very young team as we talked about before. Does a week
like this give you guys confidence going into next year?  
NAJÉ MURRAY: Absolutely, we have a lot of years. The conference should be a
little worried.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Marta Hermida](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32779)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 89, Fresno State - 77  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State head coach Gordy Presnell and
student-athletes Joyce Harrell and Marta Hermida. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH PRESNELL: I thought Fresno State played a great game. And I thought
especially in the first half they controlled pace a little bit and pushed it.
And I thought it was a pretty well-played game overall.  
  
Really proud of 25 assists and nine turnovers. That's really -- 31 baskets on
25 assists is really outstanding on our kids' part.  
  
But it was a great game. I knew it was going to be a great game. They've got
shooters, and just proud of the victory, and we get to advance.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Yesterday we asked you about Braydey scoring 37, and now the next
night you have somebody score 30. What can you say about what Marta did
tonight?  
COACH PRESNELL: It was just outstanding. She kind of controlled the boards
down the stretch of the game in the fourth quarter. And I don't know why she
messed up on two assists of having a triple-double but I thought her play
overall -- it hurt us when she got in foul trouble and had to come out. But
she just picked up where she left off and just had an outstanding game. And
she's had a good run here down the stretch of her senior year, that's for
sure.  
  
Q. The stat, I think you guys are tied with 10 different players that
led you in scoring or tied for it at some point in the season. But to have
somebody score 37 and the next night have somebody else be able to score 30
and neither one is Riley, what does it say about your team and the depth that
you have, and it can be anybody on a given night?  
COACH PRESNELL: A couple things, one, it says that our kids are pretty
unselfish. And someone that's not feeling as much isn't just going to jacking
stuff up. We're going to find the open person and find the person hitting. And
our kids did that for Marta tonight. And she delivered big time.  
  
Q. To get back to the Mountain West championship game for the third
straight year, it's obviously something that's not easy to do. What is it
about your team that continues to handle this big stage? And how proud are you
of your program to get back to this thing for a third straight year?  
COACH PRESNELL: These two right here, with the two league championship games,
it will be their fifth league championship tomorrow. And just real excited for
them and what they've done for our program and what they've done for our
university in terms of who they are and the character that they have and then
the way they play. Just really proud of them. And they certainly, when they're
done here, leave a legacy, that's for sure.  
  
Q. How confident are you in your group that they'll figure it out, too?
You were tied at 36 at halftime but you look, in terms of teamwork and
chemistry, 31 made field goals, you assisted on 25 of them tonight. That's
obviously a pretty impressive number.  
COACH PRESNELL: We have pretty good guards that you can spread and space the
floor. When we space the floor, then we can get some pick-and-roll action
going. And we run really simple, easy stuff. But they run it well and they
know it and they communicate very well.  
  
Q. Marta, what was working well for you tonight?  
MARTA HERMIDA: My teammates saw me open and I was, like, just shoot it. That's
the only way you can help your team. And I think they did a great job finding
me, and I just have to shoot. That's the easiest part.  
  
They find me wide open. This girl gives me, like, I don't know how many 3s
every game. Jayde Christopher gave me really good passes, too. I did the easy
part. Like, what they did, like (indiscernible) gets the screen for the open
player, and then Jayde Christopher gives you the ball. So, yeah, I did the
easiest part.  
  
Q. How does it feel, Marta, to be a senior in the Mountain West
Tournament and score a career-high 30 points? That's pretty cool.  
MARTA HERMIDA: Yeah, it's pretty cool, but the coolest part is tomorrow I play
a final here. That's the best part of it.  
  
Q. Joyce, you had the running floater at the end of the shot clock, I
don't know if you saw your coach, but he did kind of a flex or a fist pump?
I'm not sure what it was, Gordy (laughter).  
COACH PRESNELL: That was a game-changer, yeah, the running -- we practice that
all the time. We don't ever practice that.  
  
Q. Joyce, to have a shot like that, which basically put the game out of
reach there, how big was that? And for you to just contribute and get your
team into the finals?  
JOYCE HARRELL: It was a really big shot. I would call it, like, my H-O-R-S-E
shot. It's one of those shots you use when you play H-O-R-S-E. It was good. It
was a game-changer, helped the team close it out. We really needed it and I
just wanted to be that person that I could be there for my team when they
trust me.  
  
Q. The stats are getting a little bit crazy for me with this team.
Braydey is the number one scorer, single game scorer in Mountain West history
now, and you are now tied for No. 3. How do you explain the scoring ability of
this team and why it seems to work so well?  
MARTA HERMIDA: I feel like we know that we have really, really good players.
And we don't know who is going to step up, but we know somebody is going to
step up. The best part of this team is that we can recognize every single game
who is that person.  
  
Yesterday Braydey had a great, great game. And today they found me. But
tomorrow, let's see who it is. And that's the best part. We play all together.
We know who we have to give the ball to and that's the best part.  
  
Q. Marta kind of touched on it right there, Coach. How do you feel it
out? Braydey goes for 37 yesterday. Obviously you probably wanted to get Marta
some shots after she scored 11 in the first quarter alone. But how do you feel
out the hot hand when you guys are so balanced?  
COACH PRESNELL: You know, I think our kids just find each other. And we
usually try to start with motion, our games, we try to start with some motion
and then kind of do some reading on how they're going to handle screening and
switching and then we'll get into our specials and we'll call some specials
for kids.  
  
Q. To win and know you're still playing, a loss and your season may be
over. Obviously I guess you have the NIT locked up, but how do you look at
just wanting to win, advance and get back to the tournament and just knowing
that every game you never know what could be the future for you guys?  
JOYCE HARRELL: We set this goal early in July of our team wanting to win and
going back to the tournament, knowing that it's right there in front of us;
and it's on us, if we're going to get there or not is something that we know
we can control and we can do this.  
  
MARTA HERMIDA: For sure it's a big game. Like every single time it can be your
last game but instead of thinking it's my last game, I'm thinking I have one
more chance to enjoy, with these players, with these coaches. And that's all.
I just want to enjoy playing with them.  
  
Q. You've played in this game back-to-back years. You'll play in it
again tomorrow. How do you handle the emotions? What's it like going to bed at
night tonight? What's it like waking up in the morning, and how eager are you
to hear that horn go off at whatever it is 7:00 in the morning so you can hit
the floor?  
JOYCE HARRELL: I'm excited, honestly. It's something that we dreamed of. We
set this goal. But you also have to be mentally tough. This is our third game
in three days. We can't let the fatigue affect us. And so knowing we have to
go out there and compete, it's exciting to do and knowing at the end of the
game it's going to be for a championship. You wake up for that in the morning;
you don't need to set an alarm.  
  
MARTA HERMIDA: Same. I feel like I'm a very nervous person. I get nervous, I
get excited for the game. I look at my team and I say I have the best team
here. I know it's going to be a great day tomorrow; and, yeah, I'm trusting
all my teammates and I know it's going to be good if we play together.  
  
Q. Coach, second game in a row you're in a battle late in the game, and
just the whole game. And every time you thought you'd get up by 12 or whatever
they'd make a run. What is it about this team and your leaders and your
veterans on this team that you just don't panic? It seems like every time you
needed a shot Riley would hit a big shot that would make a one-point lead back
to three or three to five. What is it about this team where it doesn't seem
like no matter the situation, the pressure or whatever, you guys just don't
panic?  
COACH PRESNELL: We don't have very many players that have basketball anxiety.
And we have a number of players that are willing to take that last shot and be
the hero or the G.O.A.T. or whatever you call it. And that isn't a problem for
them. We do need to sometimes raise our level of play and we found that out
today. They came right after us.  
  
So with that being said, tomorrow -- like I said yesterday, I think in the
press conference, everyone, when you get to this stage, tries their hardest.
It sounds so cheesy, but they do. They try their hardest. And it creates more
pace, more physicality. And you gotta adjust to it as soon as you can.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Wyoming - 75, San Diego State - 70 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming head coach Joe Legerski and student-
athletes Karla Erjavec and Marta Gomez. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH LEGERSKI: As far as the game tonight, neither team was going to give an
inch. You take a look at it, the lead changed hands 15 times. The score was
tied 15 times. And you play that again, add two more minutes, and who knows
what the outcome is?  
  
But that was something that I took away from this game, was just how hard San
Diego State and Wyoming ended up competing to try to get a victory. And the
job Stacie's done to bring this team along is truly amazing. I give her so
much credit.  
  
We played them back in January and it's a different basketball group. They've
really grown as a team.  
  
And then I took a look at our group tonight. There was a lot of pressure on
them. I thought Marta felt the pressure early, was talking to her and trying
to lighten them up. But then I thought in overtime, this senior wasn't going
to be denied. And she just kept making big shot after big shot.  
  
And then to her left, Karla Erjavec hit probably the two biggest free throws
for us as a freshman, to be able to step to the line when we're down two,
deliver on both accounts, and then we did just enough defensively to send it
into overtime.  
  
And you saw a change on our bench during that intermission between regulation
and overtime, and it seemed we relaxed. They were excited again. And, as I
said, Marta took over. And that's a great player to have on my side.  
  
Q. Marta, you didn't play bad but then overtime something kicked in. Did
something kick in for you? What was the big difference from overtime from the
rest of the game?  
MARTA GOMEZ: I mean, I don't know. Once I heard the buzzer beating, I was,
like, we're getting this. I don't know what it's going to take, and I don't
really care, but we're going to get this because our team deserves to play in
the championship game tomorrow.  
  
And I kind of felt like the pressure was off, because that was it. We either
win or we lose. If we lose we go home. And I don't think this team is ready to
go home right now. So I kind of took over. And I knew that I wanted my
teammates to experience and to enjoy the game tomorrow. So I kind of felt like
I needed to do that for them. And I just stepped out and I'm glad that the
shots went in when they had to go in.  
  
Q. Karla, take us through the sequence where you got fouled at the end
of regulation and made the free throws. Was that play designed for you? And
what were your emotions at the free-throw line to put it into overtime?  
KARLA ERJAVEC: The emotions were overwhelming, for sure. But I tried to calm
myself down and knock those two. I knew my team needed those. And I'm glad I
delivered.  
  
Q. They pretty much carved you guys up offensively for the majority of
that game. And then you guys don't allow a point, I think, within the last
minute or so in overtime when you went on that 8-0 run. What gave you guys
problems and what changed?  
COACH LEGERSKI: The biggest thing, they're able to put the ball on the floor
and attack you. They also have great range to shoot it from 3. And all of a
sudden that puts a great deal of pressure on us defensively.  
  
And we tried to get our rotations at times, but we had to make sure that we
had the 3 covered. And one of the things we made a change to talk about was
we'll give up some baskets but we're not going to give up that extra point.
And that extra point is how we play.  
  
When you take a look at this game we made five more 3s than San Diego State.
That's five extra points. That's the difference in the ballgame. So it's by
design, but it makes it difficult when they're scoring layups, and you're
sitting there wondering if you're going to be able to stop them at some point
in time. But it's very much by design.  
  
Q. Marta, what were you guys saying? What was the mood when they were up
64-63, with just over a minute left in overtime? You knew you had to get
stops.  
MARTA GOMEZ: We were just saying that we were going to get it. We just needed
to stay back defensively, make some shots on offense and the game was ours. I
think the last two minutes of the game we didn't have any doubt that we were
going to end up getting the win tonight.  
  
Q. You're playing Boise State for a championship. The first time you've
ever been in this championship game. I imagine you're happy to be there, but
not satisfied either. What are your thoughts, your earlier thoughts about
playing Boise State for a third time for a championship?  
MARTA GOMEZ: I think it's huge. We've never been in a championship game. It's
kind of crazy to represent the state of Wyoming in a championship game. It's
just one more game, 40 minutes, we start from 0-0. Nothing will change from
that.  
  
So we just need to come, play our game and whatever happens, happens. But as
Coach told us in the locker room, we just need to enjoy the moment that we're
living. And I think it's a great experience for us to be able to actually play
in that game.  
  
Q. Marta, you said the pressure was off at the end of the game. I feel
like that's counter to what most people would think. Why was the pressure not
on in that situation?  
MARTA GOMEZ: I mean, it's just our teammates, the coaching staff. They make
you feel like there's nothing really going on, like, it's just -- you're maybe
practicing. Like, you make, you make; you miss, you miss. We just move on.  
  
And just knowing that there's actually pressure there but no one is really
actually, like, telling you that you have to do something; it's just whatever
happens, happens, and we just move on. And I think that really helps.  
  
And just having everybody else around you telling you we're going to get this;
don't worry, we're going to get this, makes you feel way better and way
comfortable when you're shooting and when you're on the free-throw line.  
  
Q. Karla, I know you said you were trying to calm yourself at the free-
throw line. Take us through those minutes. What do you do, how do you calm
yourself down with as loud as it was, with as much at stake as it was?  
KARLA ERJAVEC: I try to take a bunch of deep breaths, as Coach always tells
me. Just take a deep breath and just imagine that you're in practice. Shoot
those free throws like you would shoot any other, and that's how I got
relaxed.  
  
Q. You've obviously had some battles with Boise State the last couple of
years. They had two different players each score 30 the last two games. What
makes them so tough? What are your thoughts on them for tomorrow?  
COACH LEGERSKI: The biggest thing with Boise is very well coached, have a
number of offensive weapons. When you take a look at the three guards they can
put on the floor, all three of them can score over 30 points at any point in
time. And I think that their post players are very active, they rebound really
well.  
  
When I take a look at Boise, they're very deserving of being the champion of
the Mountain West Conference. They have all the pieces you want to put
together. So it will be a big challenge for us tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Jaime White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28473)

### [Maddi Utti](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34817)

### [Candice White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32758)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 66, UNLV - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Fresno State head coach Jaime White and
student-athletes Maddi Utti and Candice White. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH WHITE: Well, I thought we had a good start to the game. And I thought we
had good energy coming out. Early I thought our press was really good. We were
able to create some offense with forcing them into turnovers. And I thought
just as a team we played well together. Get 38 points in the paint, that's a
nice job. And then to force the 22 turnovers, I think that was pretty much the
game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. The first half, a little precursor, I've known Maddi for four years,
I was the counselor at her high school -- I'm writing a feature article for
our local paper. But I was really impressed with that energy from all of those
girls. You must do a heck of a preseason training regime?  
COACH WHITE: Well, I think the biggest thing was our girls were a little upset
about how we finished our regular season conference games. And so I think our
focus was really good coming into this game. Also our confidence in knowing
that we'd played really well against UNLV. And clearly UNLV outsizes, us and
Maddi is going to be not the tallest one out there. But with our speed and our
agility and Maddi playing the top of the press and the top of the zone has
really helped us down the stretch.  
  
Also, Genna Ogier played a great game and she was able to hang in there with
those big kids. It was nice seeing all of us hitting it on the same night.  
  
Q. What did you talk about at halftime to shut down their tall girls,
because the one gal had 13, I don't know, in the first half and then she was
shut down?  
COACH WHITE: Powell was getting free. She was getting open on the short
corner. So we made a little bit of an adjustment where we have the center come
out and try to defend her a little bit better. And I think we had a little bit
more of an awareness of where she was.  
  
We know she can shoot the 3, and she hit one of those deep ones on us in
Fresno, too. So I think on the top we had an urgency, but in the post play,
just a little bit more communication, kind of shifting a couple of things. And
then I thought Kate Noyer came in and did a good job on her, just to make her
shoot over a taller hand.  
  
Q. Maddi, what do you have to say to the folks back home?  
MADDI UTTI: Just thanks for all the support. Thanks for watching all the time
and everything.  
  
Q. How have you grown in your two years personally, athletically, what
do you think have been your greatest strides?  
MADDI UTTI: Well, with my game, I play a different position now. So with
basketball, it's changed for me. I like it. And then I've grown as a person
because playing basketball is hard. It's hard work. It takes a lot of
commitment. And I love my teammates and it's been the best decision I've made.  
  
Q. Candice, I see you guide that team; you really give them a lot of
direction and move people around. What year are you?  
CANDICE WHITE: I'm a senior this year. But with the core class that's with
Maddi, the four sophomores, they're just a group that's always wanting to
learn, always working hard and just competitive all the time. So in a way they
make my job, I guess you could say, a lot easier. But they're a special group
that I know is going to have a lot of success in the future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 70, New Mexico - 61 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Diego State head coach Stacie Terry and
student-athletes Najé Murray, Sophia Ramos, Téa Adams and Baylee Vanderdoes.
Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH TERRY: What a fun game to watch. The Mountain West has so much talent,
and we don't always get the credit that we deserve. But we were able to
outlast a very good New Mexico team that gave us everything that they had.  
  
Just a really fun game to be a part of and coach in, and really proud of our
young ladies for executing what we've been working so hard on down the
stretch.  
  
Q. Give us your thoughts on what it meant to win a game here in Las
Vegas?  
BAYLEE VANDERDOES: It felt great. The past two years that we've been here we
didn't get past the first round. So this meant a lot to me and a lot of the
upperclassmen.  
  
We were just ready. We believed in ourselves from the beginning. And it was
just the fact that we were able to produce and we put all of our scout
together, our hard work together and we all came together, and especially in
an overtime moment we were able to come up with a win and it was very well-
deserved.  
  
TÉA ADAMS: I think it just feels amazing to have all of our hard work this
year finally pay off. Our coach always says that we're made for this. So I
think that we really believed it tonight and we put everything together, and
it just came out our way.  
  
And I'm really excited and awesome -- and I'm awesome. (Laughter) I mean, it's
just an awesome feeling. So, yeah.  
  
SOPHIA RAMOS: It doesn't feel real yet. I think a lot of us thought we could
do it. I just think a lot of our hard work has finally paid off. We're a young
group. And so I think just seeing how well our chemistry is and how well we're
playing right now is just a really big reason on why we're being so successful
at the right time.  
  
NAJÉ MURRAY: It's the time of the year where it's will over anything else. We
know them like the back of their hand and they don't know us the same way. It
was grit. It was effort. It was making plays at the end, and then we made
plays top to bottom. Everyone who stepped on our court for us made a play at
the right time. And I think that's what matters at this time of the year and
this time of the game.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about last night you felt like you played New
Mexico tough and you had a little confidence going in this game. I thought I
saw it in your players. Is that what you saw?  
COACH TERRY: Right. Even in the Pit, we went down there and it was a close
one. So they felt really confident going in, as they do against anybody in the
conference. We talked a lot about we respect everybody, but we're not playing
with any fear at this point.  
  
New Mexico does a lot of things well. And we really focused in on slowing some
of those perimeter players down and not letting them shoot the 3-ball as well
as they normally do.  
  
And again, you can't contain Nunn because she's such a good player. We did our
best to make sure she didn't get anything easy. Really proud of Baylee and
Mallory Adams who did a good job containing their players.  
  
Q. Coach Bradbury talked about you guys own the boards and they feel
they're a pretty good rebounding team. Was there something you did special for
that?  
COACH TERRY: This is "want to," this is will. My pregame speech was talking
about how special things happen in March and to live without regret. And what
it was going to take was commitment on both sides of the ball.  
  
And I thought we were committed to rebounding tonight more than we ever have.
They don't realize that now this is the standard, guys. So we need to rebound
like this all the time. But they were committed to making sure they only got
one shot, and I think that was a crucial part of the game, is we got stops
down the stretch when we needed to.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Gordy Presnell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23338)

### [Riley Lupfer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32836)

### [Braydey Hodgins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34852)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 72, Nevada - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Boise State head coach Gordy Presnell and
student-athletes Braydey Hodgins and Riley Lupfer. Coach, an opening
statement.  
  
COACH PRESNELL: Happy with the win, happy to get to advance. Nevada played a
great game coming off a great game yesterday. And fortunate we made plays, and
fortunate to have two players like the two that are next to me that made plays
as well. We're pleased with the victory and happy to move on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Obviously a historic night, 37 for Braydey. You needed all 37 of them
tonight. What was it about her performance that impressed you?  
COACH PRESNELL: Braydey is an exceptional player and has this ability to play
in pressure situations and excel. And she's just as happy when someone else
shines and maybe she doesn't score as much. But tonight was her night.  
  
And just like she has last year in this tournament, last year in the league
championship at Washington, she excelled when it really counted for us and had
an exceptional performance and really proud of her.  
  
Q. You got off to a slow start obviously and only were up two at half.
Looked like you were going to take control up 11. But I think you had one
point from like the sixth minute of the fourth quarter to the last minute.
What was it like on the 11-0 run?  
COACH PRESNELL: I thought we could have broke them if we could have secured a
rebound. And we did not secure the rebound and they went and scored. We went
down, took a quick shot, and they went back and hit a 3. And all of a sudden
the momentum changed. We were close but we didn't -- they play with a lot of
heart. They're a very good team well-coached.  
  
Q. Any reason for the slow start? Just nerves or just the slow start?  
COACH PRESNELL: I think -- usually, anyway, in my years of coaching, the top
seeds, 1, 2, 3, 4, whoever is the top seed, whether it's a 4 versus 9 or
whatever it is, but you start off pretty slow. The other team had a game
yesterday. And there's just a different level of intensity and a different
level -- for anything else -- a different level of trying hard.  
  
And so I think most top seeds, when a team comes and plays the day before,
might struggle early. And we did.  
  
Q. Obviously the tournament game against Nevada last year was a close
one. You had to win on a buzzer-beater. What makes them a tough matchup for
you guys?  
COACH PRESNELL: Their length. Their guards are very quick. They space you out
very well. They shot the 3 exceptionally well against us early and kind of got
us on our heels. And then they isolate down low with those kids, those big
kids, and it's really difficult.  
  
And, like I said, they're very well coached and they're going to have some big
things in the future for them, I'm sure.  
  
Q. You've been coaching quite a few. To see Braydey Hodgins break a
tournament record that has stood since 2002, what does that mean to you and to
the program?  
COACH PRESNELL: I'm just really proud of her. Like I've said over and over, if
you need her to be a complementary player and be happy for someone else, she's
glad to do that. When she's out of the game on the bench, she's amazingly
engaged in the game. And then she can take over a game like all the games I
talked about earlier. And there just isn't very many players that are like
that. And we're the better for it, that's for sure.  
  
Q. Braydey, what did it feel like to score 37? And you heard about the
record and just I don't know if you're peeking up at the scoreboard at all.
Did you realize you were having a big game?  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: Obviously I knew I was having a big game. Didn't necessarily
look up to the scoreboard to know that. But I think the mini run in the first
half was sparked by Ellie Woerner and her exceptional rebounding ability and
long length at the guard position. And she gave us great energy off the bench.  
  
That kind of got us on a roll. Luckily in that time I was hitting shots. So
I'm thankful for her in that position and just being aware. She tipped a
rebound backward to me for a 3. So that doesn't happen often.  
  
But tough game. I mean we didn't expect it like that. But we knew Nevada was
going to come out swinging. They did it last year in the championship and they
did it again tonight.  
  
Q. What does it mean to have your best game of your career in the
tournament when your team really needed you to step up? To do it today in a
game like this and help your team move on, what does this mean to you
personally?  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I mean, we came here knowing that we were going to stay here
until Wednesday, and we're hoping we're able to do it tomorrow. Doesn't mean
anything personally. I just want to win this thing do it next to people like
Riley and all of our other teammates that we just have such a great bond.  
  
And no matter who is performing we're all happy for them. Luckily it was me
today, but tomorrow it might be someone else and we just have to prepare for
that.  
  
Q. Riley, what did you see from her performance, 37 and obviously you
guys needed all of them?  
RILEY LUPFER: I'm going to say I'm not surprised. You see it on the floor but
-- she's a great basketball player but she's so smart -- the way Nevada was
guarding the ball screens, she was just patient. She was, like, okay, you're
going to go under. I'm going to hit this 3. You're going to high hedge and go
over, then I'm going to get to the rim and get a foul call.  
  
She's been good at that her whole career. I played her in high school. She got
to the free throw line more than I want to know. She just adjusts and she
makes everybody around her better. And her getting to the rim makes -- opens
up other people too. And it's just, like, how do you guard her? It's not fun
and I can speak from that with practice.  
  
Q. Braydey, I saw on Twitter that you scored like 46 points in high
school. So how does this game compare to that game?  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I would say it compares a little differently because I think
in that game I shot 22 free throws. So there were those other points. But in
high school -- I was talking to Tamara earlier -- I was more of a driver.  
  
So shooting 3s wasn't my first instinct in high school. It was getting to the
free-throw line. That's something that's always been in my game. And in
college you're going against bigger players. I'm not able to get some contact
and then go up and finish, it's a little bit tougher.  
  
So the difference for me in college, when you're playing out on the wing,
you've got to be able to shoot the 3. I think I've developed that well this
year. When they want to chase me off the 3-point line I'm able to do something
different.  
  
RILEY LUPFER: I'll say in high school she dropped 40 on us. Probably had 20
free throws. I remember that.  
  
Q. Riley, you hit three 3s today. I know that you would like to score
some more points besides from Braydey. What is it going to take to turn things
around for the next game?  
RILEY LUPFER: Braydey can go out and drop 50 tomorrow, but if the scoreboard
says we win, we win; that's all that matters.  
  
Q. What did you guys see in terms of the slow start, and then obviously
in the fourth quarter there, too, when they were making the comeback, what did
you see in terms of being able to pull it out at the end?  
RILEY LUPFER: I would say, yeah, we had a slow start. But we get this feeling.
We have these good practices before a game and it's a good vibe. And we have
this feeling between us all that no matter what happens, no matter how we
start, no matter how the middle of the game is, that at the end we're going to
finish, play our basketball, and we're going to come out with the win.  
  
BRAYDEY HODGINS: I'll reiterate what Coach said. We have a lot of experience
here with a lot of our returners. But still, for the freshmen, it's a shell
shock, pressure environment.  
  
So it's hard when you're the 1 seed, or 1 through 5, I guess, and you haven't
played a game. So Nevada already had a game under their belt. They kind of
felt the court out a little bit, felt their shot, and they were feeling it
early.  
  
So we have to be able to sustain those runs and be able to go on bigger runs
ourselves. Like Riley said, that feeling we get, they went on an 11-0 run to
tie it up, but I never thought once we were going to lose that game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Fresno State - 66, UNLV - 55  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by UNLV head coach Kathy Olivier and student-
athletes Katie Powell and Nikki Wheatley. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH OLIVIER: Well, I mean, for us, it's hard. We have six seniors on this
team, and they've been great. We had a great run with them. The last three
years we won over 20 games each year, each season. We were super proud of
that. Just to finish like this it's just a downer.  
  
We had a lot of expectations this season and we just had a lot of injuries
that kind of held us back, but they never stopped fighting. They always came
in to practice very eager to get better. They were constantly helping the
returners and just, I don't know, it was good times even though we weren't as
successful as we wanted to be.  
  
And I'm super proud of this group of six. I think we have a good group coming
back and don't count the Lady Rebels out for next year.  
  
You've got to give it up for Fresno. They played a good game, very good game
today.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Nikki, their press defense, how much pressure did that put on the
offense taking the seconds off the play clock and then they're settling into
the zone?  
NIKKI WHEATLEY: I think in the first half, from the start of the game we might
have had a little trouble with it. I felt we adjusted to it. It definitely
takes some seconds off the shot clock. But I feel we did adjust to it as the
game went on. We expected it, we knew it was coming. But I knew we could have
been a little more aggressive towards it.  
  
Q. When you're constantly in catch-up mode, how difficult is that?  
NIKKI WHEATLEY: That's what hurt us. I think getting down, it kind of puts a
downer mood on everything. And having to constantly catch up, catch up
definitely makes it hard. But I do think we made a run at the end so that was
good.  
  
Q. Katie, they would go on a run. You would chip away, make it a game
again. Just how frustrating was it, though, when every time you got closer
they'd go on another run?  
KATIE POWELL: Yeah, it's frustrating, but in a game you've got to keep your
head up wait for the next play, next play. I feel like we did that and we just
fell a little short.  
  
Q. Katie, you touched on it, but could you talk about your first half,
14 points; second half, held to three points? What was the difference there?
Obviously they clamped down on you in the second half.  
KATIE POWELL: Yeah, I think they were more in their zone; they were sucking
kind of in a bit more. We need to have a little bit better ball movement. But,
yeah, they were obviously trying to stop me that second half.  
  
COACH OLIVIER: She's not 100 percent. Not that she's going to say this, but
yesterday she practiced for about 15 minutes. And then today she was at
shootaround. But Katie's not 100 percent. She said I want to go. This is it
for me, I want to go and do all I can for the team. So you've got to give it
up for her.  
  
Q. Nikki, can you touch on turnovers? You've talked about it in your
first answer, but just specific to that, 20 through three quarters, and then
you guys figured out in the fourth quarter.  
NIKKI WHEATLEY: Coming off the Colorado State game we did well on the
turnovers and controlling them and having low turnovers. So it was kind of
upsetting to come in this game, we felt like we were prepared coming in for
the press. We definitely know they do it. They do it every game. We felt we
made some lazy passes, and we weren't just executing like we should have.  
  
Q. Obviously your last game as a Rebel, just kind of -- I know it's
still fresh and raw after the loss today, but can you try to sum up your
experience here at UNLV?  
KATIE POWELL: My experience was great. After I transferred I was welcomed by
the coaches. They're great people and the people that you meet are the people
that are coaching. They're great people. And I'm just happy to play for them.  
  
I mean, UNLV is an awesome school. I'm happy to have gotten my education here.
And playing as well, I was happy I could make an impact last year and this
year. I wish the best for them next year.  
  
NIKKI WHEATLEY: Same thing. I think that Katie was telling us in the locker
room, this is kind of a bad note to end on, but we're going to look at
everything we accomplished. We're not going to take this game and say this is
what I'm going to look at every time I look back on my experience.  
  
So we're just going to look at everything we've accomplished and we think that
we have brought this program up. And we're now handing it off to the
underclassmen and handing it off better than when we got here. That's the goal
and we're just going to take that.  
  
Q. Was this game representative of what's plagued the team, missed free
throws and turnovers, but you're still competitive?  
COACH OLIVIER: I'm looking at it. We lose by 11. We had, what, about a C-minus
game. We had way too many turnovers; we all touched on that. And we missed our
free throws. But this team, they're fighters. They're fighters in the sense
that they're going to give their all on the defensive end. We're going to
continue to challenge people and play aggressive D and just things didn't go
our way.  
  
And sometimes that gets to you. It's been a season -- it kind of summed up our
season, this game, it kind of summed it where up/down, up/down. We couldn't
get it going.  
  
Gotta give it up for Fresno State. I thought they played well. When we went on
a run they answered and that's what good teams do. I thought Jaime did a great
job with her group. They didn't start off the season well, but they've come on
really, really strong. And I wish them the best.  
  
Q. You've always squeezed the most out of your teams. Was this
particularly frustrating given the experience that came back and just always
seemed like it was running in place a little bit?  
COACH OLIVIER: They're a really good group. They're great to be around. And
everyone probably saw our shirts. It said "family." And like we're all family.
Like we are. We do a lot together on and off the court. They're hard workers.
I like what Nikki said when she said that she knows that they're leaving the
program better than when they got here. And that's true. They've just made us
better.  
  
Katie, her redshirt year was in the gym nonstop. She would always text, can
you open the gym? I'm thinking, gosh, I just need to give her a key. She's
constantly wanting to get better, get better.  
  
Nikki is in there all the time working on her free throws, doing whatever she
can to make us better. So she's showing -- all these seniors were showing the
returners how to improve and how to make this program better. We're super
proud of that. The alumni, I had alumni texting, wishing us luck.  
  
We're Rebels for life and they all know that. We're all disappointed that it
ended like this. But, again, like Nikki said, there's a lot of positives that
we can draw from this season and from the last four years that they've been
here.  
  
Q. They basically owned the inside. Is that just something that Fresno
State, you anticipated that they would be tough to defend being able to get to
the basket like they did?  
COACH OLIVIER: They played a lot of zone. And I think someone said that Katie
was doing a great job early. So they kind of took her away the second half. I
mean, they're smart with that. And I thought we attacked the basket and got
some good looks.  
  
But we just never could get on a roll. Never got any rhythm on the offensive
end. You can't miss your free throws and then get these offensive rebounds and
not do anything with the offensive rebounds. And for us, it just doesn't work
like that.  
  
Defensively we're going to get after it. And defensively we did a good job,
but we saw zones all year. We just have to get more effective against the
zones for next year.  
  
Q. The end of the first half you cut it, I think, to four. Looked like
you were taking momentum at halftime. Then they come down and hit that shot.
How tough was that for you?  
COACH OLIVIER: To be quite honest, that's what happened to us last year, the
same exact thing at halftime someone hit a shot. And we were -- chipped away.
I thought we did a really good job at the end of the second quarter.  
  
But when they hit that shot, you know, I got deflated. I know I can't do that
because I have a group of people that they're looking up to us coaches. And we
had a good talk. We made some adjustments at halftime. And the team just, you
know, they did all they can. We just never got really any rhythm offensively
today.  
  
Q. I wanted to talk about Rodjanae's award, the sixth player of the
year. Can you touch on that how special?  
COACH OLIVIER: We were really excited for her. R.J., when she came in this
program, if you would have saw what we were working with, she's a great, great
girl. She's a hard worker.  
  
But Coach Collier really developed her. Our coaches do a great job of skill
development. I'm super, super proud of her. I said earlier in the year you're
playing behind Paris. You're playing behind Katie, two really talented post
players. You've learned a lot. When you get in there do some damage.  
  
And I thought all season she did a great job. She just made things happen
immediately when she came in the game. She's got to do a little better job of
not turning the ball over as much. But otherwise, you've got to give it up for
R.J. We're really excited how much better she's gotten in our program.  
  
And Bailey, you've got to ask about Bailey, defensive player, Bailey Thomas
deserves that hard worker and determined lady those two coming back and
incoming freshmen, I think it's a bright future for the Lady Rebels.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2019

  

### [Amanda Levens](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34803)

### [Terae Briggs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34818)

### [Jade Redmon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36675)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Boise State - 72, Nevada - 67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nevada head coach Amanda Levens and student-
athletes Terae Briggs and Jade Redmon.  
  
COACH LEVENS: I'm proud of our team. We fought and competed and gave ourselves
a chance to win. I'm just really proud of their effort. Obviously Jade played
phenomenally, just scored extremely well all game. And Terae did what she kind
of always does for us, close to a double-double.  
  
I'm going to miss our seniors, can really count on them every day. And I told
our team after the game there's three teams in Division I that don't end their
season with a loss. It hurts no matter when it happens, but I was just really
proud of our effort today.  
  
Q. 37 from Hodgins tonight. Seemed like whenever they needed a shot she
was hitting it. What did you see from her?  
COACH LEVENS: She shot the ball extremely well, and she has been all year. I
thought she's done a great job when Riley got hurt, and stepping up and taking
on not only Riley's load but continuing what she was already doing. She got 15
free throws, too. That helped.  
  
Q. You guys have obviously played them real close at your place and last
year was a buzzer-beater down here. What is it about when you guys play them?
It's a good matchup for you guys.  
COACH LEVENS: I just think our team, we compete. We fight. We try -- our goal
every game is to put ourselves in a position to win. And we're a program that
doesn't have a tradition of winning yet. For our team we're just trying to put
ourselves in a position to win and establish a winning culture and a winning
program.  
  
So for the two years I've been there I've been proud of both teams, both years
that they just fight and buy into whatever it takes to try to win this game.
We win ugly a lot and we keep ourselves in games because we just never quit.
And so like I said, just really proud of these guys today.  
  
Q. Obviously Boise was a top seed for a reason. What makes them, I
guess, as good as they are and how tough of a matchup are they for any team?  
COACH LEVENS: They just can score at any position. And Harrell does a great
job rebounding and getting O board put-backs. Nobody really plays outside of
their skill set and they don't force anything.  
  
And they run really simple stuff but they run it extremely well. And I think
it's just a great testament to coaches. It doesn't have to be a fancy play;
it's how you run it. And they can all shoot off of screens and they really
play to their strengths and share the ball extremely well.  
  
Q. Who knows what will happen today but if they don't win the tournament
they may not get in. Are they an NCAA Tournament to you?  
COACH LEVENS: I think so, yeah, because we played a few teams from the Pac-12.
I came from the Pac-12 and just the familiarity of that kind of thing. But
they played Louisville really tough for the first half this season. And I do
think if they got in the tournament, in the right matchups they can win a
couple games in it. How far they'll go, I don't know.  
  
Q. So you first got here two seasons ago, and that summer you were just
trying to establish a culture. And then this past summer you were focusing on
continuing that culture and you had summer programming for fitness and mental
health. In your efforts to become a championship team, what programming are
you planning this summer with the incoming freshmen?  
COACH LEVENS: That's a great question. I haven't really thought about our
offseason plans. We were trying to play as long as we could.  
  
I do foresee us adding some additional players this spring, up to four or
five. That will determine what we do. Last summer it was based on what we felt
what the needs of the team were to improve kind of their mental and emotional
strength, to be honest. So I think it will just depend on what our team needs.  
  
Q. Give us your thoughts on today's game and about your career at
Nevada.  
JADE REDMON: Well, first and foremost, obviously we're a team full of
underclassmen. I thought that our underclassmen fought really hard and played
extremely well for us, which made me really happy and happy for them as I hope
they bring that into their future seasons. But, yeah, it's been a long career
for me. Obviously I've gotten hurt a few times. This is my sixth year. But I
just want to thank the current staff for accepting me and putting me in a
great position to play a great brand of basketball. And obviously it didn't
end how I had hoped but overall I'm very satisfied with my career and happy
with how it went.  
  
TERAE BRIGGS: Kind of what Jade said. I'm really happy to be a part of this
program. We did a lot of big things. We went from a program that didn't really
win a lot of games to winning, going to the WBI last year and kind of making a
run this year. I felt like the same, the freshmen fought. And they just fought
for us, for sure. My career has been amazing. And I got to meet new people. I
don't know, it's been a lot of fun.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 11, 2019

  

### [Joe Legerski](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13841)

### [Marta Gomez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36689)

### [Bailee Cotton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36690)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Wyoming - 64, Utah State - 41  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Wyoming head coach Joe Legerski and student-
athletes Marta Gomez and Bailee Cotton.  
  
COACH LEGERSKI: I thought our senior leadership showed tonight. Marta and
Bailee have been through so much in this tournament, being seniors that have
played extensively. The same with Clara Tapia. We talked about our big start
and what we wanted to do defensively. I thought we executed it at a high
level.  
  
When you have players like Marta and Bailee, get you going offensively, makes
it a game, where all of a sudden in the second half we can kind of determine
how we want to play it, whether we want to speed it up, slow it down. I
thought the first half really gave us that opportunity.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. The hot start offensively, did that set up your defense, or did the
defense set up the offense, or a little bit of both? What attributed to the
fast start?  
COACH LEGERSKI: I thought our defense really set up our offense. To be able to
hold Utah State, which is a very potent offensive team, to make it very
difficult, as we talked about, one and out.  
  
And we knew having played them twice that there were going to be switches
happening and we just had to make sure that our motion offense had a lot of
cuts in it; and the players, as I said, experienced players, and I thought the
play of Clara Tapia. She took to heart what we talked about doing. To go from
5-of-6 from the field and no 3s from her, and she finished. And that was a big
plus for us throughout the whole evening.  
  
Q. Marta, their coach called you the best half-court offensive team in
the Mountain West. You guys shoot 53 percent tonight. What was working
offensively to get the kind of looks you got?  
MARTA GOMEZ: I think just our motion offense. We practiced that for four
years. We really mastered the motion offense and I think it's really hard to
guard. So I think that's what makes us a really good team, that we always talk
about that we don't even know what we are going to do, because motion is like
so free for us to run whatever we want. And I think that confused a lot of
teams. When we run it and we do it good, I think that's pretty hard to guard.  
  
Q. Bailee, Dufficy had 11 first-half points but then just six in the
second half. I know she had foul trouble you guarded her a lot, the defensive
player of the year in this league. Did you do anything different defensively
against her to slow her down?  
BAILEE COTTON: Yeah, I noticed when we went in for halftime that she had 11
points and she was the only one in double figures. So it was, like, I knew I
had to step up a little bit. And we knew she was going to get her points. She
shot 20 times. And so I think holding her to 8-of-20, I'm still proud of that,
because we knew she was going to shoot so much. And I wanted to make sure
every shot she had, it was tough and it was tough to get it into her and tough
for her to even move.  
  
Q. I know you probably want another shot at New Mexico but San Diego
State pulls the upset. You guys beat San Diego State pretty handedly when you
played them earlier in the year. What's your thoughts on that matchup?  
COACH LEGERSKI: What I looked at they defeated New Mexico that's something
we've not done this year so that's a challenge in and of itself. The way the
conference is set up to play some teams only once and that happened to be
playing them in the first week of January at our place. They've improved
tremendously. And they got a big win tonight and advanced on it's something
we're going to spend coaches are going to be up late tonight breaking down
film, going through it again, taking a look at it, it may not be much you can
take back from that January game as much as what you're going to find over the
last few games because they played very well, they're excited, they're rolling
and that's a dangerous team right now.  
  
Q. For either of you guys, how much of a benefit is it they're going to
be playing their third game in three days?  
BAILEE COTTON: I think it's something that's kind of in the back of your mind.
They might not think about it that much. It may not affect them. But as the
game goes on and as the minutes go on I know that their legs will start to get
tired. My legs got a little bit tired going into the fourth quarter. So I'm
sure that hopefully theirs will anyways for us for our sake.  
  
MARTA GOMEZ: I think they just beat New Mexico. So probably tomorrow they're
going to forget about how tired they are and they're going to be let's beat
Wyoming. I think we really need to be ready for that, just don't assume
they're going to be tired. Don't assume that we beat ...

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 11, 2019

  

### [Jerry Finkbeiner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26597)

### [Eliza West](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36682)

### [Shannon Dufficy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32783)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Wyoming - 64, Utah State - 41  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State head coach Jerry Finkbeiner and
student-athletes Shannon Dufficy and Eliza West. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH FINKBEINER: Yeah, it was a game -- obviously, by the score -- Wyoming
pretty much had their way with us.  
  
We beat them the first game we played this year at our home. They beat us the
second game at their place. And I thought going into this game we were in a
good place mentally and emotionally and the game plan.  
  
But they really came out in the first quarter and just overwhelmed us
fundamentally, overwhelmed us defensively. And hindsight, I probably should
have called a timeout or two the first quarter. I just thought they'd miss a
shot surely and we'd make a shot, surely, and stop the bleeding a little bit,
but it didn't happen.  
  
So I think Wyoming, their biggest improvement from our win at our place is
defensively. They just really tightened the screws on us defensively. And we
just had a hard time executing what we wanted to execute offensively. And I
think at the defensive level, even though they shot the ball so well, they
didn't give us a chance to get in offensively. Credit Wyoming. They were
really good tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. How much did that early run from Wyoming -- I think it was a 9-0 run
after it was tied 4-4 -- how much did that set the tone over the game
overall?  
COACH FINKBEINER: Basketball is a game of momentum. And you always hope to
keep that momentum in runs of four or six points and no more. And that's where
I remember thinking just so clearly, do we call a time-out? Tournament games
you want three, four timeouts in the fourth quarter down the stretch to
prevent unknowns, and just thinking we were going to be just equals out there,
thinking it was going to be a close game, kind of had a little inner battle,
so to speak. Should I call a timeout, burn a couple now, or hold on and
hopefully make a couple of shots and move forward that way?  
  
So it really hurt us. Now at halftime we're down by 16. Yeah, that's a lot of
points, but we're still in a good place emotionally and thought if we could
just cut it to 10 or less going into the fourth quarter.  
  
But man we came out in the third quarter, the same thing. The same thing. Just
could not stop the Cowgirls out there.  
  
We gave it our best effort. Gave it a really good effort. Played with a lot of
heart and soul but they were just really good tonight, the Wyoming Cowgirls,
really good.  
  
Q. So on that note, saying they're really good, for one of the student-
athletes, what was the difference, because in the other games you held them to
52 and 42, pretty low scoring? Tonight they score 64. What was different about
the Cowgirls tonight? They were scoring with pretty much ease in a lot of
cases?  
SHANNON DUFFICY: Clearly they shot a lot better than they did against us when
we beat them. We held them the lowest percentage from the 3-point line when we
played them and beat them. And tonight they shot 44 percent and 53 percent
from twos. Yes, they were unstoppable tonight. We just couldn't match it.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned they really put the pressure on you defensively
tonight. What was challenging about the way they played?  
COACH FINKBEINER: You know, I think Wyoming is maybe the best -- well, I think
they are -- I think they're the best team in the conference in the half court.
They execute really well offensively -- a lot of screens, a lot of cuts, a lot
of back doors. We were prepared for them, but we couldn't match their
execution on the offensive side.  
  
And defensively, not the quickest group in the conference, but they're all
long and they anticipate well and they're always in your face. And we just
couldn't shake them tonight.  
  
I think if the game would have started off a little differently; if they
wouldn't have been as hot, we make a couple more shots, the whole reflection
of the game could have been different. But they came out so hot and confidence
just grew and grew and grew. And they didn't give us a chance, didn't give us
a chance.  
  
I think Wyoming is the best half-court team in our conference. And we want to
go up and down a little bit more, we want to get some fastbreaks. But they got
back -- when they make shots it's hard to fast break. We couldn't fast break.  
  
Q. Looking back at the season, you surprised a lot of people. You were
picked to finish eighth, and you went into the conference tournament at least
two seeds above that. I think you surprised a lot of people throughout this.
Eliza, looking back on this season, what are you taking from it?  
ELIZA WEST: I think it's been a really big learning experience for, like,
personally, my and Shannon's junior year. We've seen what we can do and when
we play to our potential how good we can be. And so from this season, like,
we've been able to play a lot of Pac-12 teams. We've seen where the top
basketball is at and we know we're not far from it. So we need to get back in
the gym and keep working because we know we can get to that level.  
  
Q. Shannon, going into next year, having set all these records already
this year, is it hard for you to find the balance between being excited about
your personal achievements and wanting to help your team out in doing better
next year?  
SHANNON DUFFICY: Yeah, definitely I just, like I said yesterday, personal
achievements, I don't really care about them. Like, if I had to play zero
rebounds, zero points and we got the W, I couldn't careless. I don't really
care about the personal achievements as long as we can get the win. And
hopefully we can do better next year.  
  
Q. With the seniors that are now done playing with this team, what's it
like to see them finish this way?  
ELIZA WEST: I wish I could have done it better for them.  
  
SHANNON DUFFICY: Yeah, they're a big loss. We'll miss them next year. Would
have been nice to send them home with a couple more wins, but ...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 11, 2019

  

### [Mike Bradbury](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32780)

### [Nike McClure](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32710)

### [Jaisa Nunn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34808)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 70, New Mexico - 61 (OT)  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by New Mexico head coach Mike Bradbury and
student-athletes Nike McClure and Jaisa Nunn. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH BRADBURY: I thought, you know, hard-fought game. I thought both teams
played really hard. Give San Diego State credit. They came in here and were
definitely ready to go. And rebounded the ball extremely well. Attacked the
basket. I thought they played well. Give them a lot of credit.  
  
And I think for us, I think we played hard. But you just can't be minus-15
rebounding and shoot it the way we did.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. One possession that kind of came to mind was the last one of
regulation. You guys only had one team foul. Did you have an opportunity to
foul them or not really?  
COACH BRADBURY: We couldn't get everything communicated because we gave up
four or five offensive rebounds on that same possession. So in the whole
thing, we were in scramble mode. So there was very little time to get that
communicated to our team.  
  
Q. I know there's probably not an explanation for this, but that's the
second time against San Diego State for whatever reason the 3s just didn't go
in. Is it anything they do or did you just feel like --  
COACH BRADBURY: That's their plan. And it's fine. I thought out of 29 shots
from the 3, I'm going to say 25 were horse shots. And you've got to make more
than three of those. You just can't win like that.  
  
Q. Coach, how much did Aisia's absence affect you guys?  
COACH BRADBURY: I don't know. Aisia's not playing. So I have -- sorry I can't
answer that the way you want me to. I don't think it had anything to do with
anything.  
  
We didn't win tonight because we didn't rebound and we didn't make a wide-open
shot. And whether Aisia was playing or not, I don't think that changes.  
  
Q. How much did the turnovers really kind of take you out of what you
really wanted to do?  
COACH BRADBURY: We had 17. I mean, we average 16. Again, I don't think that
was what beat us. We're a good rebounding team. And we absolutely got killed
on the boards. That's more the problem. The turnovers were -- it's about what
we usually do.  
  
Q. With the rebounding, did you feel it was more a lack of execution by
your team or was it just something that the Aztecs were doing that made them
so effective?  
COACH BRADBURY: You know, sometimes -- I don't think it was execution. I think
San Diego State played really, really hard. And they went and got rebounds.
And I think sometimes the rebounds get skewed a little bit by -- if you're the
team missing all the shots, you know. But we missed about the same amount of
shots they did. So I think they just beat us to the ball a little bit.  
  
But I don't think it was because we didn't play hard enough. I think that's
just the way it was.  
  
Q. In the fourth quarter you guys had that 10-point lead. Were there any
breakdowns that you saw on those back-to-back 3s that San Diego State hit?  
COACH BRADBURY: No, we went zone. We were having trouble guarding the ball. So
we went zone about five possessions there and the first three were good. And
the last couple they knocked down a couple 3s. But it was -- I mean it was
just kind of what happened.  
  
One was contested. They make 9 out of 20. And I don't know that their 20 shots
were any higher quality than our 29. They just made a bunch of them. And give
credit. They made shots. That's what you have to do.  
  
Q. Jaisa, comment on tonight's game. You had a great game, obviously. Do
you have any thoughts on the game tonight and your career at New Mexico?  
JAISA NUNN: I just want to say, like, credit to San Diego State. They played a
hard game and congrats to them. But it was just, we all played hard and it was
a good game. That's my thoughts.  
  
NIKE MCCLURE: Thanks to our fans for showing up. Thanks to our band and our
cheer team. We really appreciate you guys. Don't really have any comments on
the game.  
  
COACH BRADBURY: I'll add this, too. First of all, nobody's career or anything
up here is over. We're one of the teams -- we're 41 in the RPI. So this is
definitely not our last game. And it won't be here. We're not one of the teams
that comes to the conference tournament and it ends. We will always continue
play.  
  
So with that said, what we talked about in the locker room is we have to make
sure we leave here mentally right so we can prepare for our next game. And it
won't be next year.  
  
Q. Jaisa, you even had a few looks at the 3 tonight. For whatever
reason, they just weren't falling. You guys don't probably miss that many in
practice on a normal day. Is it something about this arena? Something about
playing San Diego State, or just luck of the draw?  
JAISA NUNN: I think it was just the luck of the draw. We were hitting them at
first then they just weren't falling. I tried hitting them -- Jayla, Jaedyn,
Ahlise, like everybody, even A.T. (phonetic) started hitting them or trying to
shoot them and they just didn't fall.  
  
Q. Nike, it really kind of felt like when the kid made the shot with two
seconds left or whatever to tie it, a little bit of the air went out of the
arena. How did you guys feel going into overtime?  
NIKE MCCLURE: Confident. We always feel confident going into overtime. This is
a team that's really capable of playing in overtime. We just didn't show up
today to do that. We'll have plenty more opportunities in the future to win
basketball games hopefully. But I mean shots like that kind of, they suck, but
I'm confident in my team to play the correct plays when they need to be made.  
  
Q. What's it mean to hear what Coach said that you know you're going to
have an opportunity to wear the cherry and silver again?  
JAISA NUNN: I mean, he's right. With our record, we definitely worked hard --
we tried to win every single game. And we have the record that we have and so
hopefully we'll still have a postseason, but just not with the Mountain West
Conference.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Ryun Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=25027)

### [Tatum Neubert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36683)

### [Mollie Mounsey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36684)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 62, Colorado State - 59  
  
COACH WILLIAMS: … Dufficy is a very, very good player. They play well
together. I thought our kids were exceptional in their fight tonight. I
thought we guarded really good. They just made a few more winning plays than
we did.  
  
But our second half was, it was strong. It was competitive. It was a winning
half. And we put ourselves in a position to win the basketball game. And I'm
proud of our kids for that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Tatum, obviously final play, you guys aren't able to get a shot up,
what's going through your head during that whole sequence?  
TATUM NEUBERT: I mean, it's hard to say what was going through my head at that
last moment. Obviously I should have gotten a shot up. But I think that it
doesn't come down to one last play. I think it comes down to all of the other
plays that were made throughout the game that we could have finished and we
didn't. But it's a team thing.  
  
So I could have gotten a shot off. I could have put one up for my team. But
I'm not going to blame myself for that. So, yeah.  
  
Q. What does it say about your guys' team, being able to come back after
they kept hitting free throws? Every time they went to the line they just kept
hitting them, and you came right back. What does that say about your team?  
MOLLIE MOUNSEY: I think we really fought tonight. Like, we've had a rough
season. Not going to lie. But I think we really fought and showed like we have
heart. And I think that's really what matters.  
  
TATUM NEUBERT: I think that if anything, we showed that we could be respected
and our game could be respected. And I think that for us it was fun to play
this game because we were playing together and we were playing hard. And
that's a team that I know that we are and that we showed tonight. For us it
feels good that we played as a team and we just worked together.  
  
Q. You guys obviously took the lead into the fourth quarter. Then they
go on a 11-0 run. What were they doing that gave you fits in that last part?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Dufficy made some tough shots, but the O boards got us. They
rebounded the ball extremely well and I think that's kind of what got us. Gave
them a few extra possessions.  
  
West hits the big 3. 24 sparks them a little bit. And so I thought the start
of the fourth was obviously critical. We went up and immediately down 10. But
the kids fought. I think we made our -- your point on how we ended the game --
I think we scored six out of our last seven possessions, maybe. Really good
execution. Kids made winning plays.  
  
And that was a good college basketball game. Hats off to Utah State. Dufficy,
she's a big-time player, made some big-time shots. So did West.  
  
Q. Both regular-season games were kind of lopsided. What was the
difference in this game? You guys were going toe to toe and nearly pulled this
game off.  
COACH WILLIAMS: I think we guarded better in 40 minutes. We had some stretches
in each of those first two games where we either turned it over and created
some offense for them or what have you.  
  
But I thought tonight we were really locked in. Only four turnovers in the
second half. And it's the tournament. I mean, I think you're going to see a
lot of close games. It's just how it is when you see somebody three times.  
  
Our kids -- they were locked into us; we were locked into them. So everything
is difficult. They made it difficult on us. We made it difficult on them. But
just wish we could have got this one.  
  
Q. You are really familiar with this team it seems, but were there any
surprises from playing Utah State tonight?  
COACH WILLIAMS: I don't know if we were surprised by really anything. They did
the same stuff they usually do. So, no. I wish I could give you a better
answer. I know you were looking for something, but we weren't surprised by
anything.  
  
Q. Tatum, obviously you'd rather go out with a win in your final game.
But just thinking about the entire season as a whole, what's the biggest thing
you'll take out of this season?  
TATUM NEUBERT: I mean, me and Mollie were just talking about this. If we were
going to go out anyway this is the way we wanted to go out. We gave everything
we had. And in my final season, I think the spirit that we brought every
single practice even though we were losing.  
  
We were coming into practice every day, working just as hard, coming into
every game we were working just as hard. And every practice, everyone had a
smile on their face we were ready for the next day every time. I can't ask for
a better team for my last season.  
  
Q. What's your takeaway from the final game; you guys lose, but you look
like a different team?  
COACH WILLIAMS: Yeah, we played some good ball here lately. We really have. It
hasn't equaled the wins obviously, but we put some really good stretches
together. But tonight we just did it for a little longer. So my take on the
game is just what I said earlier.  
  
These kids competed. And like Tatum said, they came and they bought in every
day to the plan. This is how we can beat this team; this is how we need to
improve. And they did it with a wonderful attitude and a wonderful spirit.  
  
And it was Tatum led that charge a lot of the time. So I'm just happy that
Tatum chose to be a Ram. She's been at a couple other schools, and I'm glad --
I'm proud that we get to call her a Ram and that she finished up as a Ram and
got to play a ton of minutes this year and gave everything she had. As a
competitor, that's all you can ask. And Tatum's been a wonderful player on our
roster and a wonderful leader in our locker room.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Stacie Terry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26587)

### [Mallory Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36678)

### [Sophia Ramos](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36679)

### [Naje' Murray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36680)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
STACIE TERRY: It was a defensive battle. I thought both teams came out and
really defended well tonight, made it really hard to score, both of us, on our
opponents. I'm really proud of our kids for coming in and gutting out this
really tough win. Air Force is a really good ballclub, and they're getting
better every single year. She's done a phenomenal job recruiting and bringing
in a lot of young talent, and they can get down in a stance and defend.  
  
I was talking with my team, I was just really proud that we matched their
defensive effort. That's the key for us as we continue to grow is our defense
improving and continuing to improve.  
  
Q. Seemed like Air Force, they always play hard, and you guys just
seemed to have the answer tonight every time they cut it close. You would make
a big basket. I was going to ask the players how it felt out there and if they
appreciate how hard they play. You guys always just seemed to have the answer
tonight.  
SOPHIA RAMOS: We just are a really well-coached team. We have a lot of
competitive practices. So it's a lot of gamelike situations for us. We've been
in a lot of close games, so I think this has just helped us a lot to prepare
for the tournament.  
  
Q. Mallory, you had a big game with 20 points. Just feeling good
tonight, the shot was there?  
MALLORY ADAMS: Yeah, I thought it was pretty good. I feel like first half
things were a little bit more open, and they really came out second half and
really shot a lot of us down. It was really hard for us to get downhill, which
caused them to go on runs, and then we would answer back with a run. But it
was really competitive the entire game.  
  
Q. Naje', they started out with a little bit of a run but you guys came
back and didn't give up the rest of the game. Was it just your intensity?  
NAJE' MURRAY: Yeah, you know, we're a really tenacious team. We are used to
that situation. So when we have a cushion, we kind of gather ourselves, okay,
guys, we've been in this before, this is nothing new for us, so I think once
we've been in those situations where it comes down to big-time plays, I think
we will always be prepared for those.  
  
Q. The tournament experience, it's an intense couple days, but do you
look forward to it? Is it a good experience for you? I imagine it is.  
MALLORY ADAMS: Absolutely, it's a great feeling, especially to come out with a
win.  
  
Q. You'll recover enough for tomorrow and be ready to go?  
MALLORY ADAMS: I think so, yeah.  
  
NAJE' MURRAY: Ice baths for everybody.  
  
Q. Coach, Air Force talked about having a young team, which they are,
but you're a young team, also.  
STACIE TERRY: We're really young. And I'm really excited about what we're
going to do in the future. We're starting two freshmen and two sophomores and
a junior who literally arrived the day school started. You know, we're going
to give it all this tournament here and hopefully be victorious on Wednesday.
But the future is bright for San Diego State women's basketball.  
  
Q. I agreed with you how hard they played because Air Force is hard to
play with their intensity.  
STACIE TERRY: It's such a good defensive team, and every game that we've
played since I've been here has been a battle, and she's done, like I said, a
really good job in improving, and they're bringing in really quality kids, and
they have some young freshmen that really got after us defensively. So proud
of our kids to match it. We gave up or held them to 20 points in the second
half. That's the type of defense that's always going to win you games.  
  
Q. How do you feel going forward to Wednesday? Feel pretty confident?  
STACIE TERRY: I'm excited. You know, we've played New Mexico close both times,
even at the Pit. I thought it was a tight game down the stretch, and we gave
ourselves a good chance with a couple minutes to go in New Mexico, and then
obviously beat them at home. You know, Mike does a great job. They want to
push. They want to really play at a fast pace, and that's what I think we're
at our best, too. So it's going to be fine. I think our kids are confident and
ready. If we can just manage those highs and lows, I think we can give
ourselves a really good shot to win tomorrow.

### [Terae Briggs](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34818)

### [Emma Torbert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36676)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 78, San Jose State - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Nevada head coach Amanda Levens and student-
athletes Terae Briggs, Jade Redmon and Emma Torbert.  
  
COACH LEVENS: I give San Jose State a ton of credit. They played well to end
their season. Won four of their last six games. Had a players shooting
incredibly from the 3-point line coming into our game. And I just felt they
were in a good rhythm and playing really confidently at this time of year.  
  
For our team we wanted to defend the 3-point line better than we did. Our goal
was to only give up -- was it six? I think six 3s because they've been
averaging eight in conference play.  
  
I thought our team did enough to win. We've been relying on Jade and Terae,
and they've been doing what they've been doing all season long for us tonight.
And this time of year you need everyone to step up, and Emma really stepped up
and had a great game and I thought played confidently. And as coaches we
believed in her all year, so to see her do the things she can do is really
just awesome.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. You guys obviously made a big run through last year's tournament. Is
there anything you can draw on that will help you this week in that regard?  
TERAE BRIGGS: Well, the goal was to just get further in the tournament and
actually go to the NCAA Tournament. So that's what our goal is this year. And
we have to play the full 40 minutes and just playing together for sure.  
  
JADE REDMON: I think from last year we learned that in the tournament it's
anybody's game. And it's just a matter of coming out and giving full effort
and playing a complete game. I think from last year that's what I'm definitely
taking in and trying to tell the younger players that you've just got to play
hard. And if you play hard you'll put yourself in a good position to win.  
  
Q. Emma, you guys played Boise, especially that one meeting really
close. How much does that benefit you going into tomorrow's game?  
JADE REDMON: I think it's just a good reminder that we can compete with
anybody, especially the top team in the conference. And I think it's also just
a confidence booster that it could be our game.  
  
Q. Jade, you started the game 0-for-6, ended the game leading the team
with 19 points. What was going on on the bench. What changed in the middle of
the game for you to start like that and finish like you did?  
JADE REDMON: Just a desire to win, honestly. If my shots aren't falling I try
not to really think about that too much because that's just how the game goes.
Sometimes you're on; sometimes you're off. I just tried to make up for it on
defense, get my teammates the ball and hopefully that will pay off. And I
think it did in the end.  
  
Q. Emma, could you just talk about the 3-pointers you hit? You were
3-for-4, but I guess you're, like, traditionally on paper you're a post, not a
guard. What's going on?  
EMMA TORBERT: Well, us posts, we practice shooting 3s a lot and we just -- our
post coaches just want us to go out there and shoot confidently. And I just
try to get as many points as I can to help us win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Obviously it's not the same team as last season. Are there things
from last season that you can draw on for this week?  
COACH LEVENS: I think the returners who played here have a sense of
confidence. We played well here to end the year. We don't visit this venue all
season. So coming back, even for me there's a lot of great feelings and
memories of just how fun that tournament was for us last year.  
  
And I think our younger players definitely feed off the older players. So the
older players feel good. They feel confident. And just to echo what they said,
I think they believe when we play well we can beat anybody, but when we don't
play well we can be beat by anybody. So I think this week our goal is just no
regrets. Go out and play as hard as we can and see what happens.  
  
Q. You played Boise to within a point earlier in the season. Is that
important going into tomorrow?  
COACH LEVENS: I mean yes and no. In my opinion, Boise, they're really, really
good. And we played them up at their place after that. And they kind of had a
double-digit lead the whole game. When they're firing on all cylinders,
they're just so dangerous because they can score at every position, even when
they sub.  
  
They have four back-court guards that are all juniors and seniors, upper-
classmen guards that have won and understand what this tournament's all about,
winning the tournament, winning the conference. They have their own set of
confidence for different reasons.  
  
And so for us we're pretty much the underdog. But for our team we also believe
that we can compete with anybody. Can we win? I don't know, we'll find out
tomorrow.  
  
Q. There were 33 fouls called in the game, 24 of them called against San
Jose State with Nevada shooting 83.9 percent from the free throw line, 26 for
31. How important are free throws in practice to you, especially considering
earlier in the season there was a game where Nevada shot 35 percent from the
free-throw line, to go to 84 percent today?  
COACH LEVENS: To me it always just shows focus when we shoot over 80 percent
or close to 80 percent, I know our team is...

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Chris Gobrecht](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30464)

### [Kaelin Immel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34802)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
San Diego State - 63, Air Force 55  
  
CHRIS GOBRECHT: We've all got to figure out how to make this work at the
Academy to develop those skill levels to the point where we can be highly
competitive in the division, and no better place to start than with this very
young team, which is what we have right now.  
  
Q. It seemed like the second half, you guys kept getting really close,
maybe a possession or two, and then they just sort of had an answer every
time. Was that frustrating?  
KAELIN IMMEL: I mean, yeah, it's always frustrating. I think, again, it comes
down to just how young we are as a program and as a team, and I think we can
get excited and we can get into the game, but then we'll make transfers that
we can't be making in those crucial situations and things like that, and we'll
give them an easy lay-up, and that just drains us, and it shouldn't. But
again, only like two of us have been in this tournament before, and the rest
were all brand new. This is the first time they've been here. It's difficult
to fight back from those situations.  
  
Q. You guys played very hard. What do you take away from tonight's
experience?  
KAELIN IMMEL: I don't know, I mean, I think we've all realized, especially
after what coach has told us, that we get to get in the gym more, and after
the season we need to get better in the off-season. We haven't had the
opportunity really -- the freshmen really don't have the opportunity because
of all the requirements of the academy and the things that -- other things we
need to do like school and military. But you can make time. It's all about
making priorities and what you priority advertise in your life. So if we
decide to prioritize basketball, we can get better as a program and we can
move ahead from this, because we really should have improved this season, but
instead, we almost took a step back.  
  
CHRIS GOBRECHT: I don't know that we necessarily took a step back. It was a
necessary transition that we had to go through, and we're building this thing
from scratch. That's all there is to it because that's how you have to do it
at the academy. You don't have international students, you don't have transfer
students, you don't have fifth-year students, you don't have JC kids, you
don't have the things that most of the programs in this conference are highly
dependent on. So we have to do it from scratch, and we have to help a lot of
young kids understand the demands of the academy and how to be highly
competitive at division 1. We will get there, but I think that the best thing
is that we're not satisfied with just being in games and our players aren't
satisfied, and so I think we're ready -- I think the program is ready to take
a big step forward, but a lot will have to happen in the off-season. That's
going to contribute to it.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Jerry Finkbeiner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26597)

### [Eliza West](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36682)

### [Shannon Dufficy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32783)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Utah State - 62, Colorado State - 59  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by Utah State head coach Jerry Finkbeiner and
student-athletes Shannon Dufficy and Eliza West. Coach, an opening statement.  
  
COACH FINKBEINER: I thought Colorado State did a really good job establishing
the tempo of the game. We had a very hard time controlling that isolation
play. They're bigger at the guard spot, a little bit more physical than our
guards, and they just practiced that all night long. And we really struggled
guarding it.  
  
But credit to our kids. Obviously we made big plays when we needed big plays.
And hit free throws down the stretch, I think 6-for-6 down that last minute,
minute ten seconds, and obviously we needed every one of those free throws.  
  
It was all about situations the last two minutes. We've been working a lot on
situations the last week of practice. So it might have been a little pay-off
there. But I look at our stats. We just did not shoot the ball very well.  
  
But we had a good assist-to-turnover ratio. I think that might have been our
biggest positive, 15 assists to 10 turnovers. These two here, you might
mention Shannon Dufficy, all-league this year, Mountain West. And she broke
our Utah State double-double season record tonight.  
  
And Eliza West broke our assist record at Utah State. A big night for some
individual awards. But most importantly, as they'll say, the W is a lot bigger
deal tonight than individual stuff. So we're just really happy to move forward
and move on and tomorrow night's a late game at 8:30.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Like Coach said, it's a huge deal but I've got to hear your take from
both of you. What it's like to have these records? Was it on your mind at all
tonight going into the game?  
SHANNON DUFFICY: I'm going to say no, I didn't even know this was the game
that it could happen in. As Coach said, like, we would both say it's not the
individual achievements that we're worried about; it's the W. Whether it's an
ugly loss or a real pretty one, it's the W that matters in the end. I think
it's a reflection of our teammates of both of us getting these achievements.  
  
ELIZA WEST: I agree with Shannon. I did know about the assist record kind of
thing coming up because it was put on Twitter and then everyone kept telling
me about it at practice. I was like leave me alone.  
  
But it wasn't something I was thinking about in the game because, of course,
we're in the tournament now and it's one game on to the next. And individual
achievements are just blocked out right now. And it's not something we need to
think about we need to think about the team and winning the championship.  
  
Q. You had a pretty awful third quarter in terms of shooting but you
bounce back in the fourth quarter. How did you bounce back from that third
quarter offensively, and then kick it off with an 11-0 run to start the
fourth?  
ELIZA WEST: I think we had a good -- when we had a good stretch we hit a
couple of nice shots. And Marlene was really good for us in that segment. She
had steals and just had really strong takes in the basket. And that just
really helped us. Her game was really significant tonight for us.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit more about Marlene. We haven't really seen much
from her until now. So tell me about how awesome that was to see her
succeed?  
COACH FINKBEINER: First of all, we still can't pronounce her last name. So we
just call her Mar or Marlene.  
  
ELIZA WEST: Aniambossou.  
  
COACH FINKBEINER: Very nice. I told the girls in the locker room, all these
individual achievements, we got a win. There was a lot of pressure on both
teams tonight. The first-round win is -- I hope the wrinkles have now been
ironed out for tomorrow and maybe the pressure might be on Wyoming a little
bit.  
  
But Marlene might get the game basketball tonight. She came off the bench,
played very limited minutes all year. She's going to have a good senior year.
But she's probably the difference of our game tonight, just come off the bench
and give us spark.  
  
Hailey Bassett-Meacham struggled tonight. And Deja Mason struggled tonight.
They're our 2-3 posts along with Shannon. And Marlene is our fourth post off
the bench and she came up big.  
  
Q. Rachel had nine points going into the half. She's your leading
scorer, goes scoreless in the second half. You end up having six players score
more than eight points in the game. How did that overall distribution help you
guys to stay ahead throughout the game?  
COACH FINKBEINER: That's a good question, because that's one of our internal
issues of trying to be where we want to be. We have struggled all year long
with scoring. Shannon scored all year long. We've had a really hard time
having other people score with her.  
  
And the last five out of seven games, six out of seven games we've had,
finally had two, three, sometimes four double-figure girls. Even though
Rachel's was in the first half, Olivia West also had nine in the first half,
ended up being our leading scorer. And now we're starting to get some punch
there offensively.  
  
And I think our late-season run has been due to the fact that we're starting
to score more points.  
  
Now, tonight we didn't shoot the ball very well. But I think it was nerves,
and I think it's Colorado State. But it's big time. Olivia, that one comment
there, I mentioned the girls in the locker room a few minutes ago, Olivia and
Rachel, we needed that first half out of them. Definitely needed them.  
  
Q. Coach, how would you describe that last minute overall, pretty hectic
where you pulled away and they came back, repeated two or three times in that
final minute and 30 seconds?  
COACH FINKBEINER: I was asked by the Mountain West Network, what did you guys
do? I told them I can't remember. I have to watch the tape. Sometimes you have
to have those situations, your players make plays, both offensively and
defensively.  
  
Like Eliza said Marlene made a couple plays, got a steal, made two free
throws. Eliza hit a 3. Shannon hit a 2. Just things came together there.  
  
And you wish it could happen over 40 minutes. But I think the biggest positive
we can take away tonight, we just did the things we had to do to get over the
hump. We did the things we had to do to get the W.  
  
I know there's two sides of the picture here: Colorado State's view and our
view. And we did the things that we needed to do to get the win. So we're
really proud of the girls. We have worked a lot on situations.  
  
We've worked a lot on plays when the shot clock is running down. So I think it
gave our girls a little confidence in those situations when we had to make a
play.  
  
Q. You mentioned a couple of times the poor shooting night overall. You
had a lot of offensive rebounds. I think 13 or 14 or so. Like, how big is
getting those offensive rebounds on a night where not all the shots are
falling?  
COACH FINKBEINER: Shannon's our lead rebounder. She's averaging a double-
double on the season and I think about 12 or 13 in conference.  
  
And Colorado State has a really interesting game plan. They don't bound
offensively; they just get back. They don't want to give up a layup. They can
give up offensive opportunities.  
  
On the flipside, we try to really impress upon our girls let's get offensive
rebounds, let's get putbacks. So that might have been true, besides the
assist-to-turnover ratio, second-chance points, 10-0, two are probably the two
stat lines that really gave us the win tonight.  
  
We need to do more than that tomorrow night, because tomorrow's nights game
against Wyoming, they have an inside-out, and they have one of the better
records in the conference.  
  
But I think Colorado State, it's just their tempo tonight. That probably makes
our winning better because we played their style, their tempo, and we walked
away with a win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [MOUNTAIN WEST WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
CHAMPIONSHIP](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=MOUNTAIN+WEST+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Jamie Craighead](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26595)

### [Cydni Lewis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36673)

### [Danae Marquez](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36674)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Nevada - 78, San Jose State - 68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by San Jose State Spartans, head coach Jamie
Craighead and student-athletes Cydni Lewis and Danae Marquez.  
  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: It was a grind-it-out game. I thought we played with great
effort. There were moments we couldn't seem to get a defensive rebound off a
first missed shot. And I thought that was the difference in the game besides
the free-throw line. And usually when you get those second chance rebounds
that's what happens; you end up fouling on the rebound.  
  
So I thought if we could have controlled that a little bit better, it was such
a close game, it was a possessions game. And we could have had some chances.
But really proud of our effort and proud of these two young ladies and we'll
move on from here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Danae, could you tell us about the game, what you saw and how it went
for you?  
DANAE MARQUEZ: You know, the game was a struggle, like Coach said. It was hard
for us to get a rebound and put it back up. We only shot 11 free throws to
their 31. That was really a difference-maker I thought. It felt like we could
never keep the momentum on our side.  
  
Q. Cyd, probably one of your best games in a while. You were taking the
ball to the hoop did you feel you had an advantage over them?  
CYDNI LEWIS: Yeah, honestly I felt the isolation, especially in the elbow
areas, I felt like I could easily attack off the dribble. Being -- this being
the last game sets the tone for next year, I think.  
  
Q. Could you talk a little bit, D first, and then maybe Cyd, the
progression of the team over the course of the league play. Seems like you
guys got better and better. Out there today, it just seemed like as well if
you could have gotten a couple of possessions in a row you would have turned
this thing around.  
DANAE MARQUEZ: The season was ups and downs but towards the end here I think
we came together as a team and grew confidence together. We started playing
for one another and believing in each other, and I think it's been evident
with our last round of league here.  
  
CYDNI LEWIS: Yeah, same.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Your team got close a couple times and then Emma Torbert, 15 for
Nevada, knocked down some 3s. That appeared to stun you that she was able to
knock those down. It seemed like it took some air out of the team when she hit
those.  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: It was back-to-back possessions when she hit the two. And
it's an action that we're pretty common to guarding. It's a turn-back action
where you dribble up and pop a shooter out. And the exchange, it felt like a
couple of our players that have been so big down the stretch for us just
really struggled today and sometimes momentum-wise they're really offensive
players, so when their offense isn't going well and they're struggling, they
tend to make mistakes on defense because they're thinking about the last shot
they missed and sometimes it's the person involved in that action.  
  
Just felt like the moment was maybe a little bit big and just thinking about
the last possession that you can do nothing about. But those were big shots. I
mean, that's what this time of year is all about in March, the players that
make shots and we've talked about that. And of course we've been on our end of
it and made some big plays and cut it to one possession.  
  
Miyah hit a huge 3, but those back-to-back ones, they were hard because the
time was not on our side at that point. And then you start to press really
hard and push and kind of change how you play.  
  
Q. Did they do anything specifically against Analyss and Meg to shut
them down because neither of them really got really good looks?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: They play a defense where they deny passing lanes. And it's
always leading up to it. We just played Fresno State who zoned us a lot. So
there's always gaps for those shooters. But we still hit 13 3s and some other
people that are capable got some. But we were trying to run some actions to
get them going.  
  
But I just thought that in transition we weren't really pushing and those guys
weren't really sprinting their lanes and getting out wide. We looked a little
fatigued to me in the first half, especially. But obviously we came out in the
third quarter, we just missed some shots but battled through the fourth
quarter. Just the ball didn't bounce our way.  
  
Q. And this game was won and lost on the free-throw line.  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: For sure. It's a lot of free throws to give up, and it's the
highest percentage shot in basketball.  
  
Q. You have one senior graduating. Everyone else is coming back. Very
strong sophomore class; they're going to be juniors. What's the outlook for
this team and this program? How bright is it?  
COACH CRAIGHEAD: I walked into the arena today with a lot of underclassmen,
and we walk out of the arena today with eight upperclassmen. Three seniors,
five juniors. And Razi becomes a sophomore and two kids we've signed that we
feel really, really good about.  
  
But I saw a team that collectively kind of struggled through the preseason.
Chemistry is always a thing. And women's basketball, you've got to really --
you've got to love each other, gotta care about each other, gotta know how to
play together. And there were plenty of times where they could have given up
and they didn't. They just kept battling, we played our best basketball
through February. And obviously I thought tonight, we're not as familiar with
Nevada as we are with people we've played twice.  
  
But I thought for the most part the game plan was decently solid. If we could
have taken away the second chances that led -- to me, those free throws really
came from that. But I'm excited about the group that's coming back. And I
think that they feel really good. And that's exciting. You want your players
to feel that way.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 24, 2019

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

### [Sophie Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30334)

### [Amber Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20847)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Iowa - 68, Missouri - 52  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: Just -- obviously this is always the toughest press conference
of the year. You know, it doesn't really settle in immediately, but just the
thought of this being it for our three seniors, it's hard. It's really hard. I
just love these girls to death, and this senior class has been so incredibly
special to the University of Missouri, on the court, off the court. They've
paved a heck of a road for the kids to follow after their graduation, and
they've done it the right way. They absolutely have done it the right way.
Just enjoyed the heck out of the last four years.  
  
I feel like -- Sophie and I were just talking about before we came in here, I
feel like I've known her for half her life. It is, it becomes family for life
at our program. All of our seniors, just an incredible career, obviously,
Sophie and what she's meant to Columbia, she's kind of become our golden child
in Columbia, Missouri, and the way she's embraced this fan base and the
community has been awfully special.  
  
Certainly when you come into a program, you want to make sure you leave it
better than when you got there, and this senior class can say that. Sophie is
one of the best in the country. She's certainly left a legacy behind. I'm
proud of our entire team. We battled. We had a hard time knocking down shots
and had a hard time getting to that free-throw line. Needed to be more
aggressive attacking off the bounce, but we played a really good Iowa team. We
knew it was going to be a battle. What a great environment, what a great fan
base here in Iowa City, and we knew it was going to be a challenge.  
  
I thought we hung in there in that first half, and the second half we just had
a hard time. That second and fourth quarter we really had a hard time scoring
the ball, and I think ultimately that came back to haunt us.  
  
I thought defensively we probably did one of the best jobs anyone has done on
Iowa. I think we did a really good job, but offensively you've got to be able
to knock down shots, and we just struggled in stretches tonight.  
  
Q. Sophie, I know this is a hard one, but can you describe the feelings
when you were coming off the floor for the last time? What was going through
you?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: It wasn't because my season is over. I've been blessed.
Hopefully I have more basketball in my future. But it's just a family. It's
the family, it's the culture, it's the community that has embraced me, and I'm
so blessed and humbled that God gave me this platform.  
  
And I can't stress that enough. I'm very blessed. I'm very fortunate, and it
just humbles me, the support that I've gotten from my community, from my
teammates, from my family. So it's not the basketball, it's the family that
I'm going to miss the most.  
  
Q. Sophie, describe how difficult Iowa made it for you to score the ball
tonight.  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, I think it was hard for everyone. I don't think it
was just me. I mean, they had me. But I think we did a really good defense. We
had good defense on them. Right now I really don't even want to talk about it.
They're a good team. I don't know, didn't get to the free-throw line at all,
so I hope they do good down the road. But I'm just proud of our defense
tonight.  
  
Q. Amber, what kind of looks were you getting throughout the game? You
were obviously the engine for this offense. What was allowing you to be
successful today?  
AMBER SMITH: They were stretching it out on Sophie and Lauren a little bit
more and it left the middle wide open, and my teammates got me the ball in the
best positions possible.  
  
Q. Amber, just describe how difficult it was for you to guard against
Gustafson, such a powerful player.  
AMBER SMITH: I wasn't really on her that much, but I mean, she's a very good
player, and we put ourselves in the best position that we possibly could. She
was making tough shots tonight.  
  
Q. Coach, I thought your team played hard until the very end. You've got
to be proud of the effort. Sometimes the shots just don't fall.  
ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, I agree. Well, thank you. I thought we really competed.
I thought we put ourselves in a position with what we got done defensively,
but we just had a hard time knocking down shots tonight. Sometimes that's
going to happen. But yeah, I thought we battled for 40 minutes, and I'm really
proud of them for that.  
  
Iowa is a very good team. Obviously they've had a really special year,
undefeated at home. What a great showing tonight, great atmosphere for them,
and we knew it was going to be challenging. But thank you, I think our girls
really competed hard for 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Coach, Gustafson is probably going to get her production in most
games, but how difficult or how much pressure did that put on you guys that
Meyer performed the way she did today?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, you know, we said we didn't feel like we could take away
everything, and Megan just demands so much attention, and so the last thing we
wanted to do is give up threes and easy touches inside. We felt like if they
hit seven, eight, nine, ten threes and we were able to slow Megan down a
little bit, we'd be willing to live with it.  
  
Obviously everyone has had a hard time figuring it out this year. She's a
load. Great footwork, great hands. But she's got a great supporting cast, and
I think those girls really know their roles. They know what's expected. And
they just play such unselfish basketball, and they executed really well.  
  
Just when you look at statistically, I don't know for sure, but I feel like
it's probably one of the lowest offensive outputs from Iowa this year, or
right in the top one, two. I don't know, they haven't been in the 60s much.
But we just had a hard time scoring.  
  
Q. What are the emotions for you knowing that Sophie, Cierra and
Lauren's career is now officially over?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I don't know if there's words to describe it. I don't know
that it's set in quite yet. We felt really good coming into this game. I
really liked where our team was at. We felt confident. We never even talked
about this potentially could be the last game. I just think we liked our game
plan. The girls really bought into it. We felt really, really good. You know,
really there up until probably the six-minute mark in the fourth quarter did
you start to feel like, okay, this might not work out the way we had hoped it
would.  
  
But those emotions I'm sure will come through in a little bit here. Very
thankful. I think the biggest feeling that I have is gratitude and thankful
that they made a decision to come to the University of Missouri and really
help us elevate our program and put us on the map and put us on the national
radar. There's a lot of blood, sweat and tears that they've invested. It's
really cool when you've got not only great basketball players but just
incredible young ladies, so I've been blessed. I wish -- I think Sophie is
going to have a phenomenal career. I'm really excited for her. Just appreciate
Cierra Porter coming back; Lauren Aldridge, juggling law school and basketball
at this level is really challenging.  
  
But just incredibly great kids, and they've impacted the program, and they've
definitely impacted me personally.  
  
Q. Robin, you kind of just said this, but can you think of any one
player that's impacted the program on a level that Sophie has, from on court,
from how she's helped the culture of the team and how she's set you guys up
for future success, as well?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, I mean, that's a hard question because I don't know -- I
don't know other teams' personnel and what that community support looks like.
All I know is our players here at the University of Missouri, and just to see
the way that this community has absolutely wrapped their arms around her, and
she's done the exact same thing back to them. She just pours into them.
Anytime she had an opportunity to go out, meet and greet, take pictures, sign
autographs, she was always the last one to leave after home games, which when
you play 35 minutes a game you're usually typically pretty exhausted. Win or
lose, it didn't matter, she was out there on that court signing autographs
until that last person left.  
  
I think that's pretty remarkable. So certainly talent-wise, one of the best of
the best, right, all-time leading scorer, broke numerous records, and then
just continued to build on the core values of our program and lived them out
daily and I think has really done a great job helping our underclassmen
helping understand what that looks like and what that means moving forward.  
  
Q. It looked like there were some times you were having some trouble
communicating with your players on the court. What kind of impact did the
crowd and the environment have on your team's play?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, really it definitely impacted it. It's a loud
environment. We've played in those environments, so I don't know that -- yeah,
I don't know, you'd have to ask the players. I don't think it felt
intimidating to them, but it was hard to communicate. Just because we've been
in those environments before, but absolutely give Hawkeye fans a ton of
credit. What a great showing, what a great environment. That's pretty special,
and you've got a team that's had a special season and had a chance to go
undefeated at home, and that doesn't happen very often at this level.  
  
Q. Given Sophie's tough performance today, what can you say about
Amber's ability to keep you guys in the game, like you said, up until that
six-minute mark in the fourth quarter?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, she hit some tough shots for us. Just had that
aggressive mindset, made it hard on Sophie, just switching up between passing
it around in the zone to triangle-and-two to man defense, and that's what Iowa
does. She just switch up their defense, so you can't really get comfortable
and in a flow. But I thought Amber really stepped up for us tonight. That was
big. After I think kind of an up-and-down game against Drake, she started out
of the gates really strong, and then kind of went silent for a while and
finished strong, but I thought Amber really played an aggressive game for us
tonight, and that was big.  
  
Q. Iowa went on a couple runs there; what was the key to them being able
to sustain those runs a couple different times?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, you know, it makes it really hard when you're having a
hard time scoring. Obviously go back and watch film as much as you'd just like
to set it aside, that's just kind of how I'm wired, and I felt like we got
some good looks in that second half, and we just didn't knock them down. But
it's hard when you're giving up offensive rebounds and they get and-ones, they
go to the free-throw line and then we're just having a hard time scoring on
the other end.  
  
Again, a great team. You expect that. I thought in that first half it was a
game of runs. We both went back and forth. They just had too much firepower
there at the end, and we couldn't get shots to fall.  
  
Q. You talked about the struggles on offense; is there one thing you can
kind of put your finger on? Do you think you guys were settling, just what
they were doing defensively, or just there were good looks that didn't go
in?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, I felt like in the third quarter we had some
uncharacteristic kind of pull-up contested jump shots, but again, I'll have to
go back, but it felt like we got some really good looks that have gone down
for us. We've been a pretty good shooting team this last month and a half, and
again, you've got to give Iowa some credit. Just switching up their defenses
as much as they did, they just make it really hard for teams, I think, to get
comfortable.  
  
But I felt like we got good looks. Probably needed to be more aggressive. I
mean, we didn't get to the free-throw line. I think we shot two free throws. I
don't think this box score is right. It says we didn't shoot any, but Cierra
Porter shot two. So obviously didn't do a good enough job attacking to create
those opportunities for us. I would say that's probably the biggest takeaway.

## March 24, 2019

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Megan Gustafson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32141)

### [Makenzie Meyer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34740)

### [Kathleen Doyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33245)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Iowa - 68, Missouri - 52  
  
LISA BLUDER: I've got to start with thanking the crowd. There was so much
energy in the arena today, and we loved it, and our three seniors deserved it.
The whole team deserved it. But I'm just so thrilled that Hawkeye Nation got
behind this team. Number one in the nation in attendance on Friday -- yeah,
Friday, and then the turnaround today and just to do it again. Our fans are
amazing, and we're so thankful for them, and they just created a tremendous
home court for us, and we are very thankful for that.  
  
Megan today became the Big Ten's all-time career rebound record holder, a
great honor for her. Today she had a mere 19, 16 defensive rebounds. I thought
our zone defense was outstanding. I thought our players worked so hard in it,
and then Megan just cleaned up the glass afterwards.  
  
I'm just thrilled that we have another week. I get another week with this
group. I get another week to go to battle with these guys, and I'm very, very
happy about that.  
  
Q. Kathleen, you didn't score in the first half of that game Friday. Did
you consciously come out and try to get started early, or did you just let the
game come to you like you usually do?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: I just tried to let the game come to me. I wasn't really
thinking about that. I was just letting the offense run, and that's just how
it kind of worked out.  
  
Q. Megan, after you checked out, the three seniors there, as the seconds
ticked off, there was a group hug there, the three seniors. Just tell me about
that moment and what it was like.  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, it was amazing just to be with my seniors, and that was
our last time being in Carver-Hawkeye Arena playing, and it was a bittersweet
moment, but mostly sweet because it's a Sweet 16, and we're moving on.
(Laughter.)  
  
Q. Any of the players, the defense you played this weekend against
Mercer and then again today, the thing that really kind of stands out, the
other teams only shot two free throws in the two games combined. How does that
happen?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I mean, it just comes down to what's going on in the
environment, and we were just trying to get locked-down defense. That was our
focus going into it, and we really can't control a lot of things, but we were
able to control our effort on defense, and that's what we really wanted to
focus on, and in the Mercer game but also really especially into this game.  
  
Q. Makenzie, you told me once that warmups don't always come true when
you're hitting hot in warmups, but you were hitting in warmups on Friday and
today, and both days you were really in the zone?  
MAKENZIE MEYER: Yeah, I've just been feeling very confident, and my teammates
have done such a good job of setting me up for great shots, so I've just been
letting it fly.  
  
Q. Makenzie, I think in the regular season, final regular season game,
you didn't have a field goal, and postseason starts, you've kind of been on a
roll production wise. Do you see any key? What has allowed that to happen?  
MAKENZIE MEYER: I just feel -- I just have been feeling really confident
lately, and like I said, our offense has really been flowing really nicely.
We've been doing a good job of getting it inside to Megan and Megan is looking
back out to us for the in-and-out three, and that's a really, really great
shot for our offense. I just think the offense has been flowing really well,
and I've been able to knock my shots down, so that helps.  
  
Q. There were a lot of times when you were chasing Cunningham around the
floor. She only scored eight points, a testimony to the team's defense, but
what were you concentrated on? Were you trying to deny her the ball or cutting
off a move with one hand or what?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: I mean, she's an awesome player, so we definitely had to focus
in on her, but we were doing whatever we can to make her life as hard as
possible throughout the whole game, wear her out, and it worked out in our
favor today. But she's a really great player.  
  
Q. Megan, I think one of my favorite plays of the whole season was Tania
saw you open, and you probably could have scored, but you made a nice pass to
her, and I don't know this for a fact, but I bet your coach was smiling on
that one, when she made that floater?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, that was a really fun play. I think I could have
scored, but honestly, I just wanted Tania to score. I think it's so much fun
playing with my fellow seniors, and I just wanted that moment to really stick
out, and hats off to Tita giving me the assist.  
  
Q. Kathleen, just to follow up on Cunningham, she got her second and
third fouls there in the middle of that run, I think it was a 12-0 run. You
guys took the lead there for good. How critical was it to get her in a little
bit of foul trouble there?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, a great way to play defense on a great scorer like her
is to have her not play, so that worked out for us. But like I said, she's an
awesome player, and that just, yeah, like I said worked out in our favor that
she got into some foul trouble, and we took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Megan, whose idea was it to kiss the floor at center court there
afterwards?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: It was Hannah's. She didn't really say anything to us, she
just started running, and then me and Tania just followed and we knew what she
was doing, but that was a special moment for sure.  
  
Q. Lisa, can you talk about Tania's three to start the fourth quarter?
It just seemed like that really lifted you guys to a whole 'nother level.  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, we got pretty excited. They went to a zone defense coming
out, and then Tania hits one in the corner and then Makenzie turns around and
hits one in the other corner, and all of a sudden now they have to change
their defense again. That's exactly what you want to have happen when somebody
switches their defense is you just take advantage of it and open up with those
threes.  
  
Q. I asked Makenzie, too, but what have you seen different in her since
the postseason has started, and how beneficial has that been for your
production?  
LISA BLUDER: Well, it's huge. The more three-point shots that we can put down,
the easier it makes life for Megan inside and Hannah inside. When you have to
respect those guys, now all of a sudden you can't double as hard, you can't
cheat as much, so it opens up that middle so much. So it's wonderful when
we're hitting threes. I don't know what's the difference right now. I mean,
other than that she did have a significant knee injury and came back early
from that and probably is not -- wasn't all the way completely mended when she
did come back, and now I think she's really feeling good.  
  
Q. Two big runs you had, one gave you the lead, one put the game away
basically. What were you able to do to sustain those runs and were they
similar?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, I think in those runs, we played great defensively. We
were making them take so much time off the clock, and our kids are tired, they
worked really hard because lots of times they were playing defense for 27, 26
seconds, and then Megan, like I said, just cleaned up the boards. But they
were just not getting any really good looks, and I think that's just -- and we
kept getting that defensive stop, defensive stop. It just gave us a real
mental edge.  
  
Q. Did you change anything with the zone because the second half you
were so active on that entry pass, the pass to the wing, you were deflecting a
ton of them and they could never get their offense running?  
LISA BLUDER: We got some steals out of that. Hannah got three, I think,
Kathleen got three out of it. You know, they spread it out, so we kind of
spread it out, and really when you know you've got Megan sitting in the
middle, it allows you to do that more. There was times that there were five
out, out there, so we were able to spread it out a little bit more. They
really weren't getting the ball inside at all, so we just kept moving it out
as they moved it out.  
  
Q. So much emphasis is put on this tournament and how far you can go.
How important was it for you guys just in terms of the legacy of this senior
class to advance and keep this thing going?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I think that's important, but honestly, it's not even
something we think about. We are just wanting to keep playing basketball. I
mean, that's -- like that's what it's all about. We wanted to make it to the
Sweet 16 because we know that's a huge accomplishment, but it's not about the
legacy, it's about this family being together, it's about these women having
the opportunity to go to battle for another week. It's more than that. It's
not about legacy, it's more about sentiment, it's more about being together.  
  
Q. Do you think your players were feeling any pressure, though, to get
you there, to get you to the Sweet 16 because I know you never bring it up but
obviously it's out there.  
LISA BLUDER: You know, I think the first game we felt more pressure than this
game, quite honestly. I think the first game we hadn't played for a while, we
were having those kind of uncharacteristic turnovers and tonight we only had
11 turnovers. I just think that we settled down. We were so thrilled with the
crowd coming out on Friday, it almost was like we didn't want to let them
down, instead of just playing off the energy a little bit.  
  
I don't know if the team -- they just want to be successful. They just want to
keep winning, and I mean, we want to go to the Elite 8 now. That's the next
goal.  
  
Q. How were you kind of able to limit Sophie Cunningham tonight,
especially from three? She had a pretty rough shooting night from three, and
that's definitely a specialty for her.  
LISA BLUDER: Well, we respect her. We know how good of a player she is. We
know what her numbers have been like, especially these last five, six games. I
mean, she's been shooting over 50 percent from three-point range.  
  
So we said no open looks. She gets no open looks from three, and we basically
dogged her all over when we were in player, when we were in our triangle-and-
two, and then in zone. Again, we were just there on the catch. We were there
on the catch. We did get her in a bit of foul trouble to begin the game, but
she still played 33 minutes.  
  
Q. You guys had a season high 24 turnovers against Mercer. Obviously it
was going to be a big point of emphasis in between games. How did you think
your players did today with taking care of the basketball?  
LISA BLUDER: I think really well. I don't think they -- I think they put it
behind them, which is exactly what we wanted them to do. We knew it was not
right. It was not good. We knew it was uncharacteristic, so let's not dwell on
it, let's not get mad about it; we just said, forget about it, it's over,
let's move on. And they handled that really well today.

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Robin, I know it's not your team culture to be on wins and what
happens on the court, but what would it mean for this senior class to get a
fourth tournament win when there hadn't been a senior class that had three
before yesterday?  
ROBIN PINGETON: You know, I didn't even realize that. I don't even know who
brought it to my attention, but that's pretty remarkable. This senior class
just means so much to us, and, you know, every season is so unique. Every team
is so unique. The journey is different. But obviously this senior class has
had a lot of success and has helped us elevate our program to a national
level. And, you know, it's just interesting because Cierra and Sophie, I've
known them, well, Cierra my whole life and then Sophie since she was just a
junior high kid, just running around with her long blonde ponytail and been
around the arena with her sister playing for us. The history is so much
deeper, I guess maybe with this senior class. And then Lauren, who's obviously
just been a huge impact for our program.  
  
But it would mean a lot. I mean I think anytime you're trying to blaze a new
trail, you know, make history, history is a big deal. That hasn't been done
before. That's an incredible opportunity. And I think more than anything,
though, I think sooner or later, you know, you forget about the records. You
forget about the scores of the game and you remember the relationships. And I
think that's what we're all trying to hold onto the longest or the most that
we can is being able to battle together. It's a pretty special group, pretty
special culture. And, you know, we came in as a team, and we're leaving --
they're leaving as sisters, and that bond is just something that's hard to let
go of at the end of the season. But we're going to embrace it and try and hold
onto it as long as we can.  
  
Q. Obviously it's been a while since you played for Lisa and the game
has changed a lot since you were playing, but is there anything that you can
kind of see from coaching and playing for her in her team that has carried
over all these years or is it just night and day given the time that's
elapsed?  
ROBIN PINGETON: You're trying to age me a little bit? (Laughs).  
  
Q. I didn't use numbers for a reason.  
ROBIN PINGETON: I think she was a great coach when I played for her. You know,
I just -- and I think she teaches fundamentals really, really well. I think
she's got a great staff. Yeah, I think the game's changed a lot. You know,
offenses have changed. Defenses have changed. So, yes, a lot's changed since
back in the days I played for her and coached with her, but I think she's
always been really, really good at the fundamentals; and when you look at the
University of Iowa women's basketball team, they're a really fundamentally
sound, well-balanced team. And they're really good. So we're going to have our
hands full.  
  
Q. Robin, you've mentioned a lot this year, especially early in the
year, just the journey Jordan Roundtree has been on. For you what's it like
when you think back to that journey to see her have such a big day on this
type of stage?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, it's really cool. You know, we talked a little bit,
golly, I don't know if it was yesterday or the day before. I can't remember,
but we were talking about how she used to come to our camps. She came to our
camps forever as a little kid, and she was decked out from head to toe in
everything Mizzou, and she was just talking about as a little kid --  
  
Oh, I know how it happened. So our alumni had sent letters back to our current
roster. Different alumni, each one sent a letter to one of our current
players, and they were just talking about laying the foundation, playing for
the front of the jersey. You know, they're doing things that they never had a
chance to do. And so that's how the conversation started.  
  
And she said, I remember coming to camps, looking up to these girls, and now
they're writing me notes, and how much it meant to her. And just to see the
growth in her on and off the court has been really special. And certainly, you
know, on the court she's impacting our program in a very big way. But to me as
a coach the most gratifying thing is to see her grow as a person. Her voice,
her leadership in the locker room, the way she carries herself, the way she
handles adversity, you know, to me that's really the most rewarding thing that
I get to see as a coach, because I've seen the progress from that freshman
year to where she's at now.  
  
Q. Robin, you've had to deal with a few different post players
throughout SEC play, namely Teaira McCowan. I'm just curious what different
challenges does Megan pose for you guys compared to what you've seen so far
this year?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah. She's as good as advertised. I've watched as much film
as I could with trying to get a little bit of sleep. She's got a great touch,
great feel. Her teammates do a great job getting the ball to her, in great
positions. And so we have had the experience of playing against other great
post players, with McCowan, and you think about Asia Wilson. You know, and you
gotta game plan. We've got a plan going into this. We might tweak a few things
in the next 24 hours. But I think you've gotta be a little bit creative
because she's a hard guard for sure.  
  
Q. Robin, I know kind of outside of the program a lot of people said
like the next kind of step for these seniors is to make the second weekend of
the tournament for the first time. Is that something that they've talked about
or expressed as a goal throughout the season or is that something that's been
left more unsaid?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I think for sure. I think we've absolutely talked about it. I
think, you know, I mean anyone that's coaching is trying to compete for a
National Championship. Right? But then there's steps to that. You want to get
a conference championship. You want to get, you know, first round NCAA, second
round. I mean it's a natural progression. And some of those goals that we had
this season we didn't get accomplished.  
  
I always tell our players, though, their value comes from who they are, not
what they do, and so even though that goal is out there, it doesn't define how
successful they are as an individual. And I think it's really important that
they understand that. And again, I think sooner or later you forget the
scores, you forget the records and the growth and the relationships are what
lasts.  
  
But absolutely. A chance for them to get to Sweet 16 would be awfully special.
And I think it's going to be a battle tomorrow. I think both teams obviously
advance and survive and advance, and it's a big opportunity that's in front of
us. But that game tomorrow will not define our season nor will it define the
incredible young ladies that I'm so blessed to coach every day.  
  
Q. You and Iowa both just survived yesterday. What's been your
experience as a coach when you kind of get a new lease on life like that? Do
you see great performances the next timeout or what's been the history?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Well, it didn't work out very well for us in the SEC
tournament. We got Kentucky in overtime and then we lost to Mississippi State.
So hopefully we're not going to go based on history and what that looks like.
But it's just -- we're playing in the NCAA Tournament and you got great
competition.  
  
I think everybody would agree that Drake clearly is not a 10 seed. Right? I
mean don't we all think they're probably a little bit better than a 10 seed.
They've got a great program. Jenny has done a great job, and it was a battle.
But we all -- our student-athletes understand what's at stake, and you gotta
live to play another day, and we got a chance to do that, and we're going to
embrace it. We're going to embrace today leading up to our prep for Iowa and
then we're going to embrace tomorrow and we'll see how it all falls out in the
end.  
  
Q. Did you know this day would come when you would coach against the old
coach, Lisa Bluder, some day? Did you know it would come?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Well, you know what, actually last year we played in their
tournament and we lost our first-round game. And so if we would have won, we
would have played them. So even coming back to their tournament last year we
knew that there would be a chance that that would happen. Obviously, I'm
trying to schedule closer to home just for my dad more than anything to be
honest with you, when he was still alive.  
  
But definitely, I understand the dynamics, coaching against Bill Finley,
coaching against Lisa Bluder, the relationships, the friendships. It's just
always a little bit -- it's just different. Probably none of us really like
it, but at the same time I think as a coach you get so lost in your prep and
your scout that with time, you know, you're not even thinking about those kind
of things.  
  
MODERATOR: Any other questions for Coach? Thank you.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: Thanks.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Sophie Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30334)

### [Jordan Roundtree](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37063)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
THE MODERATOR: With us today are Missouri Head Coach Robin Pingeton; student-
athletes, Sophie Cunningham and Jordan Roundtree.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: First of all, thank you guys for coming out. We're obviously
very excited to be sitting here today. Last night's game was an awfully tough
game against a really, really talented team, and I know I gave them as many
props as I could last night, but I truly feel they had a phenomenal year, and
they've got a great program, and that was definitely a battle. But we're
looking forward to the prep again against a very good team. Lisa obviously has
been a great mentor and a friend to me. But honestly the focus, I think, is
just preparing for our team to play their team. You don't really think too
much about the friendship, the relationship. At least I don't because your
focus is on your next opponent.  
  
I'm excited for our kids. I think they're in a good place. I think it was good
to get that game under our belt, playing in a new facility. We'd played here
last year. I think it was last year. So to get out there on that court and get
that first game under our belt I think was big and we're looking forward to
have an opportunity to play a really good team.  
  
We know it's going to be a great environment. The turnout for the game for
Iowa yesterday was just phenomenal and I'm sure it'll be a packed house
tomorrow. So we know it's going to be a battle and we know it's going to be a
great environment, and we're just really blessed and excited to see another
day in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sophie, you guys have been in this position in the second round
before. I guess what's the difficulty of preparing for a game on one day's
notice in this kind of tournament.  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: I think we're used to it. I think early in the season we go
to tournaments, and it's a one-day tournament. You don't even have 24 hours to
prepare. And we just got done with the SEC tournament. It's the same exact
deal. So having that experience under our belt, especially for the younger
classmen on our team, I think it's really good for us.  
  
Q. Sophie, just what would it mean to you to get to the Sweet 16 for the
first time in your career?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: I think it would be awesome. I mean this is what I want. I
think it's what every team wants. So it's definitely going to be a battle,
it's going to be a great game. She hit on it, great environment, kind of like
that South Carolina environment. So we have that experience under our belt,
too.  
  
But it's going to be fun, and I can't wait for tomorrow. We prepared. We know
what we're going to do, so now we just have to go out there and execute.  
  
Q. Sophie, you've seen Jordan really kind of grow up since she came here
as a freshman. For a lot of people, what she did on the floor yesterday might
be kind of a surprise, but does that kind of speak to the growth she's made
since she's gone from a freshman to her time now?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Absolutely, and I think she's made tremendous strides. I
mean everyone knew she had it in her. She's one of the most athletic people on
our team. And for her to go out there and step up and really own that moment,
I'm just super proud of her. I knew she was going to knock it down, and she
went out there and executed.  
  
Q. Sophie, just your preliminary thoughts about facing Megan Gustafson
and the challenge that she brings?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, she's a great player. Great player, and she's a lot
of their offense and we're going to have to shut her down, but I know our team
is prepared. We're ready to go, and I think from top to bottom we know what we
have to get done.  
  
Q. Did you learn anything from the way Mercer attacked Megan Gustafson
yesterday?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Honestly, we've watched film, and we have some idea. I'm
not going to give you our game plan. That would be dumb of me. So our teams
know what we need to do to get done. But, yeah, they played a heck of a game
yesterday. Both teams did, and it was a battle.  
  
Q. Jordan, what's the reaction been from friends and family from that
game-winning free throw that you hit yesterday?  
JORDAN ROUNDTREE: Yeah. I mean I have a great support system. It starts in the
locker room. Obviously everyone, you know, we've talked about it some, but
it's a new day. But my friends and my family have been great. They're just
happy to see me play on this stage. They know it means a lot to the team, and
I'm just happy that I have that support system that watches every single game,
follows everything we do. So I've been blessed in that manner.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Kathleen Doyle](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33245)

### [Megan Gustafson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32141)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
LISA BLUDER: I mean, we're glad to be here today. I mean, only 32 are standing
now, and so we're glad that we're one of them. You know, we don't feel like we
played maybe our best game of the year yesterday, and that's probably okay. We
survived, we moved on, and we're forgetting about that and moving on to our
full focus on Missouri. I heard Robin after the game say she didn't think her
team played the best game, either. I think both of us are going to have our
teams ready to go tomorrow.  
  
Missouri obviously a very good defensive team, good defense, and good three-
point defense. Cunningham is just so much to handle. She is a terrific All-
American type player, but this is a team that I know that we're going to have
to have an incredible focus tomorrow and it's going to be a lot more physical
than it was yesterday, and we're going to have to be able to be mentally
strong as well as physically strong tomorrow.  
  
Q. Megan, I'm assuming you're used to seeing doubles and triples like
you saw against Mercer yesterday, but it looked pretty physical. Was that
something you were also used to or something you had to fight through in that
game?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, you know, seeing double and triple teams being physical
is something I've been used to all year long, and so I think especially in the
Big Ten conference they've been very physical, and I think it's prepared me
well, especially going into this postseason play.  
  
Q. Megan, what are your thoughts on Sophie Cunningham, and how hard of a
guard is she?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, she's a really good player. She's a tall guard, too,
and that's always hard to have. It's one thing if you're a really good guard,
but if you have length and size, that's pretty hard. Again, hats off to her,
she's a great player, and we're going to have to be ready on her defensively.  
  
Q. Megan, you mentioned Sophie, but when you combine Sophie with Cierra
obviously coming in halfway through the season, how much do you think the
addition of Cierra gives them a different dynamic?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, it's kind of a one-two punch there, so we've got to be
ready for that. They both work pretty well together. Again, we just have to be
ready, be prepared and to be able to play our principles defensively. They're
both really longer, especially guard, and then post, she's about 6'4", so
we've got to be ready for that play, and just be ready for that match-up.  
  
Q. Megan, you're one of three senior starters. This is really your last
game at Carver-Hawkeye tomorrow. Have you thought about that? Obviously you
would like to go out with a win. Have you thought about this being your last
game?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, I've thought about it a little bit. I think I'm just
going to go into it like any other game, preparing for it and not really
wanting to think about that. But at the same time I'm going to play my heart
out and I know my teammates are, and it's going to be a lot more sweeter when
we get a win, and so then it won't be as sad not having to play in Carver
anymore.  
  
Q. Kathleen, yesterday Mercer was able to apply a lot of pressure and
force turnovers. How do you remedy that going into a match-up against Missouri
tomorrow?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, I think just being a triple threat is really important,
and like Coach said it's going to be even more of a physical game, so us
guards need to be prepared out on the perimeter staying in triple threat and
making sure we have all of our options.  
  
Q. Kathleen, I know down the stretch of that game you were pretty
pumped, kind of pumping up the crowd. Do you imagine that same type of
atmosphere for tomorrow's game?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: He yeah, we have the best fans in the country so I'm assuming
they're going to come out in full force for us, and we really appreciate all
of them coming out all year long, and I really don't doubt that that will
happen again.  
  
Q. You mentioned Sophie Cunningham already, but I don't know if you can
kind of talk a little bit more about the challenges she gives different
defenses when you kind of watch her in that game and watch her on tape?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, she can just score in so many different ways. She's
shooting 50 percent from the three-point line, range, but she'll beat you off
the drive. They do a great job of setting ball screens for her and getting her
open for the drive, and then she can post-up and do a great job drawing fouls
on the block. So she is a very tough assignment. Yeah, just a really good --
and you know, senior. She's got all this experience. She's been playing there
since her freshman year she's been a starter, and obviously just like all
seniors, they don't want to see their seasons come to an end right now, so
they play with a little different urgency.  
  
Q. Having coached Robin and having her on her staff a while ago, is
there any traits you can see from your teams in Missouri that maybe carried
over that maybe Robin got from spending some time with you?  
LISA BLUDER: No, I really don't. I mean, that was 30 years ago. I mean, that's
a long time ago. I think we've both changed quite a bit in so many ways during
that amount of time. I will say that I think she coaches the same way she
plays. She was tenacious. I mean, she was an undersized 4 that was just
really, really good in the post area. I mean, she had terrific post moves, and
you see her niece doing the same thing and just really see teaches post play
so well. But I'm really impressed with their defense. I think she's done a
really, really good job defensively with this team.  
  
Q. Lisa, if you could, the three seniors playing their last game at
Carver-Hawkeye tomorrow, what they have meant to this program? I know it's not
an easy question to answer, but a Cliff's Notes version maybe?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, you know, it's been nice that we've been able to have two
more games in Carver, and I know a lot of people around the country don't get
to do that. Their senior night is actually their last night. So it was nice
for us to be able to have two more opportunities to play in front of our home
crowd, which I thought yesterday was just terrific. I mean, it had to be one
of the best environments in the nation yesterday for the preliminary rounds.  
  
They were wonderful, and I know they're going to come out again tomorrow, and
they're coming out because they love this team. They're coming out because
they're great Hawkeye supporters, and they're coming out because of these
three seniors.  
  
But Tania, it's been said so many times, but what she's meant to our team as
far as her resilience, her just amazing way to bounce back after ACL, ACL, and
to continue to go through the grind just so that she can put a Hawkeye uniform
on when she could have copped out on that. She could have just given up and
just taken her scholarship, but she wanted to represent Iowa. She wanted to
play in this NCAA Tournament so badly. So I love it for her.  
  
And for Hannah, just having such a different path than Megan and Tania in that
she didn't play much as a freshman, and a lot of kids bail on that. A lot of
kids don't stick around if they're not getting the minutes; they're hitting
the road. She didn't. She loved the University of Iowa. She knew she could get
better. She kept a positive attitude. She was voted a captain last year, and
even as a junior she didn't have a starting role, but she excelled coming in
at the 4 and the 5 and backing up both of those positions. So coming into this
year and having a starting position, being rewarded for all that positive
energy, just amazing. Again, you couldn't script it any better.  
  
And then Megan, you know, I've run out of ways to describe that kid. But I
know she's been one of the easiest stars I've ever coached. She's been one of
the most -- the least drama kids that I've ever coached. She's given me no
issues whatsoever. She's an absolute joy. You know, she deserves to go out of
here with a win, and that's what we're going to hope to give her tomorrow,
although we know it's going to be very difficult.  
  
That wasn't really a Reader's Digest version.  
  
Q. How much easier is it when your star player is as humble and
unassuming as Megan is?  
LISA BLUDER: It's so much easier because she's the hardest worker on the team,
so she's setting the example, and then when you're that hard of a worker,
nobody is jealous of your success because you've worked for it, and they've
seen how hard she's worked for it, so that's not even an issue. And then when
you're the first one to be such a great teammate, to spend time with your
teammates, to be humble. I call her an all-American with no ego. She's
confident because she's worked hard but she has no ego. It's easy to be around
those type of people, right? It's easy to be around people that don't think
they're great when they are. And so she has just been marvelous to coach, and
I just hope I get to coach her for another week.  
  
Q. Just when you were coaching Robin in college, did it ever cross your
mind, did you ever think or maybe even hope to face her or any of your players
one day in as big of a game as tomorrow?  
LISA BLUDER: I mean, no way. You can't even dream that, right? You just -- you
never have those kind of thoughts that this kid could some day be a BCS coach
at an SEC school, doing so well that they're in the top 32 in the country. I
mean, you can't think that type of story. That's just unbelievable. And she's
done a great job with it.

_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Missouri 77, Drake 76  
  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: Just March is March, and it's the NCAA Tournament and I
definitely want to acknowledge what a great team Drake is. I think Jennie has
done a phenomenal job, Jennie and her staff, with that program. They have had
an unbelievable season. They are a real hard guard and there's no way you can
convince me that they are a 10-seed. Just a very, very talented team. You've
got some kids that have had a phenomenal career there, and they have had a lot
of success, and so I definitely want to acknowledge that.  
  
I'm very proud of our girls. I'm proud of our seniors. I thought they really
battled tonight. You know, it was a game of runs. There's runs where we bent a
little bit but we didn't break, and I'm just really proud of the grittiness,
their ability to hang in, stay the course, and we were able to answer some of
those runs, even when we got down.  
  
So give our seniors a lot of credit. Excited for our team. You know, this is
what it's all about, survive and advance, and we're looking forward to an
opportunity to continue to go battle together as a team.  
  
Q. What was it like for to you watch those final seconds from the
bench?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Stressful. Very stressful. But I think our team stepped up.
I mean, we are two very key players, but I mean, they stepped up. Amber
stepped up and I mean, true with that three. That was huge. Just super proud
of everyone from top to bottom.  
  
CIERRA PORTER: Just to reiterate what Sophie said, everyone stepped up. It's
hard to be on the bench in the final moments of a game like that, but I didn't
doubt for a second that everyone out on that court was going to pull through.  
  
Q. Sophie and Cierra, how has your relationship evolved since your
freshman year and how has that affected the on-the-court product?  
CIERRA PORTER: It's grown a lot. We were freshmen in high school together,
too. You go through all the ups and downs together. You just end up like
sisters and I would honestly consider her like a sister now, and it's so cool
because you see that on the court, as well. We get more hyped for each other
than each other does well. It's just a really fun connection and I'm really
blessed having played with her for so long.  
  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Everything she said. Once she left a little bit -- kind of
step back because when you're together for eight years, you kind of take each
other for granted, and I hate we did that. But when she left and came back, it
was just like -- back on our final ride together.  
  
Q. Sophie, off that, when Cierra got that stop end of regulation, I know
you got pretty pumped up about that. What was that moment like for you and
what was that conversation like at midcourt?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: It's just awesome. I get so excited for my teammate. I try
to give them 110 percent. I mean, she's 6'4, and I knew she something was
going to happen. I just trusted everyone and when she got that block, I knew
we had it. I really did.  
  
Q. Sophie, Jordan missed two free throws. Did you feel like that make in
that crucial moment was kind of an example for coming out as a leader for this
team and building into next year, even already the end of this season?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Absolutely. Even since the beginning of this year, she's
grown so much. I'd loved for her to hit all three. It would have been less
stressful, like I said. But she hit one, and she stepped up and she wanted
that moment and she owned it right. So really pride of her.  
  
Q. Cierra, I think you made two threes this season and the huge one
against Mississippi State, so in overtime, when you dribbled into that shot,
what's kind of going through your head? How confident are you feeling in that
moment?  
CIERRA PORTER: Yeah, I mean, at that point, it's just -- it's go time. If
you're going to leave me wide open, I was feeling good throughout the game. If
you're going to leave me wide open, I'm going to be confident -- not exactly
the look we wanted (laughter).  
  
Q. You talked about how stressful it was being on the final seconds but
any part of your brain saying this could be it and I'm not out there to make
an impact in it?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Really, no. I don't -- I don't -- you would think that, I
mean, seniors, you're depending on sophomores and juniors to get it done, but
I think we just trust in our team to get it done.  
  
We work as hard as they do every day in practice, and when you're in battle
and going to war together, you just have that trust. So I really didn't have
any doubt in my mind. Doesn't mean I was nervous but doesn't mean I knew we
were going to get it done.  
  
Q. The two buzzer-beating layups, and then the key free throw, how
clutch was she today?  
CIERRA PORTER: Jordan Roundtree. She stepped up all year and obviously that
free throw at the end is what sealed it. But I just think she's a testament to
how she's grown and matured like as a person, as player, and you know, we need
her. She's someone that contributes a lot for us. Not always points
necessarily but energy, defense, everything she contributes and so she's
clutch in a lot of ways, not just scoring.  
  
Q. Either of the players. Your thoughts when Hittner got the ball there
pretty wide open three there at the end of over time?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Super wide open. I thought it looked good. I don't know, I
have a lot of former teammates on that team and so yeah, I'm a competitor and
I wanted to win but seeing them, I wish we didn't have to play Drake. But we
did. They are a really good team, though. Their cutting and them being able to
knock down the three, that's huge, and she was left wide open. Don't know what
happened there. But thankfully, she missed it. Really good player, though.  
  
Q. For either of you. What changes mentally, physically, tactically for
you guys as players once you reach March and you make the tournament?  
CIERRA PORTER: Kind of like you just got to forget, like the whole -- not
forget everything that happened the first half of the season but like body
wise, how your body feels. Mentally it's a refresh button. It's March.
Anything can happen. You know you have to go to battle. Everybody's body is
tired and everybody has all the excuses so that doesn't matter.  
  
You just have to go out and battle, and I think it's just mostly the mind-set
that changes. You have to trust your training to this point, and the work
you've put in, trust in your teammates, trust in your coaches and just go out
there and do what you can in battle.  
  
Q. Cierra, you already touched on that play with Sara Rhine at the end
of the game, but what was that battle like throughout the entire game? Seemed
you were both getting really good post positions and playing good defense
against each other. What was that matchup just like tonight?  
CIERRA PORTER: She's another really good player for them. Watching film, it's
incredible how she uses her body. She knows how to cut, get open and she's
just really crafty. It hard to defend, so I have to give her credit. She's one
heck of a post player even though she's a little undersized. Yeah, that was a
good battle.  
  
Q. What can you say about your team's ability to make the NCAA
Tournament four years in a row?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: I mean, I think us coming in as freshmen, there's been a
lot of people before us that set the foundation, and without them, we wouldn't
be where we're at. But me and CP as seniors, we came in as freshmen together
and we're blessed to have been here for all four years but you don't take it
for granted. But you really do have to thank the people before you who set the
foundation.  
  
Q. When you hit that breakaway and you dish it to Amber, were you trying
to get her going a little bit?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, and even on the bench, I was like, something is going
to happen. She ended up having a huge bucket for us at the very end of the
game. When you are going like this in the game, you need someone to be there
and encourage you and believe in you even when you don't.  
  
Amber is a heck of a player and when she has her head right no one can stop
her. She's a really hard guard. I think that bucket gave her a little bit of
confidence and I love to see it.  
  
Q. For either of you. What did it mean when Aldridge came to the team
from Kansas and you were just able to add another veteran piece to the team?  
CIERRA PORTER: I got to play AU with her and tried to recruit her at that
point and it didn't work. She ended up here. Just to have her -- she's so
solid. She's so reliable. That's someone that you always want on the court.
She's always on the same page as Coach P. She's just kind of like a calming
factor for us and that's just huge. She's a huge piece to what our team has
done this year and last year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Q. On the final play, were you looking to give the ball to anyone in
particular or best basketball play out there? What was your thinking?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: We were trying to get inside Amber. We wanted something
to attack in, and we knew with her post feed or dribble drive we would have an
opportunity to maybe draw a fall and wanted to maybe put the pressure on the
defense a little bit. It didn't develop the way that we had hoped that it
would, but yeah, the goal was to go inside to Amber.  
  
Q. You've been obviously around Cierra for a long time, in terms of both
on the offensive and defensive end. How big was she today? How big was she
today for you guys?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: I thought she was huge and I thought she did a really
good job just playing through tough calls, no calls. It was definitely a
battle down there with her and Sara Rhine, who is, again, just a tremendous
player. But they really battled.  
  
CP was a load for us tonight on the offensive and defensive end. She ended up
being, what is it, 7-for-9, and you know, was a presence inside. Wanted the
ball. Demanded the ball. So that was big.  
  
Then I think defensively, just her size, it's something that it's just hard to
replace. 6'4 is 6'4, and just being there before, being in these situations
and being in those moments and the maturity that comes along with being an
upperclassman and a senior. Again, I thought all three of our seniors really
showed up today.  
  
Q. Going into the last possession for you all in the time-out, Sophie
fouled out at that point but looked like she was really vocal and involved in
that timeout. What was her message?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: I think the biggest thing was we were all just saying we
wanted to be the aggressors, attack, get something going to the rim. You know,
if they foul, we are going to the free throw line.  
  
Yeah, I think that was her message in there, if I heard it correctly. I think
she echoed the same thing, the same sentiment that we were trying to get
across to our kids is two things. No. 1, we have got to make sure we get the
last shot. We did not want to shoot too early and I think that's why the
development of the play was off a little bit because we were so concerned
about making sure we had the last shot.  
  
Then No. 2, just the importance of really trying to attack the rim.  
  
Q. What does it mean to you that your three seniors' collegiate careers
are extended for at least one more game?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: What's it mean to me? It means a lot. I love these kids
to death, young ladies to death. We have been through a huge part of what the
success that we've had over the last four years.  
  
It's so awesome as a coach to see the, come in, maybe as kids, and leave as
mature young adults for the most part.  
  
It's a fun group. I mean, there's a lot of personality out of those seniors.
When you look at -- start thinking about this could be the end, it's hard not
to reflect on just the growth, the accomplishments, the ups and downs, the
hard times, the tears, the laughter, the celebrations. There's been a lot of
them.  
  
But the really cool thing is, you know, when you go through this journey, you
become family for life, and we all know at some point, it's got to end. I just
feel blessed I've had an opportunity to coach them.  
  
Q. Jordan has been a good free throw shooter for you this season, but is
she the kind of person where she doesn't like to go to the line? Was she
listening to positive talk or just like: Get out of my way, I want to go to
the line and shoot?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: Jordan Roundtree? You might have to ask her. I don't
know. She's been really good are to us all year long but she's playing a
completely different role than she's ever played. I think when you're at the
line, you know, in the NCAA Tournament, and it's advance or go home, she's
never been there before. And so, honestly, I thought they all looked pretty
good and I thought she had a shot for all three of them to go down.  
  
Again, when you go from last year being spotted minutes, you know, someone in
the rotation, but not extended minutes to having the ball in your hands at the
free throw line to survive-and-advance, that's a lot of pressure. But she had
a big one for us and that was huge.  
  
Q. Do you know what happened to Haley? Looked like she couldn't put any
weight on her left ankle.  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, I think it's it -- she just came down on her
ankle. It was right in front of our bench. Just twisted it. We got some new
shoes and they are a little bit lower cut than what we had been playing in. It
was just a little loose. I don't know, we'll see. She's getting an X-ray right
now so we'll see what happens.  
  
Q. With the final shot, were you expecting to get the ball and Sara
Rhine and hitting?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: We thought it would go to her and yeah, I'm anxious to
go back and watch the film and see where the breakdown was. I thought the
first time we really guarded that sideline well. Felt like we knew what was
coming. The second time, I don't know that that was a play that we went
through in our shoot around.  
  
So, I don't know, I'm anxious to go back and look. I don't want to make
anything up. I'm surprised show got so open, though. That was a really good
look and my heart stopped for a few seconds because I thought it looked good.  
  
Q. I know you haven't done any homework on Iowa, but just the idea of
playing against Lisa, your former coach. I know you coached against Bill a bit
when you were -- from Iowa State with the Big 12. Do you like facing your
former mentors and showing them what you learned?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: Honestly, I think it's more of a fun story line for the
media. Just to be honest with you, I don't have any thoughts about it.  
  
My ideal is I just want to go and prepare our team and hopefully put them in a
position to have success. I think as coaches, we get so entrenched in that
more than anything else.  
  
So I've got a lot of respect for Lisa. She's a great coach. She's a great
mentor. You know, she's part of my family. We've been through a lot together
and certainly years past, but forever grateful for the impact that she's had
on my life.  
  
She's got a great team. There's going to be a great crowd tomorrow, or on
Sunday, so we know it's going to be a tough environment. We are looking
forward to another opportunity to play with this team.  
  
Q. From a leadership standpoint, how has Cunningham and Porter changed
and involved from their freshmen years to their senior years?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: I think they have always been leaders for us. They are
very unique as freshmen because they came in and were very comfortable and
confident. They grew up around Columbia. Most freshmen come in and they are
trying to feel out their way a little bit and get acclimated and they don't
really know what the buildings are or who certain people are.  
  
But those two came in and acted like they ran the place, and not in a
disrespectful way, but just being from Columbia and being around the arena so
much with Lindsay's -- with Sophie's sister, Lindsay playing there. She had
been around a lot.  
  
You've got Cierra Porter, whose dad was on staff, so the Porter family was at
the arena quite a bit. They just were so comfortable coming in.  
  
They have always been pretty strong leaders in their own way. It's just been a
really cool -- it's been a cool journey for them. Win four state
championships. They have won over 70 percent of their games since they have
been here at Mizzou and that hasn't been done for a while. They are just
really, as good of basketball players as they are, they are even better feel.
I feel blessed that our paths that crossed.  
  
Q. Were you expecting to play Emmanuelle as much as she did tonight, and
how did you feel about her impact on the game tonight?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, you know, I think she's had a huge sophomore year
for us. It you know, her minutes are up and down a little bit, based on what's
going on with Amber and I've got a lot of confidence in Amber. I thought, you
know, out of the gate, she looked good and then we started missing a couple
easier shots, and you know, a lot of that, Amber knows we need her, so there's
pressure within that all by itself.  
  
You know, I just felt like we needed a different look. I thought Manue
defended really, really well for us. Created some extra possessions for us.
Doesn't really force the issue and has been really good throughout the course
of the season. But going back to Amber, for her to kind of regroup and keep
her mind right and come in and be able to contribute at the end I thought was
huge, too. So just overall a great team win.  
  
Q. What does Aldridge mean to the team transferring from Kansas and how
she acclimated to the team?  
COACH ROBIN PINGETON: It's a high-character, high-integrity, passionate, blue
collar young lady that has been huge for us on the court and off the court.
There's not a lot of fifth-year seniors out there that are in law school right
now, so juggling that and playing basketball and the demands.  
  
But it's been, I would say she's -- in those early years, such a serious kid.
She's very driven, very determined. I'm so thankful that we've had this senior
year together and seeing her letdown her hair a little bit and really be
vulnerable and enjoy the process and just to be able to laugh at things.  
  
She's a really special young lady. Really, really special young lady and just
been a great addition for us to have her in our program.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

### [Susie Gardner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13858)

### [Amanda Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19485)

### [KeKe Calloway](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36967)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Iowa 66, Mercer 61  
  
COACH SUSIE GARDNER: Well, obviously it's disappointing with the outcome. I'm
so proud of the way our guys competed and battled. It was a great basketball
environment. I felt like their fans really pulled them through when they
needed to be pulled through and our guys kept bouncing back and we had
opportunities. We never went away.  
  
We got off to a shaky start. We were missing a lot of shots that we normally
don't miss. But we feel good about our effort. We feel good about the game
plan. You know, and we lost to a really, really good Iowa basketball team.  
  
Q. You got off to a slow start but really came on. Can you talk about
the shot you took that hung on the rim forever and fell off at a key moment?
Did you think it was in?  
KEKE CALLOWAY: Yeah, I thought it was in. It came out. I felt like it was a
good slot and it had a chance. You know, either you're going to make it or
you're going to miss it. That shot, keep shooting regardless whether I make
ten in a row or miss ten in a row. Just keep shooting for my team.  
  
Q. To either player, you were able to force 24 turnovers and only
committed three. What was working so well for you in that regard?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I think that was part of our game plan. Get tips. Get
turnovers. We wanted to keep the ball out of 10's hands so we were going to
pressure the ball and that's what we did. We focused on taking care of the
ball. We focused on that in practice the last two weeks. Just value every
possession. We needed them all, so it was a focus for us.  
  
Q. You gave Iowa fits on their entry passes to Gustafson. Is that
something you saw on film, a way to approach that, stopping her?  
COACH SUSIE GARDNER: Actually we didn't see anyone do, and I didn't understand
why. All the film, I think we talked, I think it was yesterday or whenever it
was when we talked, you asked me what our game plan was.  
  
I didn't see anyone do that. I'm like watching film, why is no one trying to
get tips, why is no one pressuring the passer. We thought hey, that's how we
do it.  
  
We knew she was going to get our points but our goal was to maybe not let her
get so many touches as what she's used to. That was definitely our game plan
and I feel like it worked pretty well. She still got 30 but we caused 24
turnovers. So I'm really, really pleased with the way that turned out.

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Makenzie Meyer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34740)

### [Megan Gustafson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32141)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Iowa 66, Mercer 61  
  
COACH LISA BLUDER: First of all, just want to congratulate Susie Gardner on
the great game and how she represented her conference.  
  
We knew they were a really good team coming in here. We knew that just because
they were a 15-seed, they had won 17 in a row and went undefeated in their
conference play the last two years, won their conference play last two years,
had five seniors on the team and they had all the makes. They played Florida
State to a one-point loss, Georgia very, very close and last year they played
Georgia to a five-point similar to this one. So it doesn't surprise us at all.
We knew they are a good team.  
  
But most importantly I want to thank this crowd for coming out. Our crowd was
fabulous today and they probably helped us get those five points that we
really needed, so just a tremendous crowd. Appreciate them so much and
hopefully they will come back on Sunday, as well.  
  
Megan, today, became the Big Ten's all-time or season record holder in both
points and rebounds, so another accomplishment by Megan, and Makenzie, you
know, just had a terrific game and had her highest scoring game since she went
out at the Penn State game with a knee injury. Very, very good time for her to
come back and knock down those threes for us. She tied a career high with five
threes.  
  
Q. Makenzie, what kind of trouble were they giving you out on the
perimeter with the entry passes, 24 turnovers by you guys today? What happened
there?  
MAKENZIE MEYER: They were just really aggressive defensively. They had a long
team and they had a couple really long guards and they were doing a good job
of keeping their hands up and they knew our game plan was to get it inside.
They did a good job tipping passes and we probably could have done a better
job using ball fakes.  
  
Q. You had a big rebound basket there and got fouled, in a key time of
the game. Talk me through that play and what you saw as it developed.  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah,, it was a crucial time during the game. We really
needed a bucket and I'm very thankful that my teammates were able to trust me.
I kind of ruined the assist, wanted that board, just being able to get
position when the ball caught the rim, that's something I have a knack for, to
do that and put it up and hopefully it went in and it went in. It felt really
good to get that bucket because it gave us a ton of momentum going into that
defensive play the next time.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the crowd support?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: They are incredible. It's been amazing to play in front of
these amazing crowds the last couple games. Senior day was amazing. This is
awesome and we're really looking forward to Sunday, too.  
  
Q. Megan, first NCAA win for you. How does that feel to get that monkey
off your back?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: A lot better than last year. I think there might have been a
little jitters collectively. We have to get through that first game in order
to keep playing so honestly feels really good to get the win no matter how
ugly it was.  
  
Q. Obviously you were having trouble getting the ball in to Megan.
Someone had to step up and get some points. You had the three stroke going
today. Did you feel like someone had to fill that role besides her when you
guys were trying to get a lead?  
MAKENZIE MEYER: It always is nice to take some weight off Megan's shoulders
because we know she does so much for us. Opened up a lot of three
opportunities and I was able to knock them down today.  
  
Q. You were down four with about four minutes and 25 seconds left. Did
you say anything to each other to snap out it?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, our emphasis was on getting stops on defense. I think
it's really important to do that at those times and really get those extra
possessions on those rebounds. We weren't doing a really good job boxing out
in the third quarter, especially, so we really emphasized on pushing back and
then on offense, I kind of knew that I needed to take over, and so just
demanding the ball, making sure I can get myself in the best position
possible.  
  
Q. Do you feel like the committee didn't you any favors --  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I don't know much many coaches that really like their
seeds. We personally liked our seed. We didn't love our opponent. We loved our
2-seed but I think we played against somebody that was much more difficult
than a 15-seed. I think everybody can recognize that and understand that. This
is a good Mercer team.  
  
For them to be a 15-seed was kind of crazy. You look at our next opponent, you
know, both of these guys were 5-seeds a few days ago.  
  
So you know, people that are announcing the game said they thought this was
the hardest preliminary rounds in the country.  
  
Q. That you could win today despite losing the turnover battle 24-3,
what does that say about this team?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: How well we shoot the ball. When you get 40 points in the
paint, that really helps. When you shoot such a good percentage.  
  
So yeah, we're disappointed in the turnovers, and you know, that's -- I don't
know if it was nerves. I'm not sure if it was rust from two weeks, I don't
know, but that's pretty uncharacteristic of it, but I don't want to take
anything away from Mercer because I thought coming into it, they are a really
good defensive team. Titus, she's athletic, long, hard to pass over. So is
Thompson. She does a really good job. She's the heart and soul of that team.
Just amazing how well she played with two fouls and played the whole second
quarter and never picked up that third foul.  
  
Q. Coach Gardener said that they saw on film that no one was guarding
that entry pass, getting up and contesting that as much as they did. You look
like you were trying everything possible to get your team to maybe ball-fake
or something and make that positive. That had to be frustrating for you.  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Well, it was. You know, and that's unfortunate because
we're better post passers than that. We are much better and we know -- we kept
talking about using ball fakes and triple threat and not holding the ball
above our heads. It's funny that we resorted to some of those things but we'll
be better on Sunday.  
  
Q. Obviously you said the turnovers and stuff, not characteristic, but
how do you approach Sunday? Do you just kind of flush this one and hopefully
the jitters and the nerves that you kind of mentioned are gone?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, you know, I hope so. I think our team wanted to come
out and play so well for this great crowd.  
  
We are so appreciative of everyone that came out. Sometimes you want something
so badly, right. You remember last year and you want to do so well for these
people that came out to watch us play. So I think that got to us a little bit.
We'll be more prepared for that on Sunday for sure. But yeah, we're going to
flush it. We're going to move on.  
  
Q. Were you very encouraged by the way you finished the game? They had
you on the ropes and your team found a way to win?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yes, and that's what you do, find a way to win. Hannah got
on, so that was really nice. You know, Megan gets the offensive rebound, but
we got stops, and that fourth quarter, they only got two offensive rebounds.
Look at every other quarter leading up to that, we got seven offensive
rebounds. I said that incorrectly.  
  
They got seven offensive rebounds in the third quarter and only two in the
fourth quarter, and so we did a much better job finishing the possession in
the fourth quarter versus the third quarter.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Jennie Baranczyk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36988)

### [Sara Rhine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36990)

### [Becca Hittner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36989)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
Missouri 77, Drake 76  
  
COACH JENNIE BARANCZYK: This one's really painful. Hats off to Missouri and
what a great game and great environment for women's basketball. We talked
about this yesterday, but just how the State of Iowa always seems to show up.
I love how many fans that we brought. I love that how many Iowa fans stayed.
Missouri brought fans. It's a great first-round matchup. Obviously
disappointed with the outcome. This is a tough one. This is a really tough
one.  
  
And I'm proud of our team and I'm proud of the way that we did some things.
There's going to be some things that we wished we could do different, but what
a great game for women's basketball.  
  
Q. How much contact was there on that last play, and were you surprised
you got that about of a look there at the end?  
BECCA HITTNER: I mean, I don't know, but the refs called it, so they called
it. We still got a good look at the end.  
  
Q. Sara, you got that last shot, I think it was at the end of regulation
before things went into overtime. You had been pretty dominant down there all
game. Did you feel like you got a good look there in your final possession
there?  
SARA RHINE: Yeah, I think we did get a good look. Coach Baranczyk set it up
and we didn't need to look for it. I thought we executed, besides the actual
making of the basket. I thought we gave ourselves really good chances.  
  
Q. Sara, what can you take from the experience, especially going into
next year?  
SARA RHINE: Honestly that's really hard to answer right now. Like Coach said,
this hurts a lot. Especially for our four seniors. I think more than anything
it just shows that we deserve to be here. We have all that we need right
within our circle. We also just need to be better, get better.  
  
Q. You started first quarter, 5-of-10 from 3 and finished the game
9-of-25. What adjustments do you think they made?  
BECCA HITTNER: I think we were just able to adjust to stretch their defense
out a little bit more. We knew who their shooters were, so just keeping in
mind where they were on the court and we were able to limit their shots I
guess.  
  
Q. Going into that possession from Missouri in overtime, was the message
in y'all's huddle, get one stop and we feel good about where we're at?  
SARA RHINE: Yeah, we just knew we needed to get a stop. Kind of got a little
too aggressive I guess, but that was just our main thing was we've just got to
get one stop and we're good.  
  
Q. With Cunningham and Porter on the bench, who were you expecting them
to draw the play up for, given they were out their two best players?  
COACH JENNIE BARANCZYK: They have had multiple players make plays tonight. I
think the biggest thing for us was just to get one stop and play team defense.
That's what we really tried to do. Those hurt when they end on the free throw
line. Those games hurt. That's something we have to be able to do. They
obviously shot free throws really well today, and that's something that we
needed to keep them off the free throw and we didn't.  
  
Q. The officials went for the monitor --  
COACH JENNIE BARANCZYK: Time.  
  
Q. \-- I was going to say, did you get any clarification on the call,
but no.  
At the end of the game, shooting really well there at the end. Not the look
you were hoping to get out of that time-out, out-of-bounds play?  
  
COACH JENNIE BARANCZYK: Yeah, we had two different looks and I thought we got
a good look. You know, that's a shot that we had two different options and I
think both of them were both of their shots.  
  
You know, sometimes the ball doesn't go in the hole and it's never -- you
know, it's so cliché because it's true. It never comes down to that and we
needed to do a better job before that point.  
  
And like I said, this is going to be one where we're going to go back and say,
this was good, this was good. But I think there's going to be a lot of things
that maybe weren't as good as we would have liked them to have been.

_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: First of all, thank you guys for coming out. I think it's
going to be a really fun weekend in Iowa City. Obviously we're excited about
the opportunity to play again in the NCAA tournament. It absolutely never gets
old.  
  
I think just so grateful for the opportunity and excited to be able to coach
these girls for another game. And that's really what it comes down to. It's
just one game at a time at this time of the year. And I think our team is in a
really good place. We understand we've got a really tough matchup against a
very talented Drake team. And so it's going to be a battle. But we're looking
forward to it.  
  
Q. Sophie, has it hit you that this is your last NCAA tournament?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Not really. I'm just excited to be here. I think our team
deserves it we're in a really good spot right now. Coming off of two weeks
practice, we're ready to play. We're hungry to play. Yeah, I'm excited to be
here. Like Coach said, it never gets old.  
  
Q. Do you feel different the way you're playing compared to last year?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yes, honestly since I've been here at Mizzou, this is the
best team emotionally and physically going into the tournament. I feel like
our team is in the best spot it's been all year. And what a great time to be,
considering it's our last tournament.  
  
Q. Before you got to watch film you thought you had high advantage.
After watching film, and do you think you have an advantage?  
AMBER SMITH: I think we have an advantage. I think just pounding inside and
also getting our shots on the outside.  
  
Q. Sophie, first off, are you feeling better? I know you were a little
under the weather?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yes, I'm getting better, we're good. I'm excited to get
going.  
  
Q. Your mother said you play better sick?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: I guess so. Maybe I need a couple of IV's tomorrow to get
me going. I think it helps me focus more. I want to do whatever I can for the
jersey and to get that win. But, yeah, I mean I'm feeling better. I don't
really sound like it but I'm feeling better.  
  
Q. Sophie, someone who's been around Cierra almost forever, what's it
been like to see her come back and kind of get a shot at another NCAA
tournament she might not have ever expected?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: She's in a very different situation. Once you step away
from the sport people don't get the opportunity to come back, especially at
the college level. I think Cierra stepping away for five or six months it
helped her body recover a little bit. And I think it also helped her mentally,
too. I think she really missed it. And she's not taking anything for granted,
I'll tell you that. As Coach says, if you're tired, just wait, because you're
going to recover a lot faster in the real word, you're really not tired. It's
been awesome to have her back. Her height is a huge advantage that we use a
lot down low. So it's been great to have her back.  
  
Q. Sophie, did you ever play against Sara Rhine when in high school
ball?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: No, I didn't. But a lot of the other teammates actually I
played ball with, from Kansas City Eclipse. Pretty familiar with them. Yeah,
they're a good, fundamental team.  
  
Q. What makes Sara so efficient down low?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: She just knows how to seal very well off the ball. She's
not afraid of contact. She's just really good at finding the angles. We're
going to have to shut that down.  
  
Q. You guys just got here, but what's it like to be back in Iowa, do you
feel more comfortable here?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Well, I haven't really left my hotel room much. So this is the
first sign of daylight I've seen. We got in yesterday late afternoon, but, you
know, certainly for me, obviously, you know, it's really neat to come back to
Iowa.  
  
I wish my dad was here to enjoy this NCAA tournament with us. He was a die
hard fan and been such a huge part of my life. It just would have meant the
world to him to be around our team and to be a part of this. But a lot of
family, a lot of friends. My sister played here at the University of Iowa, so
very familiar territory.  
  
But obviously nothing about this is about me. It's about our team. And so you
have those thoughts or you may go there for a moment, but really all of my
focus is just trying to put this team in the best position they can against a
very talented Drake team. We know we're going to have our hands full. I've
been very blessed with this group, proud of their resiliency. The senior class
is obviously really special. And just so blessed that we get an opportunity to
go battle again together.  
  
Q. Coach, both you and Coach Baranczyk are Bluder -- I don't know if
want to say -- disciples or part of their coaching tree. What kind of mentor
was Lisa for you?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Yeah, I think I'm probably the only one in the country that
came from Iowa state and kind of an Iowa disciple, that's foreign territory,
and trust me, I grew up in the middle of all that.  
  
But Lisa has been incredible for me. Had a great opportunity for play for her
in college. We had a lot of success at St. Ambrose. And then after that I had
an opportunity to go play professionally. My mom had a stroke and so leaving
the area wasn't the right time. And she gave me an opportunity to go with her
as a Division I assistant right out of college. She's been a huge part of my
life, both on and off the court, and forever grateful for the impact she had
in my life.  
  
Q. Sophie says she thinks it's the best field the team in her time. Do
you agree with that?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I do, I think our team is in a really good place. Just not
only emotionally, physically. I think as we all go through the season, looks
different for all of us. Playing in the SEC is such a physical league, and so
a lot of times I think you feel the aftermath, just -- and feel it drained
when that's done.  
  
But maybe we did a better job with management and practices, and what that
looked like throughout the course of the season, I don't know. But I think our
kids are in a great place.  
  
I think this last month we've been playing some pretty good basketball. Energy
has been high. Focus has been great. Attention to detail has been really good.
We've been shooting the ball a lot better. So, yeah, I think when you go into
tournament time you want to feel good about where your team is at and I feel
as good as I ever have with this team.  
  
Q. Secondly, earlier in the season, how much do you think this team has
grown from that time to now?  
ROBIN PINGETON: It's interesting, I think every season is so unique in
discipline. People want to talk about there's a struggle for up and down. I go
back and look at it and think, golly, South Dakota is in the NCAA tournament,
Michigan is in the NCAA tournament, Auburn is in the NCAA tournament, you try
and think, okay, there were some peaks and valleys, but we played a really
good nonconference. And obviously the SEC has been a challenge night in and
night out.  
  
I do think there's growing pains, and we had lost at that point in the non-
conference Jordan who was a huge piece of what we did offensively and
defensively and Cierra Porter wasn't there and Kayla Michael and then we were
blessed to get Cierra Porter back after Christmas. It was growing pains, there
were a lot of returners, but asking them to step up in a position they hadn't
been in before. Kids that were maybe more role players, played more of an
impact rotation for us. And so it just looks different.  
  
But I think there's been a lot of growth. And I think the resiliency of our
team, after some tough losses that we have had this year have been outstanding
for us, and to be in the position we are right now, we are tighter than ever.
That's what you want as a coach. You have to get through the peaks and valleys
of the first couple of months in the season but in February or March, you feel
good about where your team is at and I do. It's a great group. I care a great
deal about them. I want to make this last, because it's a special group of
seniors.  
  
Q. You said you were sort of familiar with Sara coming into this, and
from high school, but what kind of jumps has she made at Drake, and how
central has she become to what this team does offensively?  
ROBIN PINGETON: First of all, I would say (inaudible) is a tremendous player,
and I knew coming out of high school she was, too. So versatile, runs the
court and shoots, plays her tail off, can defend, she's just -- she's one of
the very, very -- one of the many great players they have on this Drake
roster. And then you look at what Jennie has done in her staff with this team.
And what she's implemented offensively, it's a really hard guard. In talking
to different coaches that played them they say the same thing. High basketball
IQ, fundamentally sound, everybody can shoot it. There's reads within that
motion, we're familiar with it, we run a motion offense, too, it's a little
bit different in the principle, but again the confusion that it can cause at
times. And Jennie and her staff has done a great job. So some great players,
but you have to give a lot of credit for what Jennie and her coaching staff
and the way she's developed them. Not only individually, but how they fit into
her system and style.  
  
Q. Are there any lessons that you learned playing for or coaching with
her that you still use today?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Well, I think, you know, when I go back and people that have
really impacted me as a coach, obviously my high school coach, Lisa Bruner,
was a huge part of that, Bill Finley, always been a fan of Pat Summit and
followed her from a young age. When you spend as much time in those college
years you're so moldable. So when I had a chance to be under her and be
coached by her for four years and just everything that she -- I think
implemented in her system, always been very positive, encouraging. And then to
have a chance to work with her, too. Because as a player you know what coaches
do, but you have no idea until you're sitting in that conference table with
them and you're really diving into the recruiting the xes and o's, and
everything, the marking and everything that goes into is that program. So she
really opened my eyes to what really coaching is all about. It's so much
bigger than the xes and o's, and just the importance of relationships. So,
yeah, she's impacted me in so many ways. I can't say one particular thing to
jumps out to me right now. But she's certainly had a huge impact on me as a
player and certainly as a coach and as a person.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
SUSIE GARDNER: First of all, we're really excited about being here in Iowa
City. I am very appreciative of the history of Iowa women's basketball with
Dr. Christine Grant and everything she's done in the past, and of course when
Coach Stringer was here, the success that she had, and now what Coach Bluder
is doing. So we're not removed from understanding the history and love of
women's basketball in the state of Iowa.  
  
You probably don't know a whole lot about Mercer University. We're a private
school, about an hour and 15 minutes south of Atlanta. We're in the Southern
Conference, which is a conference that we are proud to represent in the NCAA
Tournament. It's got great coaches in that league that we think have prepared
us for this moment. These two players are two of five seniors that had the
winningest record in the history of our program. A unique situation: Amanda
was Southern Conference player the year voted by the coaches, and KeKe was
Southern Conference Player of the Year voted by the media. So you don't often
have co-MVPs on the same team.  
  
Q. KeKe, you guys gave Georgia a really good run last year in the
tournament. How much confidence did that give you that you can play with the
big schools on the big stage?  
KEKE CALLOWAY: You know, last year that was a hard-fought battle between
Georgia. We play them every year, so we -- coming into the game, we just tried
to be confident that we could play with anyone in the nation, and we prepared
well, and we just tried to come out and fight regardless of the outcome.  
  
Q. This is for both players to comment on: When you have a long winning
streak like you guys are on, what is the positive in that, and are there any
negatives to that?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: I don't think we really think about the winning streak. We
really take it one day at a time. I didn't even realize until last week -- I
hadn't even thought about the fact that we were on a winning streak. We just
don't want to talk about that.  
  
So I think it's more one game at a time. We're focused on Iowa and what our
coaches are telling us about that game.  
  
KEKE CALLOWAY: Yeah, just to second what Amanda said, we're just taking it one
day at a time, and when we come out and compete, just take what the coaches
give us at practice and try to put it all together when we come out and play.
And we've fortunate enough to come out on the winning end of however many
games we've won.  
  
SUSIE GARDNER: 17. (Laughter).  
  
Q. For either of the players, just your thoughts about what you see when
you see Megan Gustafson on film?  
AMANDA THOMPSON: Obviously she's a great player. Top rated in the country. So
we've just excited about our scout and our coaches' ability to create a game
plan, and then give that to us, and we're just going to take that and play our
hardest.  
  
KEKE CALLOWAY: Yeah, obviously she's a great player. In watching the film,
she's very skilled. We're just focusing on just taking the game plan and the
scout from the coaches, and we're just going to come out and compete hard and
give her our best shot.  
  
SUSIE GARDNER: Sounds like the game plan is very important, doesn't it, from
these guys. (Laughter).  
  
Q. I'll ask the same thing to you: Just your thoughts about Megan
Gustafson and the problems she might present.  
SUSIE GARDNER: Well, you know, we don't get the Big Ten Network in Georgia, so
honestly, the only knowledge that I had of her was reading on ESPN that she
got Player of the Year. This was before obviously we drew them in the
tournament. So we don't get to watch a lot of Big Ten games at all just
because they don't come on TV.  
  
But then when we drew her, of course I knew this was going to be one of our
biggest dilemmas in playing Iowa. So we obviously did a lot of research on her
and watched a lot of film. First of all, you look at her stats, and you think,
man, these stats cannot be real. It's like when I'm watching film and she
misses it's almost like a shock that she's going to miss the shot. Not only is
she a great scorer, she's an exceptional passer, and that stood out to me
because a lot of times post players aren't the best passers on a lot of teams
that we compete against, and obviously she's used to being double, triple-
teamed, and her ability to just get the assist and find the open player is
remarkable.  
  
And on top of that, she runs the floor really, really well and plays a ton of
minutes. She is just an incredible player that I wish I was able to watch more
this year just as a fan versus as an opponent, but she's a special, special
talent for sure.  
  
Q. Have you done anything special in practice to try to prepare your
team for her and how you might stop her?  
SUSIE GARDNER: What do you think?  
  
You know, I've watched a lot of different teams, and we do, we scout really
hard. Those weren't just words that we told them to say. We really take a lot
of pride in our scouts of our opponents, and so I've watched a lot of film.
Obviously our coaches watched the night that we learned we were playing you
guys. And you watch other people's philosophies, whether it's an in-conference
team or perhaps an out-of-conference team, and everyone does something
different.  
  
Most of it doesn't work. I mean, part of it works, but if you keep her from
catching the ball, someone else is open, and they've got really, really good
shooters from the outside. They've got drivers, they've got all the
ingredients of a great team. So certainly we have a game plan, but this is the
beauty of playing this game tomorrow is for us to see if what we think may
work -- I told my players, listen, she averages 28. I mean, who averages 28?
So that means there's been times that she's had more than 28. So I'm trying to
tell my post players, listen, she's going to score, don't get your feelings
hurt. That's basically been the message to my post players is listen, "It's
not on y'all." I'm trying to put the blame on everyone else besides my players
that are going to be defending her. That's kind of my philosophy strategically
or emotionally, I don't know which one it is.  
  
I mean, I'm very excited and curious to see what we're going to try to do, if
it kind of comes close, you know? That's the fun of playing the game.  
  
Q. Do you talk with your players at all about being here in Iowa?
Obviously Iowa being in Iowa City and then Drake being in Iowa and Mizzou only
being three hours away, is the fan base going to be -- have you talked about
that with your players?  
SUSIE GARDNER: No, we haven't. We didn't talk about that. I'll tell you,
that's an interesting question which I'm going to answer it maybe not the way
you wanted me to, but we have great following. Our fans are awesome. We have a
great following at Mercer. When we go to Asheville to the SoCon Tournament, in
the women's side we have the largest crowd. We went to Georgia last year, and
I promise you, it was half and half, Mercer and Georgia fans. Our fans were so
excited to drive over to Athens and support our team, and I will say that our
fans on Selection Monday were probably the most disappointed, not because of
who we played but where we were going, because it is a 13-hour drive, and it's
a very expensive, quick turnaround if you're going to fly.  
  
We're not talking about now we're the team that's far away. Now, would it be
nice for me to recruit the Drake fans and the Missouri fans and say, hey, help
us out. I know y'all rather play Mercer and Iowa. So cheer for us because we
get a lot of energy. But it is what it is.  
  
So we don't talk about it with our players. I know we've got some disappointed
fans, though, that wish they could be there. We do have some watch parties
going on in Macon at some of the restaurants because we do have a great
following. We're very, very fortunate to have that support at home.  
  
Q. Can you tell us about your team? I know you have four senior starters
and players who have logged a lot of minutes in a lot of big games. What are
the strengths of your team?  
SUSIE GARDNER: Well, one is those seniors, when they were freshmen, we were
picked to finish fifth out of eight in our conference, and one thing that's a
strength is that's the first year we won the regular season Southern
Conference championship and they've won four in a row, so a strength -- I know
that's not what you're looking for, but one strength is they've been there,
and their confidence, and they've won. They know how to win. We've won a lot
of close games this year. If you looked at our scores, a lot of them came down
to the end, but we have -- you look at Iowa, what their strengths are. We have
players that can score. KeKe can score. But all five of our starters can
score.  
  
We also feel like we're pretty good defensively. We worked very hard on that.
I would say that our experience has played a key role in what we've
accomplished this year because we were very, very, very good last year, lost
some key players, key starters off of last year's team, and so I think the
fact that these seniors that were juniors on last year's team have been able
to continue what we've done in our conference, and it's hard. Y'all know. It
doesn't matter what conference you're in. It's hard to go undefeated two years
in a row through the conference and also in the tournament.  
  
So what they've done has been pretty impressive.  
  
Q. I think you're fifth in the nation in fewest turnovers given up. Is
that experience, or what's the reason for that?  
SUSIE GARDNER: That is not what I expected because last year one of my
assistant coaches, Sydni Means, was my point guard last year, and I actually
hired her right out of college. We led the country or she led the country last
year in that category, and I thought when we lost Sydni, I had told myself,
okay, prepare for turnovers -- the ball to just be pinging everywhere.  
  
So that is not something that we really -- I didn't have any idea that we were
going to be that good at not turning the ball over this year. And maybe it's
just because I get mad in practice when we turn it over and I make it a big
deal, but maybe it's just the culture that has been cultivated because of our
success with Sydni last year, and maybe it's just, oh, we don't want to turn
the ball over.  
  
But we don't really do anything different, maybe because our guards shoot it
before they turn it over, who knows. But yeah, I looked at that stat this
morning before I came over here so I'd be educated with y'all's questions, but
that is not something we anticipated this year at all. At all. Pleased about
it but didn't expect it.  
  
Q. A 15 has never beaten a 2 in the women's tournament. I think between
the 2s and the 1s they're like 231-1 or something like that in the first
round. Has that been mentioned to the kids and just the opportunity that might
be out there to do something that's never been done?  
SUSIE GARDNER: You know, I know y'all are disappointed that we don't talk
about all this stuff behind the scenes, but we really don't. We did not talk
about the streak. My assistant coaches are getting on my last nerves a little
bit about all this stuff about 2 and 15. They've mentioned it, but it's not
something that we're going to talk to our players about. Maybe I'm naïve or
maybe I'm just different, but we just try to keep it like nice and simple
about who our opponent is and not try to do all the peripheral stuff that's
involved.  
  
Now, certainly if we were able to do it, we would certainly mention it at that
point.

_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
LISA BLUDER: It's really nice to be at home. We're thrilled to be here in Iowa
City at the University of Iowa in Carver-Hawkeye Arena. We think it's going to
be a great atmosphere for everybody involved. We certainly want to welcome our
three competitors to Carver, but we're excited about the opportunity to play
Mercer. We know they're a very good basketball team. I mean, I didn't know a
lot about them on Monday night, but I know a lot more now.  
  
I'm very impressed with the -- they're very similar to us in that they're a
very senior-dominated team. They have five seniors on the team, four in the
starting lineup. They've been on 17 straight wins. Went undefeated in their
conference play, and it was pretty easy to get my players' attention when we
note that they only lost to Florida State by one point, where we lost to
Florida State by four points. So this is a very good team that last year
really competed well in the NCAA Tournament, so they're no stranger to the
tournament, and Susie has done a great job with Mercer's program.  
  
Q. Tania, can you just talk about being here in the tournament after
your season ending prematurely the previous two years and all the hard work
and dedication it took to be at the podium right now?  
TANIA DAVIS: Yeah, well, obviously this is my first NCAA Tournament as an
athlete, as playing. So I'm definitely excited just to be here with my fellow
seniors and the rest of my teammates. We've worked so hard from last year up
until this point. So I've worked hard from last year up until this point just
rehabbing and getting myself back right mentally and physically, and just
visualizing this day and holding up that trophy in the end.  
  
This moment right now is definitely special to me, and sharing it with some of
my best friends has been amazing.  
  
Q. Hannah, you and Megan have really developed that 12-foot shot. Coach
said you were shooting like 70 percent in practice. Have you guys ever played
H-O-R-S-E against each other? You've got it down.  
HANNAH STEWART: Yeah, that's a shot we practice a lot, not only in practice
but outside of practice. We know that's a shot we're going to get a lot in
games, so that's one that we are really repping, and it's kind of like second
nature now.  
  
We've played a couple competitions during practice. Sometimes it gets a little
too competitive. But yeah, no H-O-R-S-E games yet. We probably should do that.
I'm getting so used to dominating, I wouldn't want to get in her head or
anything. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Megan, what really stands out to you about Mercer? What has your
attention about them?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, they're a really good team. They've got a really good
point guard. They've got an all-around balanced team, and it's impressive to
hear that they have a 17-game win streak and they won their conference
tournament. I would just say they're overall really well balanced, and their
guards are especially really good.  
  
Q. Megan, you and Tania were on the All-Big Ten freshman team, as I
recall. You had to stand there and watch her go through what she's gone
through the previous two years. What do you admire the most about what she
fought her way back on to the floor?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, I think just that, seeing her fight and drive to want
to keep getting back out on the court. To go through what she's been through,
not a lot of people can come back the way she has. She's just been persevering
through anything. Whatever is thrown at her, she keeps having a positive
attitude and attacking rehab. It's been really amazing to be able to watch her
go through that and to really stand out and to be out there right now.  
  
Q. For any of the players, you've been playing against Big Ten opponents
for two months now. Is it good to maybe see something different, experience
something different, because Big Ten, you guys know each other so well?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, it's nice to switch it up a little bit. We've been
playing Big Ten teams for a while, for four years now. So it's nice to have a
team that maybe doesn't know us as well or we don't know them as well. So I
think it'll just be a breath of fresh air.  
  
Q. Tania, you've got that one-handed floater down. Have you been
practicing that since high school, or is that something you developed? That's
not an easy shot.  
TANIA DAVIS: Yeah, obviously with my height discrepancy, I've got to find
different ways to get the ball into the basket. When I was in high school, it
was just understanding that I'm not as tall and not as physical as everyone
else, so I'm not going to be able to get to the basket and get an easy lay-up
off, like some of the taller guards.  
  
So back when I was in high school or middle school, that was what my AAU
coach, we really worked on that floater. I saw a lot of NBA players doing it,
like Kyrie, like Chris Paul, Chauncey Billups. I thought it was a good weapon
to have in my bag.  
  
Q. Tania, obviously the physical part of coming back is pretty well-
known, but can you discuss the mental part of it, playing through a season,
and were you ever looking over your shoulder waiting for something bad to
happen? And how did you get through that mental barrier to do what you did?  
TANIA DAVIS: Well, I would definitely say after the first injury, after the
first ACL injury, it was more physical than it was mental, getting used to
rehabbing every day, putting that strain on my body every single day and
trying to fight through that every single day, but I would say with the second
ACL it was definitely more mental. It took a lot more for me to get up out to
bed in the morning and to go to rehab and look forward to rehab and doing
rehab every single day, when I just went through the same thing not too long
ago.  
  
My teammates, my best friends, my coaches, my family, they were definitely
huge for me, but the mental aspect of just trying to get up every single day
and rehab for something that you don't even know if it's going to continue to
be there for you in the end, that was just definitely hard for me.  
  
Q. Tania, Mercer is a team that I think is fifth in the country, fewest
turnovers, 11 a game. Tell me a little bit about their guard play and it just
appears to be a team that doesn't make very many mistakes.  
TANIA DAVIS: Yeah, they're very disciplined, very talented. Takes what the
defense gives them. They're going to be very patient on the offensive end.
They're not going to rush or get in a hurry-up situation. That's not what
they're used to. That's not what their coaches want. They're very disciplined
on the offensive end, so we just have to play very solid defense, play our
principles, and try our best to just get in their heads. If that doesn't work,
if they miss or if they make a shot, just get out and run our transition.  
  
Q. Hannah, does anything change for you or your team because you're
playing at home but this is the NCAA Tournament?  
HANNAH STEWART: Yeah, well, I mean, obviously Carver looks a little different.
It's not really our gym anymore. There's NCAA logos everywhere. But it's also
cool because it is still our gym, and you know, this is where we play. Some of
us were joking around getting a little defensive, like what, we can't go on
our court? This is our court, that's not fair.  
  
But no, it's awesome, and I think routine-wise as far as game day tomorrow,
it'll stay pretty much the same, which is nice, because we all have a routine
that we do for game days, and I'll still be able to braid Megan's hair in the
same spot, which is a big deal. But yeah, we're really proud to be at home and
excited to play in front of a lot of our fans.  
  
Q. Coach, your three guards, over 130 assists. Hannah has got 70, I
think Megan has got 50. Is this one of your better passing teams? You led the
nation in assists per game there for a while. That's got to be one of your
favorite stats, isn't it?  
LISA BLUDER: It absolutely is. It's something that we get excited about every
single day is how many assists we have. I believe we have some of the best
post-passing guards in America. Megan and Hannah, again, they look for each
other, and when people double Megan, she makes them pay.  
  
So it's pretty exciting how well they share the ball. It's just a fun style,
and it just shows team chemistry, and we all embrace that.  
  
Q. You've got a small coaching tree at the tournament with Robin and
Jennie. What does that mean for you and having to also essentially play one of
them in the second round?  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, you know, I guess when you coach long enough and you start
running into your former players, that's a good thing. It means that they
loved the game and they wanted to continue coaching it. I think it's a
terrific thing.  
  
I don't love playing against my former players, obviously, but at the same
time, we cheer for each other. I mean, all year long, we cheer for each other.
It's just that one time when you play against each other, it makes it awkward.  
  
Q. You guys have already had a great season this year, but there's so
much emphasis on the NCAA Tournament. Do you worry about your players putting
too much pressure on themselves to try to meet that?  
LISA BLUDER: I think coaches worry about everything this time of year. Like
what we worry about, is the water cold enough? It's just what you do. It's
part of the nature of the beast is that you have to find something to worry
about.  
  
I have to trust them, that they have paid the work. They're confident. And
when you're confident, it can take away some of those worries for them and the
pressure for them.  
  
You know, they want this so badly, and they certainly don't want to let down
the fan base here at Iowa. But at the same time, we just want to try to
alleviate some of that pressure from them and just go out and play Iowa
basketball every day.  
  
Q. How would you describe what was Robin like as a player? What was
Jennie like? What are your memories of them as players for you?  
LISA BLUDER: Ironically they're both pretty tenacious. They're both very, very
similar. They were both power forwards. They both were incredibly competitive.
They both were terrific rebounders. They played very similar to each other,
and it's going to be an interesting game tomorrow.  
  
Q. When you look at Tania's career path, I know as a coach you admire
that she fought her way back, not once but twice. How rewarding is it for you
to see her in this moment getting to play in the NCAA Tournament?  
LISA BLUDER: It is absolutely rewarding. I think you can tell the emotion in
her voice about her being here. This is what she came here to do. You know,
Tania is a basketball player, and you think, yeah, they're all basketball
players. No, Tania is a basketball player. She would not be at Iowa if it
wasn't for basketball. She loves the game. She came here to play. She came
here to compete at a high level, and now it's happening her senior year. Does
it make it even more special because she's been denied the last two years?
Yeah, I think it does make it more special for her. And honestly, when she
first came back this year and was going in practice, I mean, there were
several times us coaches, we're choking up because we're seeing this kid out
there playing again, and it's been very special.  
  
Q. One of my favorite snapshots of your team is that second game against
Indiana, towards the end you had the game pretty much in hand. All five of
your starters walking down the court hand in hand. You've talked about the
chemistry of this team. That's just got to go a long ways in some of the
victories.  
LISA BLUDER: Yeah, they call it the victory formation. It's pretty cool. It
just happened naturally. It's not something they planned. It's not something
that they figured they were going to do. It just happened. It happened earlier
in the year. It actually started quite a while ago, and when the games give
themselves an opportunity to have that relief of kind of walking down the
floor together to that free-throw line, it's beautiful to watch.  
  
Q. Earlier today you were named one of the four finalists for the
Naismith coaching award. What's that mean to you?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, any time you get a coaching award or a recognition of
any kind, it's all reflective of the great team that you've had, right? And
then obviously -- what I'm happy about is for my staff because those guys work
so hard, and any time you get any recognition as a head coach, it's reflective
of not only your team but your entire staff, your administration, your
university. It's a whole package deal, and that's what makes me happy about
it.  
  
Q. Have you ever had a player handle the physicality of play the way
teams guard a player, like Megan Gustafson has handled that?  
LISA BLUDER: No, never. There's never been anybody that's -- that I've coached
that has had to take what she's had to take as far as the physical play.
There's nobody that's handled it so beautifully. There's nobody that's handled
it with such composure. I don't know how she does it, honestly.  
  
But no, there's nobody that I've ever coached that's played like her.  
  
Q. What impresses you most about Mercer? What concerns you most about
Mercer?  
LISA BLUDER: You know, they stay within their lane as far as they know what
they're good at and they just do it. They don't try to do things outside of
themselves. They know what they're good at. They play hard. They compete. I
mean, every game you look at it, you win 17 straight games, you're feeling
pretty good about yourself coming into this tournament, and especially since
they know they played well in last year's NCAA Tournament.  
  
They challenge themselves in the non-conference and played some really good
schools. So what scares me is you've got a guard like Calloway who is
definitely a BCS point guard. She is a very, very good point guard, and
Rosendal, who is an excellent three-point shooter. Titus is an amazing
athlete, long at 6'1", can pull up, has a great mid-range game but long arms.
Thompson I think is the heart and soul of this team. I think that she is just
a blue-collar kid that will will herself to get rebounds and will will herself
to get points, and then you've got a really nice post player, as well.  
  
So this is a team that has all aspects and they have experience, and a very
good coach, too. Susie has been around a long time.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS: IOWA
CITY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+IOWA+CITY)

### [Sara Rhine](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36990)

  
_Iowa City, Iowa_  
  
JENNIE BARANCZYK: I'm impressed you got everyone's name right. It's so nice.
Nicely done.  
  
We're really excited to be here. Being in the NCAA tournament it never gets
old. There's always just this unbelievable feeling. I'm really, really proud
of the way that we've been able to just have a complete season, and obviously
there's been moments that we'd love to have back and we'd love to do
different, but there have also been some good moments.  
  
To get an at-large bid at Drake, we're really proud of that. And at the same
time I think we're hungrier than ever. We're ready and really excited that we
get to play close enough to home that our fans get to come with us, and I
think that's a significant part of what we do, so it's going to be really fun
to have that.  
  
Q. Sara, what was your reaction, being from Missouri, getting to play
Mizzou?  
SARA RHINE: I'm really excited. I was really excited for any team to pop up.
But it was fun having that connection, that being my home state and getting to
play a team that's from there.  
  
Q. Becca, and for anybody from that matter, when you saw your name come
up, what -- you see Iowa City, so you know you're close, then you see a 10,
for one thing, are you excited to be close to home and also do you feel you're
under seeded?  
BECCA HITTNER: I'm super excited to be close to home. It's going to be awesome
for our fans to come to the game. Just super exciting to have blue around.
We're just excited for this tournament, regardless of the seed. We're just
ready to give it our all and really compete tomorrow.  
  
Q. Sara, two straight seasons now, your NCAA, your first opponent is an
SEC opponent, what did you take away from Texas A &M last year?  
SARA RHINE: Just looking that we do have to focus on who we are and what we
bring, and being very confident in the strengths that we do have. And knowing,
I don't know what we have is a little different from what the people have seen
and taking pride in that I think is the biggest thing, the biggest take away.  
  
Q. Sara, what's your guys game plan when this comes to Sophie RHINE and
stopping her?  
SARA RHINE: She's a good player, we have to know where she is at on the floor.
But going back to my last comment, we really are focusing on what we need to
do on both ends, both defensively and offensively, in order to be our best.  
  
Q. Coach, Sara led the conference in shooting her freshman year, so
you're obviously getting a polished player. But how has she improved with her
time at Drake?  
JENNIE BARANCZYK: Sara is a special player, you just listen to her talk, she's
so genuine, she's an incredible person, incredible leader for our team. But I
do think she's really expanded her game. I think she came in as a freshman and
just did what she could do as a freshman and every year she's added a
different element. Obviously she's always been able to run the floor, she can
catch pretty much everything. Her defense is better, her rebounding is better,
she's gotten a lot stronger. I love the way that she positions well, and she's
obviously extended her range. So I think she's really a complete player.  
  
And this year I think she's even added passing to her game, as well. And so
she really just fits who we are and she really has just expanded her own self.
And I think that's what's really neat.  
  
Q. Have you gotten a chance to reflect on kind of the coaching ties that
are here with Lisa and Robin?  
JENNIE BARANCZYK: I'm very well aware that Lisa coached me. And I've known
Robin for a really long time and obviously we play Iowa every single year. But
we aren't even looking to playing Iowa, we are really focusing on Missouri.  
  
And obviously Robin has done an incredible job, and I have all the respect in
the world. She came from Illinois State and I followed a lot of what she did
there. There are a lot of Iowa ties, and I think that's what's pretty cool.  
  
I think the things that's so neat about the State of Iowa is how important
women's basketball is. And there are so many fans. And I've talked up Iowa and
Iowa State all year long. With Iowa State being able to host, with Iowa being
able to host, people will come. Sometimes on the national scene people don't
realize what we have here in this state. When you see how many blue people
come over to this game, people get to have a view of really how great women's
basketball is in the State of Iowa. And you can go to the state tournament in
high school. You can go to high school games. You can see any facet. So in
terms of ties, I'm really proud of being an Iowa girl. And I'm really proud of
the fact that our sport really matters in this state.  
  
Q. Missouri sounded pretty confident in their high advantage down low.
They seemed confident in their advantage down low. But they, where do you
think you guys can be effective down low with your zone?  
JENNIE BARANCZYK: Well, not many people have Gustafson, right, let's be
honest, that's why she's player of the year. But they should be confident.
We're in the NCAA tournament. We're confident. We're in the NCAA tournament.  
  
So we really need to focus on what we do have than what we don't have. We can
go through and I can tell you a million things that I wish we could be better
at or don't have, but there are also a lot of things that we are pretty good
at we need to make sure that we play the way we want to play and really keep
more focus on that. I mean obviously we need to rebuild the basketball, and
every single coach would tell you that's a major key to the game. That's
something that we've got to be able to do. But I do think that -- I think both
teams probably have advantages and so the game always comes down to really who
outplays the other team.  
  
Q. Coach, you probably have the person who knows Missouri best in your
locker room in Grace Berg. How much have you leaned on her, just in the scout
for Missouri?  
JENNIE BARANCZYK: You know, that's a really good question. And to be
completely honest with you, we're not going to put her in that position. We're
not -- she's a great person and that situation is one that is very personal to
her. And so we're not going to put her in that position. She's on our team,
we're really excited to be able to have her, but that doesn't give us an
advantage over another team because of that situation.  
  
Q. When you were recruiting Sara what drew you to her and what drew her
to Drake?  
JENNIE BARANCZYK: Well, one, Sara is a 4.0 student, so she's very smart. And
she's definitely -- she is the definition of a student-athlete. So I think
that the academic fit is a no-brainer. She's also -- she's a culture person.
She loves what she does. She loves being part of a team. She really builds
people up around her. She's got a natural confidence in herself and other
people. The culture was a fit. The style of play, we want to be up tempo, we
want to be able to run the floor. And she fits that really well. And so when
you have those things fit in every facet it's amazing what can happen. And
fit, fit creates magic.  
  
Q. Lisa said that you and Robin actually played a pretty similar game?  
JENNIE BARANCZYK: So do you think that she thinks that Robin was really good?
I'm just asking. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding. I'm just kidding.  
  
Q. Do you see that in how you coach your teams, that competitiveness,
that fierceness?  
JENNIE BARANCZYK: Well, I mean I have -- I don't even know how to really
answer that question. I know that all of the coaches here are really
competitive. I mean that's why we're all here, right, is because we loved
playing. We loved the form of competition, whatever that looks like. So I
don't really know how to exactly answer that question. I know -- I have a lot
of respect for Robin, I knew her more as a coach than a player. But I do know
Lisa is one of the most competitive people I know, too, and I'm in coaching
because I got to play for her. And those are things that -- that's probably
the best way I can answer that. I don't have another way really to give you a
better answer.  
  
Q. Your AD put out a Tweet earlier this week, a lot of teams that have
similar RPIs, similar records against top 40 or 50 or hundred or something
like that are all five and six seeds. Do you take the ten seed a little bit
personal?  
JENNIE BARANCZYK: That's a good question, and one that I probably continue to
get asked. And honestly do you like being a ten seed when we've scheduled the
way that we have in the nonconference? No. Do I like having an at-large bid?
Yes. Do I like where we get to play in terms of having our fans be able to
come? Yes. But I'm not in the business right now to fight what the seed is.
We're in the business right now to be able to show up and give everything that
we have. And that's the only focus that I have right now and we can get in a
reflective mode later and that's more Brian's job than it is my job. My job is
to prepare our team to play Missouri tomorrow as a ten seed.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville 71, Michigan 50  
  
COACH JEFF WALZ: You know, first off, just want to congratulate Michigan on a
wonderful year. You know, we knew coming into the game tonight that we were
going to have to play well.  
  
Just watching what they did to Kansas State on the boards, 50-19, was pretty
remarkable, and we talked to our kids about it. We had talked to them about,
you've got to come out, you've got to be prepared to battle. It's going to be
-- it's going to be a basketball game where it's going to be physical, and I
thought we responded well.  
  
To all three of our seniors, just a wonderful group of young women. So proud
of Arica Carter, just being able to get back out there and play, and I know
that's one of the things that she wanted to do. Like she did not want to end
her career not having a chance to play the last game at home.  
  
You know, I started her and I was just going to let her keep going until she
couldn't go just for the fact that if you warm up and then you stop, and it's
tough for her to get going again, and I thought she did a great job. I thought
AC did well and Sam and Deja. Just a remarkable group to coach. Really, really
proud of them.  
  
Q. Obviously right off the jump, getting those two assists, getting
those baskets really kind of helped jump start you all. Was that something you
kind of took upon yourself or just something -- I know you had to start off at
a fast pace but for you personally, did you feel like you had to take it upon
yourself to really get the team going?  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, I mean, I just tried to make the right reads. Make the right
play, as well. They were throwing like three guards at me, three players at
me. I was just trying to make the right read and make the right pass.  
  
My teammates were getting open, making great cuts, and finishing the ball, as
well.  
  
Q. Describe your emotions when you took that victory lap, and when you
left the arena for the last time.  
ASIA DURR: It was great. You know, playing here for four years with such great
fans, great people who follow you everywhere, literally, everywhere. I can't
really put it into words because it's a feeling that you'll never forget, and
years down the line, you talk to your kids, your grandkids, your friends about
these four years, and I mean, it was just so much fun playing here, playing in
front of the best fans in the country.  
  
We take tried in that and we are very thankful. We never take that for
granted, but just so thankful for it.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, AC and Asia left me.  
  
ASIA DURR: We don't know where you went.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: On that first victory last, they left. I had to come back out.
It was kind of embarrassing, but I enjoyed it. And the fans, they clapped for
me all over again.  
  
ASIA DURR: They are awesome.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: It was exciting. Yeah, we had a really, really big crowd. Even
when we were doing the instructions, I was like, this crowd is roaring. I feel
like it's not like this anywhere else, and I'm so appreciative.  
  
Q. Jaz, you've had the last couple years to play with these two and
Arica up here. Just some of the accolades, thoughts, words about playing with
two exceptional athletes like this.  
JAZMINE JONES: I love my teammates, and these two, and AC, I'm going to miss
so much. Just playing with them, having to be with them every single day, they
are all great individually, and they are even better people off the court.  
  
I don't want to take that for granted and I'm going to miss these young ladies
so much. Next year is going to be really hard without them, especially Sam and
Asia, and AC, I look at her as our team leader. She's a big part of this team.
And then trying to fill that void next year is going to be hard for us, but we
can do it. I just want to say thank you guys for everything. Appreciate it.  
  
ASIA DURR: You trying to make us cry?  
  
Q. I guess for all three of you. Looked like you came out with a ton of
energy. Was that something that you talked about pregame? Was there anything
that triggered that?  
THE MODERATOR: Asia, Sam then Jaz, please.  
  
ASIA DURR: During this time of the year, a coach should never have to tell you
that. It's either win-or-go-home. So we take pride in that. We want to win.  
  
That was a great team, so we knew we were going to have our hands full. We
knew that we were going to have to play hard for the whole game. So we were
just trying to have fun, too. Focus all-in and just play hard.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, to add on to what Asia said, we're trying to throw the
first punch every game. We don't want to start out flat because that pretty
much determines the rest of the game.  
  
But yeah, today, honestly -- I don't know about you guys -- but I feel like it
was the crowd giving us energy. So that helped to boost us even more.  
  
JAZMINE JONES: Yeah, I think everybody came out focused. It started like when
the ball tipped, we started off to a great pace and then our defense was
tremendous. We played like we're the best team in the ACC on defense this
game, and we picked it up.  
  
Coach been getting on us the last couple days, knew that they are a great
rebounding team, so it all started with boxing out. We didn't let them get
offensive boards in the first couple possessions, so that determined the tempo
of the game, as well.  
  
Yeah, I think everybody was just focused this game, because we knew it was our
last game here, and we wanted to do great for these seniors.  
  
Q. Sam, when you go back to the scouting report about Michigan and their
size, what did you see on film or with that scouting report that you felt like
you all really -- did you feel like you really had to push the pace to beat
that size advantage that they seemed to have?  
SAM FUEHRING: I feel like we're always trying to play our own game, whether
that be our transition game, just playing fast. I don't think we really worry
about the opponents. We always try to play our own game. But yeah, definitely
worked today against them. They are a great team, though. Yeah, I mean, we're
trying to play our own game all the time.  
  
Q. Can you talk about what the message to the team was in terms of
dealing with their press?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: Yes, our goal is to attack the score. When we went back and
watched the Kansas State film, they attacked it at times but they looked to
pull it back out to set up an offense.  
  
I told our kids, we don't want to do that. Our goal, if they press, try to get
as quick and easy looks as we can. When you've got that type of tempo and
mentality, sure, you might turn the ball over a few times, but you're going to
get easier looks, and possibly deflating baskets.  
  
When you're pressing and all of a sudden you give up a layup, it's one of
those, you hang your head on. There was one possession where we took a quick
shot, it was a good shot we missed it, get the offensive rebound, great pass
back out to Asia and she hits a three.  
  
I thought our whole mindset has been all year, if someone tries to press us,
to attack the score.  
  
Q. Hopefully four more games to go, but some of your thoughts and
memories of the three seniors here?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: Yeah, it's remarkable to think as a staff what we've been
able to do with those three bad players. To turn them into the players they
are, it's pretty amazing (laughing).  
  
As Jaz says, they are really, really good players, but they are even better
people. That's I think what we strive to do here at Louisville is to win
games, of course. You know, that's really important, but to also have great
young women when they leave here.  
  
And I'm excited for all three of them, because I truly believe all three are
going to be successful no matter what they do. If they want to continue on
playing basketball at a professional level, I think all three will have the
opportunity somewhere.  
  
And if they are ready to get out into the real world, you know, I think they
will do extremely well there. I tell them all the time, play basketball as
long as you can because that 8:00 to 5:00 job, it's not much fun.  
  
So if they can do it for five, ten, 12 years, go ahead and do it. But it's
been a joy for me. It's been fun and I've said it before, Arica and Sam are
exactly -- what's not happening any more in my opinion in college athletics,
not just women's basketball.  
  
It's two young women who came in here as freshmen, did not play a whole bunch,
played a little bit more their sophomore year and then sat down with them and
said, hey, if you want to play more, you've got to get back in this gym.
You've got to work harder. And then they take that to heart, the summer of
their sophomore year, all of a sudden they are making an impact on our team as
juniors, we go to a Final Four and now they are right back in the middle of it
and we are going to a Sweet 16. And anymore, if you don't get instant
gratification, you're looking to leave.  
  
You know I always tell them, the grass is greener on the other side because
it's fertilized with manure, but I don't use that word. I make sure they all
know, because it's the truth.  
  
It's fun to see these two young ladies who are putting in their time and
looking at the rewards they are getting back. You know, it's a process and
they have done it.  
  
You know, Asia came in with a lot of hype, and I think she backed it all up
but what's the most impressive thing about Asia, I think her teammates will
tell you, as good of a basketball player she is, she's an even better person.
I challenged her, her freshman year, she would always ask, "Am I shooting too
much?"  
  
I said, "I'll tell you, when to stop shooting," and I never quite told her.  
  
That's the one thing the teammates love about her. I remember the N.C. State
game, she scores 47 and the first thing she said in the press room is her
teammates did a great job of setting her screens, finding her when she was
open. And that's just not the norm anymore.  
  
So really impressed with all three of them. We're going to miss all three of
them, but the good thing for us is we've got a another ballgame to play and
we'll get back to work and get prepared and see who we are going to play next
week.  
  
Q. You talked about the rebounding, out-rebounding. Did you sense that
the team was locked in and focused and ready to go leading up to this game;
that they were taking on the challenge?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: We had one day of prep, so we had just talked about it, if
you want to keep playing, this is what you're going to have to do.  
  
And I've got to give them credit. I thought Kylee came out and really set the
tone early, which is something she hasn't done in the past, but she held her
ground. Made their post post-up higher up off the block, and made it more
difficult to score. Where in the past, she sometimes will let you get too low
and all of a sudden, it's a drop-step layup and then she did a great job of
boxing out. Then.  
  
Everybody started to get into the mix because we had talked to the guards,
you've got to rebound the basketball, because Hillmon, the one thing we told
our kids, whoever is guarding her, I don't care if you get a rebound; she
can't. And even with that emphasis on it, she still comes off with five
offensive boards. So our guards are going to have to do a really good job of
coming in and cleaning things up.  
  
Q. Kind of answered my question, but I'll ask a different one. With
Kylee, ten boards today, moving forward, looking at those teams down the line,
what next level can you all reach if she sets that tone and if she plays that
big like she played today?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: It's one game at a time. That's the one thing about this
right now is whoever we're going to face next weekend is our only concern.  
  
You know, I told them, "my bads" aren't cutting it right now. "My bads" are
what get you sent home. I was really excited because I think I only heard one
my bad from her and I'm used to hearing about ten. So she put her mind to it
and really went out there and did well.  
  
I told her in the locker room after the game, I told her, "I've got good news
and bad news, which one you want first?"  
  
She's like, "Well, I prefer the good."  
  
I said, "You were fantastic today. You've played as well as I've ever seen you
play."  
  
She said, "So what's the bad?"  
  
"The bad is I'm going to expect that. So now you've shown me what you can do,
so unfortunately for you, you have to keep doing it," and she got a good laugh
out of it. But it's true. She has really developed over her three years here.
She came from being an outside three-point shooter, which is all she did in
high school, to where she's finishing at the block and being more physical.
I'm really proud of her.  
  
Before I finish up, I'd like to thank Nora Lynn. Nora Lynn, thank you. I just
really appreciate what you've done for women's basketball for the ACC. You've
been remarkable, we are going to miss you. I know you can't say it but there's
no doubt I'm your favorite coach, so I'll say it for you, but thank you for
all that you've done, because I don't know where you'll be next weekend, but
thank you.  
  
Thank you, everybody.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville 71, Michigan 50  
  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: Louisville is a great basketball, that's for sure.
Playing them here just adds to it. What a tremendous crowd for a women's
basketball game on a Sunday morning at church time.  
  
So Asia Durr came out of the gates just really attacking us and we didn't
handle their pressure exceptionally well early on and by the time we settled
down we kind of dug ourselves a little bit of a hole.  
  
But I said to my team in the locker room, there probably aren't very many
teams, and I can probably count them on one hand if I can count all of them,
that can come into Louisville and play in this environment on their home court
and not lose by more than 20.  
  
So we have a really good basketball team. Our seniors, I'm just proud of them,
and we had a great run. Just going up against one of the top teams in the
country on their home court is tough, and Louisville was great tonight for
sure.  
  
Q. Do you guys feel like the crowd affected the way that the offense is
run?  
HALLIE THOME: I thought the crowd was outstanding. Definitely a fun place to
play in. We played here last year. Knew what we are with coming into. We
practiced yesterday with a speaker and a lot of loud noises. So yeah, the
crowd sometimes can feel a little shaken up. But I thought we did a great job
on handling it.  
  
AKIENREH JOHNSON: I think it personally affected me because we couldn't really
hear, like our defensive switch-up switches or offensive plays or things like
that. But that's why we practice in practice echoing, so if one person hears
something, then everyone else hears, so you echo it so we can get it through.  
  
Yeah, it was difficult but it was nothing we couldn't handle. We worked
through it all year long for moments like this. I think we were pretty well
prepared after we got our nervousness out the first couple minutes of the
game.  
  
Q. 19-4, did you feel they were trying to speed you up? Do you think
that's what they did to you then, but for most of the game?  
HALLIE THOME: For sure, I think definitely a big stat was in the beginning,
the first half, we had 17 turnovers. So kind of came out and pushed us into
doing things we didn't want to do and turned the ball over, but I think we did
a great job the second half coming out and handling that. Second half we only
had five turnovers total.  
  
That just stands for a lot, I think we got our confidence and knew what we
were going against, but I think in the beginning they definitely did speed us
up.  
  
AKIENREH JOHNSON: Yeah I most definitely think they sped up a lot. That was
their game plan. That's their game plan against most teams plays that -- they
like to take away the point guard. Most teams take away the point guard, it
messes up everything's offense, so I don't think they did anything different
against us.  
  
I think they played their normal game, but they definitely brought a lot of
intensity the first couple minutes of the game but we most definitely started
to adjust to the pressure.  
  
Q. With that being your final game for Michigan, what are you most proud
of over the course of your career?  
HALLIE THOME: I was waiting for that question, so I'm prepared.  
  
I think just the group of girls I got to finish it with. I think a lot of us
doubted us this year with losing Katelynn Flaherty, a person who scores so
much. But we proved so many people wrong.  
  
I think what I'm most excited about is to see this program continue to go on
the rise once I leave. I was just talking with Sara, I'm in a lot of -- No. 2
for scoring, rebounding blocks. But the best part is I know Naz Hillmon is
going to break all those and I'm waiting for her to break all those.  
  
I definitely want have traded it for the world to have gone through Michigan
and had my time here, but I'm excited to see them only get better and continue
to break the record.  
  
Q. Talk about the 17 turnovers, the max that y'all had all year was 25
and you had 17 at halftime. Obviously it was not the way you wanted to
start.  
HALLIE THOME: Yeah, that's obviously not how we wanted to start, but I think
-- all year we've had turnovers, but we've always found a way and we've always
stuck together, and I think that really shows the Michigan team that we are.  
  
All that matters this year is that we stuck together and when you're having
turnovers, instead of getting annoyed and mad at each other, stick together
and then you end up winning out games.  
  
I think an important stat, although the NCAA pointed it out and we were
annoyed with it: We average 16 every game, so it's not anything we're not used
to. So having turnovers sucks, but I think that's a credit to our team for
being able to stick together and win important games.  
  
AKIENREH JOHNSON: From a guard's perspective we talk about we get a lot of our
turnovers from trying to force passes, but the forced passes that we make, we
see those.  
  
So I think in practice, we try to practice making those passes like over-the-
top lob passes or dump-down passes or trying to get their person to pass
before their defender comes up.  
  
So yes, we have a lot of turnovers but we also have a lot of assists with
those turnovers. And we just do that because we are trying to find our
teammates the best look, and sometimes we try maybe one pass too many, and I
think that's one thing that we're going to really improve on for next year.  
  
Q. For AK, you came off the bench about five minutes left. You were down
19-4. You finished the first quarter down 19-11. How do you think the team was
able to respond to that run in such a hostile environment?  
AKIENREH JOHNSON: We already talked about our ability to come off the bench
and make an impact. A lot of times, we sit on the bench and if something isn't
really going our way, we talk like, okay, we're going to turn this around; or
okay, we are in the going to lose momentum, and we have doing that the whole
year.  
  
So all we do is talk about coming in doing our press, our 12 defense and
getting stops, getting rebounds, getting deflections and the offense will come
later. So I think that's one thing we really improved on and a lot of teams,
even this team, struggled with a little bit was getting through our press. I
think that's one of our strengths is our press and our defense for people that
come off the bench.  
  
Q. What some of the things you'll use from this one to get yourself
ready for next year?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, definitely. You know, we talked to our team in
the locker room, and especially on the women's side of things, your seed is
really important and we finished the year really strong and now we know how
important it is to get a higher seed so you're not playing a 1, it's really
tough to matchup against Louisville at Louisville early in the tournament.  
  
We know from their press, they speed us up. We have a freshman point guard and
we have a sophomore 2-guard, so those guys were handling most of that, and
they are going to improve on that. And I'm sure that they are going to try to
watch that film and learn from that experience so they are never in that
position again.  
  
Q. You talked about how you scheduled difficult road games deliberately
to try to help your team grow. How do you think this team is going to help
some of your younger players grow down the line?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, just what we talked about, the things that we
need to get better at, we need to be able to handle that pressure and handle
that environment from the start. I think we settled in and we handled it as
the game progressed.  
  
But you can't put yourself in a 19-4 hole against a No. 1 seed and try to
climb back from that. We had cut it to six, but it's not easy to climb back
from that deficit. So definitely a learning experience.  
  
I mean, we are losing some outstanding, outstanding seniors, outstanding
leadership. But our freshman, sophomores and juniors really contribute and
made an impact all season long. So we are excited about what the future of
Michigan women's basketball holds for sure.  
  
Q. Obviously you had known about Asia Durr coming in, but what about her
performance today impressed you from an opponent perspective?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I don't think we did a good job on her
initially, and she was able to get going, and when -- any time, you know, a
great player, any player, gets going early, you know you're in trouble because
once you get some open looks and you get them to fall, holy cow and I think
that happened with her.  
  
The bummer for us is they weren't off of initial offense. She got her first
couple threes off of offensive rebounds, and we were running to get a rebound
and they found her. I think they do a tremendous job of finding her and shared
basketball really well.  
  
She's a heck of a player. I mean, she's an All-American. But she also is the
kind of kid that let's the game come to her. She doesn't press too much but
her team did a great job of finding her and she's just an outstanding player
and did a tremendous job for them tonight.  
  
Q. In regard to the first half turnovers, how many of them did you think
Louisville was responsible for, and how many do you think you made some
mistakes that were unfortunate and uncharacteristic?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: It was definitely a combo. We knew they were going to
speed us up, but we practice against that every day. I just think we got --
and when you're a young kid and you make a couple mistakes, you have a
tendency, it's kind of like a young kid that makes their first two shots. They
usually make three, four, five. If you make a couple mistakes early, usually
make three, four, five.  
  
So it was just trying to settle down and get us to relax and just play
confidently, but you know, we talk about Amy Dilk. She's a freshman. This is
her first time in this kind of environment and they have great defenders and
some really, really quick kids. The same with Deja Church, first time in this
environment.  
  
So handle the ball; they took the ball out of Amy's hands early, and that made
us have to have somebody else handle the ball that is not accustomed to doing
it the entire game.  
  
So it was a combination, and I think when we got shook and rattled, it took us
a few minutes to get out of that.  
  
Q. Heading into next season with a lot of young players, what are you
most excited about?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I mean, I might have said this in the last
couple days in the press conference. We've just finished practice number 103,
and at most times when you're at practice 103, the horn ends to end practice
and the kids go scurry on their way and can't wait to get out of the gym, or
the coaches go home and can't wait to get home.  
  
And this is probably one of the first teams in my career that I have to throw
them out of the gym after practice 103, because they want to continue getting
shots up or they want to continue working or they want to get better.  
  
So they are hungry. They are hungry. They are driven. They are Michigan kids.
They want to be the best that they can be in the classroom, on the basketball
court. As a coach, there's nothing more you can ask for, and that's exciting
to be around every day. They are energy givers.  
  
When you have a freshman point guard like Amy Dilk coming back and you have a
freshman post player like Naz Hillmon coming back and they have the kind of
freshmen seasons that they did, that's reason to get excited. I mean, Kayla
Robbins, Akienreh Johnson, two juniors on our team that you guys had a chance
to see tonight, the sky's the limit for them. Hailey Brown, a Canadian kid who
can absolutely shoot the basketball.  
  
I mean, we have a lot of great pieces coming back and our kids know that they
are hungry to take those next steps in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Thank you, guys.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
COACH JEFF WALZ: You know, looking forward to a great ballgame tomorrow. Kim
does a fantastic job with that ballclub. I was fortunate enough to work with
Kim as assistants with USA Basketball, and you know, have the utmost respect
for her. We used to compete against each other when we were both in the BIG
EAST, so I'm fully aware that she will have that team ready to play, and I'm
expecting a great ballgame tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know you have some experience coaching Naz Hillmon. Can you talk
about what's impressed you about her game this season and going back to last
summer?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: Sure. Naz is a tireless worker. That's always what's
impressed me back when we watched her in high school. She's not the tallest
player, but she's got a huge heart. Her motor never stops, and that's what
impresses me. When she's on the floor, she gives it 100 percent every second
she's out there.  
  
You just look at what she's done this year, I mean, a remarkable freshman
year. Her efficiency, once she's in the game -- she's playing 22, 23 minutes
in the game scoring about 12, 13 points. When she's out there, she's getting
things done. She does not waste any movement or any effort, so it's really
impressive. I'm not surprised. She's a great kid, great family, so you know,
she has had a wonderful freshman year. I just hope tomorrow is not a very good
game for her.  
  
Q. I guess two questions. One, how soon were you back in the arena after
that game, and, in fact, how close, where were you for those that don't know,
for to you get back and scout?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: Well, I was just right across the street at the restaurant,
Sidebar. You know, went over there, got a bite to eat. Watched the game with
some friends. In some ways, I told my staff, it was actually -- I enjoyed it
in some ways because of the fact what you're out there coaching, you're always
trying to prepare for next play.  
  
When you call something and you're waiting to see if you execute, you don't
always watch your team. You're watching the opposing team to see how they are
guarding things, so you know, hey, if we run it again this might be adjustment
we have to make.  
  
So you don't always get a chance to watch your game as it's going on when
you're there because you're always preparing for the next thing to happen, the
next call to make. And yesterday, I was actually able to sit there and just
watched it and took some notes and really saw some things that if I was an
opposing coach, this is how I would try to attack us and this is what I would
try and do to stop us.  
  
After the ballgame, Lauren Rust, our sports supervisor here that's covering us
today, you know, she escorted me back in because you have to go sit in a
certain spot and all that good stuff. We got here for with about 25 minutes on
the clock for tip and I just watched the second game.  
  
Q. How much more whole do you all feel you're going to be tomorrow with
you back on the sideline and Arica, is she pretty good to go?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: Arica practiced today. She looked great. I think if you ask
my staff, they would tell me to go back to the Sidebar for tomorrow's game. I
mean, Steph's 1-0 and she just doesn't understand why this stuff is very hard,
you know, (laughter) so I'm not sure they want me there, and I'm not even
going to ask the players because I'm afraid I know what the answer there will
be.  
  
I mean, that's the one thing, when you have someone that's been on your staff
for 12 years, it's the same thing. You know, we think the same. We speak the
same. My delivery just might be a little different. But what we are trying to
get our kids to do is the same.  
  
So there was not a disruption of any type for our players and for our program
because we're fortunate enough to have a continuity within it that it doesn't
matter if I was there or not; they knew what was expected of them. For the
most part, I was really impressed with how they played.  
  
Q. One of the things you've been harping on this whole year is your
team's interior defense. Going up against Michigan and their length, how do
you plan to combat that?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: Well, it's going to be difficult. They have tremendous
interior play, but then -- but then they have got guards that can score, too.
They are well rounded. They aren't just one player. I'm really impressed with
their depth. I think everybody on the team knows their role, and then you take
pride in doing it.  
  
We're going to have to do multiple things. It's not going to be one, which
it's been like that all year. We're not always the biggest in the post, so we
have to mix some things up, throw some different looks at kids, and then make
sure we are on point with knowing scouting report.  
  
Q. One follow-up question about Sidebar. How was the milkshake?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: The milkshake was fantastic. It's their special, the mint
chocolate chip, right now. I highly recommend it. It's not low-cal, though, I
will say that.  
  
Q. Obviously you played Michigan last year. You watched them yesterday
in person. How different are they from the team that you saw last year in the
preseason WNIT?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: Well, Naz brings a completely different look just with what
she brings off the bench. You know, they are pressing more than they did last
year. They played a lot of zone when we played them here in the preseason NIT.
Playing majority man right now, but will mix it up at times.  
  
So some of the personnel is the same but the players have gotten better. You
know, it's the same thing with our kids. You give them a year to work on their
game and off-season to focus, and all of a sudden you start seeing
improvement.  
  
I'm not taking anything from last year's game, at all. We were down five at
the half, and then held them I think to ten or 12 points in the entire second
half. So we need to have that type of a defensive effort for four quarters,
but I'm not expecting, you know, us to hold them to 12 points at the half
tomorrow.  
  
Q. Back in the day at U of L, Scotty Davenport was the coach that made
sure the players were in the class at the right times, was the disciplinarian.
Was Scotty there to make sure you got to the right place?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: Scotty is a good friend of mine. I watch his games and he
comes and watches our. He just asked me what I was doing for the ballgame and
I told him I was going across the street to watch it, and he said, "I'll meet
you there."  
  
It was good, because we shared some basketball ideas. Talked ball. It's the
one great thing about it: Basketball is basketball. It truly does not matter
if you coach on the men's side, the women's side. It's basketball. So you can
share ideas and go back and forth.  
  
I really enjoyed it that he came over. We just sat here and watched the second
game for a little bit before he had to leave.  
  
Q. Sam said she feels like she's a tournament player. She couldn't
describe it but last year her numbers went up in the NCAA Tournament and
obviously yesterday, effort. What is it about her this time of year?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: Well, I hope she understands the urgency. You know, I told
them today, we watched -- we talked a little bit about the Tom Izzo press
conference and about "my bad." You can't have "my bads" at this time of the
year and he's exactly right. "My bads" are what finishes your season.  
  
I really think Sam understands that. She's out there, I thought she was very
efficient in the game yesterday, and that's what we're going to need from her
tomorrow. She's going to have a tough job with their post players, trying to
make sure she keeps them off the glass.  
  
She's by far our best defensive rebounder on the team and we're going to need
her to do a great job of defensive rebounding. I mean, I'm sure y'all saw the
rebounding advantage in yesterday's game. When you outrebound somebody 50-19,
it's not by accident, you know, so I was very impressed by that.  
  
Q. If you do have Arica back, what does that give you as a team?
Obviously more depth, but just her leadership?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: Well, Arica understands the game at the point guard spot.
She's not going to blow by you. I say it all the time, and it's a huge
complement to her: She's the ideal 50-and-over men's YMCA league player. She
is old school punk fake. Gets you in the air, one, two dribbles. When you
watch, it there's nothing that you're going, wow, wow. She just understands
the game. She knows how to play, and because of that she brings confidence to
our team.  
  
She's also a 40 percent three-point shooter. All of a sudden when I'm able to
put Dana on the floor, AC on the floor and Asia on the floor, all three of
those kids are shooting close to 40 percent from the three-point line, it
gives Sam a lot more room, Bionca room to work, and it givers those three,
when they drive, more space, because it's hard to collapse in.  
  
She practiced today and looked really good, so I was really happy for her. We
will not put her on the floor unless she's 100 percent confident that she
feels good, and that's all that's going to be said.  
  
I've told her, she has complete control over if she plays tomorrow. If the
doctor says she can -- it doesn't matter. If she's not 100 percent confident,
I will not put her on the floor. But she practiced well today and seems
excited, so we'll see how she feels tomorrow.  
  
Q. Did you see the starting lineup with Mykasa and Kylee? Did you have
any say in that, and thoughts afterwards?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: No, we had talked about it. You know, I put Mykasa in the
game. I started her just for the fact, that's what I should have done in the
ACC finals, just because of the fact, Dana brings so much to our team coming
off the bench. She changes our tempo. She's a scorer. She can shoot the ball.
She can create for others.  
  
When I started her in the ACC Championship game, well, then I don't have that
coming off the bench, and as a coach, it's nice to have someone that can give
you a scoring punch if needed.  
  
So that's one of those things when we found out about a half hour before the
tip of our Conference Championship game that AC wasn't going to play, it was
just, okay, just throw Dana out there.  
  
Since I've had time to think about it, I thought that was going to be the best
way to go, and then Bionca and Kylee, we're just trying to switch some things
up.  
  
They are all going to play. I keep telling them -- everybody wants to be a
starter because they get to do some crazy handshake. They go out there, do all
this stuff, jump up and down. I go -- at the end of the day I always ask them:
Do you want to start or be in the game at the end? That's the game you should
ask yourself. And you know, they all say, "I'd rather be in the game at the
end."  
  
So you've got to have mature players, though, that can accept that. That's
what I think has helped us get to where we are as a program is the fact that
we have players that they are okay doing their job no matter what their job
is.  
  
Q. You continue to get kind of the short end of the stick on game times.
The noon yesterday on a Friday, what did you think? I know you weren't here,
and then unfortunately another noon tip tomorrow. What do you expect from the
fans?  
COACH JEFF WALZ: I thought the crowd was great, what I could see from the TV.
I thought being a noon tip on a Friday, I was really, really pleased.  
  
And then tomorrow, it's a noon tip again. If you can skip communion at the end
and come on over, it would be great. Because that's the hard part, we do have
a lot of fans that are going to church on Sundays.  
  
We talk about it at our house. It's so hard for us to be able to go to church
on Sundays because we play, and if it's two o'clock game, it's right in the
middle of getting prepared to play, and you know, we have no control over the
game time, we have none. But it is frustrating some because I know if it was a
two o'clock tip, we'd probably have 8,000 in here and I think it looks good on
TV.  
  
I think it's important when people turn on the TV and all of a sudden you see
a women's basketball game with 8,000 people, you're like, hey, let's keep it
on. It's the casual viewer that I always talk about that we're trying to catch
in women's basketball, somebody that might not be, per se, a women's
basketball fan, but they have never really taken the time to really watch it.  
  
It's just like our fan base here. We've gone from about 2,500 12 years ago to
close to 10,000, and part of that is because we've really worked hard on
getting people who have never really been to women's basketball games to come
out and when they do, they are shocked. Some of them are like, I can't believe
how talented these young women are, and then I tell them, that's kind of the
way it's been for the past 20 years. You've just missed out.  
  
So it's one of those, I have no doubt that we'll have a great crowd tomorrow
and I'm just hoping it doesn't have much of an impact on what it could be.

LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

### [Naz Hillmon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36626)

### [Amy Dilk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36663)

### [Nicole Munger](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36662)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Q. For any of you. Can you guys just talk a little about like the
difficulties of the quick turnaround? Obviously a big win yesterday and now
you have to face Louisville tomorrow.  
THE MODERATOR: Nicole, Naz and then Amy.  
  
NICOLE MUNGER: I think the good part about it is we were well-prepared. Over
Thanksgiving, we got to go to Florida and had the opportunity to back-to-back-
to-back games which really prepared us, and then just last week we had the Big
Ten Tournament at Indianapolis where we played back-to-back.  
  
So I think our team is really used to the quick turnarounds, but kudos to our
coaches who do really, really thorough scouts who got us information after
last game so that we can study them last night and then heading into today's
practice ready to go.  
  
NAZ HILLMON: It is a tough turnaround playing against any team, but like
Nicole said just a little while ago we had prepared for this all year, going
to Florida and even the games after that it was a quick turnaround and the Big
Ten Tournament and prepared us for that.  
  
So I feel like throughout the year, coaches have definitely acted and getting
us to be able to just turn around and play the next game.  
  
AMY DILK: Yeah, just to add to them, too. With the quick turnaround it's as
much mental as it is physical so just focusing on scout and film and times
when preparing for each team is really important and we've done a great job of
buying into that.  
  
Q. How does it feel to be in an underdog role heading into tomorrow's
game?  
NICOLE MUNGER: I love it. Eagles won the Super Bowl Last last year. I'm a big
Eagles fan. Hungry dogs run faster.  
  
So I'm just really happy that we're in this position. We have a chance to wear
the Cinderella shoe. We can be Bracket Busters. It's a lot of fun.  
  
NAZ HILLMON: Like Munger just said, there's a lot of excitement going into
that but it's something that we're used to. There's been a lot of times, just
counting us out but we've been showing up and we're just going to keep our
heads on straight and focus on Michigan basketball on this next game.  
  
AMY DILK: I agree with both of them. Nothing is going to change with our way
of play. We've been playing the same all year, so we're going to continue to
do that.  
  
Q. After such an easy game yesterday, how much tougher does it get
against Louisville and I guess for the veterans, what do you remember about
the last time you faced them?  
NICOLE MUNGER: Well, I wouldn't say there's anything easy about yesterday's
game. NCAA Tournament and everybody here has proven that they belong here, so
it was nice to get out there and get a win, especially because we played
really, really well, 1 through 14. 1 through 14 got to step on the court which
really special.  
  
I am a veteran and from last year, I just remember that we were up five at
half, that we were hanging with them and we know that we can play with them.
They are definitely a very, very, very talented team but we are right there
with talent, too. Excited to get the opportunity again.  
  
NAZ HILLMON: Just piggybacking off that, by no means yesterday's game was
easy. We just bought into our game plan and really focused and worked on it.  
  
But I mean, this is the NCAA Tournament and nothing is going to come easy and
we're excited to be in this position. To be able to step on the court another
day is exciting. I wasn't part of the Louisville game last year, but I
remember watching a little bit and seeing the juniors and sophomores talk
about it a little bit to us. They definitely wish there was a different
outcome last year, but they will definitely keep that in the back of our
minds.  
  
Q. Naz, I know you have a little bit of experience playing for Coach
Walz, obviously with USA Basketball last summer. Could you just talk a little
about that experience and maybe your relationship with him?  
NAZ HILLMON: First of all, USA Basketball was a great experience. Definitely
helped me a lot moving into the college setting.  
  
Coach Walz is a great coach. Very enthusiastic and he's a great character, and
I mean that in the best way possible for sure, but he's very fiery and he
doesn't take any games for granted. You can see that in his coaching style
over the summer, but I know that he's going to have a game plan and push his
girls to the right position. We'll be ready for that.  
  
Q. You guys are obviously going to be playing in front of a crowd
tomorrow that's going to be predominately Louisville fans. Is that
intimidating you at all?  
NICOLE MUNGER: I don't think it's intimidating at all. We've put ourselves in
these situations all year long of being in different opposing crowds' venues,
and I think it makes it more fun, going in with the underdog mentality and
getting something done that's very special.  
  
NAZ HILLMON: Piggybacking off of that, we've been doing that all year. It's
exciting having a crowd of people wanting to watch women's basketball. That's
exciting. We know how a crowd can affect the game but we're going to try to
not worry about that so much and know that we have our Michigan section
somewhere in the crowd.  
  
AMY DILK: Yeah, just going off that, I think just minimizing the crowd noise
as much as possible and just focusing on what is going on out on the court and
listening to our bench, as well.  
  
Q. For Nicole, as a whole, what do you see from Louisville that you
really have to stop the most? Is it speed? Is it just the defense? Do you
really have to try to beat the pressing defense?  
NICOLE MUNGER: Well, first and foremost I think they are really, really fast
and they use their speed to their advantage really well. They like to get
advantages on the offensive end by drawing two, and once they draw two, they
are really good at making the extra pass, finding the shooters or finding
their bigs for easy twos.  
  
They also do a really, really good job in transition. Like going back to their
speed, when they go in transition, even if they don't make their first shot,
since they are going so fast, their rebounder is able to get right on the
glass and crash, and that's where they get a lot of their second-chance
opportunities.  
  
So I think it's going to be really crucial for us to slow them down, but also
to put bodies on them and block them out. And then on the offensive end, if we
have the same turnovers as we did yesterday, we are not going to be very
successful.  
  
So just taking care of the ball. Just staying within ourselves and just being
poised but I think we are ready to do it.  
  
Q. The team really hit its stride in February when you went 7-1. What do
you think clicked on that run to help you guys make that final push for the
Tournament?  
NAZ HILLMON: I think that not to say that we weren't buying in the entire year
but in February we really bought in and locked in when we really started to
figure out each other and our game plan each and every day. We just really
stuck to Michigan Basketball. Of course we focused on our opponent, but we
really tried to make sure that we were making ourselves better that month.  
  
I just think, going off things we've said in the past, we just had a lot of
fun in that month and we were taking things serious, but taking it one step at
a time and just letting the game come to us during that month.  
  
AMY DILK: I agree with everything that Naz said. Also the Big Ten Tournament
is super competitive, obviously, so the month of February, I think we found
how to close games out as much as like starting the jump on them early as
possible.  
  
So I think, yeah, just coming together as a team in the fourth quarter and
closing the game out.  
  
Q. You got to the starting point guard role right out of camp and began
the year in that position. What have you learned the most about that job, and
how do you feel like your first season has gone handling the responsibility of
being the distributor for this team, even as a freshman?  
AMY DILK: I think over the course of the year, I've learned a lot obviously,
mentally and physically, growing as a player.  
  
The main thing is just not to take any possessions off. I've learned more
about my team over the course of the year. I think each rep helps, obviously,
in practice, whether that's in practice or games, or getting outside work,
like shots off with Coach. Just continuing to build as a player mentally and
physically has been the biggest thing I've learned.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Sam Duehring](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37060)

### [Asia Durr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30724)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Q. When you look back on yesterday, what was the biggest take away from
that game that you all feel good about going into this one?  
ASIA DURR: Our defense was great, especially starting off in the first
quarter. I think we held them to four points, I'm not sure for how long, but
that was a good stretch where we played great D.  
  
We need to carry that over because they have a great team with great posts and
guards. That's going to be a challenge for us, and we have to look forward to
that.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: We also tried to box out more because we know that Michigan is
going to give us a hard time on the glass.  
  
Q. What stands out most about Michigan when you look at them on film,
anything that you guys really need to key in on?  
ASIA DURR: I think it's just like how long they are and how hard they play.
They play so hard and for the whole game, and also, their posts. They are big
and they play hard. They play strong, and when they get two feet in the paint,
it's almost like they are going to make it every single time.  
  
So that really stood out to us, how their posts play. There's not too many
posts that are that big that can score like that. That's going to be another
challenge for us, and we have to be focused for that.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, they work hard and they are very aggressive. They push the
ball, and their transition is really good, getting it inside to the post.  
  
Q. Both of you had your send-offs a couple weeks ago. I guess you all
stuck around for probably at least 40 minutes after the game with fans. Now
that you're coming to your real, final home game, does it kind of sink in,
what everything has meant to you being here? Is there any kind of emotion that
you might anticipate going into that game?  
ASIA DURR: I mean, yeah, somewhat we think about, yeah, this is our last game
but we don't want it to be our last game for the whole year.  
  
We'd rather suck that up and play so we can continue to play throughout the
whole year. That's our main focus right now. We can't really weep on our last
home game here. We have a long journey in front of us, so that's what we're
focusing on.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, it's going to be sad, but we're going to put our hearts
out on the floor, being that it's our last home game, and I'm pretty sure the
fans are going to follow us wherever we go if we do win the next game, so
that's what's great about them.  
  
Q. Is there anything that you can look on with the last meeting against
Michigan that you can kind of carry over and think, or has it just been so far
that both of you have come different directions since then?  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, we started off really slow the last time we played them. We
didn't play like us. We played down to them; meaning, we chased them around
instead of having them chase us.  
  
Yeah, we just really started off slow. We didn't know where the scorers were.
We let the ball get inside. We weren't playing hard, as well, so that's
another challenge for us that we have to take care of if we want to win.  
  
Q. Sam, anything to add?  
SAM FUEHRING: I honestly don't remember.  
  
Q. Your numbers have been good all year. Last year when you got to the
NCAA Tournament, your numbers took a boost and then yesterday, your play. Is
it just something about the postseason with you or a little extra emphasis?  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, I don't know. It feels like I'm a tournament player. I
don't know why honestly. I just always play well in tournaments. I have no
answer for that. Sorry.  
  
Q. For both of you, what has been the difference with Arica out of the
lineup, and if you do get her back, what does she bring to this lineup and add
to the team?  
ASIA DURR: She's a great point guard. She knows the game well. She knows how
to make the right reads, especially having that experience and knowledge.
That's huge for us, especially her being our point guard. We need a point
guard who can lead the team and knows what took place on the floor, and she's
great at doing those things.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, she's a leader on the floor, telling people where to go,
what to do pretty much, bringing us together in huddles. Dana does similar
stuff. Mykasa, too. But AC just has experience and she's watched it, being
that she sat out last year.  
  
ASIA DURR: Two years.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Two years ago, being that she sat out. But yeah, she has
experience and knowledge of it the game.  
  
Q. What did Coach Walz say to you when he came back about yesterday's
game?  
ASIA DURR: Just playing hard for the whole game, tempo. That's just been the
biggest two things.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: I probably wasn't even listening to him honestly (laughter).  
  
Q. Even though you tuned him out today, was it at all strange not to
hear his voice or his comments during the game yesterday?  
SAM FUEHRING: It felt good not to hear him (laughing). Yeah, just to get a
different feel for another coach, it was a little weird, but something we
overcame.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Kim Barnes Arico](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24309)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: We are excited to be playing basketball for another
couple days for sure. We have a great group of seniors and they don't want
their season to end and we want to try to advance as far as we can. We know
that we have an incredibly difficult challenge ahead of us. Louisville is a
great basketball program. They have great players. They have great coaches and
they have great fans. I know the environment will be really exciting here
tomorrow.  
  
I think it was Naz that said before, it's great for women's basketball. So our
kids will be excited about the opportunity to play in this environment and
excited for the opportunity to play one of the best teams in the country in
Louisville.  
  
Q. You guys are obviously going to be a huge underdog tomorrow. What's
the feeling like in the locker room right now? How would you describe it?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I think the kids are excited to play. We really
challenged ourselves in the non-conference schedule, as well as in our
conference, to play against the best opponents and to put ourselves on the
road as much as we possibly could.  
  
So you know, earlier in the season, we played Missouri. We played Texas. We
played Washington. We played N.C. State, all away from our home court. We
played at Marquette. So we really challenged ourselves in our non-conference.  
  
And then in our conference, we had an opportunity to beat Iowa. We beat
Rutgers. We played Maryland to a one-point game.  
  
We've tested ourselves against the best teams in the country in hopes for an
opportunity like we're going to have tomorrow. And I think our kids, you know,
they know they are the underdogs, but they have a belief in themselves and
they have a belief in their teammates that they can achieve something that
probably 99 percent of the world thinks that they can't.  
  
So they are excited about this opportunity, and I think they just have a lot
of enthusiasm and really excited to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. A little different than yesterday's game because this is a team that
you played last year on this floor in the preseason WNIT. How much did that
help with the preparation and the short turnaround? And also, you know Coach
Walz a little bit from time with USA Basketball. So just talk about your
relationship with him, if you could.  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, the quick turnaround, I think it definitely
helps. I think it gives our kids at least, you know, hey, we've played against
them, they are not invincible. We hung around for a period of time. We've got
to get better at some things, but they have already seen Asia Durr live. They
have seen their team live, and I think that definitely helps.  
  
They are a team loaded with talent and she obviously leads the way. Really a
special, special player, but they have a lot of special players in their
program.  
  
So we are a little bit familiar. Plus you get the opportunity to see them on
TV a lot. We've had the opportunity to watch them a ton.  
  
I've known Jeff for a really long time. Actually we were in the BIG EAST
together. So when I was at St. John's, you know, he first got the job here at
Louisville and I had already been at St. John's. So we've played against each
other for a number, a number of years, and then we had an opportunity to coach
together with USA Basketball.  
  
He's one of the best in the business and I think that he's proven that in his
time at Louisville. He has done a tremendous job on the recruiting front. He's
done a tremendous job raising this program to a consistent national contender
year-in and year-out.  
  
He's a really good coach and they are a really good program, and like I said,
you know, that's what we're aspiring to be, and we talked about it a lot this
week, how to build that and how to get there, and we want our kids to have the
opportunity to see tomorrow, okay, this is -- test ourselves against the best,
and this is a chance for us to test ourselves against the best, and if we come
out on the winning end, okay, that's great, and if we don't, now we know, hey,
between tomorrow and next year, these are the things that we need to do to be
a better seed and a top seed in the country.  
  
Q. You lost Katelynn Flaherty in the preseason and a lot of people
counted you out. What changes have you seen to the way the team's run and been
able to succeed without her there?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I mean, Katelynn Flaherty is kind of a once-in-
a-lifetime player. She just impacted our program so much. I mean, leading
scorer, man or woman, all-time leading scorer, over 2,700 points and I think
for the rest of the country, we finished the year strong. We lost to Baylor in
the NCAA Tournament, and we didn't receive a ton of national recognition
through the course of the season this year.  
  
But I think what spoke volumes to our team was our league really -- our league
voted us in the preseason to be one of the top leagues in our league. I think
our league had a tremendous amount of respect for the players that were
returning in our program, such as Hallie Thome and Nicole Munger and Deja
Church and Hailey Brown, because with the loss of Katelynn and Jillian, I'm
sure there were many people: How is Michigan going to survive this and where
is Michigan going to go at this point.  
  
But the rest of the team really rallied. Our freshman class has made a
tremendous impact but I think the players that came back really committed
themselves to improving and really wanted to show that you're a program and we
are building a program and not just a one-year team; and without Katelynn,
we're going to be okay and we're going to be able to still be a really
successful team, and we've proven to be able to do that.  
  
Q. One thing that Coach Walz has said about his team this year that he's
hammered home that they struggle with their interior defense. With your
advantage, do you think that's something you're going to look to exploit?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: I think we definitely need to take advantage of that,
and that was kind of a theme of ours yesterday, as well, going into the game
yesterday. We have a tremendous post -- tremendous post play and we have four
that complement each other so well, and it's such a diverse group.  
  
I think we can hit teams from all different angles. I mean, coming into the
year we now Hallie Thome, a 2000-point scorer, just has had -- a three-time
first-team all-conference player has had a tremendous career for us.  
  
But Hallie Brown, a kid that plays for the Canadian National team, a kid
that's a stretch four can face-up and knock down threes but can take you
inside; we knew she was coming off an injury last year. She didn't get to play
in the NCAA Tournament. She was going to have a great season for us.  
  
Then you add a Kayla Robbins, who is a junior for us, and just is so explosive
and has incredible balance and incredible motors with the basketball and
really can affect the game with her length and her ability to offensive
rebound.  
  
And then you get a freshman like Naz Hillmon, Big Ten Freshman of the Year,
Big Ten Six Player of the Year, had an immediate, immediate impact for us.  
  
That package of four is really hard for other teams to guard. When other
teams, one and two are getting tired, or when Hallie and Hailey are getting
tired, we bring in Kayla and Naz. Our team doesn't miss a beat and we are able
to continue and take it to another level.  
  
That's really been an effective thing for us all season long, and I know
that's something tomorrow that we've got to look to take advantage of, and I'm
sure Coach Walz is preparing to stop that.  
  
But we need to make sure that we are getting our post touches and we need to
make sure that our posts are trying to get some second-chance opportunities,
which they did a tremendous job of yesterday.  
  
Q. In all likelihood the crowd tomorrow is going to be Louisville fans.
Is that something you're a little bit concerned about?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, we had a nice crew yesterday. It's nice that the
game is drivable and our managers, our practice players, our families, our
friends -- I mean, we had a decent crowd yesterday travel, but it's not going
to be a Louisville crowd.  
  
I think one of the things I touched on earlier is we did go to Marquette and
we did go to N.C. State and we tried to put ourselves in positions. We've
played at Iowa and we've played at Maryland where we were going to be some
situations where the crowd was going to be against us and we weren't really
going to be able to hear our play calls, and we worked on some noise things
during the course of the season.  
  
So we know that it won't be easy. We know that it will be challenging playing
on Louisville's home court and we know that the crowd will be for them. But
it's still just tremendous to have a great crowd for a women's basketball
game.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville 69, Robert Morris 34  
  
ASSOCIATE HEAD COACH STEPHANIE NORMAN: Awesome. I want to start off first by
congratulating Robert Morris on an amazing run for them, their team, their
conference. They are extremely well-coached and have some really talented
players. I think it was a pretty remarkable season for them and they should be
very proud of what they were able to do.  
  
Our team was really, really good on defense tonight. We had a game plan put
together and they executed it. I thought we got good and valuable minutes from
a lot of people. Our playing time was equally distributed amongst several of
our players.  
  
Once Coach Walz gets here, he's probably going to be not very happy with our
turnovers tonight. We typically are a team that gets eight to ten turnovers.
So we'll have to clean that up.  
  
But beside that, I thought it was a great experience for our young kids to get
involved early. I thought the crowd was phenomenal and I'm just extremely
appreciative that my family was here with me today. Gets to come back here and
they miss school. I sort of got them out of school. It was just a really fun
experience for me, and that's what Coach Walz's the last words he told me
before he left us this morning at pregame is "no matter what, to have fun."  
  
I just really tried to keep that in mind and really tried to be relaxed. I was
very confident. I was not nervous. I just was excited for our players. And
when you have a great team and a great cast and an ensemble, it's very easy to
be confident and not nervous or scared. It's something I've been coaching for
25 years.  
  
I feel very well equipped for something like this, but it will be nice to have
our Commander-in-Chief back on Sunday.  
  
Q. For any of the players. Describe playing in a tournament game like
this, without Jeff Walz on the sideline? More pressure? Less pressure?  
THE MODERATOR: Asia first, and then Dana and then Sam.  
  
ASIA DURR: There's no pressure at all. Obviously he's our coach, but we have
to coach ourselves playing. So we have to play as a team. We can't just count
on Coach Walz trying to coach us through the game.  
  
So I think we did a great job playing as a team and just playing hard. We
can't just leave everything up to the coaches. We have to take our role, too.  
  
DANA EVANS: I think we have a great coaching staff, from Coach Norman, Coach
Purcell, Coach Williams, and we just trust in the coaches and know they are
going to put a game plan together for us and it's just a matter of us
executing it.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: To go along with what they said, I feel like, yeah, Coach Walz
is our head coach, but Norman, Purcell, Williams, they can all be a head
coach, too. They work so hard and stuff. So I mean, it was no pressure at all.  
  
Q. In 22 minutes, you go 9 for-9, you get your only three. You get a
double-double. You how does the ankle feel?  
SAM FUEHRING: Great. It really does. I kind of felt it in the third quarter, I
don't know how, but I kind of just shook it off and kept playing.  
  
Q. I asked their players if your all's height bothered them. You all
were quite much bigger in most positions, all but maybe one that they matched
up. Did you think you intimidated a little bit with your height? The first
quarter I think you all blocked at least three or four shots within a two- to
three-minute stretch?  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, height, it kind of has an effect on people, but it doesn't
really matter as long as you're going hard. Yeah, there were blocked shots,
but that's because we were in the position to block the shots. But other than
that, I mean, height doesn't really matter when it comes to going hard.  
  
Q. I guess for each player, you hold them to a very, very low percentage
in shooting here and they end up, your defense was outstanding. What were you
seeing out there to shut them down so effectively? Start with Dana and work
around.  
DANA EVANS: I think the coach has been emphasizing defense a lot because we
have to rely on it to win games. You're not always going to make shots but you
can always defend. I think us focusing on defense and rebounding was key, too,
so not letting them get second-chance points. I think our defense was a lot
better. I think our transition could be better but defense was a lot better
this game.  
  
ASIA DURR: Dana hit that right on the jackpot. That was great. Our defense was
really good today. We pressured them. They didn't really like the pressure. I
was very proud of my team. We got, you know, we got stops, and then we got
that board.  
  
So that was very, very, very important, especially going back to our
conference game against Notre Dame. So I think we made that next step, and I'm
very proud of them.  
  
Q. I know it was already asked but Sam, how does it feel knowing coming
off an injury, you had the kind of game that you had?  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, I'm -- coming off an injury, I don't think sophomore year
I had an injury, but it's just ex-kiting to come back because like leaving
your team, it's not a good feeling. You always want the best for them and
that's something that I've wanted, and I sat out like a week trying to get
better as best as I could.  
  
It's not fun, especially when you want to play the game that you love, and I
know -- I was telling myself, all I wanted to get was rebounds. Like I can't
wait to come back and get rebounds. Yeah, I mean, my trainer helped me to get
healthy real fast.  
  
Q. Starting roster had Mykasa in it. How soon did you decide that? Did
you decide that on your own?  
ASSOCIATE HEAD COACH STEPHANIE NORMAN: That would be no. I don't do anything
without the approval of my boss. We had talked about it. We got -- when it
happened against Notre Dame, it was like a game-time decision, so we really
weren't prepared to think about it as much as we did having this whole week
off.  
  
Dana's role has been so great coming off the bench that we thought it would be
better to do this and keep her accustomed to what she's doing and her
strengths and change the tempo when she comes in and the dynamic of our team.
So we thought off, you know, some deliberation, that this would be the best
thing for our team is to start Mykasa.  
  
Q. What was Jeff's last words to you before --  
ASSOCIATE HEAD COACH STEPHANIE NORMAN: "Have fun."  
  
Q. \-- before he walked across the street?  
ASSOCIATE HEAD COACH STEPHANIE NORMAN: "Have fun." That's what he told me.
Those of you who have all had a chance to get to know him over the years, and
he's an amazing coach to work for because he gives us so much freedom. He
really instills ownership in this program.  
  
So whether you're the first assistant, the last assistant, the manager, the
guy who sweeps, our practice players, we all have an opportunity to be
impactful in our program because he let's us.  
  
To have someone like that as your boss really instills a lot of confidence and
pride, and so he -- he kept like making it really easy -- well, he jokingly
put pressure on but now the pressure's on him. So I did my job.  
  
So he was giving me crap the whole week about, you know, a lot of different
things, and really keeping it light. And so the last thing he said is just
make sure you have fun, don't worry about anything else. Just have fun.  
  
So I appreciated that because I mean, if you think about it, even though I
have a ton of experience, your first coaching is a do-or-die situation. It's a
one-and-done situation. It's not like even though I had the opportunity to do
it against UT Martin, it wasn't like if we lost that we're done with the
season.  
  
So this is a different animal to have to deal with to be thrown into the fire
your first time. But he made that transition really easy and really set me up
for success.  
  
Q. Do you think Coach Walz was having fun across the street? What do you
think was going through his mind as he was watching this game on television?  
ASSOCIATE HEAD COACH STEPHANIE NORMAN: You know, he's a really positive
person. So I would imagine he's having fun. And then he was probably cussing
at the TV a few times, but no, he saw how hard our kids played. I think he
would be proud if he was in here, I really do.  
  
You know, he's the patriarch of this program and I'm just really proud to be
his understudy and I hope that he was really proud of our coaching staff,
because although I'm sitting up here, there's two other assistant coaches who
do a phenomenal jobs and we really collectively talked about -- we got
together last night at the hotel and talked about how we were going to coach
together, what each person's responsibility was going to be and that this was
going to take a village.  
  
So I would give as much credit to them as I would to Coach Walz, but they did
a great job of keeping me confident, too, as we were going into this.  
  
Q. With Sam coming back from injury, did you expect her to have this
performance right after rehab?  
ASSOCIATE HEAD COACH STEPHANIE NORMAN: I wouldn't expect anybody, not only
Sam. She literally practiced not even a full -- I think she practiced a full
practice, but she had limited reps, so really one practice, and it was quite a
long time since our Notre Dame game.  
  
You know, there's always an element of doubt in you when you're coming back
from an injury, especially a sprain of some sort. You know, am I going to step
wrong or do something.  
  
She just played so aggressively. I was just really proud of her, because
that's not an easy thing to do to really press yourself to get back as soon as
you can. I mean, ideally, we would love to have another three or four days for
her but she gutted it out and it was just a tremendous effort, and especially
the rebounding part. I know she had 19 I think tonight. It was perfect from
the field.  
  
But it's really the rebounds, because this team is a really good rebounding
team, and she just brings that confidence to our group because she's always in
there doing the dirty stuff and cleaning things up for people.  
  
So I was just -- I couldn't be more happy and proud of her to be able to come
back off that injury in the first game back, have a performance like that.  
  
Q. Obviously we don't know who Sunday's game will be, but preparations
for that?  
ASSOCIATE HEAD COACH STEPHANIE NORMAN: So I had to pull double duty, so I not
only had this scout, which was a cumulative effort between all of us, but I
had to know what was going on. So it's not typical that assistant coach would
do back-to-back scouts but myself, I have Michigan and then Coach Purcell has
Kansas State.  
  
So we were kind of pulling double-duty here a little bit here. That's
typically how we do it throughout the year. Each one of us assistants, and it
would be a different assistant would have a certain team. So I'm very familiar
with Michigan. I couldn't tell you anything except Kansas State runs a 1-3-1
because Purcell told me that but I have not taken a peek at them, so I'm
anxious to go out and watch them.  
  
This is going to be a great game. These are two really, really about teams.
This is this your at this point 8-9 game in the past, and I think that's
indicative of women's basketball this year. It's been extremely competitive,
extremely balanced and the parity is phenomenal.  
  
So it makes for a great fan experience. This game on Sunday is going to be
really, really tough no matter who it is. So I'm not necessarily looking
forward to it but we will up to the challenge at that time because these two
teams are much better -- well, I mean, they are 8 and 9s. There's a reason
they are 8-9, but they are really good 8-9s.  
  
I know everybody says like our bracket is loaded but we've really tried to
emphasize to our players, we're just going to play the next team on our line
and not worry about everybody else in there, and then we'll approach each game
with the same businesslike approach that we do with all of our teams.

LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 22, 2019

### [Christianna Carr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37023)

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Michigan 84, Kansas State 54  
  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: Congratulations to Michigan. They played very well. I
thought they played very well. They did a great job on our top two scorers and
made us go to third and fourth things, and thought that we struggled with that
most of the day. Most of our plays were individual plays. Really struggled to
play in sync with each other and I think that's a credit to Michigan's defense
and then they just whooped us on the glass for second and third chances, which
was a problem, but not very competitive for us on the glass today.  
  
Q. Your three-point shooting brought the team pretty close.  
CHRISTIANNA CARR: Honestly, being a shooter, you want to be able to find the
best shots possible within our offense, and you know, we kind of noticed that
things weren't really working inside. As they knew that we were forcing the
ball inside, forcing the ball inside, it opened up three point shots as well.
What Rachel and I told each other before every single game, get your feet set,
get ready to shoot the ball and take open shoots. I feel like we did what we
usually do and we just take our open shots whenever KG passes it to us and
that's kind of what helped us out there.  
  
Q. To either of the players, but how did Michigan's press early in the
first half, or late in the first half, kind of help them extend their lead and
kind of cripple you guys offensively?  
RACHEL RANKE: Just put on a lot of pressure that we couldn't handle at the
time. We weren't taking care of the ball very well. We were making careless
plays and we weren't running press plays correctly throughout the last 30
games we've played. They just sped us up, and we just did not handle it very
well at the time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for the ladies?  
  
Q. Seems as though they used their height advantage quite well. Would
both players talk about that and how difficult their height advantage was to
them in allowing them to kind of do what they wanted to in the paint,
especially later on?  
RACHEL RANKE: Well, we've played against pretty big teams, you know, having
Baylor in our conference. So we've been used to playing against height. I
think what we struggled with was we left a lot of plays on the floor. We
didn't finish defensive plays. We gave them a lot of second chances on boards.  
  
Just not getting underneath and getting aggressive enough under there was a
big problem for us.  
  
CHRISTIANNA CARR: What Rachel said. We don't struggle with height adds much
because we played in the Big 12 and we face a lot of Kalani Brown, Lauren Cox,
girls like that.  
  
But one thing that killed us today that I didn't feel like we had was a
tenacity to go after the ball and they got a lot of second chances on us which
really did kill us in the second quarter going into the second half.  
  
Honestly, I don't think it was their height. It was just we lost the will to
get the ball more than them, and so I think that ended up going into a lead
and we kind of lost it from there.  
  
Q. You're both underclassmen. How take this experience and grow from it
in the future?  
RACHEL RANKE: It was fun. I had not been to the NCAA Tournament yet. It was an
expectation for us this year but like Coach said, getting to the NCAA is cool
and all, but you want to advance. Losing the first round is tough and it's
hard. I'm definitely going to remember this all off-season and all next year.
You know, it's going to be the same goal. Same goal next season. We want to
get back to the NCAA Tournament, but we want to advance.  
  
CHRISTIANNA CARR: Going off what Rachel said, last year, coming to K-State and
going into our work outs in the summer, they kind of drilled that mindset into
us not only as a freshmen but new players, as well; that they didn't like the
way that they finished last year and that we were going to attack this year
with everything that we got.  
  
Honestly, I feel like now that we kind of have been through, we got a taste of
what it's like. We didn't get the best taste of it, getting a loss today but
now we'll be able to drill into our new players this summer and kind of set
that mindset and that tone of how we're going to attack this year so we can
not only get to here but advance and keep advancing and keep advancing.  
  
Honestly I just think it's going to start in the summer and we're going to get
back to work, and that's the only thing you can do is just focus on what's
ahead and get back in the gym.  
  
Q. What did you think of the way Michigan was able to take control of
the paint?  
COACH JEFF MITTIE: I thought they owned the blocks. This was a horrific
performance by us down low. There's no way to sugarcoat this: We did not play
very well. We were not physical enough. We were not committed enough to what
we talked about.  
  
You know, Michigan comes in, they don't make a whole lot of threes and it
appeared we were flying at people as if they were really good 3-point shooting
team and we're supposed to be what we call, squeezing the post and getting
extra help around there, not only for the first attempt, but for the offensive
rebound, and just a really poor job of getting that done.  
  
I did think early, we were pretty scattered. We were a little -- if anything
the press did, it might have got us out of sorts, not just with the turnovers,
but also just in our discipline to do what we needed to do at the defensive
end of the floor.  
  
Because, as they mentioned, we were not very sharp and in sync, and we were on
press break every day. It's not something that we do only when we play a
pressing team. We do it ten minutes every day. We play a pressing team, we do
it maybe 45 minutes in terms of attacking. But we certainly got out of sorts
in that stretch and struggled.  
  
You mentioned the threes. The threes that they made to get us back in it in
the second quarter were really just individual plays. There wasn't a whole lot
of team plays to get those threes, so they really stepped up big in that
stretch but ultimately we needed to play better as a team and we just never
did.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

### [Charlie Buscaglia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36952)

### [Nneka Ezeigbo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36964)

### [Natalie Villaflor](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37008)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Louisville 69, Robert Morris 34  
  
COACH CHARLIE BUSCAGLIA: Very proud of my team. We didn't get off to the best
start when it came to finishing and knocking some shots down, you know, we
make a lot of the time. I think the arena today saw how a team could continue
to fight and continue to work hard, stay together, even when things get tough
and continue to defend and just keep going to that next play, is what we've
always been teaching.  
  
You know, I'm very proud of them for that, and just to continue to go on and
to finish the game. I thought we really finished the game, even though the
ball didn't go in, there was no lack of effort or no putting our head down,
even though going against Louisville, with how tough they are, these guys,
they didn't back down and they kept going. I'm very proud of the effort today.  
  
Q. Did their height, did that intimidate you a little bit? It seems like
the first couple of minutes of the game, they blocked a couple of shots and
some of your players maybe got a little bit intimidated about that. Was that
the case?  
NNEKA EZEIGBO: Speaking for myself, I didn't think the height intimidated us.
I think that it was mostly coming out and being ready to be -- to stay at our
pace. For our new players, it might have kind of shaken them a little bit, but
as time went on, I told them to kind of try to brush it off and just try to
play their game and try to get their own pace going.  
  
Q. Nneka, you went for nine and nine today. Did you ever play against
Sam in high school at all back in the days?  
NNEKA EZEIGBO: No. I didn't know who she was before I came here. She was new
to me.  
  
Q. What's it like having such a big game for you on the big stage in
college basketball?  
NATALIE VILLAFLOR: I feel like it was a good experience coming in and
honestly, we talked a lot about having no fear and faith in our team. So just
coming in and trying to emulate that and doing whatever my team needed me to
do, that was the focus. So I'm just really proud of our team and the effort we
gave today.  
  
Q. Once a game gets out of hand like that? What are you thinking about
as the game goes along, and kind of explain that. I know it was 57-13 at
halftime and you all played a lot better in the second half.  
NATALIE VILLAFLOR: During halftime, Coach was telling us, like we need to stay
on the path and he's always telling us there's a light at the end of the path.
Just focusing on that and playing our game and relying on our team to continue
to push each other. I think that really allowed us to stay focused and finish
out the game strong.  
  
Q. For both of you guys. As a whole, this it was a really great season
for you guys. You started off 3-al conference and came back and went 16-2 in
the conference, avenged last year's conference championship loss. What's the
biggest takeaways from this season?  
NNEKA EZEIGBO: Just finding our own pace and keeping our own strength and
trying to utilize them. We have a lot of confidence in our players and each
one of each other, so a lot of it was instilled from trust and confidence. So
being able to work with a bunch of girls that you really do trust and are
considered your family, and just growing off of that and being able to play
really hard for each other.  
  
NATALIE VILLAFLOR: I think just learning that the start and the end of the
game are both extremely important. Early in the season, we struggled to stay
consistent, and I feel like throughout the season, that's something we really
improved on.  
  
Q. When you go back and look at this and talk to your team in the off-
season, what are some of the teaching points?  
COACH CHARLIE BUSCAGLIA: I think one of the questions earlier about the length
and the disrupting, some of the things that we're doing, I think it's a
motivation to continue to get in the gym and improve your pace and your
explosiveness. You know, you don't see this every day at the mid-major level.
You don't see this kind of length and athleticism like with Fuerhing and
Dunham. They are long and they are athletic.  
  
So they kind of juked our pace when we got into though gaps as we were
punching into the elbow area that we live off a lot in our offense. It
disrupted our timing a lot and you see at the end of the game, Esther hit a
nice pull-up going right down the alley, and that was kind of a look into just
continuing to go after it and use these clips as a way to motivate, to get in
the gym and work harder and get more out of yourself.  
  
We played Iowa this year at Iowa and they had a great post player and they
were tough. We were down four in the fourth quarter with a few moments to go.
That was a great moment for us, playing against a team that obviously has an
opportunity to go deep into the Tournament, and we learned a lot from that.
What we were talking about up here with student athletes, that they were
talking about, a lot of what they are saying is an extension of myself.  
  
You can see they are quoting me and talking about the things we talk about
every day. But no matter if we won a game this year or lost a game; like we
lost this game, we come back the same way. We get in the video room the same
way. We don't live on highs and lows, and so we won't go crazy over this and
really question ourselves.  
  
We'll just motivate ourselves to work harder. Keep faith strong in our heart.  
  
Q. One of the big conversations coming into this game, how young this
team is, 70 percent underclassmen. How do you feel those underclassmen handled
this stage?  
COACH CHARLIE BUSCAGLIA: They were great. You know, not always they hit the
shot they wanted. Like Esther, she was a big reason why we won the conference
championship. She really lit it up and she was very confident. Today she was
1-for-11, but her effort was outstanding. She had one turnover today and
played 26 minutes as a freshman. That's pretty amazing.  
  
We turned the ball over 15 times this athleticism and this length; that's
amazing for a freshman, as many as we have out there to be able to do that.  
  
A lot of times we get caught up in the field goals and we look at the field
goal percentage and we say, well, they shot well, they played well. Well what
about, we're giving up lay-ups or we aren't defending well. Those guys were
out there and learned so much defensively this year, and with the
underclassmen team like we have, we were ranked like 11th in the nation in
defense.  
  
Think about that with freshman and sophomores out there learning how to guard,
and then we have to guard on this stage. I really am proud of them for the
effort and the defensive effort they had, even with the mistakes coming back
the next play, I thought showed a lot of mental toughness for a young team.  
  
Q. Between you and your father, you've definitely made Robert Morris a
consistent presence in the northeast conference and pursuant to the last
question, what are your plans for the program moving forward?  
COACH CHARLIE BUSCAGLIA: You build a program by bringing in student athletes
that will create stability and work hard, at least that's the way that myself
and my father, you know, really believe in how to do this.  
  
You know, going forward, we'll season to recruit student athletes that will
come in and represent the program well, and have a heart to go out and play on
a stage like this and listen to instruction and have faith in what I'm talking
about.  
  
Just going forward, the same way that we built it going. You know, we are very
routine driven, and we believe in what we believe in. You know, just like this
stage here, we didn't change anything about our preparation, so going forward,
we'll continue to build.  
  
It's always a big plus when you could work as hard as we worked this year to
get here with a young team, and then to have the reward of getting to the
national tournament.  
  
You know, it's awesome. A lot of the recruits that we're looking at and things
like that can see at a mid-major level, there's a great experience there to
choose to go to a mid major and play in meaningful games, conference
tournaments, conference championships and then get to this stage, and whether
you win or lose, when you get a draw like Louisville, you go out here and you
leave everything on the court and you earn everything you get.  
  
That's the message going forward, and that's what we'll continue with with the
program. Just that's our culture and we won't change anything. We'll just keep
hoping to grow and to continue to get these early commitments like we had like
Bella Possett, who was first team all state, didn't have the best day shooting
the ball today, but nobody can think about how proud I am of here. She's a big
reason why we got here, someone that committed to us as a sophomore, really
believed in the program. Seeing this kind of stage and the meaningful games
that she can play in, that's what this means for the program.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Michigan 84, Kansas State 54  
  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I was really proud of our basketball team tonight. I thought
we were locked into the scout, when we prepared for the K-State, we know they
switch things up defensively and we knew it was going to be something that we
don't typically face, so we have a couple days to prepare for it and I thought
our kids did a tremendous job of coming out and really moving the basketball
and finding the open person and making extra passes, and even in the beginning
of the game, shots weren't falling but we were getting great looks.  
  
I thought the difference in the game was when we were able to change the tempo
of the game. Hillmon has done that for us all year long, as has Kayla Robbins,
and they came in and just gave us an immediate spark. I think that's kind of
been our team, and for those of you that haven't watched us much, that's been
the difference in our team all year long. We can go deep to our bench and they
can come in and make an immediate, immediate impact, and tonight, everybody
was able to see that, and it was just absolutely tremendous. It was a great
game for our team.  
  
Q. For Naz, just the rebounding, you look at the edge, 50-19, what do
you attribute your success against Kansas State in that category?  
NAZ HILLMON: Well, all year long Coach has been trying to drill into us that
we can rebound with some of the best teams against the season. Just making
sure we box out and rebound, whether the teams are bigger or smaller than us
to make sure we are not running to the rim. Being focused and locked in, not
only on the offensive boards but the defensive boards, as well. We don't want
any team to get any second-chance points, and we know how that can affect the
game, so we were trying to lock in on offensive and defensive rebounds.  
  
Q. The little run that turned into a big run was 17 to 5, what happened
at that point where it clicked on and you all just really put it out of reach
at that point?  
NICOLE MUNGER: They hit four straight three pointers and we knew coming into
the game that that was their game plan so we knew we had to limit that and I
think we really just focused in on limiting those three-point touches and make
them have to earn every basket they got. When we did that, we kept hitting
shots on offense, so when you do that, you saw the 17-5 differential, but it
just started on the defensive end.  
  
Q. Naz and Deja. Obviously Nicole has been one of most consistently
hard-working players on the team the entire season, but she ended up in the
bench like early in the first quarter, like after diving for a steal, can you
just talk about how her intensity permeates throughout the team?  
NAZ HILLMON: Well, every day in practice and every game we see how hard she
works. We're in practice before we came here, she still diving on the floor as
a senior, throwing her body everywhere, literally and sack fighting for the
team. We know as a senior if she can do that, we can do that, as well. We try
to say, we are the hardest working team in America and we are not going to be
that team and there's only one person sacrificing their body, so we are going
to try to go out there and do it for our teammates.  
  
DEJA CHURCH: Just to touch on what Naz says. Every day in practice, Munger is
always that one diving on the floor, taking charge. She just motivate all of
us to do the same so we know when we're in the game, Munger has to go out for
a short period of time, we know somebody has to step up, so you know, this
whole year, that may have happened before. So we always just come together,
you know, we have to pick up the work that Munger left when she was in the
game.  
  
Q. Nicole, you scored your 1,000th point at Michigan today. What does
that mean to you and just can you talk about what your career has been like at
Michigan?  
NICOLE MUNGER: I think it means more to my family than it ever will to me. My
dad will be more excited.  
  
It's great to be here with such a special group surrounding me. Like I was
talking on the way over, this has been the most fun year I've had playing
basketball, and that's just really exciting. We're really close as a team,
that's what makes it a lot of fun. That's all that matters.  
  
Q. Deja, obviously you want to get off to a good start in the NCAA
Tournament, but when you look at a 30-point blowout against another power five
school, could you have imagined that, something that kind of grew?  
DEJA CHURCH: I think today we just stayed focused. Whether we were up ten, 20,
we really didn't think about it. We just looked at the score, 0-0 and kept
pushing.  
  
Q. Talk about -- not putting too much into the first game or building
slowly or just kind of going all out and just building from there?  
NAZ HILLMON: I think you have to give it all every game because honestly, it's
March, it's win or go home so you don't know when your last game is going to
be, so you have to give it your all every game.  
  
Q. Can you guys talk about the mentality you guys have when you play the
press on defense, especially Naz at the top?  
NAZ HILLMON: So I would say for our press, we try to give the team a different
look that they haven't had. I think usually -- we're trying to change the
tempo, whether we're taking out of transition or just to slow them down and
then they don't have as much time on the shot clock once they get to the
halfcourt.  
  
We try to do anything we can to just throw a different look at them and some
people respond to it well and we have to change it up and some people don't
respond as well.  
  
It really depends on the people we're playing and what we're trying to do, but
definitely take some time off the clock for them so they don't have as much
time.  
  
NICOLE CHURCH: Same thing. We put the press on to get steals but mainly it's
just to slow the offense down. When it's working, the back line is coming up,
it's very effective, and even if not that, we are slowing them down and they
are starting their offense with 20 or 30 seconds. Pretty sure our opponents
know what's coming with Nazr -- (laughter).  
  
Q. You're now 7-0 in first round NCAA Tournament games. What do you
attribute that number to?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: That was in the pit of my stomach this morning for
sure. I think we are a really, really good team when we have time to prepare,
and even though we were facing an opponent -- and we've faced a lot of
opponents in the first round that throw something different at you in the
first round that you are not accustomed to but we had a couple of days to
prepare for it, and we really felt confident going in.  
  
And we know, they are a great team and had a great year and finished on an up
swing and I just watched them do this to West Virginia in the Big 12
Tournament. They are a good team. They beat Texas twice, that we lost to
earlier in the season. We knew it was going to be a challenge but we had a few
days to prepare and I think our kids were real, real confident with that.  
  
Q. What was the message in the locker room during halftime? Obviously
you guys extended the lead to around 20, but what did you tell the team in the
locker room?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, our goal for the game was to keep them under six
threes, and they had six at halftime. They had four in that little bit of a
run in the second quarter.  
  
So we wanted to give -- just making sure we were rotating out to shooters, and
sometimes when you're in a two-on-one as a player, you're told to protect the
hoop. But in this situation, we wanted to make sure that we contested all
shots and don't play the scoreboard. Really important not to play the
scoreboard because they are a team that could definitely go on a run. So don't
look at the scoreboard. Don't get complacent. Five minutes at a time and just
limit the three, limit the threes, limit the threes.  
  
Q. Could you have imagined a game like this --  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: No.  
  
Q. For an opener? Did you see this kind of thing coming, even as well as
you've been playing down the stretch?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: No. Certainly no. Because K.C. had been playing well,
as well and I said in the locker room at the end, as a coach, and we were
fortunate to do this in our last home game of the season, to get an
opportunity to have a big enough lead where we could really celebrate our
seniors and people could get in and play on senior night, and that's really
important to me as a coach. Because people in your program that don't play as
much -- we say those who stay will be champions and sometimes to say through
adversity and everything else, to have the opportunity to go out on senior
night and play was tremendous for me as a coach in an NCAA Tournament, when do
you ever get to clear your bench, holy cow.  
  
Tonight was an opportunity for all our kids that work extremely hard all year
long to get on the court and in the NCAA Tournament, to be able to celebrate
our entire team was just such -- that put a smile on my face probably more
than anything else because those kids worked so hard through everything. For
them to be able to get on the court and perform was just great. But never
would I have expected that.  
  
Q. I know the physical rigors of the Big Ten, does that prepare you for
a game like this that you can wear a team down as you did today?  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I think that speaks to our depth, and like these
guys talked about and as you guys have mentioned, you have Kayla Robbins and
Hallie Thorne off the bench. Those three could arguably start -- Naz is the
MVP of our team and comes off our bench. What a punch that is to our opponent.  
  
But the Big Ten had a tremendous year. I think playing in our league
definitely prepared us for an opportunity in the NCAA Tournament. We lost a
heartbreaker in the Big Ten Tournament. We were up against Maryland, and I
don't know, like I still can't really talk about it because, you know, we felt
like we were going to be Big Ten champs.  
  
So most people on the outside, they would think that's a ridiculous -- most
kids on our team think we were supposed to win the Big Ten Championship. That
tournament that left a little bit of a pit in our stomach.  
  
The Big Ten had a tremendous year as a whole and I think night-in and night-
out, whether that's the physicality, whether that's the level play, whether
that's the coaching, it has prepared us for this moment. And you know, one of
the crummy things is getting the 8-9 seed. I mean, there's nothing crummier in
the world.  
  
But you know what, our kids are in a moment where they really believe in
themselves. They believe in each other, and our chemistry is great right now,
and they are just excited about the opportunity for our next game.  
  
Q. You guys struggled early in the first five minutes. You only had four
points and then when Naz and Kayla, came in, what was the schematic change or
what was the emotional change that turned the game around, because from that
point on, you were a different team.  
COACH KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I think earlier on, we actually had some
tremendous looks. I just didn't think the ball went in the basket early on. We
had some good shots and I felt like those shots were going to fall. But it's
expected. You're tight. You know, it's the NCAA Tournament, you come out and
then you miss a couple and then you get tighter and tighter.  
  
I think the way that Naz and Kayla, they just played loose and they make
things happen. They are players that -- and Munger, that have the capability
of making things happen. I think when we changed our defense, that took a lot
of pressure off of our offense and we were able to get some easier buckets and
then we were able to calm down a little bit.  
  
And I think, you know, that's a credit to our starting group, too. It's who we
are. And some people might say, I don't think you start and go with that
group, but this made this team what it is. I think our starting group had to
handle, hey, the spotlight is on, the NCAA Tournament, it's the tip, it's the
first three minutes of the game; handle it. They did a solid job but their
shots weren't falling. I think when that next group came in, they just changed
the tempo. They just played loose. They played confident, and we were able to
get some buckets to fall, and once we did, I think everybody else was able to
relax a little bit more.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Jeff Walz](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=19715)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
JEFF WALZ: First off, just like to thank everyone for coming out today.
Another exciting time here in Louisville with our men playing today and then
us getting started with our first practice before starting the tournament
tomorrow.  
  
We're just really, really looking forward to this. Really look forward to our
crowd for tomorrow, you know, and I challenge them not to be only at the noon
game, but stay for the second game also to show everybody what the fan base is
all about here at Louisville.  
  
I think both games deserve as many fans as we can get out there cheering them
on. It's four really good teams. You don't make it to this time of the year by
accident.  
  
Q. First of all, have you chosen a place that you want to watch the
games close by?  
JEFF WALZ: Still working on that right now.  
  
Q. Okay. And how calm or how emotional do you figure you're going to be
during the game being on the outside looking in?  
JEFF WALZ: I'm going to be fine. You know, we've had a year to prepare for
this. It's not like we just found out three days ago. We went through a dry
run during the nonconference season where Steph took care of ever thing, pre-
game talk, all the substitutions, play calling, halftime talk. I actually
enjoyed it.  
  
It's one of those things when you sit there and you do it, I was able to -- I
just sat in the middle of the bench and I was able to sit with the players and
give them some insight that I'm not able to normally because you're out there
trying to watch the game as a coach and figure out what you're going to do
next. To be able to sit down and talk to them about, Hey, that read you made,
here is what you should have looked for.  
  
So Steph has been with me for 12 years. I mean, we have a great group of young
women who have respect for everybody on the staff. We have a game plan, and I
tell everybody, As a coach you put your game plan in before you go play. What
has to take place during the game is making adjustments.  
  
I feel completely confident with my staff that they're going to be able to do
that.  
  
Q. Can you give us an update status on both Arica and Sam?  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah, first on Sam. Sam is doing great. Practiced full-go
yesterday. Looked really good. She's taped up but says she feels good.  
  
Arica ran yesterday. 100% body weight. Went back to the doctor today. We'll
wait to see what he says about the next step of cutting, planting, but she
says she feels good.  
  
If she's cleared, then we're set to go.  
  
Q. There is always talk about the 24-hour rule after a win or loss. How
much did you really stress to your team putting the ACC tournament behind them
and really looking forward to this, saying this is what's important now?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, when you go into that game and were without Arica, and we
find out 30 minutes before tip she's not going to play, and then Sam Fuehring
goes down with a sprained ankle and plays 12 minutes.  
  
Without those two we aren't good enough to compete with them. It's just a
fact. Notre Dame is one the best teams in the country for a reason. We went
back and looked at the film and said, Here some things we have to get better
at, because doesn't matter who you play.  
  
But we had pieces to a puzzle on this team. We're not always going to have the
best five players on the floor, but we think we have possibly the best team
when you put all the pieces together.  
  
When you have Arica not out there, we didn't have any time to make any
adjustments of how we were going to counter that. That's a big piece of our
puzzle not there. Then Sam goes out. It's difficult for us. When everybody is
out there doing what they do and doing it well we're a pretty darn good
basketball team.  
  
The saying we have with our program, Whatever you do well, do it. Whatever you
don't do well, don't let anybody see it. That's one of the things we try and
live by. We have done a pretty darn good job of that throughout this season.
When you lose two key players it's difficult. We were playing a really good
basketball team. They took advantage of that and beat us.  
  
Q. Coach, since the ACC tournament you've had a little extended time
off, more than usual, before your next game. What are you working on and what
have you practiced on?  
JEFF WALZ: We took a little time off just like I think everybody did to try
and get the kids fresh. It was really nice for Arica and Sam to be able to
have that time to recover with rehab and doctor's appointments and make sure
they're set to go.  
  
Then before the draw on Monday, gives you three or four days to just work on
yourself. You don't know who you're going to play so you can't start preparing
for anybody. Just gave us time to work on things that we needed to improve on.
It was a good three or four days of practice. They weren't real long. They
were intense. It wasn't a three-, four-hour practice, anything like that.  
  
Then when you find out about the draw on Monday, then all of a sudden things
pick up a bit when you know who you're going to play. So now you've got to
work on some film, some breakdown, and start preparing a game plan.  
  
Q. What is your impressions of Robert Morris from what you've seen on
film?  
JEFF WALZ: I'm really impressed with how well they're coached. I'm really
impressed with how they defend. They know who they're best players are. I say
that as a compliment. You scout and watch teams play and it's like their best
player doesn't touch the ball. They're getting it to their go-to player.
That's what I like to see when I'm scouting someone. Do the other players on
their team know who our best player is?  
  
At Robert Morris there is no doubt they do. You've got the player of the year,
defensive player of the year. She's pretty darn impressive. We have watched a
lot of film to make sure our kids understand nobody is playing at this time of
year by accident. You're good.  
  
I love the way they run their offense. They'll attack you when it's there but
make you defend, too. As soon as you fall asleep, it's a layup. You've got to
be on your toes. Can't be on your heels allowing them to dictate what Robert
Morris wants to do.  
  
Defensively they're the best defensive team in that league. They play good,
hard, man-to-man. They'll break things up, do different variations at times on
ball screens, things like that.  
  
Overall, I just like how they compete. That's one of the thing when I look at
a team on film, I like to see are they competitors. When things get tight, do
they keep fighting. That's one of the thing I see in that ball club.  
  
Q. By the same token, you know who your best players are. With injuries,
who do you need to really step up or do you find yourself - will you find
yourself - looking deeper when you're back on the bench at your bench maybe
toward the end?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, you know, we'll see what AC's status is going to be. You
know, you look at Mykasa. She's been playing extremely well for us. She's a
kid that can play 1 through 4 just because of her strengths.  
  
Then you've got Dana who can start in any program. She's just been such a
spark for us coming off the bench at 6th man of the year in the ACC. Kylee
Shook and Jaz are two that we're going to need to continue to play well and
pick things up at both offensive and defensive ends of the floor. Asia is
Asia. We all know that. Sam is feeling 100%, so I'm excited for that. Like
I've said, our margin for error is thin. It's always been thin. Everybody
laughs at me when I say that but it's the truth.  
  
We have to play well in order to advance in this tournament. Doesn't matter
who we're playing. We can't go out and assume we're going to beat the defense,
beat anybody. We can get beat by anybody. We have to do what we do well and do
it and take pride in it.  
  
If what you do is screen, set good screens. If you're a defender, defend. I
tell our kids at the beginning of the year every single year: there is only
one leading scorer on a team. If your goal is to be the leading scorer, only
one of you can do it.  
  
Who wants to be our best screener? Our best defender? That's what we talked
about as this year has gone on. Hey, this is what I need from you. Our kids
have bought into it, and that's why we've had this success.  
  
Q. Coach, just to kind of --  
JEFF WALZ: You interrupted the young man. Can you help him?  
  
Q. Coach, is it true that you purchased a blond wig and fake beard to
sneak in here?  
JEFF WALZ: (Laughter.) No, that is not true. You know, I'm going to watch this
ballgame and I'm not quite sure where yet. Still working on a few things. I'm
going to enjoy it. You know, I told my staff it's a great opportunity for them
to show everybody that, Hey, we have a good staff here. Not just a head coach,
but I've got wonderful assistants that can do the job.  
  
Q. Now, will they let you come back in to watch the second game?  
JEFF WALZ: Yes, I'm allowed back in after the completion of our game. I've got
to go directly to the scouting seats. I'm not allowed to be a part of any
media after the game, which is fine. And then I can watch the second game and
scout, if needed, yeah.  
  
If we don't win I'm not coming back. Not sure if Steph will either. I put some
pressure on them. I think pressure is good.  
  
But like I said, it's one thing I never take anything for granted in NCAA
tournament. You're foolish if you do. There is a reason everybody is still
playing at this time of the year, because they're winning basketball games. We
are fully dialed in understanding Robert Morris is a really good basketball
team.  
  
Q. Along that line, with the nature of this tournament, to be the
outside looking in in, I guess have you had a chance to kind of reflect on a
possible missed opportunity? Like say if this is your last game with your
players, that you might not be there with them because of what happened last
spring?  
JEFF WALZ: No, I don't -- that's not something that I think about. I mean, it
very well could happen, but last spring, you know, I was trying to defend my
kids in a ballgame that was a tough one, I think everyone knows that who
watched it.  
  
I voiced my displeasure and said some things I probably shouldn't have said
and may have used some colorful language. They fined me for it and gave me my
one-game suspension, and that's their choice and that's fine.  
  
I understand that. I'm not going to look back and if something happens today,
Man, that was bad. No, I was defending my kids and I'll always defend them.
Just might not use the same language.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Jeff Mittie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13840)

### [Peyton Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34746)

### [Kayla Goth](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32720)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
JEFF MITTIE: Excited to be in Louisville. Still obviously playing. This is
obviously a great time of the year. You watch the start of the men's
tournament today, you watch a lot of the games go on, and then as it goes with
our tournament getting here, we were excited to finish strong and to be able
to make a late run to get here. Ready to get on the floor here in a little bit
and go to work.  
  
Q. Coach, what did you know about Michigan before you saw their name pop
up on the bracket and their coach, and what did you learn about them the last
couple days?  
JEFF MITTIE: Yeah, I figured you were from Michigan. You know, I knew they
were a quality team. I don't know Kim well. I was at TCU for a number of
years, and I was in the Big East for six months, so got to know her at a
couple of the conference meetings. Watched her teams at St. John's, followed
her. She's done a great job at Michigan. Had followed, obviously, the Big Ten
a little bit. We've played a number of Big Ten teams over the years. She has
done a really quality job with this team in particular because they're young
like us, you know, only a couple seniors and got a vast majority of
underclassmen.  
  
I like their group. I think they're a balanced team, and I think that's what I
first gained from -- but I don't know -- what I've come to know about them in
the last 72, 96 hours is kind of just their balance is impressive, their
inside game is impressive. But they've kind of done it I just think with a
good overall balance of both ends of the floor.  
  
Q. Coach, Michigan's size has posed a problem for a lot of teams in the
Big Ten this year. Obviously your team is not overly small, but what do you
think specifically, what about Michigan's size poses you guys some trouble
potentially tomorrow?  
JEFF MITTIE: Yeah, well, they're very talented inside. You know, not only are
they talented, but they play very physical. Their rebounding numbers, that's a
problem for us, quite honestly. That's a problem for us. It's been a problem
for us.  
  
And their ability to go big at times I think can give us problems. We've got
to figure out how to counter that.  
  
Obviously we play a lot of size in the Big 12. We've just come off of Baylor,
which is the biggest team in the country. We've had trouble with Brown all
three games. I'm sure their front line is excited to play.  
  
But we have faced a lot of different power forward/center combos, and we've
got to try to do things, I think, a little bit different by. We've got to make
sure we've got bodies on them. We've got to make sure we've got enough traffic
around them, and if we can do that, then you've got to hope that you get them
off the block some.  
  
If they get in on the block, though, that's going to be a problem. That's a
problem for us, and it's a concern of mine going into this game.  
  
Q. When she was in here, she said she was looking at some of their Big
Ten games to try to find a team that was similar to your team, and how that
would help them get a mental picture of how to play you. Did you do a similar
thing, and who would you say would match up in the Big 12 to what Michigan
had?  
JEFF MITTIE: Yeah, you know, everybody is trying to look for similarities so
you can talk to your players about, hey, this is a team that plays like this.
I kind of felt like from a defensive standpoint, because they're primarily man
but they'll also full-court press at times, three-quarter court press at
times, that they were a little bit of a combination of an Oklahoma State, West
Virginia. Certainly those teams come to mind.  
  
They have a big front line, though, so you can go -- we have some big front
lines in the Big 12, so I can list a lot of teams in those numbers -- Texas
has a big front line that also likes to three-quarter press. So the teams that
I talked about, Texas, Oklahoma State had some big front lines. That would be
-- did she find anybody in her league, by the way?  
  
You know what's funny about that is Joe and I are friends. I'll probably give
Joe a call tonight. Northwestern plays a little bit of that zone. They play a
little bit of a buzz zone, and certainly when we looked at Michigan, we looked
at their zone offense because we play a lot of mixture of defenses. And while
I'm not here to tell you which defense will play tomorrow, Northwestern would
probably be a team that I would look at, as well.  
  
I'm not as crazy as Joe, though.  
  
Q. What do you think your team's particular strengths are, and what's
really led you to the tournament?  
JEFF MITTIE: Very similar to, I think, Michigan in that we've gotten more
production out of our entire group the last six weeks than we had early in the
season. Now, everybody talks about the two, Williams and Goth, but we've
gotten more production out of our entire team -- Ranke has played very well.
Chrissy Carr has played very well. Kali Jones has played very well. Our bench
has continued to improve.  
  
We're a much more balanced team that if you look back at games in December and
early January, we weren't a very balanced team at that time. That's been the
biggest thing for us in our improvement.  
  
It's simplistic to say we've shot the ball better, but going along with that
has just been better balance, and I think we've been harder to guard in the
last six weeks. We were pretty easy to guard in the early part of the season.  
  
Q. Any coincidence that you say Texas was a match-up similar to Michigan
since you beat them twice this year? We saw Texas down in Florida and they
were really good.  
JEFF MITTIE: Well, when you look at a game that was played on November 24th,
if you saw some games we played on November 24th, you would wonder if you were
looking at the right team. So I don't know. I didn't -- I think the
similarities are just simply the size, the body size. Texas has a big front
line, and Texas has good athletic players. I think Michigan falls in that same
category. I think Michigan has big guards. That is very similar to us.  
  
When I saw Michigan play, I thought there were a lot of similarities between
us because we had size across the board. They obviously have a difference
maker at the center spot with the size there, but overall good size and
complete good size.  
  
No, I just think that from a body mass, from a style of play, pretty similar.
High-low game, like to get the ball inside, left-handed, that would be a
similarity to White has, both left-handed centers, those would be similarities
that we looked at.  
  
We've made our redshirt center be left-handed all week. It's been good for
her. She's about 6'5", so she's really developed her left-hand jumper this
week, so that's been good for her.  
  
Q. Peyton, can you talk about being in the NCAA Tournament, finally
having a good run here late in the year and then getting to a point where now
it's time to put it up in the big dance?  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: Yeah, it was a little bit of an up-and-down road on the way
here, absolutely. We're a young team. We took a break from the tournament last
year, even though we went to the WNIT, so we knew we wanted to get back to the
big dance this year. We had some great team leadership and some younger
players that really stepped up in a lot of areas to get us where we are, and
yeah, we're glad to be here.  
  
KAYLA GOTH: To add to that, I would just say we went into this year with the
expectation of being here, and we preached that kind of all season to our
younger group, and we kind of struggled early, obviously, in both the non-con
and conference season but were able to kind of put the pieces together and
figure out how to play together really well towards the end of the season.  
  
Q. When Coach was in here he said if you took a snapshot of how you
played in November and how you're playing right now, it's two different teams.
Can you give me a little bit -- maybe an example of something that was crazy
early when you knew you were in disarray, and when you kind of knew it
solidified?  
KAYLA GOTH: Yeah, I can attest to that from a point guard position. Early in
the season we were calling plays every single time down the floor. I was
looking at Coach Mittie for a play call every single time down the floor. Now
towards the end of the season, I am barely looking at him. We are just kind of
moving the ball, we're playing together a lot better together. We don't have
to talk people through where they're supposed to be as much as they know where
they're supposed to be. That's definitely changed from an offensive
perspective.  
  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: Yeah, I would agree. We moved the ball a lot better than we
did at the beginning of the year, and I think that's just playing together
longer as a team. That comes with time I would say, especially for having such
a young team.  
  
Yeah, and defensively I think we're getting after it a little bit more,
getting more comfortable with the defenses, and again, just the time and
getting used to playing with each other has really been helpful. And then also
those younger players stepping into their role and becoming comfortable with
their role on this team, I would say.  
  
Q. Who's coming in with the hot hand? Who do you feel like is playing
really well or shooting really well that maybe was a kind of surprise?  
KAYLA GOTH: Chris Carr has obviously been playing well all season, but she's
definitely I would say right around the turnaround, right around the time we
made that turnaround, she kind of settled into her role a little bit more.
She'll talk a lot about, if you were to ask her this question, she kind of
looked at herself as more of a scorer at the beginning of the season, and
thought she had to shoot the ball almost every time she got it, and that's
definitely not what we need her to do.  
  
So stepped into her role a little more, knew when she needed to take shots,
knew when she needed to turn down some, and I think she's playing really well
right now.  
  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: I'd also say Rachel Ranke a little bit. She came into the Big
12 Tournament pretty hot and a couple games before that pretty hot. It would
be great if that could come back again. It would be awesome.  
  
Q. Talk about the leadership that you provide for the younger players
since you have a younger core that is having some good production for you,
that they don't panic and go back to your old ways. How are you shoring them
up a little bit?  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: Yeah, it just takes a lot of knowing how to communicate with
specific young players because, I mean, and I guess reining them in is a key.
Making sure they're actually listening to you is a key. That has taken time --
on their part, they've gotten a lot better in their defense. It used to be, I
mean Coach is always like, "Butterfly, bring it back, bring it back."  
  
But yeah, in those game moments they've gotten a lot better at knowing when
it's crucial to focus, but yeah, we've got Kayla and -- Kayla does most of the
talking in the huddles because she's a point guard, and she's really good at
making sure she's just not saying generalities. She'll pull you out and say,
okay, this is what I need from you, or if she knows a player is really down or
in their head, she'll be like, we need you to not focus on yourself and give
as much as you can, and that's really been helpful, singling out and making
sure she's talking directly to someone is really helpful for the younger
players, I would say.  
  
KAYLA GOTH: I would just add to that add social cues. You can tell when
somebody is off on their own island, they're just not focused at all and being
able to understand that, and not necessarily calling them out in front of
everybody but walking over and saying, "Hey, I need you to bring your focus
back. I need you to come back to where we're at right now. And then you can
totally tell when Coach Mittie says something and some of those younger
players have absolutely no idea what he's talking about. Just going over there
and talking them through it, trying to -- I would say at the beginning of the
season that's where a lot of growth has happened, at the beginning of the
season it was talking them through almost everything, and now they are able to
understand what he's saying, what he wants, how he wants it done, stuff like
that.  
  
Q. What do you remember from your experience with the NCAA Tournament a
few years ago, and what can you use from that experience as a bonus for not
only yourself but also when you're passing on leadership skills to the other
ones that are here for the first time?  
KAYLA GOTH: I would say I have two different experiences. My freshman year we
obviously went away to South Carolina, and then my sophomore year we got to
host. So they were two very different experiences. So my sophomore year,
you're dealing with the home crowd, you get to stay home and be in your home
city, and that was super fun in its own way. And then freshman year, you get
to go someplace new and you're playing against basically their home crowd. We
didn't play South Carolina my first game and we still had their home crowd
there.  
  
So I think they're two totally different experiences, and just trying to take
it as it comes, enjoy the experience, enjoy the process. It's really fun to be
here, but it's also do or die. You lose, you go home, that's it. So
understanding the weight of each game and being able to move forward and not
put too much weight on it but knowing that it's there.  
  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: Yeah, it's hard for me to look back on my freshman year
because I'm like completely different. My whole goal was just to not like turn
the ball over and to get it to Kindred and Lew. If I had it in the short
corner, I could shoot that one. Like that was it.  
  
Yeah, just kind of flipping the switch and -- yeah, in that way, embracing
just the newness of it all, and we get to play a different team for the first
time in several months, which is really fun, and I think, yeah, just embracing
the challenge of it and just having fun I think will be two of our main points
of emphasis I would think.  
  
Q. Kind of following up on that, what has the travel been like here as
opposed to some of your other tournament appearances? Does this seem closer or
does it seem more manageable compared to the others?  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: It seems pretty similar, at least to me. One recently I think
in the Big 12 we had to travel quite a bit to -- what was that? We had to
travel quite a bit to where we were like practicing and stuff like that. But
it's been pretty reasonable, and everyone is getting us in and out of where we
need to be. It's fun being in like more of a city, like we were in Oklahoma
City. I like that. The feeling is a little different than Manhattan, which is
fun.  
  
KAYLA GOTH: I think I would just add to that, I think that's one of the pros
of being the in Big 12 conference. We go a 30-minute flight to Oklahoma and
Norman, but we also go a three-hour flight to West Virginia. So I think it's
definitely similar to us. Not every game is close, but not every game is super
far away. Louisville is a beautiful city. We got to go explore some of this
last night. The team got to go walk around, so I think we're all super excited
to be here.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, how long was the flight from Manhattan to here?  
KAYLA GOTH: Hour 20-ish.  
  
Q. You're talking about having new opponents about playing in conference
season for a while. What have you seen so far from Michigan on film and what
are you looking forward to playing against them tomorrow?  
KAYLA GOTH: Yeah, we're obviously extremely similar teams when you look at us
statistically. They obviously run a really good high-low game with No. 30 and
00 inside, and 15 kind of adds to that, a little bit of a new dynamic to that
high post area. They've got a couple of good outside shooters in No. 10, and
they have the ability to kind of spread you, so hopefully being aware of that
high-low, but also being aware of what's outside and being aware of shooters.  
  
PEYTON WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'd say minimizing like inside movement is going to be
a big key to the game, I think, just from the film that we've watched so far.
Yeah, like find the shooters and keep your hands high I think on defense, and
offensively being able to move the ball. They have some big players, and
understanding and recognizing that we struggle with that sometimes. And so I
think moving the ball in smart ways I think will be a key for us, as well.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Sam Fuehring](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34733)

### [Arica Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34761)

### [Asia Durr](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30724)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
Q. Couple for each one of you. This is your final appearance in here as
seniors. Thoughts going into this final appearance?  
SAM FUEHRING: What are my thoughts just knowing that this could possibly be my
last game if we don't win? Trying not to let that happen, just to know that
it's the end of your career and to give it your all no matter what.  
  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, to go off what Sam said, I would pretty much say the same
thing. It's our last one, last college game, so just have fun, focus on
winning. You'll never be able to go back to college ball, so just to have fun.  
  
ARICA CARTER: Yeah, I agree with what they said. Just come out and play our
hardest and do everything that we can to go as far as we can go and have fun.  
  
Like she said, this is our last go-round, and it's not worth it if you don't
have fun. Just come out and do everything we can to win and have fun.  
  
Q. Arica, looking back on the game you all played with Jeff watching
from the sidelines, what do you remember from that game, and how much do you
feel like that prepared you all for tomorrow?  
ARICA CARTER: I was just so happy he wasn't coaching us. Get a break from him.
(Laughing.) We have a great staff so it's not a big difference. Our staff has
been doing this for years and they're prepared for this at any time. It wasn't
a big difference for me.  
  
I was more focused on the game and what we had to do to win the game.  
  
Q. To follow up, with him not being there, sometimes still kind of feel
his presence even though he's not yelling at you? Do you remember still
feeling, Yeah, he's watching us, he's going to have something to say, as
coaches do?  
ARICA CARTER: Honestly, I wasn't thinking about him. I was focused on the
game. I was focused on the moment and what was happening in the moment. You
can't try to think about what's going on outside of basketball. We were
playing game, so I wasn't really thinking about Coach Walz.  
  
Q. For Sam and Arica, you all have been kind of a subject of attention
this last week with the injuries. Let us know how you're feeling,
participation today, how things are going in your recoveries.  
SAM FUEHRING: I feel great. The training staff and the coaching staff have
been very supportive and have been trying to get me to 100% again, and they
have. I feel like I'm 95; tomorrow it'll be even better.  
  
Today is going to be my third day practicing, full practice. But, yeah, they
did a great job with treating me and getting me back healthy.  
  
ARICA CARTER: I feel good as well. Getting better and better every day with
practice. So, yeah, I'm just hopeful to play on Friday and excited to see
what's to come.  
  
Q. For Asia, how do you try to get your teammates more involved and
maybe take a couple extra shots, maybe drawing some of the attention away from
them?  
ASIA DURR: You just try to make plays, reads, how the defense is guarding you,
whether they throw two or three people at me. That means one of my teammates
are open, so I just try to make the right play, right read. That's just all I
try to do.  
  
Q. For Asia again, I know you haven't had a lot of time to prepare for
Robert Morris. Is this pretty much just a case of you all going out and
playing Louisville basketball?  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, we try to do that regardless of who we're playing or matched
up against. So we have our hands full. They're a great team. They know how to
shoot the ball well. We have to come out and get stops and try to turn those
stops into scores.  
  
Q. For Sam and Arica, you already know what I'm going to ask, don't you?
Who was Robert Morris, the person?  
SAM FUEHRING: Robert Morris is a guy...  
  
ARICA CARTER: Rich guy, very rich, but died penniless. He's a wealthy man who
bought weapons for the Americans for the American revolution.  
  
Q. Well done. Thank you. This is for any of the players. What is your
impression of Robert Morris, most especially their defense?  
ASIA DURR: They play strong in the gap. They play man. They might play zone,
but they play a whole lot of man. So, I mean, they're a great team. They're
well coached. They play strongly in the gap.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: I feel like they got -- to go off what Asia said, they have
layers, too. So like if they do get blown by, there is someone else there.
Yeah, they play hard.  
  
ARICA CARTER: Yeah, from watching the film it looks like they play very hard,
which is exciting. That's what you want to play against, so, yeah.  
  
Q. Is there any team that you guys have played earlier in this year that
is similar to Robert Morris at all?  
SAM FUEHRING: We kind of compared it to -- well, I compared it to Syracuse
with their offense. They like to drive and then kick.  
  
But not like...  
  
ARICA CARTER: I think it's multiple teams that we've played this year that are
similar to Robert Morris, that play hard, play scrappy, and rotate and make
you have to get off the ball quick. I think there has been multiple times we
played teams that are similar to Robert Morris. I can't think specifically who
they are, but I remember playing teams like that.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, it's like a mixture.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Charlie Buscaglia](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36952)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
CHARLIE BUSCAGLIA: Very excited to be here. Really proud of our team to have
such a successful year on and off the court. Beautiful place, beautiful arena.
Very impressed with the hospitality and the professionalism we've received so
far.  
  
Getting ourself ready to go out there tomorrow and play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you. Open up to the floor.  
  
Q. So with (indiscernible) doing it last year and Harvard doing it like
in the '90s, how are you and your team preparing to try to do the ultimate
upset?  
CHARLIE BUSCAGLIA: We prepare the same way no matter who we play, from game
one to the conference tournament to the conference championship. We're very
routine driven as far as just being grateful or every chance we get to go out
there and play no matter the situation.  
  
That's our culture, is to just work our hardest every day. Not looking for the
big game or the big moment, but treating every moment as a big game or a big
moment. We are extremely blessed to be able to do this and go out there and
give it our best.  
  
We value each day at practice the same way we would value it now as we would
back in game one, opening game. Obviously at this point in the season we've
earned the right to be here and worked really hard for it, but we can't forget
that the light at the end the path that I always tell them we got to stay on.
Stay on that path and just continue with the way we've been doing things and
not get caught up in the moment.  
  
Obviously 1 and 16 looks very difficult, obviously the percentages of a 16
seed being able to knock off a 1 seed on either the men's or women's side is
extremely low.  
  
But that's not what we focus on. It's a game, and we have to go out there and
play the game to the best of our ability. If we work our hardest, we let the
chips fall.  
  
Q. How much of an opportunity do you get to really see some of the top
teams during the course of the season? How much did you really know about
Louisville before the seedings went out?  
CHARLIE BUSCAGLIA: Well, we come across a lot of top teams because of our
nonconference schedule. We'll scout whether we're playing one the top teams or
somebody played a top team that we're playing. We'll see them in video.
Obviously not focus on them as much because we're looking at the other side,
but like say for instance this year we went and played Iowa, who won the Big
10, and they have one of the best players in the country at the center
position.  
  
We had to scout and prepare for that game. We were able to see the different
things that a team at that level can do to hurt you. Every top team has a
different identity, but you could see the level of size, maybe athleticism,
speed. In our opinion and in our culture, continue to be who we are and to
continue to try to do what we do the best.  
  
We're not a team that's a Jack of all trades, master of none. We like to try
to master what we do and be the best we can at what we do. So that's kind of
something that we've had to already look at when dealing with teams at that
level and knowing who we are and continuing to be true to who we are, even if
the opponent looks as strong as a Louisville.  
  
Louisville particularly, did get a chance to see them play just a couple times
during the year. I wasn't looking at them thinking about when March comes
we'll be playing them and I better start take some notes. It was more of a
casual watch.  
  
Obviously if you're on the road as a coach and recruiting, you see the players
that on their roster in the summer and spring, and you get a chance to see
them growing up from sophomore, freshman year, sometimes all the way to senior
year, as they play in the AAU circuits or in high school games they were at.  
  
So familiar with them as well just from knowing how good they were coming out
of high school and how they were going to help any program. Now that we've had
some time to look at them more, definitely getting more of the in-depth look
that we need to have. We're definitely just continuing to prepare and to learn
them the best we can in such a short turnaround time for us.  
  
Q. Talk about what your team does do well and what you have mastered, as
you say.  
CHARLIE BUSCAGLIA: We're an extremely young team. If you look at our roster,
we're just a couple tenths of a percentage below 70% freshman-sophomore. You
say, Boy, how could a team like that be able to be in this position being so
young? What we do well is focus on what we can control and come into work
every day. Our work ethic is what we pride ourselves on.  
  
We come to practice every day looking to get better. I always tell them, Just
get a little bit better every day. Just get a little bit better every day and
we're going in the right direction then. We will grow, and you'll someday be
able to look back when that timing is right and say, Boy, look at what I'm
doing now that I wasn't back in September. Not trying to be a different person
each day, but get a little bit better and put bricks on our foundation.  
  
Whether we won a game this year or lost a game, this team had a full heart to
come back to the locker room and go into video session and come up the office
and want to see the clips -- not the good clips, but the bad clips. The clips
that like I don't really like seeing myself mess up like that. They have to be
willing to do that.  
  
That's what we were willing to do all year. And especially when you're a
freshman or a sophomore you can look a that and say, Well, they're young,
they're immature, they're not going to get that yet. If you push yourself and
you really have it in your heart to want to get better at that stuff and be
more mature, you will.  
  
I think that has a lot to do with what we did well. We grew throughout the
season. We started off our nonconference 3 and 8. Even though we were 3 and 8
we lost or first game in overtime against a team that was a top 100 RPI team,
a team that did really well in Youngstown. We had that game won and we let it
slip out of our hands in the last nine seconds.  
  
We turned around a lost a buzzer beater at Bowling Green on a reverse layup on
a blocked shot where the ball bounced under the basket, player caught it in
stride, and shot a reverse layup and made it. That's how we lost another game
on the road.  
  
Those are tough moments. They're either going to break you down or make you
stronger. This team had a full heart to get stronger, to continue to come to
work. I always tell them, You got to be able to handle winning and losing.
Losing can separate you and so can winning. You can start to lose your passion
to come and get better every day.  
  
We went on some great winning streaks this year and had to stay humble. Part
of our pillars is humility. Humility is a big part of this program. That's a
big thing for us. You notice I'm not talking about hitting shots or throwing
great passes. These are the things that I believe in that are going to build
shooting the ball better, build throwing better passes.  
  
Our defense is our work ethic. We can talk about all the great ways to play
defense, how you're going to get stops. You got to have heart to do it, and
you got to be able to push yourself to come to practice when you're a little
sore or tired to go harder to become a better defender.  
  
So all the stuff they talk about with our defense and our nationally-ranked
defense and our conference-ranked difference and all that, that is all from
work ethic. I could give them all the knowledge in the world about what I've
been taught over the years being assistant coach under my father for a while,
and obviously the friends I've made in the basketball world.  
  
I can bring all that knowledge to practice every day, but you have to have
player-driven mentality to get better. Sorry for the long-winded answer, but
you're asking me what we do well, and it's not just summed up in a few words.
It really is our mentality and our work ethic and player-driven mentality to
come to practice every day and push themselves to get better.  
  
That's why we've gotten better. I can tell them all the words in the world
about what's going to make you better. They got to have the heart to do it.
That's why we were able to go into the conference tournament with such a young
team and to respond by looking so mature. It's because of how hard they work.  
  
Q. When ESPN asks you what are the keys to the game, what are you going
to tell them?  
CHARLIE BUSCAGLIA: We know they're a very fast, physical, athletic team. We
know they have some players that are considered top players in the nation, if
not the top player in the nation. We expect them to come out with a ton of
energy, a ton of passion, and we have to be able to match that. We have to be
able to be mentally tough.  
  
We have to go out there and understand that the game is going to be played in
between the lines. We have not get caught up in the moment of what's around us
and all this, all of the media and all the attention they're getting. We
talked a lot about that before we came out here today, about every game how we
prepare, and we have to be prepared the same way. We have to understand that
this is going to be a game that's played, and what's going to win or lose the
game is the way you go out there and how hard you work and to withstand the
pressure and the aggressiveness that they're going to have.  
  
That's going to be a big part game, obviously, just understanding how talented
and athletic and strong Louisville is, and when they want to come at you, you
got to be able to fight for yourself, your team, and to continue to play.  
  
If you make a mistake, something bad happens, we've been working on this all
year. Handling adversity. That's going to be big. We have to handle adversity
out there. We've been growing so much with that. We just got to stay on our
path.  
  
Q. You hear coaches talk about preparing for big environments by
sometimes piping in loud noise, that sort of thing. What kind of unorthodox
method have you done with your team at any point to prepare them for that big
atmosphere, maybe such as the Iowa game?  
CHARLIE BUSCAGLIA: Going into the Iowa game? There has been times we've made
it loud through using the speaker system in our arena and stuff like that just
to make it hard to call a play out using hand signals.  
  
Really the biggest preparation is, besides all that stuff, is coming to
practice and creating an environment that is tough. Practice has to be hard.
Practice is by far the most important thing we do every day as far as
basketball-wise. It teaches us a lot basketball-wise, a lot about people,
about dealing with adversity. That's why it has to be tough.  
  
That's the best preparation you could have, is have hard practices every day
and challenge ourself at practice to put yourself in the moment as much as you
can.  
  
If you're going through a drill or playing 5-on-5 or you're running something
up and down the court, that takes a lot of endurance and cardio, you got to
push yourself. That way when you're in the game that pace isn't too fast for
you. That's really how you get better. That's really how you handle teams that
play really fast. Louisville plays extremely fast. They're up and down,
they're athletic.  
  
You have to push yourself at practice to go after that and to be prepared for
it. If you practice harder, you know, than you did the day before, you're
getting tougher and better. That's the best way I could say it.  
  
Besides all the noise and everything else, you can't simulate -- I can't pay
20,000 people to go sit in a crowd and watch our practice. You just have to go
out there when you first get out there on the court, take it in, look around
for a minute, and at that point say, Okay, I took it in. Now everything is
between the lines. Don't worry about the crowd. All here today; gone tomorrow.  
  
We got to live with ourselves.

_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Thank you, and thanks to the University of Louisville. I
know we haven't started playing yet, but the meeting was terrific this
morning, and everything has been great so far.  
  
We are excited to be in the tournament for the second straight year. Our kids
have had a real strong finish to the season. We're looking forward to the
opportunity to get out there and play again against a really good Kansas State
team. But really just thrilled to be dancing, to be here, and excited to get
going again tomorrow.  
  
Q. In a tournament like this, how much time do you get to kind of size
up your initial bracket and really see how you match up against your first
opponent, I guess, with both teams that you might face in this regional?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, that's a great question. Obviously Monday night it's a
pretty quick turnaround, and when you head out on the road on Wednesday, you
don't have that many days to prepare. So Monday night after, or Monday earlier
when the bracket was released, we had an opportunity to start looking at
K-State. Great team, great league. Myself, I had a chance to watch a ton of
film.  
  
But as the head coach, I don't really look too far ahead. I think that's kind
of on my assistant coaches. We had one of our assistants doing the K-State
scout, one of my assistants doing the Robert Morris and one doing Louisville
to prepare for the next round.  
  
But try to digest, try to see different opponents, so K-State, what is their
style of play, is there anybody in our league that they're similar to, what's
their defense, anybody in our league that they're similar to, and go through
those scouts in our league in preparation for them.  
  
Quick turnaround, but quite a few days to just kind of get ready and prepare
for them. But they're different than the next two opponents. But we try not to
look too far ahead, especially from our kids' perspective and just concentrate
on our first game.  
  
Q. As a follow-up, you had a week off since the Big Ten Tournament, but
how much did that atmosphere really kind of prepare you for this kind of
event?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I think even in the beginning of the year, we
challenged ourselves early on over Thanksgiving and went down to Florida and
played in a tournament where we played three days in a row, and we played
against Missouri, Texas and Washington in that tournament in preparation for
the Big Ten Tournament and for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
So the Big Ten Tournament was, I mean, a great atmosphere. Our first game we
hadn't played in a while, and we were playing a Wisconsin team who had two
upsets. So they were playing their third game in three days before we played
our first game. So it took us a little bit to get going against a team that
had nothing to lose.  
  
But we found our groove, and then the next day we got a chance to play in the
semis versus Maryland. Great atmosphere, great basketball game, just a
tremendous game. We wound up coming up on the short end of it by a point, but
that was really preparation for us for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
We did have a week to prepare. It kind of gave us a chance to take a day off,
let our kids get back in the classroom. Michigan is a tough academic school,
really get back in the classroom, concentrate on their academics, but then
have an opportunity to practice things that we needed to get better at in
advance of the NCAA Tournament before we knew our opponent. So it was a great
week of prep for us.  
  
Q. Two-part question: How much did you know about Kansas State and their
head coach before you even started looking at the film? And you talked about
trying to figure out who they're like in the Big Ten; what did you find when
you looked at the film in terms of who they remind you of?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, you know, obviously I've coached in the Big East, and
I have assistant coaches that are now in the ACC, so if we were playing a team
from one of those leagues, I would probably have a little bit more knowledge
about them than I do about a team from the Big 12. But two years now we've had
a chance to play teams from the Big 12.  
  
I just know their coach was a long-time coach at TCU, as well. Very successful
coach. Runs a match-up zone, and that's kind of what they're known for a
little bit, switches up defense, might do a triangle-and-two or might do a
box-and-one, just throws a number of different things at you from the
defensive end.  
  
So in preparation thinking about Northwestern and kind of what we've done
against Joe McKeown is a guy that has run a match-up for a long period of time
and kind of what we've run against them, what has been successful through the
years against them. So probably similar to them. But they also then are five-
out offensively and do a lot of five-out stuff. So their bigs shoot threes, as
well.  
  
So we've faced that a number of times this year. We've faced that going back
to like a Villanova-style team where they're cutting through, motion offense,
five-out, really moving well without the basketball. So have had a couple of
days so prepare for that, as well, so I hope that answers your question.  
  
Q. How much do you buy into the whole idea about coming into a different
arena and trying to get -- not so much used to the atmosphere but like depth
and all that with the shooting? Is that kind of overstated, or is there
something to it?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, I think in my younger day, stuff like that used to
drive me crazy. Oh, my gosh, do we need to get there, do we need to shoot, do
we need to practice there, how important is that. And I think as you get
older, you kind of settle in a little bit and realize that just how I react is
how my players will react. So I want my players to come into any arena and
feel confident and not worry about how big it is, what the depth is. You know,
just be confident in your shot and not worry about the wrong things and
control the things we can control. So when we go into practice today, that's
not even going to be something that's discussed for the next couple days.
We're just going to go in there and do our shooting drills like we normally do
our shooting drills, have our practice like we normally have our practice, and
just try to keep our confidence and our focus on the basketball game and not
so much the arena we are playing in.  
  
This place is outstanding. You know, it's a great arena. It's a great
facility. So I think our kids will be excited about the environment more than
anything else and excited to have an opportunity to show themselves
individually and show our Michigan team on the big stage.  
  
Q. Does it help that you don't have to travel real far to a game like
this?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: It's amazing. I mean, I love it, and we didn't know, you
know, all the preliminary brackets and everything else, if we were going to be
in California. Last year we were in Texas.  
  
I think it means a lot to the families of our kids to be able to be here and
support them in the NCAA Tournament. I mean, that's something that's really
important when you can look up and you have achieved the greatest thing you
can achieve from a basketball standpoint is getting to the tournament, and to
look up and see your parents in the stands is really important, and sometimes
when you go that far from home on a quick turnaround, your parents aren't able
to make those plans and get there. So I think it's really important to the
players and our program that they have their family support there and a ton of
them -- probably almost everyone will have someone from their family there.  
  
But I also think it's really important for our Michigan community. Two boys
just walked in from our school paper, from The Michigan Daily, and they're
here. I know our practice guys, that practice against us every single day
said, "Coach, we're not going to miss it. We are getting up, we're missing
class, don't tell anybody, on Friday, but we are leaving Friday morning and we
are going to be there. We're going to be there to support our team."  
  
It's great that we're in driving distance and we are going to have people from
our community here, as well, so I'm excited about that.  
  
Q. The last tournament you didn't have Hailey Brown, she was out in a
season-ending injury. How do you think your presence at this tournament is
going to change the outlook for you guys?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Well, Hailey Brown is an outstanding player. For those of
you that don't know her, she's from Canada. She plays for Team Canada. She's
played for the Canadian national team, a U-19 team for a number of years, and
she's just a tremendous asset. She's a really skilled post player, knocks down
threes for us, and she's playing with a lot of confidence right now, as well.  
  
Even in the Big Ten last year, she wasn't in the Big Ten Tournament, and this
year coming into the Big Ten, we were on the bus driving to the arena last
week, and all I hear was Hailey Brown's voice in the back of the bus, I
thought, golly, I haven't heard her speak this much all season long, but I
think it was her excitement for the opportunity to play in the Big Ten
Tournament and the NCAA Tournament because she missed that last year.  
  
So she is an integral part of our rotation. She's a starter for us, shoots the
three exceptionally well. We're happy that she's healthy and ready to go.  
  
Q. This is the second year in a row you guys have been able to make it,
it's the first time in your tenure as a coach that you've gone back-to-back
tournaments. How did last year's experience and how does it help make you
maybe more comfortable coming into this year, the fact that those players last
year won a game at this event and they know kind of what to expect here in the
first game of this tournament?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I mean, you've been with us for the long haul, so
you've seen the program's development and you know the year-by-year
improvement and the brick-by-brick development. We were devastated and we felt
like we got the snuff three seasons ago, and we went on to win the WNIT with
some tremendous players like Katelynn Flaherty and Jillian Dunston and for us
to get in the NCAA Tournament last year was a tremendous feat after what
happened.  
  
But coming into this season with the loss of Katelynn Flaherty, and for those
of you that don't know her she scored over 2,700 points for us, all-time
leading scorer, man or woman, and when she graduated, the big question was how
is Michigan going to respond to that and how are they going to be able to
bounce back from that?  
  
I think led by Nicole Munger and Hallie Thome, our senior class but our entire
program said, no, we are going to respond and we are going to show that it's
not just one year, like we are a program and we're going to be there year in
and year out and we want to take the next steps in the program.  
  
So I think Hallie Thome and Nicole Munger kind of said coming into this year,
no, we're going to continue to do it, and their experience has kind of led us
through this season, and I think it's been invaluable. Hallie's numbers are
down from last year. She's not scoring as much. She's not rebounding as much.
But her presence on the court has been unbelievable for our freshmen like Naz
Hillmon, for Hailey Brown, for a Kayla Robbins. And her experience, when she's
not our leading scorer sometimes she has the most assists.  
  
So she it understands the game, Nicole Munger understands the game. They know
what it takes to get to this point of the season, and I think that is kind of
what carried our team through, and I think that's what helped us get here with
a level of confidence.  
  
Going into the Big Ten Tournament, our team really felt, and I'm sure you felt
this from them, even through a tough January, we were going to win the Big Ten
championship, and when we didn't, they were devastated. This gives them an
opportunity to go out again and show the world Michigan basketball. So they're
playing with a lot of confidence. I think those two have led the way with
their leadership and their experience.  
  
Q. Coach, I know size has been one of the team's greatest strengths
throughout this year. So how do you plan on taking advantage of that tomorrow
against Kansas State?  
KIM BARNES ARICO: Yeah, I think Kansas State's goal, and just from watching
them, and they've had some tremendous wins against Texas, played Baylor real
tough, I think their goal was to try to keep you from getting the ball inside.
So they really push their defense out to try to use their length from the top
to try to not allow those posts up. But we know that's one of our keys
tomorrow. Obviously rebounding but also establishing our posts. Hallie Thome
is tremendous inside. Hailie Brown, Kayla Robbins, but Naz Hillmon, who is a
freshman for us, really came on the scene and had a tremendous freshman
season, and we need to establish our posts early. That's a difference maker
for us, and that's a place where we have to go early in the ball game and
often.  
  
Q. I want to get Hallie and Nicole, both you guys, this question: Two
years ago obviously was really disappointing. Last year going into the
tournament was the goal all year. Now you're back this year, but did both of
you expect to be here and kind of how did you see this season going? Is it
kind of what you thought it would be?  
HALLIE THOME: I think it was more than what we thought. A lot of people I
think doubted us in the beginning, losing such a high scorer in Katelynn
Flaherty and Jillian Dunston, who had such a big impact on defense, but I
think everyone stepped up to it. We had a lot of people coming on. I think the
most exciting part about our team is you can't just key in on one player. Any
night any person can go off. So it's a very special team and we knew that from
the start.  
  
It's exciting being here, and I think everyone is ready to take full advantage
of it.  
  
NICOLE MUNGER: I'm just really proud of our whole team. Everyone worked their
hardest day in day out to get to this point. Easily could have quit, whereas
end of January things got really tough but we came together and we got better
and we proved that we deserve to be in this dance and it's really exciting.  
  
Q. Naz, what has the leadership and what you've learned from a player
like Hallie Thome meant to you? Obviously you came in and made a splash as a
freshman. Did she take you under your wing at all?  
NAZ HILLMON: She definitely took me under her wing, into her house. But Hallie
has been a big help. Just coming to practices you could see me talking to her
about plays, and the other team about as much as I talked to coaches. She's
been a great help on and off the court. I've talked about how she's helped me
on the court but mentally she's tried to help me anything I needed, sending me
texts when I need it. Just really being there whenever she can be. Being such
an amazing player that she is I really appreciated it and I've learned a lot
from her this year.  
  
Q. Last year in the tournament you guys didn't have Hailey Brown after
she suffered a season-ending injury. How do you think her return to the lineup
this season is going to help you guys essentially make a deeper run?  
HALLIE THOME: Hailey is a special player, being a post player that can shoot
the three outstandingly. It's hard for team to guard her. So it's nice having
her because she opens the floor a lot, but then she can also go in and get
physical in the post.  
  
But just her energy on the court, the way she plays, she just has a calmness
to her, which I think makes everyone around her feel even though the game is
close, we're always good.  
  
NICOLE MUNGER: Yeah, having Hailey in the lineup definitely changes they
dynamic of our team, like Hal said. Having her back is going to be great and
open up the court with her three-point shooting for us.  
  
Q. I'm just wondering, what are you guys' feelings about being in the
tournament? Obviously two seniors up there and then Naz being a freshman, for
the two seniors, how does it feel that this is going to be your last
tournament? And then Naz, maybe like how nice is it to make it in your first
year in college?  
HALLIE THOME: Okay, it's definitely nice. I mean, this is on our goal sheet
from the beginning of the year, so to be able to make it here in the first
place is very competitive, hard to get in. So I think that just stands a lot
for our season that we've had, and it's exciting being here and all the teams
know, a lot of media have been saying don't play Michigan right now because
we're on a roll and we know what to do. So I think it's just a credit to our
team. So it's exciting to see all of our hard work pay off and to see that
we've made it here and that we can go for a run.  
  
NICOLE MUNGER: I'm just really proud of the team and how we fought. Like I was
saying earlier, the fact that we were down at the end of January and just
continued to fight and we stuck together I think is really a testament to all
our hard work and really proud of everybody.  
  
NAZ HILLMON: This is really exciting for me. I know that everybody doesn't get
to be in this tournament and everybody doesn't get this opportunity, as the
seniors know from a few years ago, but I'm really excited and just really
trying to soak everything in and not take it for granted how blessed I am to
be here.  
  
Q. Who on your team is coming in with a hot hand? Who do you feel like
is really coming on the last part of the season on your team?  
HALLIE THOME: So it's hard to just say one person because I think our whole
team, any given night, like I said, anyone can go off. But the best part of
our team is our depth. That's what we said from the beginning. Having Naz,
someone who could easily be a starter, off the bench, that's exciting. Her
ability to affect the game the way she does is outstanding for a freshman in
the first place, but just anyone, doesn't matter what year you are, to make
that impact on the game is incredible. And then you have our juniors, Kayla
Robbins and Akienreh Johnson, they have definitely broken out of their shells
this year and have been critical players in tight games.  
  
It's very exciting to have the depth we have this year and to be able to use
it to our advantage.  
  
Q. Hallie, every time I see you on the court, you have a smile on your
face, whether it's the end of a game, in a pressure situation, or it's the
start of a game against a team from the Mid-American Conference. It doesn't
matter. Where do you get the joy for the game, and how do you think that has
helped your team?  
HALLIE THOME: I think this year I made it like clear to myself to kind of
don't be like counting down the days like, oh, my God, I only have this many
games left, be present, be in the moment. A lot of that is taking the
nervousness away, I'm just out here playing basketball. And I do think it's
helped our team a lot. Before every games and before the coaches come in, I
scream, "What are my two rules?" And it's play hard and have fun. If you play
hard and have fun, and that's how we're been going the second half of the Big
Ten and into the Big Ten Tournament.  
  
Those are the two rules, play hard and have fun and it's worked. It kind of
reminds you of why you started playing basketball in the first place. It's not
putting up stats, like don't worry about the numbers. If you go out there,
play hard and have fun, that all takes care of itself.  
  
I think having the composure definitely helps in those tight-game situations,
like in the Wisconsin one just being able to bring everyone in in the second
overtime, I think guys are fresh, we're good. Just putting things in
perspective and kind of cracking a laugh when everyone is a little nervous,
just to ease the mood, and I think just that gives them confidence, and I
think it helps me, too, by doing that. It's nice to see. I mean, I have all
the confidence in the world in my teammates, but in tight situations, like
everyone gets a little anxious. That's just reminding them of the confidence
and just acting like I know what I'm doing, even though sometimes I have no
idea what I'm doing, but it definitely works, and it's paid off for sure.  
  
Q. This is for Nicole: During the Big Ten season you guys had a lot of
close games, ended up winning a lot of those close games. How do you feel
those finishes have prepared you for the tournament?  
NICOLE MUNGER: Oh, definitely. I think we practice those every day in
practice, just end-of-game situations, what we're going to call, and try to
call the right plays and just the right reads for which person, and I think
moving forward into these tournaments it's going to be a gritty game every
single time, and it's going to come down to singular possessions that are
going to win or lose games for you.  
  
So I think having the games in the Big Ten conference, we had a really strong
conference this year, it's just going to prepare us so well for what we're
going to face.  
  
Q. You guys have a size advantage on most teams in the country. I was
wondering from an offensive and defensive perspective, what does that allow
you guys to do to maybe like prevent teams from scoring or establishing your
own offensive efficiency?  
NAZ HILLMON: We talk about every day in practice and every game how our length
can affect teams. We know when we play like taller teams, we know how that can
affect them on offense or defense, so we just have to take advantage of that,
especially on defense, make sure we have our hands up and doing things to
affect and alter their shots or their game, as well as going into I think the
depth of our length. I mean, we just have so much of it, not just the starting
five but the next five that come off the bench.  
  
So having that, so many people can do so many things. You have Hal, that can
switch and having so much diversity, and we're just very versatile.  
  
HALLIE THOME: I think our length has been tremendous this year. I think 12 has
been a whole new level for us because we have Naz Hillmon at the top. Her long
arms and just long everything and athletic ability, that's definitely when we
need a spark, Naz comes in and we go for 12 right away and we always get the
turnovers we need to spark her offense.  
  
And then I think just that helps offensively our length, it's kind of hard to
guard, like a lot of teams, even if we've been able to run like a certain set
for some guards this year because our guards are taller than most. So being
able to just take advantage and realize we have a size advantage has
definitely helped this year.  
  
NICOLE MUNGER: Like they're saying, I think we're a lot more versatile because
having the size in there because you can pick on different defenders, like Hal
said, work hard so we can post them up. And also creating mismatch problems,
even our post, like Hallie can really shoot the three, and she's still a tall
guard, but we have two other beasts in the inside. So I think it's just really
great for match-ups and use it to our advantage.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
LOUISVILLE](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+LOUISVILLE)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Nia Adams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36963)

### [Nneka Ezeigbo](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36964)

### [Nina Augustin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36965)

  
_Louisville, Kentucky_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Go ahead and open it up for questions. Start right back there.  
  
Q. This is for anyone up there. It's really rare that a 16 seed beats a
1 seed. What are you guys going to do to try to put Robert Morris on this
short list?  
THE MODERATOR: Start here with Nia.  
  
NIA ADAMS: We prepare. This is just our next game and that's how we like to
see it. We know it's a big game, but we don't try to put too much emphasis on
it. We just go out there, practice and prepare like we do for the next game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Nneka.  
  
NNEKA EZEIGBO: Like she said, we always focus on our next game. Basically we
focus on our defensive principals. Defense is a big part of our game, so just
keeping a strong focus on what we need to do next and what we need to
accomplish on the next possession.  
  
NINA AUGUSTIN: Yeah, our coaches never put emphasis on if you're the 1st seed
or the 16th seed. We're going to try to play with our strength and take away
theirs.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
Q. What do you feel like Louisville strengths are? If you could each
answer that question.  
NINA AUGUSTIN: I think we're a pretty fundamental team. So just like focusing
on our defensive principals. I think that will be our strength in this I game.
Keeping our own pace.  
  
NNEKA EZEIGBO: On our side I think a big strength is just continuing to
attack. Just continue to read on each possession. I think post will play a big
part of the team, and then also focusing on our guards to be able to lead us
with communication and keeping us moving.  
  
NIA ADAMS: For our strengths, like Nneka said, we have strong attack points.
Like whether it's from our post or the guard. We have drivers, shooters, and
post players that can bang. Like we know what to do and we just play to our
strengths.  
  
Q. Being a young team, do you feel a lot of pressure to be a leader?  
NIA ADAMS: I wouldn't really say it's pressure. It comes naturally only
because of my teammates. They look for me to do certain things and they also
help me. Like being a leader doesn't always mean just one person. You don't
always have to be a senior to be a leader as well. I think they help me in
those aspects.  
  
Q. For Nia, so this isn't your first go-round. I think, correct, it's
the third?  
NIA ADAMS: Yeah.  
  
Q. So what makes this NCAA appearance different than the other two?  
NIA ADAMS: Good question. What makes this one different I think is definitely
the experience part of it. First one with UCONN was a lot of jitters. UCONN is
such a -- like just the name just brings you like chills.  
  
Notre Dame, we built up confidence and wasn't as much nervousness as UCONN
game, and I think this game we're ready. We're prepared. We're doing all we
can to just compete and go out there and just play the game like we know how
to.  
  
Q. Just a follow up to that real quick. For Nneka and Nia, what are you
talking to the freshman and sophomores about, underclassmen? Any words of
advice when it comes to a stage like this one?  
NNEKA EZEIGBO: We just try to instill confidence in our freshman. They're
basically not freshman anymore. They make mistakes, all of us do. Just being
able to move on to the next play and keep playing strong. Our coach always
talks about whether we're here or away, it doesn't matter. We worry about
what's between the lines. Just worry about the game and being able to play
strong for 40 minutes.  
  
NIA ADAMS: I think Nneka just pretty much just said all. Just instilling
confidence in our underclassmen. Like she said, our freshman and sophomores
play a lot of minutes. They're not really freshman. They know that and they
know their abilities and what we can do as a team.  
  
Q. Nina, talk about your approach to the NCAA tournament. Obviously
Nneka has experiences, and Nia has her third game now. This is your first.  
NINA AUGUSTIN: I think it's our strengths kind of, that we have experienced
players that have been through this, and then we have the younger players like
me that we've never been here. It's more exciting.  
  
I think we have a little bit of everything there, so I think that's good.  
  
Q. Nneka, talk specifically about you having to face the forwards from
Louisville. Obviously a tougher test than you've had since nonconference
play.  
NNEKA EZEIGBO: Facing Louisville's post is definitely going to be a challenge,
but a challenge I'm willing to accept. Just one step the at a time focusing on
what I need to do to help my team.  
  
It's definitely going to be a fun challenge seeing something different and
experiencing a different level of play.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else for these ladies? If not, we'll let them go early
and get ready for practice. Ladies, thanks for your time and good luck.  
  
NINA AUGUSTIN: Thank you.  
  
NNEKA EZEIGBO: Thank you.  
  
NIA ADAMS: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 24, 2019

  

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30388)

### [Kianna Ibis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34725)

### [Jamie Loera](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37092)

### [Robbi Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34723)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
Arizona State 57, Miami 55  
  
COACH KATIE MEIER: First of all I just want to thank everybody at University
of Miami for hosting. Everybody has been wonderful here. Katie does an amazing
job. That's a really, really good team that we just beat. And appreciate all
the NCAA's hard work in putting on the tournament.  
  
That said, so proud of these guys. I'm so proud of them. This group's been to
the NCAA Tournament every year but this has been elusive to us, so to finally
take that next step -- not Final step, next step. But we know that we can make
the final step.  
  
Just really, really proud of them. If you would have said we were getting
outrebounded by 11 and we were going to win, I'd be like, aahh -- but the
toughness of this team, I already got a lot of Texes from the coaches in our
conference because everybody is just really supportive in our conference, and
you know, everybody knows how tough this team is and how we know how to take
games at the end.  
  
Our conference, and I think our overall schedule, just really paid off.  
  
Q. Can you take us through what you saw on the last inbound, how you got
your hand on it?  
ROBBI RYAN: My player was actually open at first. But they are looking to pass
into the post, so I had a chance to recover. They are just really close to
each other, and I don't know if she bounce passed or not but I was able to
leave my hand in there and tip it to Courtney and I just took off running.  
  
Q. Hof got a pretty good look.  
ROBBI RYAN: Yeah.  
  
Q. And it hit like 17 times off the rim or something like that. What's
that moment like, when you're watching it in super slow motion, I'm sure.  
ROBBI RYAN: Yeah, it took forever. You could have blown on that ball and it
would have went in. It was a scary moment for sure, but it was a great feeling
when it rolled off the rim. I think Courtney grabbed it. It was just great
feeling.  
  
Q. Kianna, this game was basically indicative of the whole season. How
did those previous disappointments really help you guys this time around,
finally breaking through the second round and heading into the second
weekend?  
KIANNA IBIS: Every loss we've had, we've learned from it, and you know, we
just knew it came down, like to a battle of possessions and just having those
close games, especially in our conference, definitely helped us and prepared
us for like the situation that happened today, and I'm glad we got the win
today.  
  
Q. Jamie, you had ten points today. Charli had mentioned you yesterday
as a key player to spread the floor against Miami's bigs, so how did you feel
your performance went today?  
JAMIE LOERA: The game was really exciting. I'm just so happy we got the win.
I'm so happy for our seniors, and just like Charli was saying, like the
toughness we showed today, and I just tried to take any opportunity my
teammates could create for me and they were really encouraging me and hyping
me up to keep shooting. That helped me a lot to just keep that confidence
going.  
  
Yeah, I'm just really pumped up. I've been yelling for like a half hour.  
  
Q. In this environment, fourth quarter, seemed like the lead was turning
or somebody was tieing up on every possession. Do you even in the crowd at
that point? Is there a home-court advantage, whether you were in Tempe or here
or not, and in a game like that, does anything really matter?  
JAMIE LOERA: Like Kianna was saying, just the number of really close games
we've had this year has really prepared us for a fourth quarter like that.  
  
In all honesty, I think our team really came together and we just had really
good energy in that fourth quarter, and so you just block out everything else.
You're just focusing on being connected and just every possession, and yeah,
that toughness?  
  
Q. I know that it just ended like ten minutes ago and you don't know who
you're playing yet, but has it hit you there's a game for you Saturday in
Portland?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: Is that when we play? I've been trying to find out.  
  
JAMIE LOERA: I'm just excited that we're still playing, and it's just really
fun. I just want our whole team to make the most of this opportunity, and to
just really have fun together and just play our best basketball.  
  
Q. We talked inside the locker room, but again, stopping the twin
towers, they got their rebounds, but they combined for 12 points, a lot of
misses, well below both of their averages. Talk about the critical aspects of
the game.  
KIANNA IBIS: Their leading scorer, it was in our game plan to stop them. I
mean, I thought Nea-Nea (ph) did a very good job. I thought Sophia did an
amazing job, and our guards really helped us out today.  
  
So it wasn't just a post effort. It was literally a team effort, and everybody
helped to stop the post today.  
  
Q. And Hof, she really did a number --  
KIANNA IBIS: Yeah, Sophia's been working, she's tough, we're all tough, but
even in the summer she's been working so hard and just to have this
opportunity to go to the Sweet 16 and have her on our team and help us get
there, I'm very proud of her and I'm happy we could do this together.  
  
Q. Robbi, you started off very strong today. You hit one of your first
shots and hit a three-pointer, how hard was that for you after not scoring in
the first-round game?  
ROBBI RYAN: That doesn't really matter to me, I guess, as long as my team's
playing well. I don't really care if I score or not. Just whoever has the open
looks on our team, that's who is going to take them. It's not a one-man team.
Everybody can score. Yeah, felt good to hit a shot, but I was just doing it to
help my team.  
  
Q. Did those shots at the beginning give you more confidence for those
free throws at the end?  
ROBBI RYAN: Yeah, probably.  
  
Q. The obligatory what-was-the-joke-of-the-day question. You did
promise.  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I did promise. I don't know if you're going to
will have. They didn't laugh as much as on this one our whole team was Desert
Swarm Defense. I mentioned it -- we kind of change. We do more for our defense
pretty much every game and our game plan was to pinch and double and make the
guards beat us.  
  
So fun fact for the day, okay, is that aerodynamically, bumblebees to shot be
able to fly, but they don't know this, so they fly, okay. So we talked about,
you know, "let's get our buzz on in Desert Swarm," and all this stuff.  
  
So then when we got in the huddle -- what kind of bee is -- gosh -- what was
it? Oh, what is the bee that's never heard. The mumblebee. And so we were just
saying, like, "Get loud, get connected," just defensive things. Sorry. I'll
have it better for this next weekend.  
  
Q. You said "mumblebee"?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I said mumblebee, yeah. Telling the joke, I said a
mumblebee, a loud team is a winning team, blah, blah, blah, yeah, it wasn't
one of my better ones. I'm going on a theme. That's the hard part.  
  
Q. A basketball one, if you'll indulge me.  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Please.  
  
Q. Improv is done for the evening, I promise. Your view, you had a great
angle of it obviously when she sticks her hand in there, and then the ball
starts going the other way right by you. How much does the mood, the feeling,
everything -- because they have a chance -- Miami has a chance to win the
game, and then don't even get the ball in obviously. I'm sure you didn't
anticipate getting a steal off that. What's that moment like when you see it
unfold?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I felt bad for Sophia. We do a lot of end-of-the-
game situations, and obviously when they got that rebound, our whole team knew
to kick it out and she was just not quite in tune.  
  
We're pretty confident in our defense, so if we've got a tie score, it's like,
okay, we're going to overtime. That particular lineup, and we just went with
who was in because we thought they were in the flow, and they were.  
  
They were just really connected. You'd be surprised at how many times we've
made some plays like that at the end of games. We did it at Maples one year.
It's knowing how to take games, knowing how to take games, knowing how stay
aggressive and this team does know how to do this.  
  
Q. I hope you have a good heart, but how was your heart like on that
final shot, its rolling, it's rolling, it's rolling.  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I'm like, don't let her iso -- I was fine if we
went into overtime. I thought we had depth, you know, and I was just overjoyed
when it went out.  
  
Yeah, I mean, it was halfway down. It was literally halfway down, obviously,
and you know, it was -- and it was a tough shot and she can make it. I've seen
her make that shot probably in all my film last night, you know, at least 50
times.  
  
Q. Was it like a spinning layup?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: She's very good at the long layup on the left.
She's very good at the long layup on the left. I always joke, a little luck, a
little bit of luck.  
  
At the same time I thought it was solid defense and it was a contested shot.
We didn't let her get around us. They are very good at getting around you and
they like the clean looks. I thought we did a great job on two amazing post
players.  
  
Q. So this mission is accomplished. What's your next mission?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, the next mission is to get to the Elite 8,
yes, and you know, this is the fun thing about this team this year, is you
know -- I think in other years, it's like okay, great, that's probably what we
can do.  
  
This team, they have played, you know, Baylor, Oregon, Louisville, to the last
possession right there. I mean, we've had four games like that, Stanford. I
mean, I think that they know, if they do what they need to do, they can beat
anybody in the country.  
  
So we are going to take it one game at a time. But you know, we are just
excited to be dancing right now.  
  
But I honestly, going into the tournament, it's like, okay, whoever, we'll
just play whoever, we're good. We've seen it all. I think Mississippi State or
Clemson, they are playing right now? Okay.  
  
Q. How proud are you of this team, to finally break through, to defeat
that elephant in the room and make it to the Sweet 16?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I'm just so happy for them. Again, you guys have
followed our season and know how close we've been. We could have been a 2-seed
or something, just close out a few more games.  
  
They are a great group. I've been asked a lot what defines this group what
defines this group; their selflessness. Zero people worried about playing time
or anything. Everybody on that team is overjoyed. We never have any, you know,
anybody disgruntled after a game. I've never had that in my career. Usually
there's maybe somebody, "Oh, I'm happy we won but I'm not" \-- this team is
amazing that way.  
  
So they have been incredible, and the seniors, this is a great senior class,
as people. They are better people even than they are as basketball players.  
  
Q. How excited to be heading to Portland?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: For any of our fans tuning in that said you were
coming to Portland, book your tickets. A lot of our fans -- it's a pretty
quick turnaround, so it was tough for them to get out here. But a lot of our
fans assured us that they would be making it to Portland.  
  
It's fantastic. We have players from the northwest and we'll have a little bit
better fan base and West Coast time zone. Seriously, I don't care where we
play. We're just happy we get to keep playing.  
  
Q. You mentioned yesterday about bringing in Jamie to play four. What
did you think of her impact on the offensive end scoring double-digits?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: It was incredible. Notice I waited until the
fourth quarter and then I put my dual threat in, and I thought it worked
really well, and then Jamie got a little tired.  
  
But Sophia was having a great game at the same time, so you know, it worked
beautifully, because obviously their bigs are not used to defending shooters
on the perimeter. They actually did a good job a lot of the game, especially
on Kianna. They are not -- pretty much for the whole season, they don't really
guard, and whoever was switching on and everything, and they started switching
everything, which they don't usually do. They made some great adjustments.
Took us awhile.  
  
Obviously we didn't score very well. Took us awhile to make some adjustments.
But Jamie and Kianna really worked well.  
  
Q. You've talked all year about how deep your team is; talk about how
the depth of your team makes such a better team and how it helps you guys?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I thought, you know, we had maybe a little more
energy. I thought they, you know, they were a little -- they are used to
playing those minutes, but I said -- I said our bench, I think our bench is
going to be the difference in the game going into this game, and I think they
were.  
  
It's so amazing to sometimes be able to sub and get better in certain areas,
and we do. I mean, Nea is a phenomenal defender, rebounder, but we needed to
score and here comes Sophia and here comes Jamie.  
  
You know, it's huge for us, and it's going to serve us well, obviously in
Portland.  
  
Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 24, 2019

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Beatrice Mompremier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30896)

### [Laura Cornelius](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32696)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
Arizona State 57, Miami 55  
  
COACH KATIE MEIER: What a gritty effort by Arizona defense. That interior
defense and their team defense was amazing. It's a tough team to prepare for
in a day, I can tell you that much.  
  
But I love the composure of my team. We weren't gating what we normally got
all year. We just checked down. I thought we had great patience. I thought we
had great maturity. I thought our guys said, okay, we're pretty good, too, and
we'll take this game on.  
  
So I thought it was just a great basketball game with a whole bunch of lead
changes. Seems like about half the game, one team was leading, and half, the
other one was leading and it went back and forth.  
  
If it comes down to three plays at the end there -- we made one mistake. We
made one mistake. The rest, everything else that went on in that fourth
quarter, I thought we were super. Super execution.  
  
And then they had players that went out of their role in order to beat us, out
of their role by a long -- you know, so that's what happened. We got a stop we
needed, we had the ball and I thought Laura was open early and we missed her
early and we tried to force it in there, and that's one mistake.  
  
But we still could have recovered from that, and had a chance to keep living
there with that last play, which was great. It was a two formation. We had
Laura off the play and we were taking either one, going to over time or
winning. It was exactly what we wanted. I think Laura was as good as she's
ever been. Just a super, super performance.  
  
But listen, now, Arizona State, that was a lesson in toughness. They were as
tough as any team we've played all year. They were committed to their game
plan. They didn't change it defensively and I said it the other day, when you
go up against another coach, sometimes, you know, you don't know them really
well or whatever.  
  
But I tell you, Charli Turner Thorne is a really great person and she runs a
great program and I thought that was one great team won and one great team
lost. Heck of a matchup to go to the Sweet 16, and that's what the NCAA is all
about.  
  
Q. Laura, Coach broke down that last play. What did you see on it?  
LAURIE CORNELIUS: Had the ball out for us. We were running a play, got me open
for the three -- I think I got open early. Checked on them and she looked at
Emese and she looked at me and that's when I got denied. That play hurt us,
but we still got a shot. I think we got our chance before that, even and I
think we played a heck of a basketball game, and it's really tough to lose
like this at home.  
  
Q. Great rebounding performance. When you look at the loss, it's tough,
but how would you evaluate your performance from today?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: I just went out there and tried my hardest, if it was
rebounds, rebounding, that's what I had to do to help my team.  
  
Q. When you try and put this season in perspective, this loss is a
heartbreaker, the way it finished, but what you were able to do, two top five
wins, it seemed every ranked opponent you were in the ballgame. What can you
is say about the season?  
LAURIE CORNELIUS: The season has definitely been one of the most fun seasons
I've ever played in my life. I will go to war any day with my teammates. I
love my seniors. I love every single person on this team. We played our hearts
out. We had a wonderful season, some great wins, tough loss, but overall, we
loved each other along the way.  
  
But right now, it's -- right now it's hard to look back at that, but it will
come.  
  
Q. Laura touched on how special this group was, and you fell short on
your ultimate goal, but this group, what they were able to accomplished, what
will you think most about?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: I'm smiling already. I tell you, you can coach a lifetime;
every day, when I came to work, I had a team -- and not every day, not
everybody, I'm not that naïve, but most of the time, the entire team, or at
least 85 percent of the team, was really interested in getting better. Just
interested in getting better for two hours or three hours, or whatever time we
got to spend together.  
  
And then off the court, it was like a vacation. To be around them, to be on a
road trip with them, it's people you want to be around, right. I love them. We
had a lot of fun.  
  
Emese and Kayla are, if you don't have the pleasure of knowing them, they are
two of the best student athletes that have ever graced this community and
their footprint on this campus, they have put their footprint over everything.
It's everywhere. It's in community, in community service, charitable work. My
heart, they just stomped all over my heart with tons of love. They are in
there for ever.  
  
Yeah, it's going to be tough -- it's going to be tough to ever even close my
eyes and think of coaching again without Kayla and Emese. It's going to be
tough.  
  
Q. What was your message to both of them, and especially Emese? She's
probably going to replay that in her head, and I saw you talk to her. What was
your message to her?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: I whispered something in her, it's between the two of us,
but it's so personal with her.  
  
Yeah, I mean, we promised each other every day in recruiting, her dad asked if
I would hug her, and I said, that's not going to be a problem. I hugged her
more than once. I think our last two shots were Bea and Emese, if that's
correct? I executed plays for exactly that purpose. You know, call me an
idiot. I know they weren't having a great game, but my God, and you're crazy
if I'm not going to those two kids in that moment, and I did. Both of them
went in and out. I love both calls. I'd do it again.  
  
I said to our team, I think we really executed very, very well. Arizona State
ran a couple things and got a couple shots that those weren't their star
players, those weren't their headliners, right. That happens. We were
struggling from the three and we were struggling inside and we still had the
ball to win or tie. We really worked through a lot tonight, so that shows you
the resilience of my team.  
  
Q. You mentioned about Arizona State defense. What were they doing
specifically, like Emese didn't get too many touches in the first half.  
COACH KATIE MEIER: She didn't have much freedom of movement. She got jammed up
a lot.

### [Reili Richardson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35156)

### [Kianna Ibis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34725)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by the Arizona State Sun Devils, Reili
Richardson, Courtney Ekmark and Kianna Ibis. We will open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Courtney and Kianna, how did you feel the freshmen did in their first
NCAA Tournament game? How has that helped them build confidence for tomorrow
night's game against Miami?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I thought they did great. They didn't let their nerves
get to them or anything. We talked to them before the game and said, enjoy the
moment. It's the NCAA Tournament, and it's win or go home. So go hard. I think
the win gives them confidence and getting that first-game jitters out
definitely helps.  
  
Q. Courtney, does everything seem more settled once you get past the
first one? I think you got in late Wednesday night or something like that, the
traffic situation, getting here for practice, everything probably seemed
rushed. Obviously the stakes go up. Does it seem a little more chill or calm
when you get through the first one?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: I think so. It's always nice to get one under your belt, and
having a game last night it's nice to get the pregame jitters out of the way.
Now we're focused on winning this next one.  
  
Q. Kianna, I'm sure you have seen the film. But their bigs especially,
they're imposing and what Miami is going to want to do. What was your
impression?  
KIANNA IBIS: They're versatile and they can run the floor very well. We know
it's a team effort in guarding them. We're not going to have just a one-on-one
game all the time we know that. So we need to lock in and play some good
defense against them.  
  
Q. Describe the motivation level of you, the seniors and the team to try
to get over the hump of the second round?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Yeah, especially my past three seasons here, you know, we've
only gone to the second round and there is many times where we could have
advanced. We were so close in the second game, you know, and we just had that
little more sense of urgency and hunger for that Sweet 16 because I know all
of our seniors want it, and I know all of our juniors want it. We have to get
our freshmen on board, if anything, this is the time to do it.  
  
KIANNA IBIS: I agree, especially being a senior, every game could be your
last. So we're going to go out and leave it all out there.  
  
Q. To any of you, how do you balance playing freely while the pressure
ramps up for each round you advance?  
REILI RICHARDSON: I think we're always just playing freely. We know each
other's strengths and we know what we're going to do as a group. So I think we
just play to our strengths and help each other with it.  
  
Q. Reili, how do you look to feed the post players? You could turn Miami
tides with Emese Hof and Beatrice Mompremier.  
REILI RICHARDSON: We have great posts down low, so we're looking inside every
game. Getting the ball down and Kianna is one of our best scorers, so getting
her the ball.  
  
Q. Reili, last night UCF missed 10 of their first 11 or 11 of their
first 12, and I know last night is neutral. But on the road it's important to
start setting a defense tone. How critical will it be to take the crowd out of
it here tomorrow?  
REILI RICHARDSON: We play as our defense goes so we try to pick up the
pressure and we force you to miss the shot. I think not giving the other team
strength.  
  
Q. Courtney, I know you're focused on here, Arizona State, but do you
ever look at the rings and remind yourself what you're playing for this time
of year?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Maybe. I don't know. I know that it's an amazing feeling
going to the Final Four, winning a national championship, so that's just what
I want to bring here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Good luck.  
  
We have Arizona State head coach Charli Turner Thorne with us. Coach, if you
could start us off with an opening statement?  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Absolutely. We're just kinda madly prepping. I am not a
coach that is good at looking ahead, even though I knew Miami had a fantastic
team. Now I really know after watching a lot of film last night how fantastic
they are. They remind me kind of of a mix between Oregon and UCLA in our
conference, so we know that kind of rebounding is something that we have faced
pretty regularly and transition game and just explosive offense and just the
mixing up of the defenses. But they do it really well. I was proud of our team
last night. Thought we had a great defensive effort and everybody came out
healthy, so that's good.  
  
Q. Coach, they make it an intimate spot with the drapes and whatever,
but in that setting it was a very good atmosphere. But how hard will it be to
replicate the defensive start you had last night tomorrow night?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: It will be important to replicate the first three
quarters minus a minute and then play the fourth quarter. The difference will
be forty minutes. We're going to have to play good defense for forty minutes
to play a team like Miami.  
  
Q. Everybody knows the history. You've been in this game a bunch of
years in a row and Miami has been here five out of six or whatever it is and
there is that "hump."  
Do you talk about it or do the kids understand that the Sweet 16 is a new
place for most of them, obviously. Do you talk about getting there or do they
know it on their own?  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We don't talk about it. We talk about it briefly. It's
three tournaments. It's one weekend at a time. Look at it that way, two games.
It's like a Pac-12 weekend. It's that caliber of basketball. But I know they
talk about it a little bit and they think about it. You're right. This group
that we have, I think they missed out on the Sweet 16. So this has been a
little bit elusive for them. But we try to be pretty in the moment, kinda
performance, goal-based team. If we take care of everything then we will get
what we want. But, you know, it's kind of the unsaid big elephant in the room.  
  
Q. Lastly, can you take us through the tick-tock of the last 16, 18
hours, whatever it's been? I know you rely on your staff for the scout and all
that, but how much film have you crammed? Did you get any sleep? No one gets
enough sleep, but getting ready for practice this afternoon?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: That's a great question and a lot of people have really
no idea. Obviously you do, probably how much preparation a lot of coaching
staffs do. I have one of hardest working coaching staffs in the country. We
kind of took Christmas off and then before that it was probably August. We
don't take days off. We work. It was a long night. I'm the defensive
coordinator and Angie Nelp is the offensive coordinator and we split up the
duties. We were all watching film and we got briefed on highlights from last
night's game and I'm still probably six, seven hours, like from really owning
where I want to be. But I picked some up at the beginning of the week and last
night it was getting through our game, getting back to Miami and preparing for
practice.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: You know what, especially for us this year, we are
probably more scout-specific maybe than ever and we have always been a well
prepared team, so things will evolve from today's practice to tonight's
meeting to tomorrow's shootaround. I think we have a good sense of things, but
as I continue to watch, I'm sure we will. Yeah, we might, and that was even
with Central Florida, adjusting, do we deny all over the floor. I'm kind of a
filmaholic and sometimes I'm a little slow, takes me watching three, four
times to figure out what I want to do. I'm probably safe to say I'm still kind
of figuring it out.  
  
Q. How do you balance wanting someone to play freely as the pressure
ramps up?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Oh, you know, that's a question for this team, you know?
You look at our experience and you think, oh, you know, they've been to the
NCAAs, they played in the Pac-12. It's a great question. You know, the whole
elephant in the room, getting to the Sweet 16, I think it is something for
this team. As coaches we tell jokes. We have the joke of the day. We try to
make 'em laugh. We do things to -- and they use their tools, mental freedom
techniques, tapping, a lot of different things to help them overall with their
physiology to help them to stay relaxed. I think it's important that coaches
set the tone with that, that we stay positive throughout the game, help them
stay connected. Ultimately, though, it's up to them to rise to the occasion
and have each other's back. You guys have seen some games we do that amazingly
well and sometimes we fall a little short. I'm excited for them.  
  
Q. What's going to be key for Kianna, Taya and Sophia to get position?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Position offensively or defensively?  
  
Q. Offensively.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I think they are going to be pretty open on the
perimeter. You've got Jamie Ruden who is shooting the ball well, and inside
it's a hook shot day because not only are they big, but they will double in
the post and stuff.  
  
I imagine that Miami doesn't give up a ton of paint touches with their
interior defense and that's okay. As you guys know, historically we love that.
But this team hasn't really needed to rely on our points in the paint, so I
think we will be okay.  
  
Q. Would you talk about defensively as well?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Defensively, do your work early. That's what I would
say. It feels a little bit like Baylor, with the Twin Towers and two really
good posts, very versatile, play really well together. It's ironic, first week
of the season and it's kinda coming full circle. And even just Oregon, other
teams in the conference with really good inside games. I think we'll be ready
as best we can. You are just going to contain. They're very good.  
  
Q. First, can you share with us what the joke of the day today was?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, the problem with the joke of the day today was,
how about if I share yesterday's? Why do blind people not like skydiving?  
  
Q. I don't know.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Because it freaks their dogs out. Okay, I didn't say
they were great jokes. I have a tie-in for each joke and this is a tie-in
about, do your job, and we're in this together. You want to talk about what
keeps me up all night, pregame talk and motivation this and motivation this
and we're all about that at ASU. The X's and O's come secondary to the jokes
and the motivation.  
  
Q. How did you feel the freshmen did last night in their first NCAA
Tournament and how do you think that helps them for tomorrow?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I thought they did well, Taya came in, knocked down a
three, was really good defensively. Iris got to the free throw line had some
great transition passes and Jayde has a knack for coming in and being in the
right place at the right time, scoring a layup. So I thought it was a great
first game for them. I really did.  
  
Q. Coach, yesterday the game between Miami and FCG really high-paced
offensives on both sides and I was wondering if you think that plays into the
hand of Miami or the goal is to slow down the game against the Hurricanes?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: What are you trying to say. We are deliberate? We don't
play fast? We want to play fast! I think Miami is similar to the Pac-12 teams
we play and obviously our goal is to slow them down. We don't want to slow
down. We would like to keep the pace up on them a little bit and I think we
push okay. We don't score always in transition. We don't have a lot of amazing
guards, but I think we push the pace a little bit and it's going to be an
intense, pretty fast-paced game, I think.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of a question about your just way of going about it. For
your defense, do you have the confidence to try to play like the way you've
been playing all year or do you think you're going to throw new things in
there, try and mix it up?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: You'll have to wait and see, won't you? We've actually
had two defenses this year if anybody has noticed. I thought yesterday was
kind of a very blended version of both of them. I told you I still have more
film to watch, so we'll see.  
  
Q. Some of your bigs can obviously shoot from the perimeter and there
were times when Miami was in zone last night where they were daring. Emese Hof
will stay home. Can that sometimes --  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Oregon State.  
  
Q. It's a risky play, but does that play with the shooter's mind you?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We have a couple teams. Actually Stanford. We are used
to that and we know exactly how they are not going to guard and it does play
with people's heads, 100%. But it won't be anything new to any of our players
if they don't come out and guard them and I think we're adept at knowing when
we want to shoot and keep moving the ball. But when Jamie Ruden and Kianna
Ibis are in together, that's going to be an interesting match-up, I think.  
  
Q. Can we know today's joke?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Today's is like an inside joke.  
  
Q. I thought it was playing off the blind sky thing?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: No, it relates to something we do. It's in our inner
bubble. I'll give you guys a joke tomorrow. Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Laura Cornelius](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32696)

### [Emese Hof](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32656)

### [Beatrice Mompremier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30896)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us. For Miami, Laura Cornelius, Beatrice
Mompremier and Emese Hof. We will open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Laura, you mentioned it feels like morning and all of you can answer
that, but you mentioned it feels like morning. What is it like waking up today
after playing a 9:00 start and the quick turnaround?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: Obviously it's a quick turnaround, but we're still alive. A
lot of teams went home and we're still playing. Happy to be playing tomorrow.
We're going to sleep, rest a little bit, watch a lot of film and we will be
ready again tomorrow.  
  
Q. Laura, after the way the last couple of seasons ended with upset
losses is it a weight lifted after getting through the first-round game
against a team that gave you guys a scare in the second half?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: Yeah, we knew Golf Coast was coming out in the second half
and you know last year is last year and we don't care about that anymore. We
know it's March and every team is going to give their best shot against us.  
  
Q. Similar situation, you've been on this program a little bit. What
would it mean to you to do what you have to do to get this team to the Sweet
16?  
EMESE HOF: That would be awesome. It's our goal right now. It's going to be
one game at a time and we have Arizona State in not of us and we're going to
do everything in our power to win that game.  
  
Q. Bea, what has been like to play these games at home? This is part of
the reason you came back to Miami. What has it meant to you?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: Just like another home game. My family gets to come and
our fans get to be here, so it's just another home game for us.  
  
Q. For any of you, have you had a chance to do a little studying so far
in your home state? What are you expecting so far?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: I'm expecting them to play really hard against us. Obviously
they have to, you know, sit back and watch our game they played before us.
They're going to be ready. We're expecting they sub a lot of players, they
play eight, nine, ten deep. So we have to know their scout. They looked good
against UCF. We're going to give it our all and we definitely got to step up
our game a little bit, too, yeah.  
  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: They have a great team. We just watched film. They
played a lot of close games against really good teams, 2 points against
Louisville in the beginning of the season. They're definitely a good team, but
so are we. We're excited for this match-up.  
  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Everybody going to come and play their best game, you
know, it could be their last game so everybody going to give it their all.  
  
Q. You mentioned taking it game-by-game, obviously, but talk about the
history. It's been a while since the Sweet 16, haven't made that kind of a run
in a while. Throughout the season was it talked about? Was it a goal to take
that next step finally?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: I think in the beginning we said this is our goal and during
the season we were just taking it one game at a time. But we're getting closer
to that goal right now and right now it is the next game.  
  
Of course, it's been something that everyone was driven to attain, and I think
we're getting closer to it now. Yeah, we have to fire it up a little bit more
even to get there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, ladies. Thank you.  
  
We have Miami head coach, Katie Meier, joining us. Coach, if you could start
off with an opening statement?  
  
KATIE MEIER: Okay. Well, glad to be here. Quick turnaround, obviously, and
thank God I have a great staff. I feel prepared in a very short time, but,
yeah, very impressed with what Arizona State brings to the table. Cannot
believe their composure, their assist-to-turnover ratio is incredible. They
have great players who know what they do well and Charli does a great job of
making sure they are able to play to their strength. Just an incredible team
that probably was expecting to host. They had a season worthy of it, so, you
know, it was an evenly matched game and we're excited.  
  
Q. This team and this group, you have gone through so much with them.
What would it mean if you were able to move on with this group in
particular?  
KATIE MEIER: Just any day that I get to extend my time with this group is
meaningful, because I'm telling you, you can coach for a lifetime and not have
such a special group. They're so different. There is so much joy, so much
passion, there is so much trust and love. But, yeah, the upperclassmen have
worked really hard and they've really, you know, their footprint that they're
going to leave is bigger than their foot here. They have been amazing for this
University and for this community. I want to extend it as long as I can.  
  
Q. And for the program itself, it's been a while since Miami has been to
the Sweet 16?  
KATIE MEIER: Back when there certainty 64 teams, and one win got you there,
right? We did that!  
  
Q. Considering the disappointments the last couple of seasons, what
would it mean?  
KATIE MEIER: I guess the meaning comes later. We have a game tomorrow against
Arizona State and I don't put anything more than that on it. I really don't.  
  
Q. I'm sure at the start of the year, Sweet 16 is obviously one of the
goals among many you guys set. Then throughout the season you take it game-by-
game. Obviously now it's one game away. Does it come back into talks or is it
just that one game?  
KATIE MEIER: I don't believe we set a Sweet 16 goal with this particular team.
I don't think we did. We were in the preseason NIT and we wanted to win that.
It was short-term with this team. We cut this segment up and you can't say a
goal that you don't have a match-up or tournament to address. I don't do vague
stuff like that. I do believe we mentioned playing deep into March, wanted to
play the second weekend, stuff like that. But the label of Sweet 16, got a
great game tomorrow.  
  
Q. Coach, Arizona State and Miami met home and home 2013, 2014. Because
the philosophies don't change a great deal does that make preparing for this
game easier on your staff?  
KATIE MEIER: No! The coaches, Charli and I have been consistent in our
careers, but I had such a different team. We had come off a nice, you know,
top-10 kinda run there and we had sorta, we were rebuilding during that series
and we did not have the type of sophistication that this team has.  
  
I thought about looking back at those games, but I remember I know some of the
stuff we did defensively. We don't do that anymore. What I love is when you're
in a high-pressure game and you look down at the other coach in women's
basketball and you have the utmost respect for that person and you know how
hard they play, their players are treated well, that they play very well and
play very fair. I really enjoy being in a big-time game against somebody that
I'm like, you know what? Thank you for what you've done for women's
basketball. And that's how I feel about Charli.  
  
Q. You mentioned the turnaround. How quickly it is to go from a 9:30
start?  
KATIE MEIER: We had to have pizza because we won and I had my pizza because we
won.  
  
Q. You had your pizza?  
KATIE MEIER: I had my pizza.  
  
Q. How do you feel like you're managing the turnaround and the girls are
managing it?  
KATIE MEIER: The girls are fine. I'm like, excuse me, you went to the hotel,
slept and came back, the other adults in this room didn't sleep. We're ready
to roll. That's kids! We're fine. We're built for this. We're built for this
and my staff has had great experience in moments like this. I feel like
yesterday even in the game there was a moment I thought to myself, yep, I've
been coaching for a while and I know this was coming. So there was no panic.  
  
So I think we're good and we can turn it around quick and I have so much faith
in my staff. We've been together for a little bit so I didn't have to check
the work, I knew Tia Jackson had this ready to roll and we went in with Blue
this morning and I didn't even do the scout. I have so much faith in their
ability that I wanted to get games in, so I could get a feel. What is the
essence of this team? What do they do? What do they do on an 8-0 run?
Sometimes you just go to the scout and you don't really know what you're
dealing with and when I'm coaching a game there is a script and I knew that
script was coming last night and I wanted to know what Arizona State's script
is. I didn't even look at the script until this morning. I just watched the
games.  
  
Q. This team, some nights it's Bea, last night it was Endia. How huge is
it in the tournament that anybody can have a big game at any moment?  
KATIE MEIER: I think what's amazing is to be able to close your eyes as a
coach and say, okay what's happening right now, the staff and Coach Blue does
the substitution suggestions and just right now, this particular moment, some
people have a consistent history, Laura, Bea, or Emese, Mykea, right there.
But if Kelsey is up and down or Endia is up and down we will go with them. We
have we have a history, but Endia Banks was just amazing. So Kelsey didn't
have a lot of minutes because Endia just got to play it out.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30388)

### [Courtney Ekmark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34204)

### [Charnea Johnson-
Chapman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34783)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
Arizona State 60, UCF 45  
  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yes, I just want to really comment on Katie's
team, UCF. They are a tough team. We play in the best conference in the
country in our humble opinion, the Pac-12, and we play aggressive, physical
teams and they were a very tough team. She's done amazing job. I'm proud of
our team taking care of business today.  
  
Appreciate THE University of Miami, everything has been fantastic in terms of
hosting and the selection committee.  
  
Obviously excited to keep playing and you know, usually the way this goes,
teams that have deep runs, just keep playing better, keep playing better, and
that's our plan.  
  
CAMRON GHORBI: Thank you. We'll go into questions for the student athletes. If
you could please direct your question to a specific student athlete; and if
the question is for one-or-multiple, I will have one of them start first.  
  
Q. For Courtney. Courtney, how crucial was it getting those two quick
three-pointers to start the third quarter?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Getting ready to start the second half, Charli told me to
light it up right before I started so I said, okay. I think that really got us
off to a strong star the second half, which carried our momentum. Then we just
have to do a better job of keeping our foot down.  
  
But like Charli said now our plan is just to keep playing better and better as
the tournament goes on.  
  
Q. Courtney, how valuable is tournament experience? They had basically
none. Your whole team has a lot, and you really have a lot, two championships
in Connecticut. Did that pay off tonight a little bit?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: I think so. We're definitely an experienced team. We have
four seniors and we have juniors who have played a lot, and you know, it's our
sixth tournament in a row for ASU. Definitely having that tournament
experience helped us a lot.  
  
Q. Kianna, 12-10 today. How important were those second-chance points in
the flow of the game?  
KIANNA IBIS: I mean, that's one of our goals for us posts and guards is to
keep getting second shots because that's part of our best offense.  
  
I mean, you know, it's win-or-go-home, so I was just trying to lock down and
focus on rebounding today and the rest of the tournament.  
  
Q. You guys dominated it the boards as well, a lot of offensive put
backs the first quarter, first half. How big was that, relentlessly pounding
the boards all night?  
CHARNEA JOHNSON-CHAPMAN: Like Kianna said, we focus on second-chance shots
because that's our best offense. Just being able to make a move and get the
rebound and go right back up was pretty important.  
  
Q. What was it like playing against an extensive aggressive zone, for
all of you guys.  
CAMRON GHORBI: Kianna, maybe you could start with that one.  
  
KIANNA IBIS: It was definitely very physical today. Like Charli said, we play
in like one of the best conferences, and you know, we've -- they are a pretty
great team. I mean, it's been physical -- like it's been awhile since we
played against a really physical team like them.  
  
So we just -- we just knew we had to be aggressive and exceed their
aggressiveness and keep punching.  
  
Q. To any of the players. Is it difficult with basically no fan base
here, coming all this distance? Is that difficult or you don't care, once
you're on the court, you're on the court?  
CAMRON GHORBI: Courtney, maybe you can start with that one.  
  
COURTNEY EKMARK: I don't think it's difficult. We can bring our own energy.  
  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: You didn't see our huge section behind the bench?
(Laughter, cross-talk).  
  
CAMRON GHORBI: You all are dismissed. Congratulations.  
  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Should I share my battle wounds?  
  
Q. What happened? Tell us.  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We were out waiting to come in, they were talking
about, "I got hit here, I got hit here," and all this stuff.  
  
I said, "Yeah, I lost two nails."  
  
Q. They nailed a lot of shots. Listen, you guys have been to the second
round the last three years, I know you're sick of that. What's the mission?
What's the mantra?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, that's a great question. The mission is to
get past the second round. You know, it will be a formidable challenge. We'll
play a very good Florida team.  
  
Obviously Miami has had an amazing season, and you know, is in my opinion the
best 4-seed in the tournament, just having beat Louisville, having beat Notre
Dame. You can never count out Florida Coast, either.  
  
Like I already said, we've played Louisville. We've played Baylor. We've
played all in the Pac-12. So we know if we do what we need to do, and a lot of
it is going to be about rebounding, you know, for the month of March, we can
advance.  
  
So I know that this team is capable. We just have to keep playing better, as I
said.  
  
Q. (No microphone).  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: You know, it's in here and it's in here, yeah. I
mean, they -- like you said, this team, a lot of second rounds, and that's not
what our program's about. We're definitely a team that can make a deep run, if
they are ready to empty out and really lock in.  
  
We had too many possessions off today to be honest, and they know it. So that
effort is not going to get us to Portland. We know this.  
  
But that's the great thing. We know this. They are not, ohhh in the locker
room; oh my gosh, we won a game.  
  
They are like, okay, what's next? We've already talked about potential
opponents. They have some scouts. They are headed out to watch. We want to get
to Portland, you know, and we want to -- we know, no matter who is in our way,
we're capable of beating them if we play well.  
  
Q. (No microphone. )  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: It's so funny, you send an Arizona team to Florida
because everybody else would be in paradise. We're like, oh, yeah -- we're not
as humid but we have the same gorgeous weather, so it's kind of lost on us.
But it is beautiful here.  
  
Q. For Courtney to get off with a 20-point outing, how important is it
for her, especially, given her experience, going through this before?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, exactly. Well, she is probably the most, she
has been the most closely guarded player that I've ever coached in 30 years of
coaching and 25 as Division I coach. Every game in the Pac-12, she was just
blanketed.  
  
So when she knew we were playing against zone, she was like, yes. We knew she
would get some good looks and she's just an amazing shooter. So you know,
that's what she's capable of doing, and I think Colorado, first year, Pac-12
tournament, she had five or six threes and that really helps us.  
  
It really helps us. She's definitely a tremendous player, and you can see she
scores other ways, too. We don't really have five people shooting the 3-ball
really well, so it makes a big difference when Courtney is on.  
  
Q. How important of a player is Reili, who has a high assist-to-turnover
ratio against an extended aggressive defense like UCF?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, and you brought up the defense, and we
haven't played a team like this all year long, so it was -- it was a
challenge. I think that's why Central Florida is so good. I mean, how many
teams press the entire game?  
  
You know, even when they were giving up stuff, they just -- you know -- and
they do a great job of adjusting during the game, and so, okay, we're doing
this, and we were ready for that. So when they adjusted, we adjusted whether
we were 3 o'clock passing or picking them off. That's a lot to play against.  
  
I thought Reili, she's got a great chance of graduating with our all-time
assist record at ASU and we had Coach Briann January and some great players
have come before her. She's running her team really well and she was integral
to handle all that pressure, and when they were going to trap and you know,
when their aggressiveness -- well, really their aggressiveness was from start
to finish. I can see why, again, they had such a great season.  
  
We don't usually turn the ball over that much, so they definitely sped us up
and didn't allow a lot of flow. And I didn't really want to play her that long
but she was doing such a great job, had to leave her out there.  
  
Q. Last week one of the things in that loss to UCLA you touched on was
losing the out-rebounding battle. How important was it to bounce back in this
game and get the job done on the glass?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, like I said, it's everything in March.
Rebounding wins championships, it's true, and possessions. It's a game of
possessions.  
  
I think we can still improve on our rebounding effort and obviously if we end
up, depending on who we play, we could end up playing possibly the best
offensive rebounding team in the country, so it's going to be huge.  
  
Q. What was the message to your team when you took that early time-out
in the fourth when UCF started to make a little bit of a run?  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We're fine. I just wanted to settle them down. You
know, I mean, obviously nobody is going to go away. It's March. You know,
everybody, it's win-or-go-home and they made a great run. I said their run is
over. Lock it down. You guard them this long, don't stop guarding them and
that was the key, and just the little bit that they were going to keep being
in passing lanes and getting more and more aggressive so he with just talked a
little about that, just with our alignments.  
  
Q. Obviously one of the keys was to really contain Kay Kay Wright, only
player on the team scoring double figures. How did you succeed in doing that
and do you think that will occur with your next opponent? It's probably
doubtful, that only one player scores double figures.  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, yeah, you know, the thing about Central
Florida is they play more people than we do, which is rare for anybody that's
not familiar with us. We usually actually spread our minutes out a little
better than we did today.  
  
You know, they play up to 13 people, and so I think their stats are a little
bit deceiving because they have four posts that play a lot and if you add
their stats up, they are really in double figures.  
  
So they did a great job with their inside game. But I thought we did a good
job with her in the first half. Thought we let up with her down the stretch
and a great player is going to step up and we gave her some good looks. I
thought it was key that we locked her down and didn't really let her get going
until maybe the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Reili, Kiki, we rotated them on a little bit. We
were supposed to be jumping out more on some stuff but team effort. Team
effort. I that you will Reili and Kiki, Kiara Russell, did a great job.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
COACH CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Sure was. Because I called a really bad play. It
was my fault. Shouldn't have called that play. And then our freshman took it
out and it was like oh -- thank you, came back. Always need a little bit of
luck this time of year, too.  
  
CAMRON GHORBI: Thank you, Coach, and congratulations.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Keri Jewitt-Giles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37058)

### [Karl Smesko](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26871)

### [Destiny Washingotn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37057)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
Miami 69, Florida Gulf Coast 62  
  
COACH KARL SMESKO: In the first half, I didn't think that we shot the ball
very well. We wasted some possessions, not getting into some actions, and we
dug ourselves a little bit of a hole.  
  
Proud of the way we fought back in the second half and rallied and gave
ourselves a chance to win the game at the end, but you know, it didn't work
out for us. But I'm proud of the effort our young ladies had and you know,
we'll be back.  
  
Q. Destiny, you guys, it was 7-0 and then it was like 26-14. Every time
you guys got in that situation, you kept coming back. Was it a case of maybe
just spent too much energy kind of going uphill all game in the fourth quarter
during that drought for you guys? Do you think you guys got a little bit worn
down and a little bit tired?  
DESTINY WASHINGTON: No. Basketball is a game of runs and teams are going to go
on runs. Once we saw that they were going up, we knew that it was our turn. I
don't think we were tired. I just think that it's the game of basketball.  
  
Q. Destiny, this was your first NCAA Tournament appearance. Felt like in
the third quarter when you guys were really going on that run; you could see
the emotion on the team. Was that the most fun you've had on a basketball
court, shining on the brightest stage?  
DESTINY WASHINGTON: It was definitely fun. I think the most fun was winning
the conference tournament, but being on the court with these girls all season,
all year, battling, working hard, it's fun for me every day.  
  
So going on that run, it was definitely something special. We just couldn't
finish it out.  
  
Q. Obviously your lone year here at FGCU. If you can reflect on the year
it was for you and your teammates.  
DESTINY WASHINGTON: It was amazing. Coach Smesko recruited me after high
school, and I say every day, I wish I had made that decision to come out of
high school. But I'm very grateful he gave me another chance to come here
because it was unbelievable.  
  
Q. Similar thing. First NCAA Tournament experience, played spectacular
and led the team in scoring. Was that why you came back, for moments like
that?  
KERI JEWITT-GILES: That's a part of it, but just really, just like Dest said,
Coach recruited me out of high school and I didn't make the decision to come
but I'm just glad I returned home because I learned so many things. Just glad
Coach gave me the opportunity to come back and play for him.  
  
Q. You said last week that this may be the last game that you play with
FGCU. Have you had any more time to reflect on that decision?  
KERI JEWITT-GILES: Yeah, actually, this was, I would say, my last game as of
right now, but it's been a heck of a journey. So as of right now, yes, that
was my last game.  
  
Q. You guys had not been down double-digits too many times in year.
Where do your kids find the poise? Were you surprised how well they hung in
there, especially when it looked like it was getting away in the third?  
COACH KARL SMESKO: No, I thought we were capable of playing better and I think
everybody on our team thought we were capable of playing better.  
  
We just needed -- we needed a little bit of a spark, a couple made shots, to
really get things going. You know, I fully -- we called a second half surge,
but we fully anticipated that second half and that third quarter that we were
going to make it a game and. And.  
  
Give our players credit, they made a lot of plays in that third quarter.  
  
Q. We talked yesterday about the parity and I'm not sure of how much you
watched today, but is this the way it's going to be in women's basketball now
where in this first round, anybody pretty much can beat anybody?  
COACH KARL SMESKO: Yeah, I think the teams, the 12s and 11s that are the last
at-larges are really good conference tournament champions who get those
positions. They can beat 4s and 5s.  
  
You know, the system of ranking teams and RPI, it definitely favors bigger
schools. That's what puts you in a position where, you know, you've got to be
on the road like we were.  
  
But this is what we want. We want to be in this tournament. We want to have a
chance to win. We feel like we have a good program that, you know, we're going
to break through and get to the Sweet 16 or better sometime soon. But wasn't
to be today.  
  
I give Miami a lot of credit. When we made the run on them, you know, they
regained composure, made some good plays, some three-point plays. I give a lot
of credit to some kids that don't typically shoot the three a lot. They dared
them to shoot and they knocked it down. So I give them a lot of credit for
making the plays they needed to.  
  
Q. You mentioned that it was a road game, but just the fan support here
from FGCU, what were your thoughts on them, specifically in the third quarter
when you went on that run?  
COACH KARL SMESKO: I mean, I could hear them, that's for sure. They were loud.
They were with us. We brought a lot of people here to the game. I thought, you
know, and Miami, also, had a lot of fans here. I thought it was a great
atmosphere for an NCAA Tournament game.  
  
It's hard for our players to appreciate it right now, because they are
disappointed that they are not moving on, but when they look back at it, when
you have that much energy in a building and play a game that level, it's
something special.  
  
Q. The 1-3-1 zone that they ran gave you guys trouble in 2017. Seemed
like in the second quarter, it made it really tough on you guys. What is it
about that zone in particular that makes it difficult on your offense?  
COACH KARL SMESKO: Well, I would say two things. One, they have got really
long athletes that it's tough to pass the ball around.  
  
And two, you know, we didn't follow the game plan for a little bit, and we did
the opposite of what we said we were going to do. And give them credit. They
put pressure on you, and then you make those types of mistakes.  
  
But you know, that was definitely a situation where we wasted too many
possessions against a 1-3-1 where we didn't get the kind of shots we wanted,
and that helped them get to the two-point lead.  
  
Q. The two women sitting to your left that are now gone, they won't be
back with FGCU, at least according to Keri at the moment. Your thoughts on
their legacy, they only played one year, but the impact it made on this
program?  
COACH KARL SMESKO: Well, they had a great season, that's for sure. They are
both excellent players. We wouldn't be in this situation without them.  
  
Keri has been outstanding and has picked it up even more once we lost Lisa for
the season, and that was a time we really needed her to step up and she was
there for us. Came up big in the conference tournament. Was the tournament
MVP. Had a little bit of a slow start tonight but she really got it going.
Started knocking down some shots. She was someone that really helped us get
back into the game.  
  
And Dest is an outstanding all around player. She's had a great season. She's
an all-conference level player. I wish we had her longer.  
  
Q. You said in the third quarter that you anticipated you would make it
a game. Was that because of adjustments you made or the ebb and flow of the
game that you expected?  
COACH KARL SMESKO: A lot of the time it's not really adjustments so much as it
is reminders of getting back to what we said we were going to do.  
  
I thought when we came out in the third quarter, they were ready to go to get
started, again and when we hit a couple shots early, all of a sudden everybody
was in on the game plan and getting the kind of shots that we were looking to
get and moving the ball a little bit better; catching it; shot-faking;
attacking the paint; moving it to a teammate.  
  
When we had really good ball movement and had things going with being able to
attack off the dribble, get to the paint, we did really well.  
  
When we passed it and stared at the ball and waited on a kid to go one-on-one,
that's not our game. We just wasted too many possessions doing that.  
  
Q. You might have touched on this a little bit, but we noticed you guys
did look a little bit confused in your halfcourt offense at some point in the
second or third quarter. Did you have conversations with the girls about
wanting to push the ball more?  
COACH KARL SMESKO: Well, we wanted to push it every position. We wanted to put
pressure on them in conversion every possession. There were a few possessions
on offense where, you know, we got out of position and didn't talk to one
another. To, you know, run the actions that we were looking to run, and that
just -- that costs you.  
  
You can't -- you're playing a really good team. We did a pretty good job on
possessions. I mean, we forced more turnovers. We didn't give up a ton of
offensive rebounds against a really athletic team, but you can still waste
possessions if you just don't run your offense right or if you don't move the
ball enough.  
  
That was how we -- you know, even though we had a possession advantage, maybe
we wasted too many where we didn't really execute our offense the way we
wanted to.  
  
Q. We now how formidable their front court is, but you touched on it a
bit, that their guards had some big shots to start the fourth quarter and
stretched the lead out with the clock. Was that something you wanted, to limit
their bigs inside as much as possible, but knowing there are some capable
shooters out there and they hit some big shots like you said?  
COACH KARL SMESKO: They definitely have some good shooters, so we were trying
to hold off the kids who don't shoot as many threes to give our post some help
because they do have some dominant posts, and those kids hit shots.  
  
You know, they hit at least four threes from those positions. So you know,
those are the things that are a little bit of a gamble. We typically don't do
that during the season but we thought we needed to help our bigs a little bit.  
  
Although they did a fantastic job defensively, both Dest and Ty. But you know,
this is one of those times where you take a calculated risk and it didn't work
out.

MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Endia Banks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37056)

### [Emese Hof](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32656)

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Beatrice Mompremier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30896)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
Miami 69, Florida Gulf Coast 62  
  
COACH KATIE MEIER: That I just thought it was a tremendous basketball game. We
were so prepared for their run. Emotionally and mentally we were prepared for
it because they are so talented.  
  
You know, they are one of the top three-point shooting teams in the country,
and we held them in check the first half and we knew the second half would
come.  
  
I didn't have like our response. We answered their threes with fatigued
offense and that doesn't something, with, we're lucky we got a way with that
because when they got on that run our answers weren't sharp.  
  
It was two conversations in the huddle before we went up and then I thought we
went back to executing crisply and sharply in the timing of our cuts, and our
guards sort of had more of a command and a posture. But what a great program,
Florida Gulf Coast, what great fan support they have. Everybody knows what a
great coach he is.  
  
They always -- I mean, every year, you know, you just admire them. You just
admire how hard they play and how much guts they have. You know, I wish they
were like, in Alaska so we couldn't draw them, you know, because we seem to
draw them.  
  
This is my third time in the postseason we keep getting them and they are
very, very good. He's just doing a great job down there.  
  
As far as my team, Endia, what did you say you are now? Big Shot Banks,
Playoff Banks? She just carried us. Obviously Emese and Bea have been carrying
us all year but Endia was the X-factor by 1000 percent. The timing of her
shots and her defensive rebounding.  
  
But I think every shot she hit was huge for us. It was an answer. You in never
find a teammate that cares more about her team, in fact, than they are coaches
than Endia Banks. She is like the warm fire on this team. Like she cares and
cares and cares and cares and gives and gives and gives, and we needed her,
and so she came through.  
  
Q. Endia, what about these big moments makes you shine on this stage?
The words Coach just said, what is it about these big moments?  
ENDIA BANKS: I just feel like that the team needs me the most, like, when
it's, like, big-time. So I just try to be there for them, like when they need
me the most and today just happened to be one of those days.  
  
Q. For Beatrice, when they made that run, the team huddled. What did you
talk about when they made that run?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: Just stay composed and everything we worked for in
practice would carry us on throughout the rest of the game. So just stay
composed and be confident. Be confident.  
  
Q. Coach talked a lot yesterday about how this was going to be a style
game. They are a three-point shooting team and you are relying on your bigs
all year long. How do you combat the three-point shooting?  
THE MODERATOR: Emese, maybe you could start with that one.  
  
EMESE HOF: We worked a lot on it in practice. We had some schemes, but in the
end it was just everyone had to be able to guard on the perimeter and
alternate times, they got it, and they got us and at times I think we had a
very solid D and it was there.  
  
So in the end, it worked in our favor.  
  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: We had to run them off the line, not let them shoot easy
open shots.  
  
ENDIA BANKS: I feel like what Emese said, we just had to run them off the
line.  
  
COACH KATIE MEIER: Great I won't be by running but the wall-ups at the end, 37
defense rebounds, that's ridiculous. That's a real big number for us, and I
thought that that was the game. It was these three right here that were
crushing the defensive glass for us, and really important rebounds.  
  
Q. Emese, what are your thoughts for Sunday's last home game and Arizona
State?  
EMESE HOF: I have to say, I wasn't thinking there yet. We are thinking one
game at a time. It's going to be special and it's a great opponent. We're
going to give it our all, and that's all we can do, and I'm very excited for
it, and it that we have another game to look forward to.  
  
Q. Do you know anything about Arizona State? One of the top player's
names happens to be I-B-I-S that you guys are familiar with.  
COACH KATIE MEIER: They have not talked about anybody.  
  
ENDIA BANKS: One game at a time. One game at a time.  
  
EMESE HOF: I know they three-point pretty good.  
  
Q. How about man-to-man? They are very tenacious man-to-man. Do you feel
comfortable against a really tenacious man-to-man defense?  
ENDIA BANKS: I felt like that's our type of game plan, man-to-man defense. I
mean, when they play man-to-man, we can either -- we can shoot and then we
have two big that is we can throw it into and just work up.  
  
COACH KATIE MEIER: Florida Gulf Coast played a really tough man-to-man.
Everybody talks about their three-point shooting. They are a superb defensive
team. Absolutely superb.  
  
Q. Just for anyone up there. The crowd tonight, how big of a factor was
that when FGCU came back, they were able to tie it up and even took the lead?
How was it rallying around that home crowd?  
BEATRICE MOMPREMIER: Honestly, I guess they hyped us up, too. You know, when
they scored, the crowd went crazy and when we scored our crowd went crazy. We
had more, I guess.  
  
Q. Again, to any of the three players. You will have a decided home-
court advantage on Sunday. Not a lot of travels from Arizona State. How do you
think that will boost you guys?  
EMESE HOF: I hope everyone who came out tonight is going to come out again and
we're going to have an even bigger advantage of having them in our corner.
It's great when they are loud there, they are loud and today, too, it was in
between their fans and our fans. Like they were rioting --  
  
ENDIA BANKS: Not really.  
  
EMESE HOF: Sounds good. It's great when we have fans out here and our students
are behind us and it's just good. And against Arizona State, like they are not
going to have a lot of people traveling down here, so that's going to be in
our advantage.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you all. Congratulations.  
  
COACH KATIE MEIER: Go to bed.  
  
Q. There were several close calls today. What does it say about the
state of women's college basketball?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: I don't understand. Close calls in my game or --  
  
Q. Other games. Your game.  
COACH KATIE MEIER: That's great, isn't it? I mean, you know, you're sitting
there watching -- I tried not to watch too much because for me to stay awake
at 9:30 is a big deal.  
  
So my energy, I just -- I was watching some games, Carolyn Kieger's game who
plays here and coached with me here. And so I had my eye on some games but I
tried to not because they were so emotional, Iowa and Drake. These games were
just crazy and I was glancing at them but I really tried to stay away because
I knew this was going to be a close game too, and I wanted to have all my
focus and energy.  
  
You know, but for women's basketball, it's fantastic.  
  
Q. You mentioned the first half, fatigue offense --  
COACH KATIE MEIER: Third quarter.  
  
Q. You cut down on the turnovers after that. What changed in the game?
Turnover-wise?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: From which to which?  
  
Q. From before you got the 11 turnovers in the first half, only four in
the second. What changed?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: Oh, well, in the third quarter, we were playing so slow,
there were no possessions. I was fine with 11 turnovers, but they weren't --
there's a vulnerability, okay. So a bad shot's a turnover, too. That's what we
did in the third, so we didn't turn it over but we took tired jumpers and we
ran tired offense. So those bad shots, their fastbreak points in the third
quarter were from horrible shots and that's a turnover in our book, okay. So
we crossed halfcourt; we have the ball we want to score; we get an offensive
rebound, whatever.  
  
You know, it's a possession game for them, and that just fueled them and some
-- sometimes you'd rather travel and have a dead ball turnover than have them
set again. I thought our zone traps were really good tonight, and we just kept
giving them live possession, live possession, live possession, off the back of
the rim, off the front of the rim, nobody rebounded, nobody getting back, and
it hurt us lot and.  
  
We had not played in two weeks and that's a factor. It's very, very hard to
keep your team fresh during that break. Just the way our conference breaks it
down. But you could tell their third quarter legs were there, and our players
were like, don't have my legs. Yeah, it's hard to mimic a game.  
  
Q. Looking ahead, Sunday, I'm sure you've done some studying.  
COACH KATIE MEIER: No, I have not.  
  
Q. Not at all?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: No, I have not.  
  
Q. I'm sure aware of some of their top players --  
COACH KATIE MEIER: I know they are great players -- I'm not lying to you. You
have no idea how important this game was and where my focus was.  
  
Q. But does Gulf Coast give you kind of a good preparation for the next
opponent because of the three-point shooting, because of man-to-man?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: So did Syracuse -- we've had quite a schedule, so I'm going
to pick through it. I'll have some bags under my eyes tomorrow but my
assistant coach, Tia Jackson, she's fantastic and she's got the scout. We had
a little five-minute meeting real quick before I came in here to give me a
rundown.  
  
But I've played against -- I've coached against Charli before. I think she's
just the greatest. I have so much admiration for her. I know how she runs her
program. I know how their defense works. We're not looking ahead.  
  
Q. And you respect the Pac-10, I'm sure?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: I absolutely. I do absolutely do.  
  
Q. What impressed you the most how the team responded after their run?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: That's the thing that's going to get lost in all this,
except for the people who know Florida Gulf Coast and they know, oh, my God
they are not hitting the threes in the first half and then they started
hitting it and that's going to be a problem for Miami; what are they going to
do with the bigs.  
  
The whole problem showed up in the third quarter, the matchup issue. But the
maturity, there's a lot of pressure. I mean, we're playing at home. We're
supposedly such a higher seed. We knew they are a great team and I think we
prepared our team for a close game the whole time.  
  
I was like, oh, boy, ladies it's going to come down to special situations. I
never thought this would be a runaway game. So when we got to that moment and
we put our fours up for the fourth quarter, when we put our fours up, I said,
we're good. I really felt that they were mature and we've been in this
situation before and we were going to start making some plays and getting some
stops. I really just saw it in my team, their spirit. They weren't beaten.
They were faithful.  
  
Q. I know we ask the student athletes about the home crowd. How cool was
it, second time in three years?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: Yeah, I couldn't -- I just want to hug everyone who came
out. Like I'm so grateful. I'm so grateful. You know, I had a moment, just
personally, for the journey that has been Miami and the building and the
building and the building and the dream and can we ever do this and will we
break through.  
  
I felt like, you know, I was really emotional just real quick right before the
game just being out of pride and just gratitude for the administration and the
student body. There are times when it just gets very humbling and you just
really appreciate the support and that was one of them for sure and it helped
us win.  
  
Q. I don't know if you got a chance to hook at the student second but
Manny Diaz was in the front row. There were numerous student athletes from
other sports. How special is that knowing you're getting support from other
teams?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: Any time I need a re-Tweet I retext many and I said,
"Manny, help me out, buddy." He's right there for me. He's so all-in to the
culture that's Miami. I use his phrase, the meat off the bone with our
defensive rebounding from our guards. I steal stuff from him because he's
special. I appreciate that.  
  
I saw a lot of athletes, a lot of people. Coach L. Texted me said he's on the
road recruiting but he would have been here. It's a family down here. But
people know what it means, you know.  
  
But the other thing, too, is we are very grateful. We say thanks. Thanks for
coming. Sometimes that doesn't happen in Big Ten college athletics, but we
love the support and we need it..  
  
Q. Don't want to cast a pall on the victory, but how upset to go see
what happened in front of your locker room before?  
COACH KATIE MEIER: I don't want to talk about that. Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach Meier. Congratulations.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Katie Abrahamson-
Henderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26935)

### [Nyala Shuler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36954)

### [Kay Kay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36953)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
Arizona State 60, UCF 45  
  
COACH KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: The first thing I want to say is I'm very
proud. I mean, what these young women have accomplished this year is just
overwhelmingly, I'm just filled with joy that they pretty much have
accomplished every single goal that we set out at the beginning of the year.  
  
You know, this program is only -- with me here at UCF, we've only been here
three years and third year in the NCAA Tournament with an at-large bid which
doesn't happen very much. You know, I think a lot of people will say, well,
that's the coaches.  
  
Well, it's not. It's the players. The players bought in. The players worked
really, really hard. Yeah, we gave them a really good system to play in but
they had to do it. They had to step up there every single night and go out
there and play and just fight and be great teammates and stick together and
have great energy.  
  
Our slogan for this year was "energy, effort and selfless," and I mean, if you
watch our team and you watch the bench and you watch how we play, that's what
we were all year long so I'm very, very proud of them.  
  
I told them -- you know, it hurt really bad because they don't want to lose.
They didn't want to lose but I told them to get their heads up because
especially our seven seniors, what they have done for this program is just
really amazing.  
  
Obviously we're fortunate to have Kay Kay Wright coming back next year and
months any and some of our younger players, and it's kind of funny and fitting
that our freshmen, that's all they know. That's all they know now is winning
and going to the NCAA Tournament, which is awesome, right. They don't know
anything different. But Nyala and Kay Kay were here our first year and they
had to go through a lot of changes to get to this point, so I'm just very
proud.  
  
Q. Their tournament experience, they are tournament-tough and you guys
haven't been the last three, four years. Did that have a different in a high-
pressure game like this?  
KAY KAY WRIGHT: I don't think experience was a downfall for us. I just think
some shots didn't fall early on and we didn't get enough stops as we should
have but I think we are prepared for this moment. Our coaches had a great game
plan for us. We were ready for this game and I think if we would have hit some
more shots early on, it would have been different.  
  
Q. Seemed like you might have been a little uptight in the first quarter
or they were keying on, high scorer on the team. Do you feel they were keying
on you more so than the other players in?  
KAY KAY WRIGHT: I think they had a pretty good game plan to deny me the ball
sometimes and they were successful at it. I just had to be more aggressive in
the second half and really focus on getting open and my teammates did a good
job of handling that pressure, as well, and running the plays. Lawriell and
Jamesha Paul, they ran the plays for me, so I think it wasn't so bad.  
  
Q. For either player. You guys were down 22 I think with minute to go in
the third and a lot of teams would have folded the tent at that point, and you
guys kept fighting. What's it say about this group that you guys -- I think
you got it to 12 at one point in the fourth, even getting down that big, that
really seemed to be the best effort of the night.  
KRISTEN YOON: Nyala, maybe you could start with that one?  
  
NYALA SHULER: Well, Coach has -- we would huddle whenever there was a dead
ball and we were just talking to each other, whenever somebody was down, we
had a great teammate, somebody was picking us up and we just decided that we
weren't going to go out on a bad note and we were going to play hard and give
it our all.  
  
CAMRON GHORBI: Thank you. You guys are dismissed.  
  
Q. The two 3s to start the third quarter, how big a momentum shift was
that? I'm sure you're hoping to win the first five minutes but when she got
loose for those two 3s early, what did that do to the game plan at that
point?  
COACH KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: Exactly what you saw. I just think they set
some good in screens on us and she got loose -- I don't know her name, No. 1,
does a great job of finding No. 22 and getting some open shots.  
  
Obviously the shooter that she is, those are big shots to, hit those shots and
games in this atmosphere and this gym, those are big shots for her.  
  
Q. How tough do you rate their man-to-man defense? Is that the toughest
you've seen all season?  
COACH KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: It's not, but obviously we play that other
team in our conference and their defense is really good and Cincinnati's
defense is really good and I can go on. People play Kay Kay like that all the
time. I think what hurt us honestly is we got in some foul trouble, and we had
a lot of people on the bench and that doesn't really help our situation.  
  
Kay Kay had some fouls, but we weren't doing a great job of scoring in there
when Mass -- because you saw when Mass and Nyala were in the game, we were
getting high-lows and getting a lot of options and Mass is going to work
offensively.  
  
Brittney Smith is going to be a great player for us, No. 32, she's. A freshman
now, but we have a lot of confidence in her. She was getting the ball and make
something moves, but she was missing her shots, right. So you saw the
difference a little bit between her and Moss. So I think it really just hurt
having those two in foul trouble.  
  
Q. Back to 22. Do you feel like her UCONN experience showed tonight, two
years with UCONN before she transferred?  
COACH KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: Okay. Wow. I don't know. You'd have to ask
her that.  
  
Q. I know you're 20 minutes removed from the game so it's probably
unfair to ask a broad question, but --  
COACH KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: Sorry, I can't hear you.  
  
Q. 26-7 this year, and at-large, like you said, they are not easy to
get.  
COACH KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: Yeah.  
  
Q. Are you kind of ahead of schedule, do you think?  
COACH KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: My team or me? Like my -- you know, we did
this at Albany, too, pretty quickly and I think I talked to you about it at
the beginning.  
  
Just I've been pleased to be around a lot of great coaches that have had to
rebuild programs, Bill Finley; Joanne P. McCallie, I've been part of
rebuilding -- twice with Joanne. So I was kind of used to going in and doing
that kind of thing.  
  
And so did I think we could get here immediately in the first year and second
year like we did at Albany? No. But I thought maybe we could have last year
but our injuries really hurt us. Fifi and Tolu were out and Kayla Thigpen had
to play the four for us and we had some great players in Saunders and Gregory,
they were phenomenal scorers.  
  
So if we would have had more post power, I'll call it, last year, maybe we
could have been here, and I think that stung a little bit for our team.  
  
It really helped us this year, just preseason, getting in shape, getting in
the gym, everybody being focused. Just knowing we had strength in numbers.  
  
My coaching staff are doing a great job of just repeating that a lot: Strength
in numbers, strength in numbers, strength in numbers. It didn't help that we
didn't have Fifi again this year to play a lot but every team has injuries and
things, and I just think our team and our coaches did a great job of just
sticking together, working hard, staying focused on our goals.  
  
And it's really the hard work. I kind of joke at our team and say, it's an old
cliché, but at the end of championships or the end of people's great careers,
you know, when they win that championship or they get to where they want, they
are crying, not just because they are so happy, but they are crying because
they have worked so hard and they have accomplished so many goals and they
don't want it to be over because it feels so good to win a championship or
feels so good to be into the NCAA Tournament, feels so good to win the game
they never thought they could win. It because they worked really, really hard
at it.  
  
CAMRON GHORBI: Thank you, Coach, and congratulations on your season.

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30388)

### [Courtney Ekmark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34204)

### [Charnea Johnson-
Chapman](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34783)

### [Kianna Ibis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34725)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up first today is Arizona State.  
  
Coach, if you'd like to start with an opening statement.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I read right after the bracket, I'm not sure who said
it, but we were the biggest loser for our draw. I've been doing this long
enough to know that any appearance in the NCAA tournament is really, really
special. We don't mind traveling. There are no easy brackets or easy games.
We're just really excited to be here.  
  
I'm from Los Angeles so I can relate to the traffic. I don't know about these
guys. But no, we obviously have a veteran team that has been here before but
does not take this for granted.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kianna, you have been most successful this year when the defense
really seems to be at a certain high gear. Every coach would tell you that's
the key to winning this time of year. How important is that that it's already
in your DNA?  
KIANNA IBIS: I mean, having a coach that really coaches us and prepares us to
be, like, our best defensively always helps us in every single game we play
because we always find enough points to win. Having our defense be the kind of
identity of our team I would say is kind of an advantage, especially going
into the tournament.  
  
Not many people know how we play. I feel like it's an advantage for us.  
  
Q. Courtney, we've been through the trials and the road of the Pac-12.
We know how difficult the conference is. How do you feel playing in the Pac-12
against so many quality programs has helped prepare you for the NCAAs?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: It's a great question. I definitely think playing a tough
conference schedule is going to help us. We've played against the top teams in
the nation. We've beaten some of them. I think that's really going to carry us
through this tournament.  
  
Q. Charnea, obviously three veterans here on the dais. The key aspect of
the season has been the bench, averaging over 23 points a game. How key has
that been?  
CHARNEA JOHNSON-CHAPMAN: I think our bench is doing a great job. They come
every day in practice, even when we have shootarounds, they are focused and
ready to go. They know it's next-man-up at any point. I think when they come
off the bench, they're ready to go, and it's shown.  
  
Q. Obviously with five starters returning, tons of veterans on this
team, how much has the experience of the team, not only the competition you
played, but the team internally played a role in the successful season you've
had?  
KIANNA IBIS: I mean, being able to go through this experience, like, four
times that I've been here, that only helps. It's always different because you
never know what to expect, then you do, especially with any team you play.  
  
I think having the experience and being able to help our freshmen, the new
players on our team who haven't experienced this, it always helps when we can
help them, as well.  
  
COURTNEY EKMARK: I agree with Kianna. To add to that, us being seniors, we
know it's our last time. We're going to give it everything we have. We also
know going through this so many times is not every game is guaranteed in
March. Right now it's win-or-go-home. It's serious.  
  
CHARNEA JOHNSON-CHAPMAN: Add on to what Courtney said, having so many people
return, veterans, our team knows it's go big or go home now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will excuse the student-athletes and go into questions for
Coach Turner Thorne.  
  
Q. You said you're excited to play anywhere, you don't mind traveling. I
don't know if you can use it as motivation, you're here with three Florida
teams, also time change, can that be some motivation for your team?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: We don't really operate that way. I mean, maybe for some
teams. I think for us, I'll have to share this, I have three sons, my youngest
son is a basketball fanatic, taking a redeye tomorrow night to come to be at
the games. We're very grateful. We're good with the draw.  
  
But he was very fired up because he's reading all the stuff. I'm not going to
say what he said about the committee, because I had to clear him up on that
and everything.  
  
No, I don't. The trend of the tournament is keep the higher seeds, the 14s
through 16s, in their regions because we're trying to have this great
experience. Miami has to play Florida Gulf Coast. That's a tough game, a local
team. That's kind of the way the tournament is being structured right now.  
  
I was pretty sure, been doing this a long time, yeah, we're going east. I was
thinking maybe North Carolina on that neutral site. But it's all good. If you
want to progress, we want to progress in this tournament, you got to beat top
teams. For the women's tournament, that means on their home floor unless
you're hosting. We were probably a game or two away from earning that
opportunity. We get that.  
  
We've been a good road team all year. Beating Oregon State, that is one of the
toughest places you will ever play, at Oregon State. It's not going to be
anything this team hasn't experienced with their fans here. I think they said
we'll have no fans. We're going to have some fans, just so you know. We have
some people coming out.  
  
Basketball is about matchups. It's an interesting first game for us with
Central Florida. Pressing the end zone the entire game, it's a little
different. We've been preparing for that. We'll be prepared for that.
Depending on after that, we'll see.  
  
Katie does a phenomenal job. She's a really good coach. They're a veteran team
like us. A lot of similarities. Great defensive team, veteran team. Should be
a really fun game.  
  
Q. It's not uncommon in the women's game for a team to have a really
long break between conference and NCAA. How do you deal with that? It's what
you have to deal with. Is it ideal? How did you deal with the 14 days?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: So when this first happened, I actually called Sylvia
Hatchell. I talked to a few coaches, used to having longer breaks. In the
Pac-12 we bumped up our season. Early on in my career, play your last game --
I remember because I had a baby, three days later we were traveling for NCAAs.
It would have been great to have that two weeks however many years ago.  
  
Now I wouldn't know what to do without it. We're used to having the extra rest
time, the extra practice time. It is a little bit nerve-wracking because you
try to stay healthy, but you want to practice and stay sharp.  
  
In the middle we do a scrimmage game against our scout team, bring officials
in. That's the best thing I have found to kind of keep us sharp. Then just
have days where you limit contact.  
  
Yeah, going that long without a game, it's like, Okay, hope we're ready.
Again, this team has done that, so I think we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Six straight 21 seasons, six straight NCAA tournament appearances.
Both school records. How proud are you of this group? What does that say about
them to be setting school marks in such notable categories?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I think we have 15 out of the 17 years post-season.
We've had a great staff. We've had great players that have come in and joined
our family, our culture, bought in to who we are, what we do. It's really fun.  
  
Obviously incredibly proud of the players, what they've been able to
accomplish at their time at ASU. Going to hopefully keep it going.  
  
Q. You're focused on UCF tomorrow. Indulge me and speak broadly for a
second. I love the women's game. This is the first time that I can remember
there might be legitimately eight or ten teams that could be the last one
standing. Has parity arrived? How good is that that it's not going to be
basically the same four teams in the Final Four?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I think last year was one of the best Final Fours in
terms of the overtime games. It's been coming. The parity has been coming,
getting better and better.  
  
Sometimes with media coverage, it doesn't always reflect how much parity there
is in the game. UConn, great program, done a ton for the game. They're a 2
seed. Hopefully it's opening people's eyes to the level of parity in the game.  
  
Going into this season, as coaches, we're looking around, This is pretty wide
open. We played Baylor the second game of the year, played Louisville two
weeks later. We had a controversial one-possession game with Louisville. We're
looking around going, Okay, yes.  
  
It's fantastic for the game. Players are getting better and better. The
commitment by administrations, by everybody, to women's basketball has been
amazing. I've been fortunate enough over the last 30 years to see immense
growth. Hopefully we'll see it in the tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Karl Smesko](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26871)

### [Keri Jewett-Giles](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36974)

### [Nasrin Ulel](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36975)

### [Destiny Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36976)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up last but not least today is FGCU.  
  
We will start with an opening statement from Coach Smesko.  
  
KARL SMESKO: We're happy to be here. We got a great challenge ahead of us
playing a great team in the University of Miami. We're excited for the
opportunity and hopefully we'll make the most of it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Smesko.  
  
Q. The other three teams here, their conference tournaments all ended
between 11 and 14 days ago. You guys typically go into the day before
selection Monday. Have you found that's an advantage in keeping your team in a
rhythm?  
KARL SMESKO: We've done it both ways. I know the first time we went to the
NCAA tournament, we had a much longer layoff.  
  
I like it like this. There's nothing to test you for big games like a big
game. You wouldn't want to do it the day before. Not to have more than a week
layoff I think is ideal. I like the way we do it in our conference.  
  
Q. The nine kids you played here two years ago, only one will play
tomorrow. Is the way that game ended still a rallying cry for this team at
all? Are they familiar? Is it ancient history?  
KARL SMESKO: There weren't many of the players that were really involved in
that, so we have a couple people that are familiar with the ending, coming up
just short, being really disappointed.  
  
For most of our team, for a lot of our team, this is their first time in the
NCAA tournament, for a lot of our transfer players. They're just excited to be
a part of it. Hopefully they'll be prepared and have a great showing.  
  
I don't think anything that happened two years ago is going to have any impact
tomorrow.  
  
Q. It's a different year in women's basketball. Many times for the first
round of the tournament, who is going to lose to UConn at the end. This year
there's 10 or more teams that have a fair chance of winning. How much has
women's basketball needed that parity at the top?  
KARL SMESKO: I definitely think it's helpful. I'm a big fan of UConn. They've
been outstanding. They've set the bar at the highest level. But it makes for
more drama when there's more teams that have a realistic chance of winning the
whole thing.  
  
This year there's so many teams that have beat the best teams in the country.
You look at Miami, they have an excellent team. They also beat two No. 1
seeds. They're capable of making a deep run.  
  
As you said, this year, it's more wide open than it's been. I can't remember
the last time it's been this wide open, where you wouldn't have a really heavy
favorite going into the tournament. I think it's good for women's basketball.  
  
I think this will be a great tournament. The last two years the Final Fours
have been remarkable, how well they were played, how exciting the games were.
I'm hoping that women's basketball just keeps building and more fans
appreciate the quality of the product. I'm expecting another great tournament
this year.  
  
Q. So many new faces this year. What was the point in the year where you
started feeling comfortable they were getting the system, what it takes for
you to compete?  
KARL SMESKO: It was probably after Christmas. I saw them start to improve on
the defensive end where we were struggling earlier in the year. By the time we
got to January, we looked like we were playing FGCU basketball at that time.
It took a semester to get everybody kind of understanding their roles, how
they can be productive within the system, what we're looking for, what we're
not.  
  
I think we've played pretty well since January.  
  
Q. 11-3 away from Fort Myers this year. When you start to go about
designing a schedule, challenging yourself on the road, how much of that
mentality is designed to set you up to be successful beginning tomorrow?  
KARL SMESKO: To be honest, I'd like to take credit for it, but it's usually
not by design. We usually play the teams that agree to play us, then try to
fit it in a schedule. I could have great plans, It would be great if we play
these teams, develop this. The truth is, you have to find other teams that
will agree to play you.  
  
Typically in our non-conference schedule the teams that will agree to play us
are often really good, really good mid-majors who can't find a game, or a BCS
program that feels like this will be a great RPI game for us, we still feel
like we can win. That's kind of how the schedule comes together.  
  
I do think the fact each year we play in a major tournament, this year in
Hawaii we had to play Stanford, that gets our kids accustomed to playing the
big BCS teams so we're not surprised once we get on the floor against Miami.  
  
Q. Eagles this year have done a great job of starting fast. Entering the
fourth quarter, you're usually in a good position. How much has that been a
point of emphasis? How will that play a role over the next couple days?  
KARL SMESKO: Last time we were here, we started really slow. We didn't shoot
the ball well in the first half. I just think getting off to a good start
helps everybody's confidence and helps everybody ease into the game a lot
better than if it looks like you're struggling early.  
  
You can always keep fighting and get back in the game, but the sooner
everybody starts to get adjusted to the speed, gets accustomed to the
physicality of the game, they're able to be successful, I think the better off
you are.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Smesko.  
  
KARL SMESKO: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by FGCU student-athletes. Questions, please.  
  
Q. Destiny, I don't think it was a real big surprise when the brackets
came out that you were coming here. After Sunday, were you really expecting
this was where you were going to be?  
DESTINY WASHINGTON: We weren't really thinking about it at that point. We were
just worried about winning the game, enjoying each other's company. After
that, we pretty much knew where we were going to go.  
  
Q. What have the last four days been like getting ready for this, a
couple of really talented bigs?  
DESTINY WASHINGTON: It's just been making sure we were locked in and focused.
We have a really big emphasis on not letting them into the post. As long as we
focus on what we're supposed to do, I think we'll be fine.  
  
Q. Keri, last year's post-season success, this program really has raised
the bar, how much did last year's win, upsetting Missouri, this team knows
what it takes to win in the post-season, how much can you build off that?  
KERI JEWETT-GIBBS: It just gives us a lot of confidence and belief that
anything is possible. No matter the seed, no matter what team it is, just
because it's a name, anybody is beatable in March.  
  
Q. Nasrin, there are only two players on the team who averaged double-
digits, but several with more than six points per game. Discuss the balance of
the team, how important you think that is for this team.  
NASRIN ULEL: I think the greatest thing about our team is that on any given
day, anyone can have a really good game. We're really good about sharing the
ball. If somebody is having a really good offensive game, we're willing to
give them the ball. It's not really like we only have two people that are
scoring double-digits, but everyone has had big games for us. Our bench is
very good for us.  
  
It's just fun knowing that anyone can just play within our system and do well.  
  
Q. Smesko's system is what it is, unusual. What is it like feeling at
this point in the year you finally might have it close to mastered? How much
better off is this team when it starts to click?  
NASRIN ULEL: I don't think we really have it mastered yet (laughter). We try
our best to play, just take the shots that we know are really efficient and
are good for our team. We emphasize taking really good shots.  
  
We want the other team to take the tough shots, tough twos, force them to do
things that are low, like returns. We try to let them take bad shots, just
take what we do, threes and layups. We win doing that many years, so...  
  
Q. Keri, the team was 11-3 away from Fort Myers this year. The team has
won on the road, beaten good teams away from home. How much confidence does
that give the team?  
KERI JEWETT-GIBBS: We have a lot of confidence going in just being able to
overcome anything we've been through, especially on the road. A lot of people
think it's hard to win on the road. Coach gives us a game plan and we just
execute it. We have a lot of faith.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for joining us.

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Katie Meier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23619)

### [Laura Cornelius](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32696)

### [Emese Hof](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32656)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Up third today is Miami.  
  
We will start with an opening comment from Coach Meier.  
  
KATIE MEIER: Well, we are very aware of the honor. I believe we earned it.
We're very humbled and appreciative to be able to host. We want to thank the
committee for recognizing our body of work, for letting us show off our
university, our amazing fan support and our tremendous administration. We're
fired up about that.  
  
It's an entire university deal here, not just a women's basketball program.
One of the first people you hear from is the president of the university
congratulating you, then you have the athletic department rallying to get fans
and support. It's something that we're all sharing right now. I'm happy for us
to be the window to this amazing department.  
  
We're thrilled and we welcome all the teams that are here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Meier.  
  
Q. You've been able to examine the film of your opponent. What are your
thoughts on the first-round matchup?  
KATIE MEIER: They're fantastic. I mean, everybody is going to say, They're
better than their seed. They are. They are. They're fantastic. I mean, I had
to go back three months ago to see them lose. I've never had to do that.  
  
They're on a great streak. They're dangerous, threatening. They're really a
lot more athletic in terms of their speed, how dangerous their defense is,
than people are giving them credit for.  
  
They're not just relying on the three-point shot. It's an incredible weapon.
Obviously it's a tough matchup for us. They're probably saying, Those bigs are
a tough matchup for them. Stylistically it's going to be an interesting game.
I think a lot of eyes are going to be on this particular game because if
you're in women's basketball, you know how good Gulf Coast is. Hey, Miami,
paying attention? We are. We know.  
  
Q. You said a month ago before the Notre Dame game this team was coming
together the way you envisioned it. Do wins against Notre Dame, Pittsburgh,
then Louisville, ranked No. 2 at the time, does that prepare you for moments
like this?  
KATIE MEIER: I mean, you can't take those wins away from us. If they show up
tomorrow, they'll show up in a non-panic, in a faith. I love confidence, but
sometimes that comes and goes. I think faith is just confidence with a lot of
patience to it.  
  
We know what we've accomplished this year. We know the games that we've won.
When we're on the ropes a little bit, which we will be, I believe we'll be
faithful and not say, My shot is off. We found ways to win not hitting. Their
defense... We've seen this defense before.  
  
We have that in our bag and you can't take that away from this team. We really
need that.  
  
Q. Two of your players, Laura, Emese, they've had exposure
internationally. The two of them are connected in many ways. Does that help
you when you go into a tournament like this where they've been in pressure
situations?  
KATIE MEIER: Yeah, there's moments. They're leaders. It's not just their
experience. We're very close. We've grown up a little bit together, too. I
mean, I first saw them when they were 16 years old in Lithuania. That's when I
first saw them. They're playing on a U19 team. Still 16? They were playing
three years up. We were the USA team, up-and-comers. I loved them the first
time I saw them.  
  
I've seen them fight. I've seen them grow. It's a six- or seven-year deal now.
They're very special to me. We turn to each other for other things. It's been
a wonderful journey. They mean the world to me.  
  
Yes, they're experienced, smart, know where the ball should go. If they're
feeling good, Miami usually plays really well.  
  
Q. A lot of broadcasts or reaction from opposing head coaches throughout
the season, instantly the remarks are about having Emese and Beatrice. Coaches
have described it as a luxury having two post players that are as good as they
are. Have you ever had a duo quite like them?  
KATIE MEIER: No. No. Because they share the ball. It's not like we have these
two bigs and that's all we do. They share the ball, put the ball where it
needs to go. That's something Beatrice completely developed since she's been
here. Last year, sitting out, watching our style of play, phrases,
philosophies, value in this program, Miami shots, Miami shots. Look at their
shooting percentages, they don't force.  
  
As good as they are, they're great basketball players. They just happen to be
tall. I think sometimes people miss that about those two. They're brilliant.
They're brilliant players.  
  
Q. Two coaches who came up here before you talked about their veteran
leadership. It feels like age has been kind of neutralized in this regional as
far as teams with post-season experience. For your own group, what can they
draw on from their previous NCAA experiences?  
KATIE MEIER: There's pressure and there's stress. The biggest job of a coach
in the NCAA tournament is to make sure the pressure is high and the stress is
low. That hinges on preparation, a little bit of faith.  
  
The same moment can cause you to stress out or you can be like, That's
pressure. I feel like pressure brings you to your highest level. That's what
we're trying to do.  
  
There's internal pressure, now we have external pressure. Can we find our zone
within that. Veterans get that. When you say that speech, the speech I gave
two days ago in the film room, the freshmen say, What does that mean? They
don't have a reference point.  
  
Everyone in this tournament, most of the players, get that. They get it. They
understand that zone that we got to operate in.  
  
Q. You've been in different situations.  
KATIE MEIER: Define that, please.  
  
Q. Different games.  
KATIE MEIER: Yes, I have.  
  
Q. On the road, underdog, favorite. Are you superstitious in any way? Do
you go through a ritual? If it's worked, you keep doing it?  
KATIE MEIER: 'Routine' is my word, right? Yes, absolutely I have a routine.
It's not superstition. You're guaranteed about 30 if you're lucky, 35 games a
year as a coach. You get that. They last about two hours. I have 70 hours
that's going to define my 365 days, my sports staff, players. Those 70 hours
I'm going to be awesome. In order to be awesome in those hours, I want to have
a routine.  
  
We believe in that. If it gets a little bit upset, we can deal with it. In
terms of saying, This is my comfort zone, what we need to do... It will be
very much the same. I think that's just a way to make sure emotionally you're
good. I owe it to this university to be great 70 hours a year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, Coach Meier.  
  
KATIE MEIER: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Miami student-athletes, Laura Cornelius and
Emese Hof. We'll go right into questions.  
  
Q. About a month ago your head coach said she felt this team was coming
together. Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, Louisville. Was that the point where you
really felt this team had come together?  
EMESE HOF: I think that was kind of like the turning point. After that we had
some losses which were also, like, huge lessons for things we are not going to
do any more this season.  
  
I think that's when we saw, like, what we could actually do. Then after that,
it was just like building on that path, getting where we are today.  
  
LAURA CORNELIUS: Those wins really helped build our confidence. Our team
chemistry has been amazing. That confidence, you can tell from practice that
we really believe in each other, we believe in our game plan. We've played in
pretty close games. Both of them were close all the way down the stretch.  
  
I think we're definitely taking all of that experience into March right now,
into this tournament.  
  
Q. The two of you know how big of a tournament this is, to host is even
bigger. You've been together since 15, 16. You know each other's tendencies.
Does playing on a national level, international, help carry over to a
tournament like this?  
EMESE HOF: I do think it helps because you face a lot of different teams and
play styles. How big the tournament is, how much alive it is is nothing
compared to what we have seen on a World Championship or European
Championship.  
  
I do think it helped us, developed us as players, get skilled, see different
defenses. Yeah, the skill of the March Madness here is not really comparable
to anything we've seen before.  
  
LAURA CORNELIUS: Back home we played in big-time basketball games. It's hard
to compare them to these. What we can take away, definitely I don't get as
nervous any more because I've been there before. I don't know how that is for
you, Emese. It's hard to compare, but just excitement. That's really it for
these upcoming games.  
  
Q. Laura, how important is it when you're playing games in March to have
experience?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: It's extremely important. I really think, I truly believe, in
March, in order to be successful, obviously you have to have great talent. You
have to have people who can get a stop on defense and can score the ball. I
think we have a mix of that.  
  
Every team in March always has to have an X factor. I think our team is built
up for that. We definitely have great leadership, great talent. We're just
striving to make that come all together in these upcoming games.  
  
Q. Emese, Coach Meier had to go back three months to find a loss. How
hard is it to play a team that knows how to win? How much does that play into
it, make sure you need to be on point tomorrow?  
EMESE HOF: It's March, so every game is going to be tough. It's hard -- not
hard, but different to come into a game, to play someone who hasn't lost in a
long time. I think it was December. They're going to come in here, try to win
it because that's what they're used to.  
  
We're not going to let that happen.  
  
Q. Is there something about this team that we don't know about that has
carried you to this belief that you can beat Notre Dame at home, beat
Louisville, no matter who it is, the odds stacked against you?  
EMESE HOF: I think that's hard to say. I think our team is very loving. We're
all very caring about each other. We had a lot of people coming back from
injuries this year. Just the belief and the will to be better, play for each
other, that's really coming out.  
  
I think that's, like, one of our strengths.  
  
LAURA CORNELIUS: For me coming back to that X factor I just talked about, in
the upset win over Notre Dame, Taylor Mason was a great X factor for us.
Against Louisville, it was Endia Banks. It was a great X factor.  
  
They're not on top of the scouting report, but they're so hugely important to
our team. We never know who it's going to be, but they're super important.
Someone has to step up these upcoming games.  
  
Q. The injuries you went through, Laura, do you savor these moments more
than ever?  
LAURA CORNELIUS: It's just amazing to be here again. Hosting is truly a
special thing. We did it our sophomore year. It's an amazing experience.  
  
When I was out, I was so hungry to get back. Now I'm here healthy again. It's
an amazing feeling. I don't take any minute for granted any more. This game
could be our last. Hopefully it's not going to be, but we have to leave
everything on the floor for 40 minutes and I believe the end result is going
to be good for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you both for joining us today.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
MIAMI](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+MIAMI)

  

## March 21, 2019

  

### [Katie Abrahamson-
Henderson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26935)

### [Kay Kay Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36953)

### [Nyala Shuler](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36954)

  
_Coral Gables, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by UCF.  
  
We will start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: Well, welcome everybody. Thank you for being here.
My team and coaching staff and administration, just everybody around UCF, is
really excited. There's been a lot of great things happening at UCF with all
of our teams. A lot of credit to Danny White and his staff.  
  
It's been three years, last year we went to the WNIT, first year, too. Our
players, this is a new beginning for them, especially for our seven seniors,
we have seven seniors on our team, they're super excited.  
  
This is one of their goals this year. They accomplished it. This is going to
be a great opportunity for us going into this tournament. I think with the
next two young ladies coming up, they're definitely the pillars of our program
in terms of leadership, captains. They played probably the most on the team.
They do a lot of special things for our team.  
  
I think our team is really excited, thankful for this opportunity.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Abe.  
  
Q. The system is different now. With 26 wins and three losses to one
really good program obviously, an RPI of 15, were you upset to hear the words
'last team in' on Monday night?  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: No. We just wanted to -- to back up. Our team has
always been let's do one game at a time. We can't worry about the future. We
can't worry about the past. We have to worry about one game at a time.  
  
As we were going through this process we knew pre-season games, we had to kind
of schedule up, get some good wins in the pre-season. We knew that our
conference is just tremendous. We have phenomenal coaches in our conference.
We just really try to not focus on the future, we just try to focus on one
game at a time.  
  
When we finished our game, got to the championship game in the conference
tournament, which is the first time ever, I think with our RPI being what it
is, we felt really good about that. We're just really grateful and thankful to
be here.  
  
Q. We all know the success that football has had. What is the vibe in
Orlando right now?  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: I mean, a lot of excitement. Tremendous energy.
It's all of our teams. Volleyball is tremendous, baseball is tremendous,
soccer is tremendous. I can go on and on. I think there's a lot of excitement,
fresh energy.  
  
Everybody is a true family there. We all back each other up. We go to each
other's games. Johnny calls me, I call Heup. We call each other and say good
job. We're all doing that at UCF, it's not just one team. We're all excited
for each other.  
  
Q. When you look at Arizona State on film defensively, what impresses
you?  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: I think the biggest thing that impresses me is
Charli Turner Thorne, for sure. She's always been a role model for me. I know
she's a tremendous coach. I've watched her for a long time. She's been a
mentor to me through my career. She's a great coach. She's going to have her
team prepared.  
  
Going back to our conference, we have a lot of great defensive teams in our
conference, too. Obviously UConn is one of them. South Florida is one of them.
They're going to play all man. We're going to play all of our matchup. Neither
of us are going to switch it up. We have to be comfortable playing how we're
playing.  
  
We're actually really excited that somebody is going to play us man. Not a lot
of people play us man. We also know it's going to be a tough task to get ready
and find ways for us to score. I'm sure the same thing for her.  
  
I would imagine both of us have been working on offense for these last few
days to figure out how we're going to score against each other's defense.  
  
Q. Obviously tons of veterans on the team, but one extremely special
one. What makes Kay Kay so special? How special has it been for you to watch
her ascension?  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: I mean, the word I would use for her is
'selfless.' She is humble, selfless. Big-time family. She's so proud of her
hometown team, Orlando. That's the reason she went to UCF. She a lot of
schools recruiting her. Her family, they're all going to be here.  
  
What makes her so good is that she's a perfect point guard, everybody likes to
follow her. She leads everybody in a certain way. She has great energy. They
really like her. She's probably one of our hardest workers. If you have a
great player like that that is your hardest worker, your team will follow.  
  
She's earned it. She's worked really hard. We inherited her, thank goodness.
Danny White and her staff were good about keeping her comfortable with the new
coaching staff. Obviously we met them all. When I came in and talked family,
academics, basketball, I met her family, all the players' families, it's a
perfect fit.  
  
Last, I have a really good point guard coach in Tahnee Balerio. After Kay
Kay's freshmen year, it wasn't that she didn't feel like she was good enough,
it was like she didn't help the team enough. That's how she felt. She was in
the gym right after her freshman year and right after her sophomore year, I
mean, every day. Obviously she's the hometown young woman. She could work out
every single day. She made a program and decided she was going to be good.
Off-season really made her good.  
  
Q. You talked about your coaching staff, a lot came from Albany, five
NCAA appearances. How important can it be that you know the grind? How much
confidence that can instill in a team who has never been to the tournament?  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: Obviously great coaches know that they can't do it
without great assistant coaches. I've been lucky to keep them. They actually
like me, so... Isoken Uzamere is our post coach, she's phenomenal. Tahnee was
a player for me. All my coaches, even my director of basketball, played for
me. She has been to the NCAA tournament. If they didn't play for me, they
played for really good coaches. Obviously Nykesha Sales. That's their
mentality of winning and championships because they don't know any different.  
  
Having them on our staff, I have a former player that played at Albany on my
staff. Everybody on my staff has been to the NCAA tournament, knows what it
takes to get there. I think that really helps.  
  
Q. Can't be a lot of coaches in the women's game that have taken three
different schools to the tournament. You're focused on tomorrow, but does that
mean anything to you?  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: It does. I mean, when I started this journey, I
think we tell our story to our recruits a lot. When I was going through the
process of what I wanted to do the rest of my life, it definitely wasn't to be
a college basketball coach. I actually wanted to get into administration.  
  
When I played at Georgia, then I transferred to Iowa, I got the opportunity to
play for two Hall of Fame coaches in Andy Landers and Vivian Stringer. My
mother wanted me to go to grad school, I went to Duquesne. Right after that I
had to do something, I got into coaching.  
  
The first place I was a full-time coach was Maine. I left Maine and went to
Iowa State with Bill Fennelly. Listen to the coaches I'm saying, I've had some
great role models. I went to Iowa State. We rebuilt that program. Every place
that I've been, it's kind of like embedded in me a little bit to rebuild the
programs. I've been blessed to have great staffs that have really helped me.  
  
When this job opened up, I don't want to really rebuild another program. It
doesn't scare me. I'm not afraid of it. Orlando and Florida was someplace my
husband and my family really vacationed all the time. We wanted to live there.  
  
Then I met Danny White and his staff. I was just amazed of his vision, what he
wanted to do with our program, the rest of the programs.  
  
I had to lean on some voices like Joanne McCallie, people that knew the White
family. Then I got a call from Johnny Dawkins. I'm going, I got a call from
Johnny Dawkins, really cool. I think Danny White's vision really made me want
to do it.  
  
It's hard to leave a winning program like I did at Albany and Missouri State.
I wasn't afraid to tackle it, recruiting would be easier with the palm trees,
the sunshine, pools and everything.  
  
Academically UCF is a great academic school. They have every major. For young
women, that's super important. Coming down here, I came on my press
conference, I was calling Iso, This is awesome down here. Ever since I day I
stepped on campus, it's been phenomenal.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us, coach.  
  
KATIE ABRAHAMSON-HENDERSON: Thank you, everybody.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by student-athletes from UCF, Kay Kay Wright and
Nyala Shuler. We'll go into questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Could both of you just speak to how, with the success of football,
men's basketball, every team at UCF, how one team feeds off another, the sort
of thing that y'all are part of building at UCF?  
NYALA SHULER: It kind of started off with our football team obviously going
undefeated. They set this notion of going 1-0 each game, taking it one step at
a time. Us and men's basketball tried to feed off of that. It obviously worked
for us.  
  
It started with football. We're trying to bring it to basketball and hopefully
we can bring it to our other sports as well.  
  
KAY KAY WRIGHT: I think we all just want to do great for our program. We all
have new changes in coaching staffs. We have a great AD. I think we just want
to do our part and make our program proud. Like Nye said, one game at a time,
that's what got us here.  
  
Q. Kay Kay, a lot of programs in women's basketball have this issue,
conference tournament, then you wait forever for the NCAA tournament. What
have you worked on in the last couple of weeks? What have the priorities
been?  
KAY KAY WRIGHT: We were just focusing on us in the beginning until we knew who
we were going to play. We were focused on Knights basketball, our press,
halfcourt defense and offense, just to get back to what we do, how we can stop
any team that we're going to face.  
  
The last few days have been focusing on ASU, how we can beat them, things to
accomplish, our game plan.  
  
Q. Nyala, the two of you have played a significant role in the team's
success this year. Another member who is not here right now is Kayla Thigpen.
How important is it and how important has it been for the season this year to
have someone that can come off the bench and provide the kind of impact this
year?  
NYALA SHULER: In the beginning of the season, Coach Abe said our slogan was
'strength in numbers'. It was really nice to see her coming off the bench, she
could easily be a starter, but giving us that spark off the bench was really
helpful. She can change the momentum of the games.  
  
Q. Kay Kay, the win total has gone up each year with Coach Abe. How fun
has this been for you personally to have been on this trajectory, first at-
large bid?  
KAY KAY WRIGHT: It's been really amazing. I just think back to when I was a
senior, I would come to the games, the number of games they won. To come and
be a part of something so great, it makes me proud.  
  
We put in a lot of work to get here. It wasn't easy. But we did it. It's been
great ever since. Nye, she's a great player. I wanted to come here and play
with her. It's been great to be a hometown hero, both of us, get some great
wins for the program.  
  
NYALA SHULER: It's meant a lot. Obviously I wanted to come to UCF to build and
obviously to be here where we are today. My first year we only won about seven
games. To come from seven games to 26 now is really amazing. I'm just thankful
for Coach Abe and her staff for bringing us here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 25, 2019

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Alanna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32740)

### [Dijonai Carrington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35195)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
Stanford 72, BYU 63  
  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: Well, first of all, we are very excited to be going to
Chicago and be part of the 12th Sweet 16. I'm really happy to be able to say
that.  
  
And I just want to complement BYU on their team. They have just a great team
and a really special player in Shaylee Gonzales. She, I think, we had all we
could handle with her.  
  
I'm really proud of our team. I thought Dijonai, she really kept us in the
game the first half and then Alanna really stepped up her game in the second
half.  
  
Kiana did her usual, I think played really hard. Our team worked very hard
defensively and again we're really excited to be moving on.  
  
Q. Dijonai, your game was all over the place today. You were hitting
threes, going to the basket, got a couple offensive fouls, at least one I
think. You hit the floor about three or four times. How can you attribute to
it the total game you had today? Are you sore right now?  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: I'm just excited. I'm proud of our team. We struggled
shooting, obviously, in the first half. But I think just the way that we stuck
together, it wasn't really any one person. I think we all contributed in
different facets.  
  
I think I was able to contribute mostly in the second quarter, but I think
that just the way our team battled; it obviously wasn't a beautiful offensive
game for us, but in any instance, we found a way to win and that's what we're
going to have to do moving forward as we continue to seek a National
Championship.  
  
Q. What clicked for you in the second half, do you think?  
ALANNA SMITH: I had a couple of my teammates just talk to me and tell me,
"Keep shooting," like "we love that you're taking those shots and we know that
they are going to go in eventually."  
  
And so, you know, if I'm open, I'm going to take an open shot, and I think
everyone on our team is confident in doing so, and it was great that the
second half that we were falling.  
  
Q. Can you describe your emotions in your final game here at Maples
Pavilion?  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I think that it's -- it hasn't hit me yet but it's
definitely -- I'm sad that that was my last game. I love Stanford. I love the
coaching staff. I just love the atmosphere and playing at Maples, and I'm
definitely going to miss it. It's been the best four years of my life.  
  
But you know, it's not over yet. We have more games coming up in the next
couple weeks, hopefully and we've got to focus on the Sweet 16.  
  
And while it's sad that it was my last game in maples, I have another one in
Chicago, so I'm just trying to ride this wave and ride it as long as possible.  
  
Q. How would you compare Shaylee to some of the players you went up
against in the Pac-12?  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: I would say, I mean, she clearly was scoring anyway she
wanted to kind of today, and I think she's a great player. I think that our
defense still did a good job, though. I think we made it tough for her. She
got a lot of buckets, but I think that Anna, Lexie, Lacie, everyone who
switched on to her really did a good job of defending her. She's a good player
though and good players are still going to score.  
  
I mean, I don't really want to compare her to anyone. I think she has her own
unique game and best of luck to her, her next three years. That's great,
especially for a freshman.  
  
Q. For either player. It was nip-and-tuck and then you scored 16
straight points midway through the third quarter. What do you think was going
on in that stretch that allowed you to pull away?  
ALANNA SMITH: I think we were hungry. We came out of the second half and we
had a really good talk about the first half, and we knew that we weren't
playing our best basketball. You know, the only way to go is up, and to
improve, so we were hungry in the second half, and we wanted to play better.  
  
And we knew -- we had been getting open shots and that we weren't hitting them
so it was just about hitting those open shots and taking advantage of what the
defense was giving us, and I think we had a better idea of it after that
second half.  
  
So going into the third quarter, we knew what we had to do and we executed
really well. People started hitting shots and it just kind of all fell into
place.  
  
Q. After Saturday's game, Kiana said that you guys still had not peaked
yet; that you still had a lot to show. Your thoughts on what she said,
especially after tonight's game.  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: I mean, absolutely. I think we can only go up. I really am
so confident in my teammates and our coaching staff. We missed how many
threes? 20-plus? I mean --  
  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: 23.  
  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: 23 threes. I think that right there tells you that this
isn't the cap for us.  
  
Everyone's potential, the sky's the limit for each of our players and as we
move on, we're just going to keep getting better and better. This is the time
for us to peak, and I think Kiana said it best, yeah, we haven't even touched
the surface yet -- scratched the surface yet at all.  
  
Q. How do you feel about playing the No. 11 seed now, Missouri state, in
Chicago? They are like the Cinderella team of the tournament, or one of them,
anyway.  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: Well, we did that in the Pac-12 tournament, too. You
know, hope it's a late game and midnight, Cinderella goes home (laughter).  
  
You know, obviously they are playing very well to be in that spot, and quite
honestly, I have not looked at any game past this bracket just because this
bracket, so far for us, took a lot of preparation.  
  
But we have played them before in a Florida tournament three years ago, so
we'll dig that tape out and we'll really study up and be ready to go. We'll
meet for a short amount of time tomorrow.  
  
You know, we'll be ready.  
  
Q. What did you think was the cause for your big explosion there in the
16-0 run in the third quarter, obviously you're hitting your shots, but what
more was there involved in that?  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I thought starting out, at halftime, we talked
about the fact that we were rushed and you know, I think people -- like the
very first play, it was like a little phrenetic. You know, shots and just like
calm down and play. So we have 20 minutes; we know what we can do. Let's just
come out and focus.  
  
Dijonai did a great job in the first half. She really put the team on her
back. You know, we're not used to Kiana being in foul trouble, so we went in
the zone and the zone helped us. We were down seven and came back out of that.  
  
And then we just know that Alanna is better than what she did in the first
half. Lexie hit a big three for us. Shannon hit a three. It was contagious.  
  
In the second half, we really got going offensively, and we were still working
very hard defensively. You know besides obviously Shaylee Gonzales had a great
game, but you know, they have a great three-point shooter, No. 1. She was
3-for-11. You know, No. 13, 5-for-18.  
  
So I think other people, our team, it's about everyone playing well, and we've
played against some great players in the Pac-12 that have had great games
against us and our team still wins, so we just kept playing hard.  
  
Q. Along those lines of the competition you've seen in the Pac-12, five
teams --  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: I know, it's awesome. We're really excited for five
teams to be in the Sweet 16. I think it's a great statement about our league.  
  
Is there another league with five teams in the Sweet 16? I don't think so.  
  
But I mean, I haven't followed it that closely, but you know, congratulations
to UCLA and Oregon state. We're excited. That's awesome.  
  
Q. You talked about Gonzales for a second. Yesterday she was saying
Stanford recruited her a little bit.  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: Not hard enough.  
  
Q. We can see why.  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: Yeah.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate a little bit on what kind of player she is?  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: I think she's a special player. For a freshman to come
into this atmosphere and against some real quality players that she played
against, she's very poised. Her numbers speak for themselves. You know, going
4-for 4 from the three, 4-for-4 from the free throw line, 12-for-21, I guess
you can do the math better than me but it's better than 50 percent. Probably
better than 60 percent.  
  
But you know, she really -- she's surrounded by really good players, and I
think, you know, they have a system and she really -- she was very tough to
guard.  
  
We switched on her or we're in positions to try to take away stuff; she still
made some big shots. She did bank in that one from the corner. I don't know if
she called that bank, but you know, she's a very special player.  
  
Q. Late in the fourth, you were up by 18, and in a minute, it was down
to nine and you called a time-out. What was your message to the team at that
point?  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think there were some things, we got careless
with the ball. They are an aggressive team, and they are going to make a run.  
  
You know, it wasn't -- I think that sometimes I think our team maybe felt that
the game was over, and we just got sloppy. We only had eight turnovers for the
game and we probably had four of them in that one-minute stretch.  
  
Turning it over, and we just needed to take care of the ball a little bit
better, so just tried to remind them of that.  
  
Q. Going back to that run in the third quarter, Jeff thought maybe your
team wore them out and that it was more physical than they were used to. Do
you think there's any truth in that?  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: I thought they were physical, too. You know, we were
able to -- I think we were able to play, you know, get people some rest in the
first half. Anna came in. Unfortunately she got two fouls. But Lexie, Lacie,
Dijonai, I thought Shannon Coffee helped us a lot. I don't know how many
minutes she played, but you know, 16 minutes, and then Maya, they were tag-
teaming.  
  
The pace of the game was really fast in the beginning of the game, and
sometimes that can -- you know, you can't recover from that. Sometimes you
come out too fast. It's like a race. You start out really fast and then you're
just dying. So it might have -- the pace might have hurt them a little bit.  
  
Q. Just with Anna Wilson, she obviously missed the NCAA Tournament the
last two years with injuries. How does it see is it to had he in action?  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: It's great. She just gives us a low, quick defender
that's just different than Lacie's defense, and Lacie has been playing great
defense for us. It allows us to not have Ki defend the ball. We need her. I
thought Ki did a really nice job on chase,.  
  
But Anna, especially in the second half, I thought she was really a big key
for us. She kind of just made her think about someone being there and got her
hands on the ball a couple times. Then she hit her three.  
  
Again, I would have liked it if we could have made some free throws and taken
care of the ball down the stretch but I'm excited to be moving on and I'm
really proud of how everyone came played hard.  
  
Even when things were not going Alanna's way early, and she stayed with
things. You know, it wasn't Ki's best game, but she kept playing hard. So I'm
really proud of our team and how hard they work.  
  
Q. Brenna chase was scoreless for most of the game and then she hit a
couple shots but the coach felt like you did a great job of shutting her
down.  
COACH TARA VANDERVEER: You know, she is a terrific shooter. Kiana has guarded
players like that, Courtney Ekmark from Arizona State. Goodman from -- she did
a great job on Goodwin (ph).  
  
So we had confidence, and Kiana's defense was really, really key. Now, we were
switching sometimes, so I bet she got her shots when were key wasn't on her.
I'd have to go back and look.  
  
I thought the defense was very focused. People worked very hard not to allow
three-point shooting. Even they made eight, we were working really -- they
didn't take bad shots. They are a very well-coached team. Even if Shaylee hit
some, I think she was open a couple times, but I think we were working hard to
keep her in front and get a hand on the shot.  
  
Thank you very much. We're really excited about going to Chicago.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 25, 2019

  

### [Jeff Judkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13839)

### [Jasmine Moody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37010)

### [Shaylee Gonzales](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37089)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
Stanford 72, BYU 63  
  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: First of all, I'm very, very proud of my team. I really
felt that they came out with a lot of fight and did the things that we needed
to do. We just had one bad quarter. Probably a bad eight minutes that really
hurt us, and against a great team like Stanford, you just can't afford to do
that. You can't have those lapse that long.  
  
But I'm just really proud of them. We're young. This is something we've been
working hard for, and to be able to be in the tournament and come and play at
Stanford where they have only lost one game this year, and compete like they
did, makes me really, really proud of them, and know that it's just a start
for us. We're going to continue to get better.  
  
Stanford is a very good team, very seasoned, well-coached, and some day,
that's where we're going to be. There's no doubt in my mind. We're just going
to keep working.  
  
We love this tournament. It was a fun time being here. Our team grew in so
many different ways to make us a better team for the next few years, and like
I said, I love coaching these guys. They have given all they need to. They
have been hard workers and done whatever they need to for this team to win, so
thank you.  
  
Q. Shaylee, a freshman, and you had this tremendous game, perfect from
three, perfect from the line. Disappointing loss but how do you feel about the
way you played in your first year?  
SHAYLEE GONZALES: You know, it wasn't just all me. It was my team, too. They
were the ones who were getting me open and setting screens for me and just
play-making and the spacing. You know, it's an amazing experience to be where
I am at right now, and I feel very pleased and very honored to be with this
amazing team, and amazing coaches that make me better on and off the floor.  
  
Q. Shaylee, I wish I could articulate this, but such a tremendous game.
You were talking yesterday that Stanford had recruited you a little bit and
that you felt motivated by that. I mean, was this kind of an, I'm-just-as-
good-as-those-kind-of-national-recruits-that-they-get thing for you?  
SHAYLEE GONZALES: Yeah, coming into this game, like you said, I was being
recruited by them, and I just wanted to prove myself and show that, like, even
if you're a freshman, you can do anything, and it doesn't matter if you're a
senior or a freshman. Just work hard, work your butt off and it will pay off
in the end.  
  
Q. How much can a game like this where you get to measure yourself
against a program like Stanford, not just you personally, but the team, how
much can this motivate you guys next year?  
SHAYLEE GONZALES: This will motivate us big time. Coming into this game, we
knew that was going to be tough, and as the No. 2 seed, we knew that they were
going to -- we just know that they are going to hit their shots, and we've got
to work in the post.  
  
I think we played very well against them. Like Juddy said, I think the third
quarter was our worst quarter where we were being kind of selfish and I think
that fourth quarter, we got back and we were playing good defense and scoring,
and just that energy that was brought was very helpful for us.  
  
JASMINE MOODY: Also, like she said, this loss motivates us for next year
because we know we want to be a team like Stanford, where we want to host at
the Marriott. We know what work needs to be done this summer and we're
motivated to do it.  
  
Q. For both of you, did Stanford change up anything defensively on you
in the third quarter or you guys started missing shots?  
JASMINE MOODY: I think not only did we miss a little bit of the shots, but we
kind of started getting a little bit tired. And with Stanford, we can't afford
to be tired. We have to like keep up our energy and be consistent the whole
time. I think getting a little tired and being selfish is what caused the
drought a little bit.  
  
SHAYLEE GONZALES: Yeah.  
  
Q. We've talked all year about how young this team is, and you guys are
returning every active player I think except for one who is graduating, but is
that any bit of a consolation? I don't want to talk about moral victories or
anything, but is it a consolation knowing that you guys can keep growing and
you have another year to grow and gel and come together?  
JASMINE MOODY: Yes, we know this is just the beginning. It's just the start.
We got a little bit of taste of the NCAA and we know that we want to keep
coming back here consistently forever. We know with this young team that we
can only get better from here.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Shaylee's development, freshman comes in,
immensely talented, but to come through the season and get to the point where
she can have this kind of game, 32 points against the sixth-best team in the
country, if you believe rankings.  
JASMINE MOODY: I didn't even know she had 32 points to be honest, but good
job, Shaylee, that's amazing.  
  
Shaylee has really grown this year. She has really taken to heart what the
coaches and us as teammates have said to her.  
  
She really listens well and tries to adjust her game and I think that's
honestly what's helped her is being open and listen. She knows she's a good
player but listening to tear teammates and her coaches is what helps her to
develop her game to be even better. She's only go to get better from here and
we're so blessed and happy to have her as part of our team.  
  
Q. The players were saying that fatigue and selfishness, I don't know,
were problems in the third quarter. How did you see it?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: I think what Jasmine said was Stanford's really physical,
and they are physical on us coming off ball screens with using their body and
pushing and hitting us, and I think after a period of time it sometimes wears
you out more than running up and down the court.  
  
It's just getting hit constantly. It's kind of like an offensive lineman that
keeps hitting the guy and eventually the defensive line gets slower and gets
tired.  
  
We're not used to it. In our league, surprisingly, those refs, the Pac-12 in
our league, they don't let us get as physical as that, and I think it affected
us tonight where we weren't used to it.  
  
I know right now, when I talk to them in practice, that you've got to cut
harder. You've got to be stronger. You've got to be more balanced. They are
going to listen a lot more to me now because that's what I'm talking about.
Teams that are physical, doing it.  
  
I really thought Shaylee, personally, she missed some thoughts that she
usually doesn't miss and part of it was just getting hit and not being able to
finish that, but what a great -- I didn't realize she had that many points. I
knew she had a good game, but 32 is pretty sweet for a freshman and in a
tournament against a very, very good team.  
  
But I think that's what we needed to do better. We've got to get more inside
presence. Tonight we just couldn't get the ball inside like we should, and I
think that hurt us, too.  
  
Q. Paisley picked up her fourth foul pretty early, how did that affect
your play?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: It hurt us because her sub is Maria, who is a 5'8 point
guard, has to go in and try to battle Smith and all these monster players in
there, and it just hurts us. No matter how much Maria wants to compete, you
know, when somebody is taller, they are just going to get the rebound over
you.  
  
So that affected us tonight. Paisley, you saw the first half, is a really
explosive player, and she's not used to that. She's not used to people being
as physical as she is and I'm sure after this game she will see that, you
know, you've got to be a little more balanced when you pull up on your shot,
don't rush it and do some of those things and then not create dumb fouls in a
big game like that.  
  
But Paisley has been a solid kid all year, and she's really kind of been the
physical player on our team.  
  
Q. Brenna had a good game last time against Auburn, but she was
scoreless for most of the game until it was two 3s in the third quarter I
think. What was going on with her? Was it the defense or was she just off?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: They did a really good job on her. They denied her
everywhere. They didn't help off her. They -- they didn't want her to shoot,
bottom line.  
  
Brenna needs to use her teammates a little bit better to get open than just
cutting, and I think that's something that I can't wait to sit down with her
and show her and say, you've got to do a better job with that.  
  
But the good thing about Brenna is she didn't get all upset about it that she
doesn't get shots. She's trying to get her teammates ready to go and she
didn't worry about that, but it really hurt us tonight with her not getting
shots that we normally expect from her.  
  
She did it, like you said, the fourth quarter. But that third quarter, she
couldn't get anything, and that's -- that's something -- I tried to run a
couple plays for her and they just bodied her through the screens and she
couldn't do it.  
  
She's never going to be the strongest kid out there, but if she can learn to
use her teammates and use jasmine as a screener and run people into them, then
she'll be able to get herself free.  
  
Q. First half defensively was like the Auburn game, disrupting their
shots and getting hands on passes and all of that. Third quarter, though, they
started to hit a lot of shots. Was that your kids getting a little bit tired
or was stand for doing anything different?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: They really overloaded a lot and they tried to screen our
center, Sara, and tried to get some cuts underneath the basket. We got caught
a couple times with that, and then they really seemed to focus more of getting
the ball in the corner the second half with their threes, and you know, when
Smith's hitting them out there, it's really tough. I really thought that they
penetrated as good as any team against us in that zone, and that hurt us.  
  
We had to attack and they kicked it, and that give them some shots. You know,
I'm playing a 5'10 power forward that has the heart of a line and after a
period of time, you get tired and you can't maybe close out as fast or your
length. I think that's kind of what happened a little bit to us tonight.  
  
I wanted to play a little more man because I knew Stanford would do that, but
we just had a really hard time guarding their inside presence. That's why we
had to go more zone.  
  
Q. As you take this team into next year, how much of this game do you
show them as a measuring stick? You said before you want to be Stanford and be
this way. How much will this game allow you to take that to them?  
COACH JEFF JUDKINS: When I'm talking to them and teaching them in skill
development during the summer, I think they will realize we did get pushed
around a little and we need to get stronger. They are going to get in the
weight room, I guarantee you and work a lot harder than that; so when they get
hit they don't lose their wind.  
  
I think more importantly, I don't know if it's the Shock, but I think getting
here and playing against a real physical team on the road -- they only lost
one game here, that was against Oregon and Oregon shot lights out. To know
that they hung with them, and just one eight-minute stretch where they just
didn't play up to par, cost them the game. I think it's going to really help
us with our confidence.  
  
You know, we got a lot of young kids that this is the first big game of their
life, and I think they will really learn from that and hopefully -- they are
not satisfied. Let me put it that way. We've got another game. They will be
ready to go, which I think that's going to help us.  
  
Thanks, we really enjoyed being here, Stanford. You did a great job with
everything.

_Stanford, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's go ahead and get started with Maya Dodson, Lacie Hull,
and Lexie Hull. We will now open the floor for questions.  
  
Q. Maya, in what ways does BYU get your attention and what are the
things you need to focus on?  
MAYA DODSON: I think their biggest thing is their three-point shooting, so
that's the biggest thing we're going to have to focus on during the this game,
so I think that's the biggest red flag for us.  
  
Q. Maya, what were your big take-aways for the win over UC Davis and how
you can build on that against BYU?  
MAYA DODSON: I think the first quarter we came out strong on defense and also
offensively and I think if we build on our first quarter, we're going to have
a great run during the tournament, so I think just focusing on that and just
coming out with energy and working hard each game is our goal.  
  
Q. Lacie, your thoughts?  
LACIE HULL: I agree with Maya. I think it's not important to focus on the
scout and the defense and then also just taking the open shots, the right
shots, and sticking together is really important.  
  
Q. Lacie, you guys have obviously been a main stay in the NCAA
Tournament for so many years. BYU is one of the newcomers. What is it about
this program and the way that Coach VanDerveer runs it that makes it so
consistent?  
LACIE HULL: Our coaching staff is amazing and I think they prepare us for
every game with the scout, and I think just the culture here is really
important, valuable, all the players play for each other, play for the
coaching staff, play for the school, so I think that's one thing that is
really valuable for us.  
  
Q. How much was the one home loss you've had this year kind of a wake-up
call and what would you say has been kind of consistent in not having lost a
game since?  
MAYA DODSON: It was definitely a wake-up call. We knew that we could play
better than we did, and it was definitely a hard loss to take, but I think
looking back that it really helped us after that, and it was just a learning
experience.  
  
LACIE HULL: A lot of things happened in that game that brought to light we had
to work on and ever since that game I think we have been improving and taking
those things into account for the rest of the games.  
  
LEXIE HULL: I think it gave us a lot more motivation, especially in the Pac-12
Championship game, to redeem ourselves from that big loss. Yeah, so we took a
lot of things and improved on certain aspects of our game.  
  
Q. Lexie, any initial thoughts on the BYU Cougars?  
LEXIE HULL: They're a great team, and we need to focus on their three-point
game because they can get hot and we've seen that in a lot of film.  
  
Q. You lost to a Gonzaga team that BYU beat three times. In a transit of
properties game, is there anything you can take from that in terms of caliber
of play and what you might expect from BYU and that kind of thing?  
MAYA DODSON: I think the biggest thing is not underestimating, especially with
good three-point shooters, and also making sure that we come out with a lot of
energy. I think the Gonzaga game we kind of didn't come out with a lot of
energy and Gonzaga has a great crowd out there, and they really got them
pumped.  
  
I think we have a great crowd, too, but we can't rely on our crowd for us to
get energy. We need to play with energy because we want to win and in order to
win we have to come out with energy each game.  
  
Q. You were talking about the three-pointers. They have a 6'7 big. Does
they present any specific problems for you guys?  
LEXIE HULL: For sure we have to know where she is at all times because we
don't have anyone her size, so she is definitely going to be a challenge, but
we have to figure out a way to be able to guard their three-point but also
make sure she is contained.  
  
Q. Lacie, if you would address this team from the beginning of the
season until now, what's transformed on this team, what's gotten better and
improved over the course of the season?  
LACIE HULL: I think it's interesting that our first game was UC Davis, and our
last game was UC Davis, as well and between those two games we have seen a lot
of improvement and a lot of changes. I think it boils down to our focus on
both the scout and our offense, just the motivation. I mean, I think that
first game, especially for us freshmen, there were some nerves there, it's the
first game we've played, but then like yesterday we were settled in, it was
time to go, and I think just everyone sticking together throughout the season
and being focused on one main goal in the end has been very important for our
team, and I think that's what's been the biggest improvement for us.  
  
Q. Presuming you got to see some of the BYU/Auburn game in person, was
that helpful for you to see it beyond film and beyond three-point shooting,
what other impressions were you left with?  
LACIE HULL: They're an aggressive team and I think we need to be aggressive
and not wait for them to start that aggressiveness, and watching that brought
it to light. We can't come in being, like, slow. We need to be ready to go
right from the start.  
  
MAYA DODSON: They're very poised. Auburn has -- during their press they are
aggressive but they found a way to stay poised through that, so seeing that
shows that we can't think we're going to rattle them, and that's the way we're
going to win. We're just going to have to play our game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
Joined now by Coach VanDerveer. Coach, congratulations. If you will begin our
press conference with an opening statement.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: We're very excited to be playing in the game Monday night,
and BYU has an excellent team. They had a great win over Auburn. We have a lot
of work to do today to get our team prepared, but we will be ready, and we're
really happy to be playing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: With that, questions for Coach.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: Do you recall Tom Holmoe's time as a coach at Stanford, and
can you describe any interactions you had with Tom at the time?  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: I do. He's not the AD anymore?  
  
Q. He still is.  
TARA VANDERVEER: I was are wondering, because someone asked me that yesterday.
He always seemed very upbeat, he worked on the football staff and worked with
Bill Walsh and just a real positive kind of encouraging person, enjoyed having
him at Stanford and I wasn't sure -- I lost track a little bit. I wasn't sure
if he was still at BYU but obviously doing great job there.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, he might have been there, I just didn't know it. Mostly
interaction in the halls and talking in coaches meetings and things like that.
Always enjoyed the time I spent with him.  
  
Q. Coach in what ways does BYU get your attention as you prep for this
game?  
TARA VANDERVEER: They have a lot of very capable players. I think starting
inside with somebody 6'7, that gets your attention. They have a lot of players
that shoot the ball very well. With someone making 86 threes, that would get
your attention, but they pass the ball well, they shoot the ball well, they're
a strong, fundamental team and very well coached team.  
  
They play a lot of people so you've got to get to know a lot of different
personnel, and they played in a very tough league, winning their conference
tournament, obviously. They've had a great season.  
  
Q. You said 6'7 gets your attention. What particular problems does
Hanson present for you guys?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, she blocks a lot of shots, she changes things in the
paint when you go in there. I'm glad that we have played against teams that
are that big already this year with Baylor with Kalani Brown, different build,
but 6'7 and also the young lady at Oregon State, 6-8. So I think if you're not
used to playing against that at all you turn and she is going to block your
shot. She scores, they run a lot of really nice pick-and-roll action with her.
That's a big part of their game.  
  
Q. Coach, the question was asked to your players before, in what ways
was that February 10th a wake-up call for your team? What have you seen as a
coach that has changed in their mentality and their confidence?  
TARA VANDERVEER: It was a beat down. I don't know that a wake-up call is how I
would describe it. Oregon came in and had their way. I think maybe our team
learned that you not can't just show up. You've got to be ready, and you've
got to play hard and play really well if you want to win the game.  
  
Oregon is a great team, and we're really excited to get a chance to play them
again and show that that wasn't who we were on February 10th. Hopefully we've
played well since then and we can continue to do that.  
  
Q. Coach, you guys are obviously very experienced at this time of year
playing in the NCAA Tournament consistently in the last few years. BYU is
young in this tourney. Do you think that experience gives you an advantage or
leg up, sort of helps your players I guess moving forward through these stages
of the tournament? Do you think that helps them?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think experience only helps if you've learned from it. Just
because you've done it doesn't mean anything, really, but hopefully the fact
that people have been successful in the tournament, they can build on those
positive experiences and learn from, you know, why we weren't successful. I
don't think basketball or the tournament is rocket science.  
  
You've got to play great defense, you've got to rebound, you've got to execute
offensively. It's probably no different than during the season. During the
season you're feeling things out, trying to figure out line-ups, trying to
figure out combinations, maybe what things to do, but by the tournament you've
got to have it figured out.  
  
I hope our team is excited about playing in the tournament and that their
experience is going to serve people well.  
  
Q. What did BYU show you against Auburn in particular how they handled
Auburn's press?  
TARA VANDERVEER: We weren't going to put a press early in like that today
anyway, but I thought they handled the press well, they passed the ball well.
They're a very fundamental team, they pass and shoot and spread the floor
well. It was a great game. Auburn made a great comeback but I think BYU just
stayed in there and -- I didn't really see the very end of it because we were
getting ready for our game but the fact that Auburn did come back, I think
they did force some turnovers, but they didn't get as many as they usually get
and wanted.  
  
Again, BYU is, I think, very, very impressive with Gonzales. We saw her in
recruiting and she committed early to BYU, but she is an outstanding player,
really good shooters, good outside game, good inside game. Hopefully that's
how we're going to play, too, hopefully we have a good perimeter and postgame,
too.  
  
Q. I thought one of the keys for BYU yesterday was they quickly switched
out man into zone. I was wondering if a team that's versatile that can play a
lot of different defenses, if that's a concern for you guys?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, honestly, we have played against everything. We
have played against press, we played against zone, player, triangle and 2, box
and 1, we have played against everything this year. I really feel like our
conference schedule and our nonconference schedule playing Baylor, playing at
Tennessee, playing at Gonzaga, you know, we played Florida Gulf Coast. All
these teams are in the NCAA Tournament. They've all gotten us ready for this.
I think players at this level, they're not going to be, you know, if a team
plays player you're doing one thing, if a team plays zone, you're going to
look for other things.  
  
I don't see that has being anything that is really disruptive or an advantage.
Most teams play both so you're going to -- we play both, they play both,
you're going to play whatever is going to work.  
  
Q. In what ways has your team transformed since the beginning of the
season and gotten better at, changed? Obviously there are common opponents
between you and BYU, but neither of you are the same team from the beginning
of the season. How has your team changed?  
TARA VANDERVEER: That's a great question. I've been thinking about that a
little bit, especially because we played Davis and that was our first game.
First of all, unfortunately, we've had some injuries. So not having people has
forced other people to step up and play well for us. I think Kiana Williams is
doing a great job for us at the point. Last year she played the 2, might have
averaged 20-something minutes a game and she has developed into what I think
is a really outstanding point guard for our team and in our league and in the
tournament.  
  
Initially Lexie Hull started for us, and she got hurt so she was out so now
Lacie starts.  
  
Last year we had Anna Wilson doing well and she got out so a lot of it is -- I
said to our team the best ability is availability so different people being
available, they've improved a lot and they've really listened. The improvement
of DiJonai Carrington is outstanding. What she is doing for us this year is a
lot different than what she did her freshman and sophomore year. She is a
great leader, a scorer and a rebounder for us. Alanna Smith is playing a lot
better. So you have someone like Kiana, who was more of a role player last
year, Alanna, DiJonai didn't start for us, and these are our go-to players.  
  
I think Shannon Coffee has improved a lot. She is doing really well for us.
Maya was out a lot but she is coming back. I think the whole team,
individually they have really improved and I think part of it is the fact that
they really enjoy playing with each other. So they're not just playing hard
for themselves but they're playing hard for each other. Overall, I think we're
in a whole different spot and we're forced to be because of some injuries.  
  
Q. What has it taken to have been in 11 straight Sweet 16s?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I hadn't really thought about that. I hope it's 12. Again, I
think you just -- you have to really be well prepared at this level. Everyone
is really talented. What we kind of have asked for in women's basketball is
more parity and we have it. There are closer games, more competitive games,
there are more upsets. We have to play -- I think that in order to play at the
Sweet 16 level you have to do the basic things. You have to rebound, you have
to play -- we play scouting report defense. You better know what you're doing
out there and work hard to make it happen. Offensively you've got to execute
well and take good shots and take care of the ball. And your team has to
really enjoy playing with each other. They have to be a team that wants to
keep playing, because, you know, you're in the locker room for three, four
hours in the training room and they know that maybe some of their friends are
at Disneyland or Hawaii or Florida or something. They have to love playing
with each other. I think that's probably it more than anything.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

_Stanford, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We welcome the BYU Cougars, Sara Hamson, Paisley Johnson and
Shaylee Gonzales.  
  
Q. Shaylee, Stanford recruited you out of high school. How does that
change your mentality going against this match-up tomorrow?  
SHAYLEE GONZALES: Being at BYU means a lot to me, and playing against somebody
who really wanted me makes me more competitive and to want to play my best
against them.  
  
Q. Tell us what kinds of problems Stanford gives you, how you're going
to match-up against them and what you are going to take away from them?  
PAISLEY JOHNSON: I honestly think we will be able to match-up pretty well
against them. They have tall posts, and we obviously have tall, posts and I
think we will match-up well against them. Our point guards and their guards
all match-up pretty well.  
  
Q. Sara, were your take aways from the result against Auburn and how you
can apply those lessons tomorrow?  
SARA HAMSON: I thought we did pretty well. I don't think it was our best game
per se, which just means that if we could pull that off not playing our best
game what can we do when we do play our best. It's exciting to see that we did
well on this big stage and we can even do better and that we have room to
grow.  
  
Q. Paisley, how positive was it for a relatively tournament
inexperienced team to have a game like Auburn right out of the gates, to
handle that 40 minutes, to move on?  
PAISLEY JOHNSON: It's promising. Like Sara said, we didn't have our best game,
but I think that just shows the potential of our team, not even just this year
but in the years to come. It's exciting for me, and I know for the girls
sitting next to me just to be able to know that we have much more to offer,
especially in this tournament. I'm just extremely excited for Monday.  
  
Q. Shaylee and Paisley, tell us about Sara and what kind of advantages
she gives you with the 6'7 post in there and defensively and offensively what
she is able to do for you guys?  
SHAYLEE GONZALES: As a point guard I absolutely love having Sara in the post.
When she sets a screen on my defender and she rolls, I can always count on her
to catch the ball. I throw it up high and I know she'll be there for it. She
creates a lot of blocks and is really good at defense inside.  
  
PAISLEY JOHNSON: Not just does she become such a big presence in the post but
she is able to disrupt a lot of the opposing players that try to go in there,
not just guards but also the posts, and she is not blocking the ball, she is
disrupting it, so that's what I love about that, and she has our back if a
player gets around us or has a fast break, so it's a joy to play with Sara.  
  
Q. Paisley, you guys don't have many opportunities to have a Monday game
and of course without practicing on Sunday, but it happened in the conference
tournament and it's happening now. What about preparing for a game on Sunday
becomes certainly unique for you guys in this situation and against a team as
good as Stanford?  
PAISLEY JOHNSON: I think it's a lovely experience to play on Monday, because
sometimes when we come in after a long week during the season, Monday
practices weren't always our best. But I think having the focus of us all
being here together this afternoon -- we all went to church together this
afternoon, as a program, and I thought it was lovely that we could come and
bring the spiritual side of our school to the tournament with us.  
  
And maybe we weren't able to prepare on the court, but we've been preparing
all season and just preparing with God to bring the excitement and the game
tomorrow. It's a good experience no matter what.  
  
Q. Shaylee, it sounds like you expected to be here even as a freshman
with this team. Now that you've gone through a game, did it meet your
expectations and how do you think this team settled into the tournament after
one game?  
SHAYLEE GONZALES: Before coming to BYU I set a lot of goals for myself,
especially as a freshman I wanted to do a lot, and I didn't know how I would
fit well into the team at first, but I think going to Europe, we did a two-
week trip where we played against pro teams, and that really got my feel for
it.  
  
Just being here, it's an honor and it's a blessing. I feel very blessed to be
in my position.  
  
Q. You guys got off to a little bit of a slow start rebounding
yesterday, and obviously Stanford is a good team with a lot of rebounders. How
are you going to rebound from the start tomorrow?  
SARA HAMSON: Focusing on a body and disrupting how they rebound and going and
getting the ball and grabbing with two hands and focusing on that from the
start. I think it was good to have that first game to get used to just the
atmosphere that it was so loud, and it's going to be even louder tomorrow, and
it was a good start to get us warmed up for this game.  
  
Q. Sara, you sat there and listened to Paisley and Shaylee say nice
things about you. I'm going to give you a chance to reciprocate. You guys have
had a good habit all year of finding somebody to step up in every game, and
it's often somebody very different, Paisley or Shaylee, whoever. How does that
make you feel in terms of putting together a scouting report? (Away from
mic.)  
SARA HAMSON: No, it's so hard to guard. There are so many weapons we have.
Paisley off the drive and Shaylee on the pick-and-roll, we are so hard to
guard, and Brenna's shots. There are so many things and you can't account for
all of them because you have to help off on Paisley's drive and Shaylee's
drive and both of them can shoot, too, and Brenna shoots and drives. They all
do all the things, and we all do all the things and it's great. It's just hard
to guard everyone at once.  
  
Q. Sara, your sister Jen is playing professional volleyball?  
SARA HAMSON: Yeah, in Germany.  
  
Q. Have you been in touch with her? Has she given you any advice?  
SARA HAMSON: She just told me go and have fun and do your best. She is really
awesome. She is so supportive.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Sara, Shaylee, Paisley, thank you.  
  
We are joined by Coach Jeff Judkins. Coach, congratulations. If you would
begin with an opening statement and thoughts in preparing for Stanford?  
  
JEFF JUDKINS: Sure. First of all, we're very excited to be here and of course
yesterday was a fun day for the BYU team. We played a very good Auburn team
and being able to win that game was a big plus for our program. We really have
enjoyed our time here at Stanford. We've been treated really well, and my team
is excited for this challenge.  
  
You think women's basketball, Stanford comes into mind. Tara is a great coach
and has won a lot of games, so it's going to be great challenge for us, but as
I know with my team, my team likes challenges, and they're excited to really
get out here and play against a top-10 team. Hopefully we can do our best and
be able to be victorious.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach.  
  
Q. Coach, talk about what you see on the tape or video or whatever we
call it these days. What kind of problems does Stanford present for you
guys?  
JEFF JUDKINS: They cause a lot of problems. They have probably one of the top
five players in the country in Smith, very versatile, can shoot it from the
three, can post up, can run the floor, can defend. She causes a total
nightmare, and unless you have a player of that caliber, it's very difficult.
Their guard line is really solid, and what I mean by that is that they have
great penetration through their point guard, but their wings can all shoot,
and they're very physical, both in the post and also with the guards, and
lastly, then they execute and run their plays to perfection.  
  
I've watched the early tapes and I've watched the latter part of them playing
in the season to try to get a good feel of the team. They're running the same
stuff they ran in December, they're just running it better right now than they
did then.  
  
She has made some changes to the starting line-ups for her team to get better,
and that happens. I did the same thing. You make changes to improve your team,
but they're very, very solid, excellent defense team. They're not going to
pressure us like Auburn did, but their it defense causes a lot of turnovers
because of the way they play. They play position and they make you force
things that you really don't have. There is no question they have advantage
playing at home. I would like to change it and play in the Marriott Center; it
would be a little better for us, but this is a great challenge for our
program.  
  
This is where we want to be. For us to play Stanford and to be able to have an
opportunity to compete is exciting for us.  
  
Q. Jeff, you guys don't get many opportunities to play on Monday during
the season but you had one at the tournament for the conference and now.
What's the Sunday preparation like with this team, especially going into the
obviously the biggest game of the year?  
JEFF JUDKINS: We prepared. We've had opportunities like this before in the
NCAA. We've had this during our conference tournament. What we do as a team,
this morning we went to church together, enjoyed being with each other. We
will go back after this media and spend some time with their families and then
we will probably go out to dinner as a team and just enjoy each other. Then we
always -- no matter what night it is, we always meet together at night and we
just talk as a team, either read scriptures together or talk about the gospel
in our lives.  
  
Especially Sunday, today, will be fun for me because I'll have an opportunity
to maybe talk a little bit spiritual things to them today. Tomorrow is when we
are going to pound it. So we're kind of lucky the game is at 8:00. That gives
the coaches more time. It gives us time to get a shootaround and walk through
it. We have had in the past where we don't get a shootaround in the morning,
and that makes it a little bit difficult.  
  
You know, we believe, and I think all of us do, that we've done this, we've
prepared for it, and, you know, we will be blessed by doing it the way that we
need to do it. My girls, when they walked in they were like, Stanford is
practicing, yeah, but they know that we're not going to do that, and they're
fine with it, so we're excited to get going.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you feel like your strength is, or your advantage will
be against Stanford, and how are you looking to exploit that tomorrow?  
JEFF JUDKINS: I think our advantage is we have three guards that can score in
many different ways. Like last night, Paisley did not have one of her best
offensive games, but somebody else steps it up. Our guards can shoot it, they
can penetrate, they can pull up, they can run the floor, no matter who you put
on them, they seem to find whatever clicks the best in the game, whatever
match-up. Second, we have size. Sara is definitely a force in there.  
  
It's sad she got in early foul trouble. She couldn't be as aggressive as I
would have liked her to be, but she causes a lot of problems in the middle
with her length. Then, of course, I think our bench, with our bigs, we bring a
lot of physicality with Shalae and Jasmine and Babalu. Those three can bang
with anybody. When Stanford goes big with one of their bigs, I'm going to sub
one of my bigs and get it equal a little bit.  
  
And Maria played so well last night. For her to come in and do what she did
when Paisley wasn't as good offensively was a real plus, and I feel
comfortable with her because she can handle the ball and move without the
ball. All those things are great.  
  
I think right now if we can move the ball and really get it spread out, we can
cause some problems.  
  
Q. Coach, you followed you're only dip in the season of three straight
losses with now nine straight wins coming into tomorrow. What's been most
consistent do you think or among the consistencies in this current nine-game
run you're on?  
JEFF JUDKINS: I would say first it would be defensively, the intensity to
detail and doing the things that we needed to do. It's so funny how this
works. Your team is successful when they start listening. It's like you're a
parent and you tell your kids to do all these things, and they don't listen,
and finally they listen to you.  
  
They're listening; not just in practice. They're listening on the court when
you say something to them. You kind of say they're "tuned in". I think that's
been a big part of it. I think the second part of it is a lot of players have
really accepted their role. Look at Jasmine. Jasmine was starting for me, and
she knows now that our team is better by her coming off the bench. Maria
started a lot, same way with her. Shalae was a starter until she got injured,
and Sara has come in and brought something, so the team has joined together in
whatever it takes for us to win.  
  
Probably the next thing is we're really moving the ball a lot better, getting
more people involved, and I'm probably coaching better. I'm putting my team in
a better position to be successful.  
  
Hopefully we can just keep it up. This has been incredible but we're not
satisfied with just winning one game. My team wants to advance. They want to
go as far as they can. This will be a really, really good -- a big opportunity
for us. I mean, Stanford is one of the top six teams in the country. I know
they won't be afraid of them because they weren't afraid of some other teams.  
  
I'm excited to really coach this game, so it will be good for all of us.  
  
Q. A lot has been made of the chemistry and how well they get along with
each other. How has that helped your success? How is does this team's
chemistry compare to others?  
JEFF JUDKINS: When you have 80 people going out to dinner every night and
hanging together and wanting to be with each other instead of running to their
families or somewhere else, you know you have great team work and chemistry.  
  
This team has been this way for, really, the start of the season. They just
want to hang with each other. They like to do things together. If people know
me very well, I don't like cliques. This team is not cliquey at all. They hang
with different people. As you know, we have a lot of young players; maybe
that's part of it.  
  
The seniors and the upperclassmen have done a fabulous job of just letting
them understand what's going on with BYU, and I think the players that have
been the stars. They're team players. They don't care about all the
recognition. All they care about is this team winning. So for me it's been a
joy to really coach. People that have been around them during the season, you
can just tell when they say things to me like, "Hey, you can tell" \-- we had
a great football player, Steve Young, say something to us yesterday. He said,
"You can just tell your team is really on the same page and they just love
each other," and that's the first time he's seen us in person.  
  
To be able to have his analysis to that means quite a bit. So it's been a lot
of fun. This season has been a joy to coach them because of that.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Hamson's development? Obviously a legacy, her
sister, her mom, so big for BYU in the past? Highly recruited and all that.
The legacy part but how she has developed in the last couple of years.  
JEFF JUDKINS: This year, a lot of people don't know it, she tore her meniscus
in August playing volleyball. So she missed our trip to Europe and really
missed about six weeks of practice. The young lady worked her heart out to get
back and she came back two weeks quicker than we thought. But we had to be
really careful with her, lower her minutes and really watch what we had to do
in practice. She just has gradually gotten better and better and better.  
  
I would say the last month maybe month and a half she's played like she was
playing last year and she's start to go develop a lot more confidence in the
offensive end. I think part of it is we're running an offense that fits her
style and that is where she screen and rolls to the basket and comes out and
pops and can pass it.  
  
But her family, whatever -- I never really saw their mom play but her older
sister, Jen, was just developing and got better every single day. They are
very, very smart. They understand the game. So when you coach them and teach
them things they remember that stuff. I'm excited because she's not going to
play volleyball next year; she is going to focus on basketball. So now I've
got her in preseason, lifting weights, getting her stronger.  
  
I've had about 20 people send me texts, this is very interesting, kind of
shocked me, said you better sign her up for ballet lessons. So I think I'm
going to get her in ballet at BYU, try to help her get her balance better. She
has gotten so much better. In that game yesterday, I saw a little fire in
Sara. I kind of liked that, where she lost the ball, and they shot it, and she
rebounded with fire in her eyes. If I can keep that up with her, she's going
to be a great player for us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flourney](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37073)

### [Janiah McKay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30822)

### [Unique Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34713)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
BYU 73, Auburn 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Auburn head coach, Terri Williams-Flourney and
student-athletes Unique Thompson and Janiah McKay. Coach, start us off with an
opening statement.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNEY: I'm definitely very proud of my young ladies. We
continue to fight all day long like we've done all season long. BYU is a very
good team. We knew that. We knew they had some very good scores, some very
good guards that could score, probably play a little bit more man defense then
we've played throughout the season. But this is definitely a team that you
didn't want to play a zone. But we continue to fight, not the way we wanted it
to end, but I'm proud of what our girls have done this year.  
  
Q. (Away from mic.)  
JANIAH McKAY: My achilles started cramping and I started getting cramps in
both my quads and I was immobile and that's why I had to go out and I was out
for a time period in the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. Janiah, why was the press not effective early and then became
effective late, do you think?  
JANIAH McKAY: I think it starts with our aggressiveness, I don't think we were
as aggressive in the first half as we were in the second half. We turned up
the pressure in the fourth quarter, but, you know, playing the whole game like
that would have been ideal for our style of play.  
  
Q. Unique, or both of you, what was the scouting report about them
defensively? I could see they were trying to get hands on balls and stuff like
that, but coming in what did you expect and what did you see out on the
court?  
JANIAH McKAY: We expected them to play zone. We could have had more of ball
movement, getting the ball inside/out. We had to move the ball. Our shots
really weren't falling today. That would have helped.  
  
But you have to play through that. Your shots are not always going to fall. So
that's when we turned to our defense and upped the pressure in the fourth
quarter which gave us a boost, but we wanted to keep that momentum from the
first half to the second half.  
  
Q. Unique, what was it like out there in the post playing against a 6'7
" player, rare sight in college basketball and did that cause you some issues
there in the third quarter as you were trying to go inside?  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: I mean, I just seen it as another post player, honestly. I
knew she had the height advantage over me, so I tried to get her on the move
and even though she was on the move they still weren't calling the fouls that
I thought were fouls. So I realized I had to use more contact and just play
through it. We knew she was down there and that she was going to be effective
in that she was a shot blocker, she is 6'7". Who wouldn't block shots? Who is
that tall? We knew we had to get our guards going and it wasn't just about me.
I wanted to crash the boards and get rebounds so my guards' shots weren't
falling. So it was kinda hard to do both.  
  
Q. Janiah, what do you think sparked the comeback there in the fourth
quarter?  
JANIAH McKAY: I would say, you know, our sense of urgency, one and done, don't
wanting to home. We've been taught to never give up, always keep fighting and
with our motto being a team of excellence no matter if your back is against
the wall you have to continue to push through.  
  
Q. Janiah, when you look back on this season and on your career, what
memories are you going to have especially having gone to the NCAA Tournament
three out of four seasons at Auburn?  
JANIAH McKAY: Definitely have a lot of memories. Each team has been different.
I have a lot of sisters that I made friends for life. It's bittersweet. You
hate that this is your last game, but wanted to leave a legacy of always
working hard, having character, you know, being a strong, black woman. Really
excited about the future of this program and now it's next step. The real
world is next. I'm very excited for that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, with the pressure of the first half you seemed to handle it
pretty well and then in the fourth quarter what did you do to turn that up on
them?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNEY: I'm not really sure that our pressure in the first
half was as strong as it needed to have been. I thought we were a little
passive there. Not saying that BYU wouldn't have handled it at that point but
if you look at the two quarters it definitely wasn't as aggressive as it was
in the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. Kind of the same question I asked the players. What were they doing
defensively and was that what you saw on the scouting report coming in?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNEY: We knew they wouldn't, even though they were a man-
to-man team we knew they wouldn't play us man-to-man, they would probably
start out like they did, but they wouldn't do it very long and then they
played zone the majority of the game. With the zone you gotta knock down
shots, attack the zone. I thought we stood around a little too much and the
offensive became very stagnant.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Kiana Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34751)

### [Alanna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32740)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
Stanford - 79, UC Davis - 54  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: First of all, I'm really proud of our team. I thought we had
a great effort. We've been off for two weeks, so I wasn't exactly sure what we
were going to see, but our first quarter I thought really set the tone.  
  
Davis has a great program. Jen Gross and her staff do a fabulous job. They I
think had us really well scouted, but I thought our team came out with a lot
of energy and made some big plays early. We're really excited to be moving on
to the second round, and just make a note that all Pac-12 schools are doing
that, and I think again, the Pac-12 competition has really gotten us ready for
the NCAA Tournament.  
  
I thought Kia had a great game for us, really running her offense, playing
really hard defensively. Lana, what did she end up, 9 for 14, playing really
within herself, scoring, rebounding, playing great defense. We needed
everybody, and I was really proud of our bench, how Shannon Coffee came in and
did a great job for us.  
  
Some people maybe just were -- maybe didn't make some shots that they had but
they took good shots, worked hard on the defensive end of the floor, and
overall I thought it was an excellent team win for Stanford.  
  
Q. Kiana, do you feel you're raising your game now at this point in the
year at the big dance? What's your attitude going into this game?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: I'd agree that it's another level of play because you lose,
you're going home. I was talking with someone earlier, and I feel like I play
my best during tournament time when stakes are on the line and stuff. Yeah,
credit to my teammates. We're all playing at a high level. I still feel like
we haven't peaked yet. There's still things would have done better feel game
we have to lays our level of plays.  
  
Q. Alanna you were running a lot of different people at Morgan Bertsch.
What was the strategy against her in this game?  
ALANNA SMITH: Obviously she's a very talented player, and it was just to try
and keep her in front, and she's versatile. She uses a lot of fakes, and we
just wanted to stay on our feet and not let her get anything easy. And I think
Maya, Shannon, Alyssa, everybody who played her, even DiJonai was on her at
one point, I think they gave it their all. Props to her, she's a very, very
good player, but we threw what we had at her, and I think we did a pretty good
job.  
  
Q. Kiana, you guys started off really well, 15-0 start, and then also up
by 20 after one. You had a really good first half, and then of course Alanna
12 points in the third quarter. Did you guys kind of converse about who's
going to take over?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: I think just our motto is just ride the hot hand, whether it's
me, Di, Lacie had the hot hand a few games. So just whoever is making shots,
playing well, we just try to ride them, and that just goes back to our depth.
We count on our depth a lot, so with me, Di and Alanna, the big three, when
we're not playing well, we can count on our other people.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: And we did not discuss it, no.  
  
Q. Alanna, you've spoken about just keeping this special run going as
long as possible and playing at Maples. How are you feeling right now about
just moving on but getting one more home game, and how much did you want to
come out in that third quarter? You scored the first nine, to really push the
team forward in the third.  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I think in games where you might be ahead by a lot, you
kind of -- you might get complacent, and that's not what we want to do. We
want to play to our best ability the whole game, and I think that was the
message at halftime. We had a great first half; let's have an even better
second half.  
  
And that's what we want to have our motto be for this whole tournament. We had
a great first game; let's have a better second game; let's come out even
harder the next game. And yeah, like you said, keep this thing going, and as a
senior, you know, there's just that little bit more sense of urgency. Yeah, I
think Shannon and I and Marta, as well, have that feeling, and it's pretty
special to be able to sit up here and know that we're going to play again on
Monday.  
  
Q. Alanna, are you ready to take on that 6'7 " girl from BYU or are you
going to leave that that to Maya and Shannon?  
ALANNA SMITH: I think it's going to be another team effort, yeah, for sure.
Like Ki said, we're deep. We rely on our depth, and I think Maya is going to
give it her 100 percent, and then Shannon is going to give it her 100 percent,
and if I'm playing her I'll give it 100 percent. But yeah, we know we can't
just rely on one person.  
  
But yeah, I don't know, I think Maya is -- will have a good shot on her. She's
athletic. She's long. You know, we'll see how it goes. We'll watch film. But
yeah, I think we're going to be ready for it.  
  
Q. Alanna, as a player, who's it like kind of running an offense that
has Princeton kind of tendencies?  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I really like our offense. We implemented it a couple
years ago. Was it last year? Last year. And at the start it was rough, and we
actually watched UC Davis because they run the same offense. So we watched
their film and watched their games to see how well they run it because they're
a very, very well-run offensive team.  
  
So you know, I really, really enjoy it now. We've come a long, long way. Even
from the start of season to now, we've come a really long way, and I think
it's great because it's not just posts are just back to basket. You spread
people out. You've got some posts on the perimeter. You've got your guards
inside, you've got your posts inside and outside, and I think it really plays
to the strengths of our team. We have versatile players. DiJonai is hard to
guard on the perimeter, but then when you get her in the post, as well, it's
like what are you going to do, she's a big strong body. And I think it's great
that we've used this offense because it does play to our strengths.  
  
Q. Coach, knowing that you're a humble woman, you've influenced so many
Stanford athletes, but you had a young lady for the other team, Morgan, that
admired your program as a kid and got emotional just thinking about the fact
that she ended her career here in your presence. How do you feel about how
much you've affected a lot of other players?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Morgan is a terrific talent, and it's really exciting to see
how much she's improved. We have a really close relationship with UC Davis,
and honestly, I wish they had played in other bracket so I could be cheering
for them. But I think that if the young women like Alanna and Ki and Di are
good role models for the community, then I think that's great. We want them to
be that, so it's great that Morgan felt that growing up with -- I don't know
what players it would have been at her age, but I'm glad that she felt that
way. We're thankful for that.  
  
Q. How do you feel about an 8:00 start for Monday?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Love it. We're excited. We're glad to be playing in the game.
So I'm -- we know we'll have to play well. Our kids are done with finals. They
stay up late. It's going to be the coaches that are going to have to prod a
little bit. Players will be fine.  
  
Q. Well, nobody asked us in the media.  
TARA VANDERVEER: I know.  
  
Q. How does it feel to be able to rest your players? Is that a big deal
in a game like this, or does that not even matter at this point?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I think it is a very big deal. Not only -- I think
that looking at Alanna playing 20 minutes, being able to really -- it's not
being able to rest them, it's getting experience for other people and getting
them confident coming in. I thought our bench was fabulous. Alyssa Jerome came
in, did some good things, Anna Wilson, her defense, I think very aggressive.
Did we miss some shots? Yes, we did miss some shots. But Lexie, Shannon
Coffee, again, with the mask did it. She got it going. But we're able to go 10
deep. Jenna had some contributions for us, and not only are they resting but
they're not being exposed to being hurt, either. So I think it was a great
team effort.  
  
Q. DiJonai seems to have a moment like this in a lot of different games.
In this game she stole the ball from Morgan and went behind her back to avoid
one defender and then came basically the length of the court and dropped a
pass to Maya for a lay-up.  
TARA VANDERVEER: That was nice. She kind of got up in the air. I wasn't sure
what she was going to do, but she did make that nice pass.  
  
Q. What about her game, and especially at this time of year, she's
obviously so strong, but can you talk a little bit about her play at this
point?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think DiJonai is one of our most improved players in
that you remember last year in this game, there were maybe some passes instead
of going to Maya went to the 10th row. She really has improved, and she's
extremely coachable. She works hard at both ends of the floor. She really got
us going, I thought, with her finishes, her free throws, finishes at the other
end, and unfortunately she got a couple fouls so she had to sit a little bit.
But her rebounding, her -- she's a real -- she's kind of the engine of this
train. She really is an emotional leader. She's doing a great job as a
captain.  
  
I don't know that last year sitting here I could think that I would be saying
what I'm saying about her this year. She's really bought into playing at a
higher level, and I'm really proud of her.  
  
Q. Looking around the stands, you had Ruthie Bolton was on one side and
she has played for you, former Auburn star, you had Steve Young, you had
Russell Wilson. To have all those big names cheering women's basketball, does
that mean a lot to you?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I guess I really don't look in the stands much, so I
didn't know who was there. But you know, I think it was a great game, and I
was really excited about -- I thought we had a really good turnout. Both fans
for us and for Davis were loud and enthusiastic. I thought a very well-played
game and an exciting game to watch.  
  
Whether it's Russell or Hall of Fame football quarterbacks or Hall of Fame
women's basketball players, they know a good thing when they see it, and more
power to the people coming out and watching. But I thought it was a fun game.
It was a very exciting game and very well-played game.  
  
Q. When you look at your say top seven players, is this one of the best
balanced teams you've had because they can shoot from outside and they can all
drive, a lot of them? It's one of your better balanced teams, isn't it?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, let's see. I mean, we've had some pretty good teams, so
I don't know that comparing the teams, but I like this team, and I talked to
our team after the game. They really play hard for each other. I think they
get it. They are very unselfish. They play hard for each other. They enjoy
other people's success. They're cheering for each other the whole game.
Whether they make shots or whether they're doing the right thing, I think we
also have some really good leadership. Shannon, her play, is so underrated but
so subtle, just her passing, her screening, her defense. I think she's just
really blossomed for us, and Tom, you wrote a really nice article about her,
and she's really a big key to why we're being so successful. Maya coming back,
Maya had some great plays. But you need it all. You need the rebounding. You
need people that can create shots. You need people that can knock down open
shots.  
  
I think everyone is feeling confident in a good way, and we're going to be
challenged. BYU is going to be a real challenge for us, and we're going to
have to play very well to beat them and move on.  
  
Q. Seeing how efficient the offense was, especially in the first quarter
and even in the first half and start of the third quarter, is that kind of
what you were hoping for or looking for when you went to Jennifer Gross and
talked to her about the Princeton offense and that kind of stuff in the off-
season?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I would like four quarters like the first quarter, yes.
Our first quarter we really were moving, and sometimes it's almost bad to jump
out to a lead like that because then you're always looking at they're going to
catch up a little bit. But Jen and Joe really have helped us teach the
offense, making -- they're much better at it than I am. But they've helped me
a lot. They're my tutors, and I'm the student, and I said to Jen after the
game, I said, well, I know you don't feel really good but you can because you
helped us be successful. Probably the timing of that comment was not maybe --
I mean, but I know she took it the right way. She has really helped me be a
better teacher of the offense. Without her, we couldn't be doing it.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Jeff Judkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13839)

### [Brenna Chase](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37009)

### [Caitlyn Alldredge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37075)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
BYU 73, Auburn 64  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by BYU head coach, Jeff Judkins and student-
athletes Caitlyn Alldredge and Brenna Chase. We will start with an opening
statement from Coach.  
  
JEFF JUDKINS: Thank you. First of all, I'm very happy. This was a great win
for our team. Auburn is a very, very good team. That quickness is a lot
quicker in person than it is watching film.  
  
I thought my team did a great job. I want to congratulate Auburn for making
the NCAA Tournament and really having a great team.  
  
You know, it's just been one of those years with these guys and they have made
it exciting. Of course they had to do it today. That's why I don't have any
hair, because of what those guys do! (Chuckles.)  
  
I'm so happy for them because they could have got down and got upset with each
other, but they didn't. They bounced back and that's what they've done all
year and these two next to me, I mean, them starting for me and scoring
points, that's awesome, but congratulations to them.  
  
Q. Talk about the first part of the game, first maybe half of the first
quarter, you're getting killed on the boards, but they're missing their shots
and maybe midway through the quarter some adjustments it looked like you made,
so what kind of adjustments did you make there in the first quarter?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: I would have to say we had to get used to playing
against their pressure and kind of how they played. We don't play a lot of
teams with their quickness and size and rebounding, so I think we had to
adjust to it and once we got there we were all right from there.  
  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Yeah, I think especially since we play small and they
just have two big posts down below it took us a while to get into the rotation
where we were getting everybody boxed out and find the boards and we did find
it and we used it.  
  
Q. Brenna, you guys were down 11-5 early and you took a shot that seemed
like it was 5 feet behind the line. Take us through that?  
BRENNA CHASE: I'm going to be honest, I don't know where I'm usually shooting
it. But if I get an open look I believe in myself and I'm going to put it up.
Shooters gotta shoot. I took it and my team believed in me, so that was nice.  
  
Q. Caitlyn, third quarter you guys took off, you were part of that, got
a three-pointer and a couple of layups off the break. What did you make
adjustment-wise at halftime?  
CAITLYN ALLDREDGE: We executed 100% and we ran plays that she threw up and
executed and we started pushing in the press and finding the gaps and it
helped.  
  
Q. Caitlyn, what was going right for you scoring-wise?  
CAITLYN ALLDREDGE: Being the big that has to take it out a lot I don't get
that opportunity but when they were missing their boards and we were able to
run I was able to be up there and be like a guard again and get some of those
layups.  
  
Q. The defensive game plan it looked like you guys played a little bit
more zone there, but it was aggressive. You guys were getting hands on shots,
hands on passes, so can you talk about that a little bit? What you were trying
to accomplish there?  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: Well, we actually practiced a lot of man this week, but
our zone has been our fallback and it's always been very aggressive. So I
think once we went into that they not didn't necessarily know how to handle it
and it was really good for us. It definitely helped us keep them from getting
to the bucket which they are very good at.  
  
UNIDENTIFIED SPEAKER: When we can keep Sara and Shaylee in the paint you can't
get in there.  
  
Q. Third quarter really turned the game around, was the mark of the game
for you guys. What happened to you guys out at halftime? What were the
adjustments and what led to that big third quarter?  
CAITLYN ALLDREDGE: I think we talked a lot about not fouling, rebounding and
getting back in transition. We had been able to break their press, but once we
finally got boards on the defensive end we were able to push the ball more and
like she said, she was running the floor well and we got a lot of looks in
transition in the third quarter.  
  
Q. Brenna, you're normally known as a shooter, you put up good points
today but you had a couple of blocked shots and defensively. I see Caitlyn
nodding her head she is agreeing with me but defensively something was
different. What was your mindset on the defensive end?  
BRENNA CHASE: I mean, I want to help my team as much as I can, so I'm going to
do everything I can in my power to tip the ball, get steals, keep my man in
front of me. I'm just trying to do my part on the defensive end.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. Questions for Coach?  
  
Q. Coach, why don't you talk about the adjustments there midway through
the first quarter after kind of they got off to the good start on the
rebounding and they were kind of disrupting you guys a little bit with their
pressure?  
JEFF JUDKINS: Kind of what Brenna said. We worked all week playing our man-to-
man against them. We felt it could do a good job of containing them and
keeping them off the boards. As we well know things change in games and what
Sara got her second foul it forced me to do things I didn't want to do and got
her second foul. So I had to be careful with that. So we went in the zone and
I could tell they were struggling a little bit attacking it and thought, hey,
we'll play until they start hitting shots, whatever, and they really kinda got
them out of rhythm where they weren't. I think the one thing it did was helped
us get rebounds, maybe because Sara was more in the middle and not running out
there guarding pick on balls, maybe that was part of it.  
  
The one thing we have and a lot of people don't notice it until they play us
is we have size in the middle and my guards, Shaylee and Brenna are very, very
long. They showed that tonight with blocking shots, contesting shots, getting
deflections and next year when I get this young freshman to figure things out
we will be long everywhere and that will make a big difference, but tonight I
thought they did a really good job being active. We got beat through
penetration too much but for the most part we were very, very active.  
  
Q. Brenna has been good most games, but at present seemed today she kind
of led the charge and came out with a strong mentality. Can you comment on her
play and what she was able to do leading you guys?  
JEFF JUDKINS: I think you saw a player that didn't panic with the pressure.
That's why I put her back as my back to start the game, because I knew Shaylee
would drive it up and they would trap her and she would put it back and I
wanted to make my best playing there for decisions and had he made side
passing middle passes and she is good enough. She can dribble. The problem is
she wasn't getting the ball and they were denying her.  
  
Brenna has done that all year. Her point guard instincts have paid off and I
have two point guards. Shaylee and her that have been used to doing that and
it made a big difference tonight. Brenna, everybody thinks Brenna's jump shot,
but when it comes down to it, Brenna is the best passer of pick-and-roll on
our team and they say the best passer and making decisions ahead of her. I
think some of those things people don't really understand.  
  
The last three games Brenna has played really good for us and she has to.
You're in the NCAA Tournament you're playing the best teams in the country.
You've got to show up and you gotta be able to show up and do the things that
the team counts on you for. Tonight was not Paisley's night, but Brenna and
Caitlyn stepped it up and that's why this team has been so successful.  
  
Q. Coach, one of the things you talked about this week was playing your
game. Did you feel like the first half things, you were playing your game, but
be not making shots and that changed in the second half? What do you do
especially that third quarter to play your game?  
JEFF JUDKINS: I think the first half, especially the first quarter there was
three things we wrote on the board to concentrate on in this game, one was
turnovers and not for easy baskets, the second was offensive rebounds and not
letting them put back and the third was foul. It's funny as a coach when you
write those three things on the board they seem for some reason to let those
three things happen. Maybe I need to write something else and they will focus
on that. The 5-minute timeout, they came over and I said we talked about these
three things, we are not doing it. If we want to win this game we've got to
change. I think they've taken a lot of my advice during the year and really
tried to listen and do it and I think they came out and focused on that.
Shaylee was a big part of that first half.  
  
Sara gets two fouls and that's what people don't realize. I got a kid who
started for two-thirds of the season sitting on the bench who has been a
season kid and she came in and played outstanding. She is not as good in the
zone and active because she doesn't have the length, but offensively she rolls
the basket very, very hard and sets tough screens and tonight she got herself
open for it. That's what this team has done all year and we kinda do the bigs
by committee. And they've all really, really done their part.  
  
Q. Late in the game couple of breakdowns against the press, Sara hands
the ball off and they get back into it and get it down to 4.  
JEFF JUDKINS: Yeah.  
  
Q. Was there any adjustment at that point? Was it just, hey, we're going
to be fine just keep doing what we're doing?  
JEFF JUDKINS: I really tried to not use Sara as much as we did earlier because
of the pressure. I tried to get it in my guards' hands a little bit more and
tried to dribble through it a little bit better. That's where Brenna and Maria
helped us. Sara will learn. She hasn't had this kind of pressure where she
gets it and everybody is running at her and she just kind of panics. One thing
she is good at is she is a big target. You get stuck and there's your outlet,
throw it up in the air and let her go get it. She'll get stronger in making
those decisions and she is a good passer. As you noticed tonight she got a
couple of rebounds and kicked it out to Brenna or Shaylee and they hit a
three. She is really good at that, so she should be good in the press where
she can flash and make those decisions. You gotta give Auburn, they're quick.  
  
We really don't see that. We don't see that, you know, in our league. To be
able to play with those kinds of athletes and it's not just the guards, their
bigs are athletic and they can move and trap and it's -- it's really hard. I
got a freshman point guard who played at Arizona, probably didn't see it
either. It's tough. Hopefully this will get us better for the coming future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thanks, Coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 23, 2019

  

### [Jennifer Gross](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37033)

### [Morgan Bertsch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37034)

### [Kourtney Eaton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37035)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
Stanford - 79, UC Davis - 54  
  
JENNIFER GROSS: First of all, congratulations to Stanford. They have an
incredible team, incredible staff. A lot of the media have been talking about
our relationship with their staff, and obviously today we were doing our best
to beat them and fell a little bit short.  
  
Also want them to know that we're going to be their biggest fans from here on
out, and we really wish them the best in the rest of the tournament.  
  
I just want to start by saying that this has been one of the most rewarding
coaching experiences that I've had, and it's all because of Morgan and
Kourtney and Karley and the other student-athletes that we have in this
program. You know, I told our players, it's a grind what we do. For them to
balance the rigors of an intense academic environment with demanding practice
schedule and weights and everything that they do, you've really got to love
it. And for our staff, too, the time that we put in, our heart and soul into
our players' experience, and sometimes you get lucky because you get a group
of people that are selfless and that care more about the team than they do
about themselves, and that's what we have in our group this year.  
  
They're a really special group of individuals that compete for each other, and
there were tears in the locker room right now, of course, like a lot of times
there are after a tough loss. But our tears were because this special season
has come to an end and because these guys don't get to play together anymore,
and I know for our staff the tears were also that we don't get to coach this
special group anymore. That's disappointing, but I also told our team that
when they're done with those tears that all I want from here on out is
celebrating because this team deserves that. They have achieved so many
things.  
  
At the beginning of the season we talked about all the things that we want to
accomplish, and this team checked one box after another, and they did that the
right way, where they played together and they competed for each other, and
I'm just a very proud coach right now.  
  
Q. Morgan, you had 25, but it was an awfully tough 25.  
MORGAN BERTSCH: You could say that.  
  
Q. They threw a lot of different people at you. Can you talk a little
bit about how they were playing you and how do you think you played?  
MORGAN BERTSCH: Yeah, I mean, we knew coming in that they were going to try
and throw different things at me. Whether that be putting multiple people in
the key, digging, doubling, going one-on-one, and I think the thing that I had
the biggest trouble with was them changing it up so much. It was kind of hard
to get in a rhythm, trying to figure out whether the double is there, whether
there's someone on my backside. It's kind of hard to make that read.  
  
But obviously I didn't shoot a great percentage and all that, but I think it
was just a game where we were just out there trying to compete and trying to
have fun with each other, especially that being the last game I'm going to
play with the twins and obviously this amazing team.  
  
Yeah, it was a tough game. It was tough to get open looks. They're a great
defensive team, so that's going to be a given. But yeah, we just came out
there. We shot some tough shots, but we also kind of had a little bit of swag
out there, hit some tough ones. But yeah, it was definitely a tough game, but
I'm happy with the way that we competed.  
  
Q. Morgan, you're from the area, so how did it feel before the game
knowing that this might be your last game close to home? And then how
devastating was that 15-0 deficit for you guys to overcome?  
MORGAN BERTSCH: I think for me, it was kind of cool to be able to end my
career here because half my family actually lives in Palo Alto, so I've grown
up watching Stanford my entire life. Yeah, so I mean, I've come to Stanford
camp multiple times. I used to watch them like growing up and stuff. So it was
kind of cool to get to end my career in front of a lot of my family. They came
out, all of them came out today, and so that was really amazing to just get to
finish there in front of them at a school that I used to look up to all the
time growing up.  
  
It was really -- it was an awesome experience to just be able to finish with
all this amazing team, the people that I love so much, and yeah, my family and
my entire family got to see it, so that's also really special for me.  
  
Q. Kourtney, what did you and Karley say immediately after the game to
each other?  
KOURTNEY EATON: I think she told me she loved me, honestly. I think that's
what she said, and we hugged, but I hugged all my teammates. There were a lot
of tears, and it was only because I don't get to play with these people again,
or these coaches. It was just -- I knew my career would come to an end, but
this season has been so amazing, I just didn't want it to end, so it was a
little emotional, but just what a year that we had, and just really, they were
happy tears today. When we embraced I just told all my teammates I loved them
and how much fun I had this year playing with them.  
  
Q. Coming out was there anything that surprised you about your
opposition today?  
KOURTNEY EATON: I don't think so, no. They're a really talented team, and
yeah, that's what they showed us.  
  
Q. Did you ever square off with the Hull twins?  
KOURTNEY EATON: No, I actually didn't. I did hear about them, though, but no,
we never got to play each other in Washington.  
  
Q. Coach, you think you taught Tara and her staff only too well how to
run your offense? What did it look like from your point of view seeing them in
previous games going through that same offense?  
JENNIFER GROSS: Yeah, yeah, we joked -- Joe, my husband, who's also on our
staff, we joked the other day and said, well, maybe we shouldn't have told
them everything, you know.  
  
I've been really impressed with them. You know, I've had a chance throughout
the season to watch a game here or there, but obviously this week preparing
for them, we really had a chance to see how far they've come, and you know, we
got to see them back in August and October right when they were starting their
practice, and it's fun to watch. Honestly, it's funny to say that as you're
preparing for -- you're preparing your scouting report, and at the same time
you were saying, oh, wow, look, they're doing this, good for them, they put
this in or they put in that wrinkle. I think they've done a tremendous job
just really -- you know, they see what -- they know their personnel so well,
and they've tried to make, they've tried to adapt the offense to fit their
personnel, and they've done a really nice job with that, and their players are
starting to get a feel for it. We always say it takes a full year to get a
good grasp of the offense from the players' perspective, and they've really
evolved throughout the year. We were really impressed with them. We don't run
the offense, our team, quite like that anymore. Four or five years ago we were
kind of running a pure Princeton offense. We're not doing that anymore. So for
our players, we were having to re-teach them a lot of that stuff, so we got
beat on a few things that we used to beat a lot of people on, and we were sort
of expecting that because we were trying to take certain things away, and that
was going to give them certain opportunities.  
  
But they have an excellent team, and they're doing a nice job with the
offense.  
  
Q. Did we see -- well, obviously we saw a sneak peek at who's replacing
Bertsch next year. Talk to Stobbart's game tonight. Is she a center or a point
guard?  
JENNIFER GROSS: You know, as we know, we love mobile posts that can shoot the
ball, just like Morgan does. She can step out and play all over the floor, and
Sage does that, as well. And this year, she really kind of backed up Morgan
and played minutes when Morgan was out of the game just because we felt like
we had so many wings and so many other players that complemented her inside.
But Sage is a tremendous scorer from the outside, as well. She can really
knock down the three, and we're going to start to work on her game in terms of
her ball handling and her mid-range and trying to make sure that she's
comfortable both in and out. But I was really happy for her. She was in the
gym all week getting up shots like she's been all year, and we knew we would
have to go big at times today, and we said, just be ready to knock them down,
and she stepped up in her moment and she came up with some big ones.  
  
Q. Morgan didn't get a chance to answer this because she got a little
emotional. That 15-0 deficit and then being down by 20 after the first
quarter, was that just too much to overcome?  
JENNIFER GROSS: I think so, yeah. To be honest, our staff said, if we can just
knock some shots down to start the game, we feel like we can keep it close,
and then anything can happen. We just didn't. Unfortunately, I thought we got
a couple good looks, I thought we rushed some shots. We just looked a little
frenzied at the start of the game.  
  
You know, as much as you tell your team, like, we're ready for this moment and
just be us and just relax and stay loose, it is a different feeling, you know.
We just didn't knock them down. So that was disappointing because when you
look at the rest of the scores from the second through the fourth quarter, we
played them tight, and I know -- who knows what could have happened. So it was
a disappointing first quarter, and I think credit Stanford, they made
everything. So it wasn't just us missing, they also made it. We were hoping
that our defense could hold them down even in a situation where we weren't
necessarily scoring, but they came out firing, they got hot, and we just built
ourselves too big of a hole.  
  
Q. Are you impressed with how tough your team played despite starting
the game down 15-0?  
JENNIFER GROSS: Yeah, you know, that's something we tried to keep talking
about throughout the game was just don't play the score. Let's just keep
fighting, keep battling, keep doing what we do. Having come back from 17 down
just a week ago, I think there was a belief in our locker room that we could
start to cut into this lead a little bit, and that was our goal was just to
get a few stops, get a few scores, try to cut it. They just -- again, to
Stanford's credit, they just kept making big shots, kept making the plays.
Again, you kind of have to pick your poison a little bit. We're taking one
thing away, and you're challenging them to do something else, and they did
that well. But I was really, really proud of our team for their fight, how
they competed through the entire game. We really -- I don't think we looked at
the score much. We really just tried to play each possession to really do our
best to get stops and scores, and that's all you can do in that situation.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Yes. Thank you very much. The team is very excited.
Any time you can still be playing this late in March is an ex exciting time of
the year. We're very happy about our selection. We're one of the top 64 teams
in the country and we're happy to be part of the NCAA tournament right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Now open it up for questions.  
  
Q. How much was this group motivated, I mean it's the third year and
third NCAA tournament berth in four years, I believe and after missing last
season was that something that stung and that stuck with these women to
motivate them into getting back to this stage?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: It didn't really sting but we knew what we had missed
last year, especially after having gone two years back-to-back. So it was
something that we knew we wanted to do. But it wasn't something that we talked
about. We continued talking about being a team of excellence, doing everything
that we needed to do without saying the NCAA tournament but we know that that
was our ultimate goal to get back to the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Does BYU compare to any of the other high level teams, tournament
caliber teams you played this year?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: They do, right in our own SEC conference. They're
very much like a Missouri team that we play every year with the three-point
shooters, not so much the big in the middle, but with the perimeter three-
point shooters that can shoot the ball extremely well, they remind us of a
Missouri.  
  
Q. Could you talk about Janiah McKay and what she has meant to the
program being a starter at your point guard for now in her fourth season?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Yeah, Janiah's awesome, when you think about her four
years, she is one of the players that has gone to the NCAA tournament three
times out of the four years, so that right there speaks to Janiah and her
ability to run this basketball team. She's been the starting point guard since
her freshman year she broke into that starting position, she's just been
great. She works hard every single day, she's like my sidekick, the point
guard has to be connected with the coach, we constantly talk a lot. She
understands what I want, so I feel very comfortable when Janiah's on the
floor, she knows exactly what we want to do. I'm very happy for Janiah because
last year was very hard for her not getting back to the NCAA tournament, it's
her ultimate goal, and so we always have had the conversation it's either the
point guard's fault or the head coach's fault and sometimes it's both of our
fault. So us not getting to the tournament last year was both of our fault and
she wanted to make sure that her senior year she got back to the NCAA
tournament.  
  
Q. You got as far as Albuquerque earlier in the year but it's not too
often that Auburn gets this far West. How do you and the team feel about the
experience of getting out to Stanford and this environment?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: It's so hard when you think about the NCAA tournament
because the excitement is not just the NCAA tournament it's like okay, so
where are we going and as soon as they heard California you would have thought
that it was the greatest place on earth like three said we were going to
Disney or something. It's very exciting. We probably -- I don't know if we
have had anyone on our team that has been out to California. So that was
exciting for them as well. They're really excited to be here, it was a long
flight, but I mean it was well worth it.  
  
Q. How well do you know Tara Vanderbilt and just the legacy that she has
created here and all she's done for women's basketball.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Unfortunately I don't know her personally, but you
can't play this game and be involved in this game and not know everything that
she has done. She's been an unbelievable person for the women's basketball
game and all that she's done here at Stanford, she's just, you look at her and
you're just like, wow, she's one of the legacies in women's basketball that
you continue to watch and just not just at Stanford though, from the USA
Basketball and at so many levels, it's really an honor to just even be here on
her campus.  
  
Q. You lost Emari Jones in the game right before the conference began.
Just talk about how this team recovered, won nine games in the SEC, set a
record for most wins on the road at Auburn in the SEC.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I think if you ask Erin who took her place, she's
still recovering. It's been that hard shoes to feel. She was our senior we
felt very bad for her because she had played so many games she had lost her
eligibility but she wasn't just a leader on the court, she was the one that
was controlling the locker room, taking care of the younger players, and Emari
started over the summer she was here when the freshmen got here. We got them
here early, she was one here, so she started her leadership right away. She
wanted to have an unbelievable senior year so she was there before practice,
she was there after practice. It was a huge loss for us and that first game
going into the SEC play against Tennessee, that was a tough game. We recovered
from it, we're, there are still holes that are missing because Emari's not on
the team but we have continued to get better each game without Emari.  
  
Q. Did you say none of your players had been to California before?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I don't think so. I didn't ask them. Just the way
they were celebrating you would have thought they had never gone out West
before. I don't think so. A few of them had talked about this being the first
time, but I don't think they have been.  
  
Q. You discussed BYU comparing them to Missouri, what defensive
challenge does that present to your group in terms of defending the perimeter
and also protecting the paint when they have some inside players too.  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Right, when you're going against a team like BYU that
can shoot from the outside and that can score on the inside it's almost really
no defense that's perfect planning for it. Whether you play man, whether you
play zone, whatever it is, it's so many ways that you could get hurt just with
the caliber of shooters that they have and then six, seven on the inside, so
you just, at this point right now you can't control your matchups, so we are
just going to go and play Auburn women's basketball.  
  
Q. What is your definition of Auburn Women's basketball?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Our definition of Auburn women's basketball is that
we apply pressure. We're a pressure team, we probably one of very few teams in
the country that press for 40 minutes. We press off of a free throw, we press
off of a made basket, we press from a timeout, like when we, when they do the
synergy numbers I think it came out that of the 40 minutes we probably press
about 35 of them when you take out the timeouts and everything else. That's
what we do and we like to cause disruption, make things a little harder, make
teams a little bit more uncomfortable, that's Auburn women's basketball right
there.  
  
Q. Your theme this year was team of excellence. Can you talk about your
thought process in selecting that theme this year?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Yes, absolutely. Well it actually came about, this
was probably about the second year that we started building a team of
excellence. One summer I was on the road and I was listening to Joel Osteen
and one of his podcasts was a spirit of excellence. And so as I'm listening to
it I'm thinking, wow, he just talked about living a life of excellence. Just
try to be excellent every single day. Try to do everything right even when no
one's watching. Keep your house clean, keep your car clean. If you see trash
on the floor, pick the trash up. It's your house. Get to work on time and when
you get to work on time don't stroll to the computer and start Googling
everything, it's just, he just was talking about that and as I was listening
to it I was like, wow, like if we could just change just to our team how can I
get our team to be a team of excellence. So I sent the podcast to our team and
we talked about coming to practice early, getting to class early, doing all
the things that you know you're supposed to do without your coach even telling
you to do it. Be a good teammate. If you're going out to get something to eat
ask your teammate if they want something to eat. Just so many things and I
actually thought if I could get them at this young age, 18, 19, 20, to start
living a life of excellence, by the time they get to be our age they're
already excellent. So that's kind of where it just came about, just as a coach
not just being a basketball coach, but being a coach that's building them to
be better people in the world as well.  
  
Q. Getting back to a comparison of sorts. Sara Hamson anything, anyone
similar to what she gives BYU in the middle?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: No.  
  
(Laughter.)  
  
No. Not at all. Her height, her length, not in the SEC, not anyone that we
have played against. Maybe close maybe Teaira McCowan at Missouri State, but
she's different. Like Teaira is like, she's a beast like she's huge. So, no,
probably not really.  
  
Q. You always talk about your defensive presence. What are some of the
offensive keys to beat BYU?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: One is to get some offense from our defense. We like
to take our turnovers and push those into points. That's one of the big
things. Our kids understand and that's why we don't have a whole lot of rules
when we do get steals or live ball turnovers that they're kind of given the
freedom to go and score. We're not just out there to just randomly run helter
skelter, we actually have lanes and positions and places that we have to go.
But this year has been probably one of our better years than in the past, we
have actually been able to put five players on the floor that can score. In
years past and if you look at our numbers how our offense numbers have
increased this year, that has been one of the biggest reasons. You got three
guards around the perimeter that can score. Maybe not at the caliber of just
being three-point shooters, but we can shoot the 3, we can drive, we can
attack. Crystal can go in and post up at the three position. Emari was a
three-point shooter as a stretch four, Erin comes in and is a stretch four.
Unique can score on the inside. You got some guards coming off the bench that
can score. So it's really been a change of our players that we have been able
to put into our offense that have been able to score. So scoring in transition
was always what we wanted to do, but now adding scoring in the half court has
been really big for us this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from coach.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: First of all we're really excited to be in the tournament and
playing at home. Our finals are finished, our team is ready to go and we're
looking forward to playing Davis tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up for questions.  
  
Q. What do you like about your team going into this tournament?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I like the fact that our team is very excited coming off of a
big win in the PAC 12 tournament, we're playing with a lot of momentum, we're
playing our best basketball at the end of the season. People are healthy for
the most part and just we feel like we're, we haven't reached our peak, we're
continuing to improve and everyone's playing really hard for each other.  
  
Q. Back in November when you opened the season against Davis and you
sort of reflected on Jennifer and her assistant coming down last may it was
the third visit they made to campus to help you with the Princeton offense, am
I right?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Yes.  
  
Q. Okay. And you said it was like playing your sister and now you meet
on the NCAA stage and both teams are probably much better now. What is it like
it play them again and everything that Jennifer's meant to you?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, Jen and her staff have been extremely helpful, they're
wonderful people, they're great coaches, and if we probably had our druthers
we wish we were in different brackets so we could cheer for each other, but
we're not and whether it's playing Jen Gross or we play Jennifer Azie or like
I said we played my sister Heidi, once the game, you do the preparation and
the ball goes up, you want your team to play well. I agree, I feel like we are
much much better and that's a little bit of a challenge. Who has improved the
most. We have a lot of young players, Maya coming back, the twins being really
young freshmen. Jenna played so much and so well in that game. We just, we
want to show that we have improved a lot and so that's the challenge.  
  
Q. Speaking of improvement, looking at Davis, what are the things that
you see that they have improved on that you have to be looking out for?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I really don't focus on the other team as much as I
focus on our team. I think that they have three seniors in their starting
lineup, so we're a much younger team and I think in some ways when you have a
younger team they started out probably more not running new offenses, kind of
doing the same thing and I focused on our improvement and so I just hope that
we have improved more.  
  
Q. You also said you had sent Jen out for a night in San Francisco. Did
you get her a dinner certificate somewhere nice or are you willing to share?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I got a hotel and, yeah, both Jen and Joe had come down and
helped us so much that and I think it was actually during baseball season so
they could go to a Giants game. What was the hotel that we used to stay in up
there, you remember for the PAC 12? 55? Parc 55, right. You know I really do
appreciate her help and just the willingness -- it kind of reminded me a
little bit of old school basketball where I remember Fred Taylor at Iowa
State, coaches worked together to get great teams and I really, she's a real
special coach. But having said that, we have our work cut out for us because
they do know a lot of -- we're running a lot of the same stuff but that's what
you do every day in practice, you play against your team that knows stuff. So
we have got to have some wrinkles and we're going to have to play very well.  
  
Q. The Hull twins are kind of a graph almost, I mean Lexi started and
got hurt and Lacie came in and started and they have kind of been they have
all contributed both contributed in different ways. Are they even in ability
or is somebody bring something else the other one doesn't?  
TARA VANDERVEER: They're different. I can't always tell them apart when I'm
looking at two of them not with their uniforms on but their games are
different. I think Lacie has, she's not maybe Lexi might be more of the I'm
going to take charge with the ball and Lacie plays really well without the
ball, moving the ball, they're both excellent three-point shooters, they both
work really hard on defense, Lexi might rebound a little stronger, Lacie might
have more assist, but they both, they both play really well. But their games
are different. You just have to watch them more I guess to be able to tell
them apart.  
  
Q. You have a long history of hosting except for that year with the
gymnastics championship. What do you like about having different teams coming
here and maybe hosting them and showing them around and just seeing the
fluctuation of teams in the tournament.  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, the way that women's basketball tournament is now,
hosting is a reward for being in the top 16 and you don't have to travel and
for our fans I think it's great because maybe a lot of our fans can't go to
the next spot. If it were to be Chicago, so our fans get to see great women's
basketball. Having Auburn and BYU in this bracket we have a great bracket and
our fans are very sophisticated basketball fans, they have watched a lot of
great basketball and I know that they will come out and support watching the
tournament here.  
  
Q. Speaking of Auburn, it's kind of like a full circle with the
siblings, DeWanna Bonner and Erica McCall and having that history here, have
you thought about that and kind of like the history of the game and that
respect?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, obviously, we played Auburn to win a National
Championship, I haven't forgotten that. But also my connection with Auburn is
through Ruthie Bolton and Ruthie will be at the game tomorrow and she's an
Auburn grad and took their team to the championship three times. So I think
it's, there's going to be a lot of kind of history in the building, which is
great.  
  
Q. You talked about having a young team. 32 consecutive NCAA
appearances, what do you say to those freshmen who certainly came in thinking
this is a possibility and almost something that they expect but what is the
message as you enter the tournament?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well the tournament, I think the PAC 12 tournament is great
preparation for the NCAA tournament in that you lose, you go home. And I've
talked to our team about the fact and a specifically to our freshmen, this is,
it doesn't matter what your seed is, it doesn't matter where you're playing,
you have to play well, period. At this point no one says, hey, you're a
freshman, you get five extra points starting out. You have to be able to get
the job done whether you're a freshman or a senior. And our freshmen have done
very well, but we're thankful that we have the leadership of our upperclassmen
and we're, I feel that our team is, they're, they really support each other,
they're a very close team and this team wants to keep playing. That's what the
freshmen have to feel as much as anything else, we want to keep playing.  
  
Q. What did Davis run against you last game and what do you expect them
to do defensively?  
TARA VANDERVEER: They mix up their defenses. They played mostly player defense
but they will play some zone. They will do some pressing a little bit. I think
it's more -- their offense, they're great three-point shooters, they have got
a tremendous player in Morgan Bertsch, going inside and they are an extremely
well coached team. So they do everything. They rebound, they play defense,
they score. Again, we just need to come out and play our game and I know
they're focused on what they do and we focus on what we do also.  
  
Q. Shannon's talents doing the anthem and everything else, you have a
lot of players who have many talents, but how fun and special is that to have
her?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, if Shannon will sign during the National Anthem, she's
taken sign language at Stanford and she asked me if she could do that and I
said, yes. At first I thought she wanted to sing it and I said no. But signing
is okay. Shannon has had a fabulous senior year and we're not in the position
that we're in without her great contributions and I think some of the reason
of taking Shannon and Alanna, this is their last NCAA tournament and for Anna
Wilson even though she's a Junior, this is her first NCAA tournament. So
Shannon brings a lot to our team, she's a captain, a leader, it's really
excite to go see her have such a great senior year and like you said, have
some special talent too.  
  
Q. When did she come to you?  
TARA VANDERVEER: It was in the middle of the year. I can't remember exactly
what game, but maybe around January when she was taking -- she's -- this is
not her first sign language class, she's good so she knows what she's doing
and she just I think that that was something she wanted to do and I said
that's great.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right. Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Unique Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34713)

### [Janiah McKay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30822)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both, for Janiah, this is your third trip to the NCAA tournament.
For Unique, your first, just talk about what it means for third one for you
and your first. If you would go first, Janiah.  
JANIAH MCKAY: I think it's just a big deal just for our program, getting
Auburn women's basketball back on the map. I'm really excited as far as for my
underclassmen to get a chance to experience this for the first time, we're
just really excited to be here.  
  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: I would say for me it is really exciting as well. We have
only heard the upperclassmen talk about it, so we're just ready to experience
it for ourself. I know I am.  
  
Q. Janiah, coach was just mentioning how this group missing out on the
tournament last year it wasn't something that was discussed necessarily, but
everybody knew what the goal was and this is where you gals belonged in March.
How much was that journey to get back here and how much did it need to be
talked about or not?  
JANIAH MCKAY: We talked about it a lot. It was definitely a hard long journey.
Basketball, the basketball season is so long, but we know we had to stay
engaged, our coaches can't shoot hoops for us, so we had to stay locked in,
stick to the game plan, and then just play hard. We play in a tough league and
I think that's prepared us for this moment.  
  
Q. Did you speak up along the way a lot or what was sort of the message
that you shared, because you've been there before.  
JANIAH MCKAY: I definitely spoke about it a lot. I played on this stage as a
freshman and that was overwhelming, I would say, for the first time. But
missing out on it last year, that hurt and so I wanted to continue to keep my
teammates engaged, talk about the importance and how great it feels to be
here. You are one of the final 64 teams and now you get to prove that you're
good enough to beat other great teams in the tournament and I think it's just
an experience that you only have so often and some people never get a chance
to actually be here. So it's definitely a blessing.  
  
Q. We asked coach about the theme, team of excellence, when she was up
there and she explained her thought process behind it. What does that mean to
your team and how have y'all exhibited that with your teammates?  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: It means everything to us. It's something that she's just
instilled in us all the time. We talk about it literally day-in and day-out.
So we know that not only do we have to represent Auburn but we also have to
represent women's basketball and representing women's basketball is being
excellent. So that's just one of the main things that we have to do, not only
on the court but off the court as well. So we just try to stick it out for
Coach Flo.  
  
JANIAH MCKAY: I think it's about just playing hard playing putting your best
foot forward at all time, Coach Flo is very classy and that's how we like to
be on and off the court. It's not about being perfect, but just constantly
like working hard and knowing that you have to do the right things at all
times, even when no one is looking and that's the biggest thing about being
excellent. It's not just when Coach Flo sees us, it's when anyone sees us off
the court, whether we're in an Auburn uniform or not.  
  
Q. Unique what, did it mean to hear from Janiah throughout the season,
just to keep everyone engaged as she mentioned and also what do you like about
this matchup? Defensively the challenges of having a six foot seven woman
inside and several talented three-point shooters.  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: Well, it meant a lot to us hearing from Janiah because she's
a great leader and so we knew the goal and we knew that it was something that
we had to work hard to get to. So knowing that we have actually executed one
of our goals that we can't just stop now, like we made it but we have to stay
here. And that's one of the things that we want to do. So as for us, we all
said we have to play for our seniors, knowing that this is her last year, so
we just have to do everything that we can for our seniors and for our team as
well. Also the matchup on tomorrow, we're just ready to just play ball,
honestly. I mean, we know what we have to do and we know our game plan, so we
just have to execute.  
  
Q. What kind of conditioning or stamina level does it take to play the
kind of defense you guys play for 40 minutes and were you ready for it when
you got to Auburn?  
JANIAH MCKAY: Oh, that's something that you can never actually prepare
yourself for, transitioning from high school to college. But we do a lot, we
work on our press every day, we run outside, in the gym, it's just about like
playing hard and it's not so much about just the running it's like mentally
staying engaged. It's like we might feel like we're tired, but it's like my
mind is never going to get tired. So it's just staying engaged at all time I
think that's what separates us from a lot of teams and that's why teams can't
play our style of basketball because it does take a lot, it's not just
physical but mentally you have to stay engaged at all times because you're
creating mismatches, putting two on the ball so you have to be able to get
back and recover quickly so, yes, sir.  
  
Q. Unique, what did it mean now that you had a little bit of time to
process it what did it mean to see your name pop you up on the screen and to
see that were you coming to Stanford?  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: Well, we really didn't know where we were going, but we had
all kind of predicted it so it was funny because me and Erin one of the
freshmen we were sitting on the couch and we didn't pop up in the first screen
so I was like Erin we're going to Cali, like I'm just tell you we're going to
Cali. And she's like, you don't know that, and I said, I'm telling you. So
when it popped up, me and her like we just was like, okay, our name's on the
screen and she's like, we're going to Cali and so that's when I actually
started celebrating for real because I was like I've always wanted to go to
California and now I'm not only going but I'm going to do something that I
love, so it was just really exciting.  
  
Q. Coach Flo talked about Emari Jones' impacts on the team both on the
court and then she got injured and her leadership off. What does it mean to
have someone not eligible I guess to finish her senior year and does that
drive you guys to play a little bit for her?  
JANIAH MCKAY: It's definitely, that was probably one of the hardest things
that we had to overcome this year, I would say with losing Emari. But it was
almost not a loss because she was still there and while she was working
rehabbing her knee, we were working just as hard on the court. And we knew
that we had to play extremely hard for her because she can't get that time
back and she can't get a chance to play on this stage. So it's really
important for us to play extremely hard for her, especially being her fellow
senior, I want to give her the best experience possible even though she's
going to be cheering on the bench for us.  
  
Q. You've been in the SEC wars for like two and a half months straight.
How is it to now jump out of that and see somebody totally different, style
and personnel that you're not familiar with?  
JANIAH MCKAY: It's extremely exciting. I think that's the beauty of the game
of basketball, sometimes you're in your bubble league and once you get to step
out and see all the great basketball that's played across the conference it's
like it's really exciting. I'm really excited to get a chance to play BYU, I
never thought I would actually get a chance to play them, so it was really
exciting. We know they're a good team, they have great guards and so we're
just ready to get out here, execute our game plan, you know, may the best team
win.  
  
Q. Janiah, you're 8th in scoring at Auburn and your name is all over the
record book. Reflect just a little bit on the last four years, making the
tournament in three of four and having a shot now to really make a deep run.  
JANIAH MCKAY: Oh, it's been a long, tough journey. I've had my highs, I had my
lows. Coach Flo gave me a chance, just a little kid from Gainesville, Florida,
I never thought I would be able to make such an impact on Auburn, on my
teammates, on everyone at our campus. It's just extremely exciting and I'm not
too big on like awards and I'm almost shocked every time I hear that I'm like
in the record book books or I won this because I just never expected it. I
just want to be the best player I can for my teammates, for Coach Flo and for
the university.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you ladies.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Alanna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32740)

### [Shannon Coffee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36639)

### [Anna Wilson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37025)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. I understand that you guys had finals this week. Now that's over and
the PAC 12 championship is over do you feel like you have a little breather to
concentrate solely on this weekend.  
ALANNA SMITH: Yes. Yeah, no, it's a relief to be done with finals. I think all
of us have put a lot of effort into this finals season and we're happy with
that being over and we're confident with our finals as well and it is now a
good time to really lock in because we don't really have anything else that we
need to focus on.  
  
ANNA WILSON: I think, yeah, I think the other two NCAA tournaments we have
been in we have either had the exams like during or traveling with exams, so I
think it's really nice to be able to be at home and finish our exams early or
at least before competition really starts. So I think that's good for us.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: I think with the PAC 12 tournament as well, Tara always says
we're always looking ahead, we don't want to be looking back all the time. She
refers to driving a car and looking in the rear vision mirror, you want to
look back and sometimes take a glance back, but you're always looking a head
at what's in front of you and for us that's this tournament coming up.  
  
Q. Sorry to look back but you did open the season against UC Davis and
both teams have probably come a long way. Stanford has. How unique is it, Tara
spoke about sort of an old school coaching where Jen came down and worked with
the Stanford staff on the offense I mean is that pretty unique and cool, now
you guys meet them on the tournament stage all these months later?  
SHANNON COFFEE: Yeah, I specifically remember their coaching staff coming down
and helping us implement this offense into our system and they were really big
help, and I know her and Tara keep up with each other and congratulate each
other and all of that. So it's kind of a unique and exciting moment that we're
meeting them in the tournament. We started off Tara said we started our
preseason with them and now we're starting our new tournament season with
them. So I think it's really exciting and we were just watching our highlight
kind of film before this and we have come a long way in our offense so I'm
excited to see the improvements that we have made since that first game of the
season and I think it's going to be really interesting that it's against the
same team.  
  
Q. What are those noticeable improvements that you've seen from game one
to now? How is the team developed over the course of the year?  
SHANNON COFFEE: Yeah, so I think the flow of our offense has improved so much.
You can kind of see some wary movements or some kind of hesitations in some of
the offense that we ran in our first game against them and so then looking at
our Oregon highlight tape you can just see such a difference in the way we
move, our confidence, and just the way we run our offense so it's going to be
really exciting to see how that plays out.  
  
Q. Shannon, how much sign language have you taken and also what sort of
prompted you to bring it up to Tara to say you would like to sign the and them
and how special for her teammates has it been to watch her do that, that takes
some courage maybe that's different than performing on a basketball court to
share another talent for a mass audience.  
SHANNON COFFEE: I just finished my fifth quarter here at Stanford. I started
my freshman year and then had to take a little break, my schedule didn't
really allow for it so I came back to it this year, I've tried to keep up with
it as much as I could throughout my career. But I kind of have been working
one-on-one with my professor more so since it's year two it's kind of a
smaller class size and so I've been working with her and just kind of getting
to know her and the deaf culture and it's really important sign language is
really important to them and any little signs that you can do go a long way
with the deaf community and I think that there's a lot of accommodations at
arenas and different things like that for different people and I think that
having the signed anthem can really just make people feel welcome, deaf people
feel welcome and just kind of create just a community with them involved as
well.  
  
ANNA WILSON: So I take sign language as well I'm in my first year of sign
language and Shannon helps me all the time studying for exams and whenever I
have questions. Sometimes we're in practice and sometimes I'll sign to her
instead of talking to her, just to practice. But I'm not sure if really anyone
else notices that, but what's amazing about what Shannon does is that there's
this whole group of people who in most cases aren't being included in or can't
participate in the anthem and what's really awesome about what she's doing is
she's opening a door for other people to be able to participate in something
that is a huge part of sports and it's the opening part, it's the intro, and I
think it's really, really important and I think it's amazing that you do that.  
  
Q. I asked Tara a little bit about the history being here and Auburn
being here and the National Championship and she talked about her connection
to Ruthie Bolton and also with DeWanna Bonner and Bird and have you guys
thought about that and what do you think of the history of Stanford basketball
and hosting and do you feel a responsibility to hold that up?  
ANNA WILSON: I can kind of answer to the latter part, I think that hosting is
a very exciting opportunity, what kind of sticks out is when we weren't able
to host two years ago when we went to the Final Four there was a gymnastics
meet here so we weren't able to host and that just kind of emphasized
emphasizes to me how exciting hosting the first round is and kind of I think
the game like game changer mentality that it has and we have our fans here and
it just kind of gets us hyped, gets us more excited to compete in this
tournament, so I think that hosting kind of brings a whole another dynamic to
the start of the tournament.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: I think in terms of relationships with other teams, Tara is a
Hall of Fame coach and I think what's really special about Tara as a coach is
that she makes connections with other coaches and keeps them. So it's really
cool that we're able to play other teams that Tara has relationships with,
especially a team that Bird's sister played on in the past and a superstar
player and we're really excited that Auburn are able to play here and we're
really excited that we have made connections with those teams in the past.  
  
Q. Tara had an interesting take on the NCAA tournament. For the seniors
it is your last NCAA tournament but for Anna it's actually your first that
you're going to play. How does that feel coming in, knowing you made it
through, you're on the verge of playing in your first NCAA game and is that
any different, especially for a team that is always in the post-season?  
ANNA WILSON: Yeah, I was here freshman year, went to the Final Four, last year
we were in the Sweet 16, so I'm very excited to obviously be a part of being
in the NCAA tournament. I think the most important thing for me is just being
grateful for every day that I've had the opportunity to be out on the court
because I've obviously had a couple of like bumps and bruises and like kind of
a roller coaster of a career so far, but I think the greatest part about being
apart of this team is that I get to be a part of this team every single day in
practice and PAC 12 tournament and everything. So this season has been super,
super exciting for me and I just want to keep moving forward and do the best I
can.  
  
Q. The follow-up for the two seniors, what's it feel like you're in your
fourth consecutive 32 straight for Stanford but this is the final go and what
are your emotions as you enter tomorrow's game?  
SHANNON COFFEE: It's crazy. Everyone says college flies by, you don't believe
them until you're there. And it's just crazy for me to think that this is me
and Alanna's last go round but it also makes it that much more exciting and
kind of gives us that much more of a boost, that much more of an edge that we
really want to go out and go out with a bang, go all the way, get that
National Championship. And I think it just adds to the excitement of the
tournament.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, you kind of get a little bit nostalgic going out there
playing in Maples for potentially the last time. And I think you have that
sense of urgency being a senior and knowing this is your last go around at a
NCAA tournament and we have had seniors before us leave great legacies and
we're just trying to live up to that and enjoy our last time around at it. I
think that's the most important thing that we're trying to do is just to have
fun and be in the moment and we are, we're having so much fun, we're really
happy to be a part of this team, we have made great connections and
relationships with our teammates and I can't imagine this ever being over.
It's going to be a bit of a reality check when it is over, but that's the
goal, for it to last as long as possible and that's what we're going out there
to do.  
  
THE MODERATOR: All right, thank you, ladies.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Jeff Judkins](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13839)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
JEFF JUDKINS: You don't know how often you're going to be here, especially in
a Mid Major conference. You don't know how many opportunities you're going to
have to be able to make the NCAA Tournament, and so I've told them to go out
and relish this and go out and grab it, the bull by the horns and just come
into this tournament and be excited.  
  
We respect and have a lot of respect for Auburn. They're a very, very good
team, played in a great conference, very well coached, play hard, play
together. We have not seen their style really in our conference and that is
pressing and trapping and all that. So it'll be a new thing for us to be able
to try to attack that, but I'm very confident in what we've been doing this
whole week to be able to prepare for that. But we're excited to be here, and
I'm really proud of these young ladies. They've worked so hard. Nobody thought
we'd be here. We are a very, very young team, second youngest team in our
league, and I just think these guys came together and decided they want to
win. They didn't want to lose, and winning was more important than stats or
playing time, and that's what it's all about.  
  
Q. Jud, lessons learned from the last NCAA Tournament game in 2016.  
JEFF JUDKINS: Well, we came in, I think, feeling like we really accomplished
something, and we just came out and played -- we played all right. We played
flat. We played Missouri. And same conference, same seven and ten seed. So I
brought that up with my team this week for sure and said, hey, we were in the
same position there. The game was very close. It came right down the wire, and
they made plays and we didn't. But we didn't come out and play our game. And
that's kind of what I told my team this whole week is we gotta come out and
play BYU style and BYU game, and if we do that and a team is better than us,
then so be it, but most of the time we can win those games.  
  
You've got a lot of kids that are like -- it's like Christmas to them. They're
just really excited about being here and being a part of it. And we want to
represent our team, but we also want to represent the university and our
conference, and hopefully do a good job with that. I like to brag about this a
little bit, Greg, and say our conference has been to Sweet 16 more than
anybody else in the Mid Majors, and hopefully the thing will continue with
both Gonzaga and us in this tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned you need to play BYU style and your game. Can
you describe what that is?  
JEFF JUDKINS: Well, you guys so it hopefully in the Gonzaga game. You know, we
push the ball. We take outside shots if we have it. If we don't we get to the
basket either through triple penetration or passing. We don't really use the
post as much as we have in the past where we just padded inside. So it's more
of screening, rolling with our bigs. Sara is not a real big strong player in
the post. She's more of an agile -- kind of reminds me of Gobert, where she
likes to screen and roll and use her size to be able to do it.  
  
Shalae has been a little different. When she comes in the game, we're a little
bit more getting the ball inside to her. Defensively, we change our defenses
quite a bit. We play man mostly, but we play sometimes pressure man. Sometimes
we containment, we play a zone where we play it aggressively or we play it
soft. And so I think for us, it's a little bit difficult because you don't
know really what we're going to do and tell you the truth half the time when
the game starts, I don't know what we're doing either. Just a feel. If I see a
team struggling and I'm going they didn't shoot the ball as good as I thought
they do in watching film, I'm going to zone or whatever, or fouls. We have a
very good inside group. They don't get a lot of credit. We rotate four bigs,
and they're all different. And those four do a lot of the dirty work.  
  
Our guard line is very strong, and they score the majority of the points, but
our bigs have been a big key to our success this year. Beating Gonzaga was
important. Beating TCU with our bigs. We had California down and lost right at
the end and didn't do a real good job at the last six minutes of that game.
But this has been a team -- you talk about let's have a team, let's be
together. This team is like that. They really, really enjoy each other, and
they do a lot of things together, and we do a lot of things as a team
together, and I think it's really showed on the court.  
  
Q. Coach, you're playing an Auburn team that's known for their defense,
so as a team how have you prepared for that and what are some of your keys
against that strong pressure defense?  
JEFF JUDKINS: Well, we're hoping that John Stockton will show up and help us
out tomorrow. We just have to get in position and get in the right areas, and
my players need to know where their outlets are. There's no way I can go out
and make my team practice like Auburn in press and do those things like they
can, but what we have to do is get the ball in positions where we can make
plays where we can read it and be able to do that.  
  
The one thing I do have is my three guards can all handle the ball. They can
all pass it, and they all three have very good feel. And in this kind of a
game it's going to be a feel, no matter what. They're going to trap and you
gotta have a feel to be able to attack and be able to read that and really
make the great play.  
  
What I've gotta tell my team, we're going to turn it over. I mean, we're not
going to go the whole game without a turnover. We just can't have it in
bunches. We can't have turnovers where they make baskets. The most dangerous
pass in basketball is from the winning to the top and if we can be really
careful with that and not throw crazy passes up there, then at least we are
not giving them an easy basket.  
  
As I notice in their stats, 21 percent of their points are scored on steals
and fast breaks. So if we can cut that to 10, that'll make a big difference.  
  
Now, the one thing that we do very well, we're very good half-court defense,
so if we can make them play that game and they don't get up and down and make
them play half court, that'll be to our advantage.  
  
They have played against a really good center, the girl from Mississippi
State. But Sara is a little different. She's more kind of active and she runs
out and she can guard you off the dribble, and she's got really, really long
arms and anticipates really well. So hopefully her presence will cause a lot
of issues.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked about the youth with your team. Are you surprised
at how well they've played this quickly?  
JEFF JUDKINS: Yes. But you know, you get a point guard like Shaylee Gonzales,
who is a special, special player. And coaches dream of having a player that.  
  
When I saw her in 8th grade coming to the BYU basketball camp, I knew that
girl was going to be good. And she's surprised me a lot. She's surprised me
because of her poise, her feel for the game. She reminds me a lot of a player
I coached at Utah, Andre Miller. She reminds me a lot of him. Great rebounder,
gets to the basket, can shoot it. So I've been very fortunate. And then my two
wing, Brenna was a really good player last year. She's had to kind of do some
things a little different for us. And she's done that. Paisley has been a big
surprise. People that know Paisley saw the girl, and that girl is like
aggressive, athletic as all get out, but sometimes she was totally out of
control. And it's been a real tough two years of me just harping on her all
the time, no, you can't make that pass, no, you can't do that. And, you know,
she took it, which was I think has made her a lot better player. She took the
coaching and put it into her game, and it's really changed. And now she
becomes a force.  
  
You know, and I think, too, these guys had a great off season. They worked
really hard. And they didn't have a very good year last year and they didn't
like it. And so they did something about it. So I'm very lucky. We want to
keep getting better. You see a lot of teams that are good at young and they
get this opportunity and they just stay there. Hopefully this will just be a
small step for us as we can get better and better and better.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Jennifer Gross](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37033)

### [Morgan Bertsch](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37034)

### [Kourtney Eaton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37035)

### [Karley Eaton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37036)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
JENNIFER GROSS: I remember 15 years ago as an assistant coach, and I remember
one of my first recruiting experiences, you know, hundreds of coaches just
watching, and I saw Tara VanDerveer sitting in a chair watching a game, and I
was going to be watching the same game, and it took me about 15 minutes to get
the nerve up to go sit down and talk to her because she's someone that I
admired a lot growing up just watching her teams compete at such a high level,
and when I got into coaching, obviously she's such an icon. So to go from that
moment to now where we are where she's become a friend, a resource, a mentor
for me. You know, I admire her so much and celebrate all of her success and
Stanford's success.  
  
She's talked a lot in the media just about -- she's been extremely gracious
with her comments on Joe and I coming down here and helping them with the
Princeton offense, and that's been fun for us, to help their staff, but to
also get a chance to develop a relationship with her and their staff.  
  
You know, everything that we've tried to help them with with the Princeton
offense, I mean, she's given so much back to me in terms of just being -- like
I said, being a mentor in terms of coaching and just life in general within
this profession.  
  
Yeah, when we found out who we were playing, you know, it was a little --
obviously we're excited and we'll be excited to play anybody, but on one hand,
we've been cheering for them all year, and so it's strange now to be in a
situation where we're not cheering for them tomorrow. But on the other hand,
we also know each other's programs very well, so it's a strange feeling there,
too.  
  
But we always wish them so much success. You know, it's been really fun
getting to know Tara and her staff better, and you know, it'll be a fun game
tomorrow.  
  
Q. It's been about eight years since UC Davis has been to the NCAA
Tournament. You were an associate coach. You've made steps towards this point
since then with the WNIT and the regular season championships. What does it
mean now to be here at this point and what are some of the most important
things in your mind that enabled your team to be here right now?  
JENNIFER GROSS: Yeah, you know, it's hard to get here. It really is. You know,
I thought back a lot to that 2011 team and what they were able to accomplish,
and then that very next year was the first year that I took over the program
as the head coach.  
  
Every team that we've had since then has really helped to move our program in
a positive direction, and you know, I look at the last couple years' groups of
student-athletes in our program who really did an amazing job through our
conference and got us that conference championship two years in a row but
didn't get to experience this moment, and for this group to be here and to do
it the way that we did where we had to come from 17 down in the championship
game, to secure that win, it's special. It really is.  
  
I know how hard it is to be in this moment, and so really what we've been
telling our team all year is just enjoy it. Enjoy the process. Enjoy
everything about this experience. And this right now is the icing on the cake.
You know, this group has played for each other all year long. They're an
incredibly special group of people.  
  
I've said it a number of times, but they're probably the most improved team
that we've had, and that's because they committed every single day to getting
better, and they did that for each other. We really haven't had to have any
talks this year about players coming in my office saying, well, what can I --
I want to play more, or I want this role or I want that role. Everybody just
bought in to whatever they could do to help this team succeed, and that's
unique. That's really unique.  
  
They play for each other. They fight for each other. They enjoy each other.
They have fun together. And that's what it's about. You know, and I'm just --
it's been one of the most rewarding, most fun experiences for our coaching
staff because of the people that we get to be around every single day. I
admire this group of student-athletes so much. It's been a fun ride, and we're
just going to enjoy every moment that we have to compete together.  
  
Q. Were you able to go to a Giants game the night Tara treated you in
San Francisco? Did you make it to a game?  
JENNIFER GROSS: We did. Yeah, we did.  
  
Q. And also, looking back at that November game, I know that's a long
time ago, your shooting wasn't what it usually is. What's sort of the key
tomorrow to get Stanford off its game and knock down some shots to keep them
honest?  
JENNIFER GROSS: Yeah, well, looking back at November, I mean, we definitely
were a different team then, and I know they were, as well. We had -- we took
some lumps early just kind of trying to build our chemistry and figure out
what was going to work for us. You know, when I watch that film, I feel like,
gosh, we were just so inexperienced, and we hadn't developed a confidence in
ourselves as individuals but also in our team. And I think that's the biggest
thing right now is kind of riding this win streak is we believe in ourselves.
We believe in ourselves, and we respect the heck out of Stanford, believe me.
We know that they're really big and athletic inside. We know that they score
it from every single position. You know, their offense has gotten better and
better throughout the year, really impressive where they've taken this
offense. And their defense is tremendous, too.  
  
You know, for us it's just going to be -- we have to play to our strengths.
You know, and our strengths really are -- we've got to get the ball moving.
We've got to get inside touches. We've got to get outside touches. We've got
to get the ball -- we've got to attack and kick and share the ball because
that's kind of -- that's who we are. We're a selfless group that makes the
extra pass, and we feel good when we do that. And so obviously we're going to
have to knock down some shots. We're going to have to get some production
inside, as well, and we're just going to have to have kids step up.  
  
The nice thing about -- for me is that that's what our players have been doing
all year. It's different people every game. One night it's Karley Eaton, she's
going 5 for 5 from three, another night it's Kourtney Eaton, another night
it's Nina Bessolo, and through that Morgan has been our consistent presence
inside and out, as well. So it's going to take a complete team effort
tomorrow. Everybody is going to have to be the best version of themselves, and
I'm excited to see my team in that moment. I think we're excited and we're
ready, and we're just going to go out there and give it everything that we've
got.  
  
Q. You talked about the 16-game win streak. Over that streak, not many
of them were close until that last game. You trailed by 17 and came back to
win it, and that secured your spot here. What did that mean for the team, and
did you talk to them at all about that deficit and overcoming them and maybe
peaking right now as you're entering the tournament?  
JENNIFER GROSS: Yeah. I mean, that was incredible. It was incredible. I've
gotten a lot of questions from parents and media about what did you say at
halftime during that game. And it's funny because it was -- while the coaching
staff was outside the locker room trying to figure out some adjustments, we
heard Karley Eaton and our other seniors inside the locker room talking to the
team about, we can do this, we've got to stay together, everybody has to be
all in, a hundred percent, we've got this. You know, and it was just the
perfect message with the perfect tone, and right then we kind of looked at
each other and we said, okay, we can do this. It's just going to take a few
stops in a row, a few scores in a row, which is what we talk about with our
team a lot is we've got to get stop-score-stops. If we can string together a
number of those, we're going to put ourselves back in this game. So it wasn't
so much about making huge adjustments, it was just about being more focused,
more deliberate, more intentional with everything that we were doing, and
really believing in each other.  
  
And I think to have that kind of a moment after we really hadn't been
challenged too much for the past couple months, you know, that was maybe one
concern we had going into the tournament was like in a close game are we going
to be ready for that. But the belief that this team has in each other, the
belief this coaching staff has in our players, it showed through, and I think
it was a real display of togetherness and pride, and it was an incredible
effort, and I think that gave us a lot of confidence that, you know what, we
can be in different situations and still come out on top as long as we believe
in each other.  
  
Q. What's the week been like starting with the weird selection show on
Monday? And then your players having to take finals throughout this week? And
just being able to enjoy this moment while also preparing for a game on
Saturday but still being able to enjoy the spot that you're in.  
JENNIFER GROSS: Yeah. It's been a bit of a whirlwind. Our players got off the
bus, had an awesome group of fans waiting to celebrate with us in Davis. Davis
is such an incredible community, and everybody has really been behind this
team, which has been so fun. But a lot of the players got off the bus on
Sunday and immediately went home and started studying. You know, I wish that
they had a little more time to just enjoy it and celebrate it, but that's the
life of a student-athlete, and they want to be successful in every single
thing that they do.  
  
We took Monday off, and the players were studying and taking finals, and
obviously we were planning on watching the show, and then once we found out
who we were playing, obviously we got to work and we practiced in between
finals -- they had to rearrange their schedules and take some finals early and
take some finals on the road. Once we got down here, it was kind of, okay,
first group of players has finals, second group has finals the next morning.  
  
It's been a balancing act to say the least, more for our players. For our
staff we've just been trying to keep them feeling good and feeling light, and
that's always a struggle sometimes during finals week because it's so
emotionally and mentally demanding.  
  
So on our end, for the basketball side of things, we were really just trying
to keep the practices short and very focused on one or two things and make
sure that we're feeling good. You know, the reason that -- I actually spoke
with Tara leading up to the Big West tournament. After they had won it, she
and I chatted, I just kind of picked her brain a little bit about how they
would prepare for the tournament and things that they do with their team.  
  
And you know, the message that she kind of said was just, feel good, feel
confident. That's the most important thing. And so I think heading into this
week, that's why we've been so successful is because our team -- we've been in
a place where we really are confident and loose and having fun and enjoying
every single moment, whether that's a single game on the road or at home or a
game in the Big West tournament or here now a game in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
We're determined to enjoy every minute of this, and just to step on the floor
feeling as great as we can. A balancing act, but I think that the players are
doing a great job of staying very focused on their finals but also being in
the moment and getting themselves prepared for the court, as well.  
  
Q. I asked your coach this about the last time UC Davis was in the
tournament eight years ago and the things that were important leading up to
this moment. Especially for you guys, I'm asking the same question. What are
those key things, not necessarily on the court things but kind of team culture
things that helped you get to this point?  
MORGAN BERTSCH: I think that this entire year has been focused on really just
enjoying the process of getting here. You know, every day has been a focus of
getting better, really improving on both ends of the floor, and being able to
execute that when we come out on to the floor.  
  
I think that just this entire year has been about the process, and now that
we're coming into this tournament, into this game, it's really just getting to
enjoy this moment that we've been working so hard for for the past year, and
just to really come out here and play as hard as we can to showcase the amount
of effort that we've put in throughout the entire year.  
  
We're just here really ready to enjoy this experience, enjoy the time that we
have left with each other because I know that I've had a ton of fun the past
five years here, and so I've been waiting to get to this NCAA Tournament. So
it's really just the icing on top of the cake at this point.  
  
Q. Karley or Kourtney or both, you guys had a really nice moment after
you guys won the Big West championship. There was a big shot on the Jumbotron
of you guys hugging each other and having tears in your eyes. Can you explain
what that moment was like and if you guys have been able to kind of reflect
back? I know you've got a game coming up tomorrow, but throughout the course
of the week have you just talked at all about kind of what this journey has
been like since you guys were little kids playing together and to kind of
culminate with this moment in your senior season?  
KOURTNEY EATON: I feel like we're always like constantly talking about just
how amazing the season has been and constantly reflecting on all the amazing
opportunities we've gotten through basketball and the last four years at Davis
especially, and that moment of just hugging, I hugged all my teammates with
tears in my eyes, and it was just a dream come true, so that's kind of what it
was like for me. We've worked so hard for that moment, so just been enjoying
it since then.  
  
KARLEY EATON: Yeah, definitely. I think the tears come from like -- you
realize all your hard work is worth it at that point. That's something I've
dreamed about forever. I've been watching March Madness forever, and it's just
amazing to be here, and we're enjoying every moment. It was just kind of --
like that hug was just like, it was all worth it. It was really cool.  
  
Q. Morgan, you said that you've waited five years for this moment. Now
it's here. You have a long list of accolades. Could you just talk a little bit
about that process personally for you and what it means to be here?  
MORGAN BERTSCH: Yeah, I mean, like I said, we've come up a little short the
past couple years, and that was definitely really heartbreaking to have to
experience that. Obviously we ended up going really far in the WNIT and that
was also a really amazing experience, but to finally get that win in the
championship was something that I have been dreaming about for these past four
years of just that final moment, having that buzzer go off and what that would
feel like. You can never really dream it up. It was better than I had ever
imagined.  
  
It was one of the things that was still left on my checklist. Having
accomplished all of these things, both as a team and personally, that was
honestly the one that was still at the top of the list. And to be able to
finally check that off was just -- it felt really amazing. It's something that
you can't really -- I can't really put into words, but it really was the last
thing that I had left at that list. I'm really just enjoying this process and
really just looking forward to the game tomorrow to finally get to play in an
NCAA game alongside some of my favorite people who I just love so much. It's
going to be so much fun to just finally get to experience that. Hopefully our
ride keeps going a little longer.  
  
Q. You guys have won 16 straight games, and we asked Coach Gross about
this, as well. You trailed by 17 in that final game and in previous games
maybe weren't as close. What did you take from that comeback, and she had
mentioned that it wasn't anything she said at halftime, it was more what you
guys said and did. Through that moment, what was that conversation, and how do
you think it's prepared you for this first round?  
KARLEY EATON: I think that shows how much belief we have in each other for
sure. We sat there in that locker room and no one was hanging their heads. It
was pretty amazing, like we had a lot of adjustments to make for sure, but no
one thought we were going to lose that game, and it was really cool to see. It
was a testament to our team, the culture we've built this whole year is the
reason we're winning so much. I think in whatever sport you look at, you see
the top teams have the greatest chemistry, and I think that is something our
team -- is a strength of our team for sure.  
  
Q. Kourtney, you were able to pass Coach Gross in assists this year. Was
that kind of a moment that you guys shared anything, or was it just on to the
next one?  
KOURTNEY EATON: I mean, we actually ended up losing that game where I did pass
her, but when she found out, we had a nice hug, and all of my coaches really
congratulated me, and it was a cool moment. It's fun to just talk to her about
it still and like bring it up every once in a while. But yeah, we had a good
moment.  
  
Q. You're going to be facing another team with twins. Does that throw
you off when you face teams with twins, as well? Or is it just fun?  
KOURTNEY EATON: I think it's a lot of fun. I think it's cool to see when other
sisters like twins go to school together and play because I can't imagine not
being here with car, so it's really fun to see that other twins did the same
thing we did and wanted to play together at this level. So it's fun, it's
always something we look forward to, and yeah, hopefully they're having as
good of a time as we are.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KOURTNEY EATON: I mean, we never did -- we never played against the McGee
twins together, but they're from Washington, as well, so in high school we
really wished we would have played. But no, I don't really --  
  
KARLEY EATON: No either. Not really.  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
KOURTNEY EATON: Oh, there you go.  
  
KARLEY EATON: They didn't play in college, yeah, that's true. I don't even
know who that is, honestly.  
  
Q. Morgan, obviously in the Big West, we have Channon Fluker, who's a
really good post player. Now you're going up against Alanna Smith on Saturday.
How much do you enjoy going up against some of the other incredible post
players in the country, and how much does that kind of add to the match-up for
you that you have a chance to kind of go up against the best of the best in
women's college basketball?  
MORGAN BERTSCH: I mean, I think it's a great opportunity just to get to
compete against some really -- some of the top -- like you said, some of the
top post players in the nation. It's kind of a challenge for me. I get to see
it as a way of how good I am at trying to defend some of the top people. I
definitely take it as a challenge, and it's going to be a lot of fun tomorrow
to get to see that match-up a little bit.  
  
But yeah, I'm just -- it's always fun to play in those competitive atmospheres
because people take notice, and yeah, I don't know, I think it's going to be a
lot of fun just to get to see that match-up a little bit.  
  
Q. Kourtney and Karley, talk about kind of the culture of the program
has really improved -- not necessarily, it wasn't bad at one point, but you
guys have taken it to a new level since you've been here and it started with
last year's senior class. Can you elaborate more about how you have kind of
taken on the responsibility this season as the seniors to continue that
culture and passing it down to some of the underclassmen that you guys are
teammates with and just how that's kind of shaped the way you guys have played
at UC Davis and how that's helped you get to this accomplishment?  
KARLEY EATON: I think it starts with work ethic for sure, just being the
leader and coming to practice every day, just ready to go. And I think like
younger girls follow up with that, and I think that's something that last
year's seniors did really well. So I think we all learned from that. But also
it's making like everyone feel like they have a role for sure. So I think
everyone enjoys it more when they feel important and stuff, and I think that's
a big thing that everyone on this team like knows their role, and we all just
have fun together. So it's been really cool to make so many great -- we all
three of us lived together this year, and I think we've gotten so much closer,
which is really cool, but I've also gotten closer with everyone on the team,
so I think that's a really big part of it is just making sure everyone feels
like they're important and they have a role.  
  
KOURTNEY EATON: Yeah, I think we work on like team building from summer until
now, we have team building, and just chemistry is something that's always so
important to us, and I really think it's such a big factor with successful
teams. We spend so much time together, so it really helps when you really like
each other, too.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
STANFORD](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+STANFORD)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Brenna Chase](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37009)

### [Jasmine Moody](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37010)

### [Shalae Salmon](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37011)

  
_Stanford, California_  
  
MODERATOR: We'll now open the floor for questions for BYU student-athletes
Brenna Chase, Jasmine Moody and Shalae Salmon.  
  
Q. What kind of zone did you feel like in the WCC championship kind?  
BRENNA CHASE: What kind of zone? Like shooting? I don't know. I just felt
really locked in. I mean that's such a big game. I knew I had to come and play
-- I knew we all had to come and play if we wanted to win. So I was just
really locked in. Everything was just working out, so yeah.  
  
Q. Congratulations on making it this far. You guys are the most
experienced three on the time. So what's it been like so far for some of the
youth, some of the younger players? Are they star struck right now, the big
lights coming on? I know you haven't been on the floor yet, but how's the
reaction been so far with the youth?  
JASMINE MOODY: I think they are extremely excited. They're just full of energy
and ready to get out there and start playing. I just love the energy that's
coming from our younger players right now. So I really love it.  
  
BRENNA CHASE: Yeah, I would say that I feel like they're ready. I don't see
any nervousness or fear in their eyes, which I think is awesome, and I applaud
them for that.  
  
SHALAE SALMON: And it's our first time being here as well, so we're kind of
like in the same boat as them as being like super excited to be here, so we're
kind of all experiencing it together, all the excitement.  
  
Q. Most important things about playing an NCAA Tournament game in
general and then playing a team like Auburn specifically, for either of you.  
JASMINE MOODY: Wait. Can you repeat the question one more time?  
  
BRENNA CHASE: I think that altogether we just need to be composed. We can't go
out there and kind of, I don't know, like freak out, lose our minds. We have
to be composed. We have to handle their pressure, especially this is a team
that averages 20 turnovers a game, so we really have to take care of the ball,
and I think that goes in just NCAA in general. Every team that's here is here
for a reason. This is a hard tournament to make, and so we obviously have to
play well in order to get the job done.  
  
JASMINE MOODY: I agree. I think the biggest thing is Auburn is definitely
going to pressure us and try and scare us. So I think that staying composed
and just trusting each other is going to be really important.  
  
SHALAE SALMON: And I think throughout the season we've done really successful
things together, and I feel like this is just another game. I know it's an
important one, but we just have to keep thinking, have a strong mindset that
we've had throughout the whole year, that this is just another game, and we
can win this game.  
  
Q. It's obviously been a really good year for you guys, just six losses
this season. You did have a stretch there in conference play where you lost
three straight. Was there something that was said in the locker room or, you
know, kind of that conversation that got you going in the right direction
where you've won eight straight and seemingly are peaking at the right time?  
BRENNA CHASE: I would just say that instead of like a talk, it was more of a
feeling. We kind of as a group had to decide that we didn't want to give up
our season, we'd been doing so well, and if we were to lose another game, we
wouldn't really have a chance to be where we are right now. And so I think
that was kind of our thought process is if we want to do something special
this year, we have to start taking care of business.  
  
JASMINE MOODY: I agree. And I think that we're all so competitive and we
didn't want to lose any more games, so we just had to all come together and
play hard.  
  
MODERATOR: Any further questions for our student-athletes? Okay. Thank you,
Brenna, Shalae and Jasmine.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 102, Cal 63  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's go to questions for our student athletes.  
  
Q. Chloe, you had several big baskets there on the 15-0 run that kind of
got you guys going. When things are going right like they were in that moment,
how are you feeling? What's going through your head, and specifically
tonight?  
CHLOE JACKSON: Just to keep it going. We knew we couldn't let up. They're a
good team so we had to play hard for a whole 40 minutes.  
  
It's great. Everything was going right for us, but stay in the moment.  
  
Q. Juicy, you missed your first four. I know Kim tells you, Keep
shooting. What got you going, I guess?  
JUICY LANDRUM: At halftime before we came back out coach told me just to
settle down, set my feet, just relax, and shoot. So that kind of helped settle
down a little bit in the second half.  
  
Q. Kalani, we talked about the matchup in the post today going into this
game. What did you think about how it played out today? You might not have the
points, but you were very active and very involved. That pass you had to DiDi
was probably one of the best I've seen in a while.  
KALANI BROWN: You're right. I didn't have the points or the fancy double-
double, but I think I came out with great defense. I think that was my focus
in the whole game and I executed.  
  
Oh, the pass to DiDi. She just kept cutting and I just kept seeing her. In the
middle of a post move one time. I was like, Wow, she's really wide open.
(Laughter.)  
  
I just kept throwing it to her. If you all going to keep leaving her open, I'm
going to just throw it to her.  
  
Q. Kalani, you start the game by grabbing the rebound. You and Kristine
were right there and got an offensive rebound and then you went right back up
with a layup. Was that a big basket in your head at that moment to set the
tone?  
KALANI BROWN: I definitely think it was a momentum changer. Gave us a lot of
energy, and we were really excited to get the first basket. Got us on a roll.  
  
Q. Juicy, three pointer to end the first half. You mentioned at halftime
coach said to settle down and just keep shooting. How big was that shot in
terms of momentum and a good feeling going into the break?  
JUICY LANDRUM: I guess it was kind of a big moment of change; another shot
before that was an air ball.  
  
Supposed to be (indiscernible), but the play wasn't open. So, I mean, I just
hit the shot. Had to look up at the shot clock and shot it. Just happened to
look up and it was two seconds and I just took the shot.  
  
Q. Kalani, end the first quarter, beginning of the second you all
outscored them 25 to 2 run. Can you reflect on the atmosphere and this being
your senior year?  
KALANI BROWN: Fans play a big part. They give us so much energy and excitement
when they get excited when we make a great play. They push us to do better. I
don't know, we got some of the best fans in the country. Just been a blessing
to play in front of them.  
  
Q. Kalani, I know your drive and focus is to get to a Final Four. The
emotions of playing your last game in the Ferrell Center. You knew it would
come at some point, but what are the emotions like and was it like on that
victory lap?  
KALANI BROWN: I was more shocked than anything. I don't know. I'm going to
miss it for sure. I'm a little sad, but just want to thank Baylor nation. I'm
so grateful.  
  
Q. Chloe, the same thing for you. You guys went back in and she did the
substitution timeout. Big hug with Kim and then the victory lap. You only
spent one year here, but what were those moment like for you?  
CHLOE JACKSON: It's been a blessing to play here Baylor. I just can't thank
Coach Kim enough for the one year and just recruiting me to come here. I
definitely think I made the best decision. The fans have been amazing. They're
family for sure. This one year it's really felt longer to me. Yeah, it's a
blessing.  
  
Q. Chloe, going back to the game you mention the run. You guys wanted to
just keep it going. Before that when it is kind of back and forth and they had
the lead a couple times, talk about what if felt like.  
CHLOE JACKSON: Just to keep playing our game. We knew eventually we kind of
run them down, get them tired, but our transition is our go-to really. Love to
get our transition run. We knew once we started that they couldn't keep up
much longer.  
  
That was our main focus. I think that helped us on the run.  
  
Q. Kalani, you talked yesterday about getting maybe a one-on-one
matchup. Looked like had three on you. How much do you being able to handle
Kristine one-on-one really help your defense do you think?  
KALANI BROWN: Definitely helped me. She's a great player. She's athletic, can
jump out of the gym, so she definitely challenged me on the defensive end. To
just come and deliver I think speaks volumes for me, because moving my feet
has been something I've been working on for four years and I think I've gotten
better, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anymore questions for the student-athletes? Ladies, we'll let
you go. Thank you.  
  
Questions for Coach Mulkey.  
  
Q. Kim, I remember in the NCAA tournament selection show Andy Landers'
question about whether or not you all would be able to do tempo? Did you
answer that tonight?  
COACH MULKEY: Yeah, I don't know. You either go fast or you're slow. I think
we were fast tonight in parts of the game and parts of the game it was a half-
court game.  
  
I don't know if there is another part of tempo that he was referring to, but
we can do both. I think that when you get down to the top teams in the country
you're going to have to execute in the half court both offensively and
defensively, and we can do that.  
  
Q. Clearly the post matchup was fun to watch, but it seemed clear right
away that they were going to make your guards beat them. Just talk about what
Chloe and Juicy, your guards, were able to do.  
COACH MULKEY: Three things were key to this game. I said this before in the
scouting report. The best defensive team is going to win, best rebounding team
is going to win, and depth is going to be a factor.  
  
I thought all three played out. Cox and Kalani's defense, I think that's the
first game all year she didn't have a double-double. You give credit to Cox
who came out and guarded her in the second half. I thought they would go right
at here and didn't want to have Kalani pick up her third foul.  
  
I thought Kalani was tremendous on the defensive end because she was very
disciplined. Kalani always has trouble picking up that second foul, leaning
into them, wanting to block a shot. I just told her, The thing that will
impress people the most tonight is can you guard her, and I think she proved
that she could.  
  
Then when you talk about rebounding, that kid played 33 minutes and had six
rebounds, and I can't help bu look at NaLyssa Smith and Aquira DeCosta. They
both played 11 minutes, and Queen Egbo. All three of those. That's three
freshmen. They played 11 minutes and have unbelievable stats.  
  
So therein is the rebounding and also the depth that I thought would play a
factor.  
  
Q. Kim, do you think of a 25 to 2 run as sort of a knock-out punch? Is
that something that you want to see your team be able to do on a given
night?  
COACH MULKEY: Yeah, I would like to see it every game. As I told them when we
were up 40 in the timeout, don't look at the score. These last minutes I am
evaluating you as we progress in this tournament.  
  
Just keep coaching, because a lot of those kids are young. We only have two
seniors on the team. I just thought that -- you just got a bunch in that
locker room that can play. It's our job to keep them focused and motivated. I
think I have used everything possible to motivate them. I'm digging deep.
Showing them 2005 National Championship film.  
  
They're just looking at me like, Coach, God, you were younger, no wrinkles, no
gray hair. I said, Focus on the floor. Anything. Because, guys, it was a long
period. 12 days was a long period between the time our conference tournament
was over and playing, and you didn't want to become rusty. Wanted to give them
some days off.  
  
I was impressed with a lot of things on that floor for us tonight. We beat a
Cal team that was on a roll, that had won a lot of basketball games, that
plays in a great conference against some great teams. We came out ready to
play.  
  
Thought the crowd was good. They took their Geritol. Saw some folks that
honestly surprised me they can stay up this late. Now they proven it, they
need to get on that airplane and go to Greensboro. It's my understanding we
play the first game; is that right?  
  
THE MODERATOR: No. Second.  
  
COACH MULKEY: We play the second game Saturday in Greensboro at 2:00 p.m., so
that's 1:00 p.m. here, right?  
  
What else?  
  
Q. Kind of touched on it on that run in the? Second quarter. Chloe's
made some pretty big mid-range shots and long twos. You think those shots from
her really helped space you away from Cal?  
COACH MULKEY: I think Chloe's ability to shoot mid-range jumpers has made us a
very good basketball team, very dangerous team. She was a two player at LSU,
an off guard. You don't want to take that away by moving her to the point, so
really it never changed with us on her scoring ability.  
  
What did change was she now had to think the game through the eyes of a coach
on the floor. She has done a remarkable job with that.  
  
Q. Kim, you mentioned obviously the crowd here tonight. Apparently
throughout all 16 regions there were good crowds the first two rounds. Talk
about what that means for women's college basketball.  
COACH MULKEY: Well, it's why we moved from neutral courts. I read Brice
Cherry's article in Sunday's paper, and I'm not sure the gist of his article,
but it sounded like he wanted to say home court is an advantage. Well, we've
tried the other way, as you all heard me say. We're not ready for that. What I
would say to him is get better. If you're one that doesn't get to host, get
better. Improve your team.  
  
You know, I'm not a believer, like he said in his article, that the tournament
starts after you get to the Sweet 16. I thought that was a great game tonight.
I've seen some lower seeds get beat. Didn't I just see Missouri State beat
Iowa State on their home floor? There were five lower-seeded teams in the
round of 32 that worn. Miami got to beat in the second round and they were a
three or four seed.  
  
So disagreed with his article that the game doesn't start until basically you
get to a Sweet 16. Maybe I interpreted the article wrong. Man, I sure wish he
would've talked about what a great memory it was for Abilene Christian. God,
what a memory those kids have, instead of something that came across as
negative.  
  
Q. You talked about Queen and what she was able to do in 11 minutes. A
lot of that was even with Anigwe still in the game. For her to have eight
points, six rebounds, two blocks...  
COACH MULKEY: Look at NaLyssa's stats. Look at Aquira's stats. I couldn't pick
one of the three of them because what they did was outstanding. We emphasize
rebounding to those kids, and they went in there. The points are icing on the
cake.  
  
What they did defensively in altering shots -- they fouled a couple times --
but just going in there and rebounding the ball, and all three of those kids
did that.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about the fans allowing you to feed the monster all
the time. You exhibited such excellence in 19 years. What do you have to say
for your fans about continuing to feed the monster?  
COACH MULKEY: They're still here. I shouldn't say that, because a lot of the
them have passed away. We've lost a ton of great supporters, Maggie. They
appreciate women's basketball at Baylor University. I'm blessed. Little did we
know as a staff when we came here 19 years ago that we would do this as
quickly as we did it.  
  
And then to maintain it, it wears on you. It wears on you. Some coaches have a
different personality than I do. I give it everything I have. I give it every
ounce of energy I have. Those kids give it every ounce of energy they have.
The fans, God bless them, because they love women's basketball here at Baylor.  
  
Q. Kim, now you go to Greensboro to play South Carolina. Do you like the
fact that you've been to Columbia, South Carolina to play South Carolina?  
COACH MULKEY: I thought about that. Do I like the fact that we've already
played them this year or would I rather go into it not knowing much about each
other? I don't know. But we know what they do; they know what we do.  
  
It'll be like a home court to them. What is it, couple hours, two, three hours
from their home. I'm not sure NC State, Kentucky. Who one that? NC State. It's
be a home court for them. That's where the ACC tournament is played there.  
  
That's okay. That's okay. We'll go and give it our best shot, and got to win
two to get to a Final Four. It's fun. It's fun.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions? Coach, congratulations on the win.  
  
COACH MULKEY: Thank you.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor - 102, Cal 63  
  
COACH GOTTLIEB: First I would just like to thank all the fine people in Waco
who work here at Baylor and the city of Waco who put this on. You could not
have treated us better. I say with a due respect, I hope not to see you again
next year or the year after or the year after.  
  
But the familiarity and the kindness with which you've treated us and the
professional way you handled this speaks well for your university and the
city.  
  
Credit to Baylor. No shock they're really, really good. We said as a game plan
we wanted to make their guards beat us. When it was more of a game early in
the game, even going into halftime, I think Lauren had six and Kalani had six
and their guards beat us, had a lot.  
  
So it got away from us in the second half more, but that's a sign of a
terrific team. I don't know if Kim has already been named National Coach of
the Year. If she hasn't, she should surely be one of the ones up there. You
lose your point guard early, got a ton of talent, but making it all work
together is something that is pretty remarkable.  
  
I will say regardless of the score I am extremely proud of our young women. I
thought how they handled themselves at the start of game when it was close and
we had the lead, and even more so when it got away from us is a credit to
them.  
  
I have two of my seniors up here who I love like family. To be honest, it's
neat that they're sitting here with Kianna, who had an amazing game and will
take over probably for them as the face of the program. That's a really neat
thing when you can see your seniors and feel like they can pass on what
they've done to the younger people.  
  
You could not get seniors that have done more for a program than Kristine and
AT. I know they haven't won the most games of any Cal players ever, but they
have been remarkable. Where they are now as people is something I'm really
proud of, so I'll cherish every last minute I have with them here, and then I
will be their biggest fans when they're professional basketball players and
professional in other things as well.  
  
Thanks.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach. Questions for student-athletes.  
  
Q. Kristine, obviously a tough way for it to finish, but talk about you
had the two fouls early on. Did that affect you much at all, take you out of
what you were trying to do? Looked like it only slowed you down for a minute
though.  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: No, nothing can really slow me down. I guess the two fouls
definitely I had to adjust and play differently. Kalani is really, really good
player and Lauren Cox as well. Playing against them when I was in foul trouble
was hard. Couldn't be as active as I wanted to be.  
  
You know, I don't know. My team had my back I feel like. We had those doubles
really hard. I think they ended up with like below their average clearly. I
had two fouls in the first half. I ended up having four falls in the third
quarter. That really, really was like I had to back off. I couldn't be as
active as I usually play.  
  
I think we played our best many like against Kalani and Lauren, so...  
  
Q. AT, obviously your last game. Try to put in perspective what it means
to get to this point. I know you're disappointed, but in general.  
ASHA THOMAS: Of course we don't like the outcome of this. I would say to get
to this point with my teammates, my family. There is no better feeling knowing
you do what you could do. I mean, throughout these four years, not just this
game. Definitely been a blessing, connection, sisterhood.  
  
That's something I'll have for the rest of my life. I wouldn't take anything
-- I don't think I'll regret anything that I have right now.  
  
Q. Kianna, talk about that first quarter. You kind of got on a hot roll.
You all had a lead until right there late. How well were you playing in the
first quarter?  
KIANNA SMITH: We came into this game believing we can win. This is the NCAA
tournament. That's what you do. Baylor is good team. We had no doubt that we
could come out on the other side.  
  
Q. I would like to know from any of the four of you, what was going
through your mind when Baylor was just going crazy scoring there beginning
late in the first quarter through the next two periods?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Like Kianna said, it's the NCAA tournament. Of course we're
trying stay in the game, trying to do whatever it takes to win.  
  
We were still in the game the first quarter, the second quarter. We could have
came back. We didn't put our heads down, didn't give up. That's what's going
through our mind, not giving up, and I think that is what every team in this
tournament is doing.  
  
There are 32 teams left for a reason, and those teams are incredible and
really good and they can compete. The score does not show like who we are.
Like we are -- I don't know. I wish we could play that game over again. Yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for the student-athletes? All right,
ladies. Thank you very much.  
  
ASHA THOMAS: Thank you.  
  
KIANNA SMITH: Thank you.  
  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the coach.  
  
Q. How does a coach and team react when they're just going nuts shooting
the ball and scoring so many in the second and third quarters?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Well, it's not the fun part of the job. I mean, my reaction
when their guards are hitting every mid-range pull-up and Juicy is gonna to go
50% from three, I'm thinking, This team is a favorite to win the National
Championship.  
  
Can we have been better in our game plan? Absolutely. We gave up too many
offensive rebounds. We were late on a few rotations. But they're so powerful
inside and there are so many bodies coming at you.  
  
We say Kalani and Cox, but then there are three more coming off the bench that
are pretty darn good. You can't play them one-on-one inside so you've got to
give up something.  
  
If you're forcing them to beat you from the outside and they're beating you
from the outside, my thought is, Gosh they probably deserve to win. Even
though we're looking for adjustment of what we can do better.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned Baylor's having to reinvent itself at the point
guard position. Chloe Jackson, the way she was hitting shots, really was the
catalyst for them tonight. What's your impression of what she's been able to
do for them this season?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, we actually played against her couple years ago at LSU.
She was really good then. When you have a grad transfer, it's a different kind
of deal. It's a one-year thing. You have to integrate quickly and figure the
roles out. I don't know intimate knowledge of their system, but I know she
wasn't naturally a point guard. They had a need for a pint guard, and she's
been able to fill that role to the tune of them being the No. 1 team in the
country.  
  
Credit to her figuring out what they needed her to do and she's done it
really, really well.  
  
Q. Like you said, you almost have to pick your poison with this team. I
think Juicy missed her first four. Are you feeling like maybe we did pick the
right thing?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah. I mean, I thought the first quarter, you know, was
indicative of how we wanted the game to go, which is you have to sandwich the
big kids and not let them get touches; when they get touches, double them and
try to make the other people beat you.  
  
Obviously Juicy is over 40% from the year for three. She's a good three-point
shooter. We're not trying to let her get as many open looks. You can do some
things a little bit with DiDi because she's knows her role and she's not
necessarily looking to shoot a ton.  
  
We we're just trying to make them take uncomfortable, awkward shots, like we
faced at times when people double and triple Kristine. When you are out of the
shots that you normally get, that's when you have a chance to maybe rattle a
team.  
  
Unfortunately the ball screen action really hurt us, because that kind of got
rid of the primary defender, and now she's hitting open mid-range shots. We
had a hesitancy for a post player to show or hedge, because now you're
dropping it to six, seven, and it's hard to rotate on that.  
  
They made the shots they needed to make. Then, like I said later, got away
from us and everything wasn't working. Early on we would take a game like that
where we're scoring and they're missing some shots and hitting some shots.
That's how you stay in the game with them.  
  
Q. As you said a minute ago, this is a team that can win a National
Championship. You've seen them too much at this time of the year. Is this team
much better than the other two you faced?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I mean, I thought the team that we lost to here two years ago
was pretty darn good. That was when the Final Four was in Dallas, right? They
ended up losing to I think Mississippi State in the Elite 8. That team I
thought could have easily been in the Final Four as well.  
  
This team is really, really good because the post play is more mature. It was
younger at that time. They're so deep so they can withstand one of the posts
getting in foul trouble. Their strengths aren't matched by anybody else's in
the country exactly.  
  
But other teams are really, really good in other areas and can maybe find
weaknesses of theirs I guess. I think they're obviously a contender to win the
National Championship, as are, the fun part of college basketball this year,
five other teams.  
  
Q. Kristine had the double-double streak. Were they just doing that good
of a job blocking her out and making sure she wasn't getting in there?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah. Can we just talk about that for a second? 33 consecutive
double-doubles. The kid has had a year that should be in the history books,
will be in the history books of women's college basketball. She had a tough
night tonight. They can do what some other teams can't do against us is why it
was a terrible matchup for us.  
  
Kim said some really nice things in her pre-game, that for them it's more like
Sweet 16 matchup. It's not a great matchup for us because they can guard her
one-on-one more than most teams can and pressure our guards because of the
size.  
  
She missed a couple she can make, but obviously it's a little bit different.
There is one of her and six of them on that roster. Literally size-wise they
can just run people at her.  
  
I think they wore down a little bit. Some of the out-of-area rebounds that she
goes and gets. Here she is still incredibly athletic and can get her hands on
them, but doesn't completely come down with it.  
  
And I do think the early foul trouble was a factor. I have a lot of the
confidence to play her through foul trouble because she is pretty smart and
has good body control, but of course it's going to make her a little less
aggressive.  
  
All of that together made her have a little bit of a tough night, but I think
she still puts a lot of pressure on the defense where they have to guard her
quite a bit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions for coach? Coach, congratulations on a
great season. We appreciate your time.  
  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Thank you. Appreciate it.

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. I was going to ask you if you had a song for this game, but --  
KIM MULKEY: I don't have any country songs about Cal Berkeley.  
  
Q. But I was going to ask you, have y'all gone through the film of Cal?
What have you seen from them?  
KIM MULKEY: I think this match-up is going to have a Sweet 16 atmosphere to it
because they have outstanding post play. They have outstanding guards. They
are a team that has upperclassmen. They just match up well with us. I think
it's going to be just a battle.  
  
Q. Lauren talked about looking forward to playing Cal. They have similar
size, and kind of reflect on that with Kalani and Lauren coming in with
similar size.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, Kalani and Lauren were babies -- their freshman and
sophomore year they got to guard Anigwe and vice versa, so they're very
familiar with Cal. Of course you guys probably, I know that y'all know this,
Receé Caldwell committed to Baylor while she was in high school and then
decommitted and then she went to UCLA, Texas Tech, and now she's at Cal. So
they're familiar with a lot of their players.  
  
They looked at the stat sheet with us this morning in film session, and we
made them look at how many offensive boards she has on the year, and it was
just astronomical, a hundred and, gosh, 20 something, 30 something, offensive
rebounds. Lauren Cox has the most on our team at 62, and we think we're pretty
good.  
  
The big difference, though, is there's a big dropoff from her going to the
offensive boards and the next one on their team has like 23. We have about
four or five kids that are 62, 58, 40 something, 40 something. We just brought
those kinds of things to their attention. They're going to have to defend.
They're going to have to keep her off the offensive boards, and then they
realize that she's not the only player that can play. They have a very
balanced team, and their depth is not what our depth is. They want to play
about seven players, and we understand that they've had an up-and-down season.
They lost five in a row and then they've been on a winning streak here of
late. We told them you lost to Stanford, they beat Stanford, but then they
lost to Stanford, I think they played them back-to-back games. So they know
how good they are.  
  
I told them, this is going to be like a Sweet 16 match-up because we have that
much respect and realize how good they are.  
  
Q. You might have kind of answered this with that answer there, but how
different is this Cal team from the one you faced a couple years ago?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, they're older, just like our kids are older, but you have a
grad transfer in Caldwell that runs the show for them, and then you have
quickness in Thomas, the kid that's a senior, and then you have a role player
there with Smith, who if you leave her alone, she's going to burn you with a
perimeter shot.  
  
I think both post players last night, those kids can bang with you. You know,
you bring McKenzie off the bench and the other post player that shoots the
three, I mean, they have everything -- if you look at what we do, they have
everything that we have except in my opinion the depth.  
  
Q. Bringing up that depth, could you see you guys pushing the pace like
you did in the opening minutes against ACU, try to go transition and see if
they can keep up with you?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, we're going to do that regardless. That's just who we are.
But they also do it. They're going to push the pace. You know, they're not
going to change who they are. We're not going to change who we are. They play
in a good conference. You know, those guys see Oregon and Stanford and Oregon
State, and so they've seen teams like us.  
  
It's just going to be who makes plays, who outlasts the other one, who stays
out of foul trouble. Can't let the unexpected happen. What do I mean by that?
You can't allow a player that you forget about and she has an all-world game.
We know what we face. Don't let somebody be an outstanding player for one game
that isn't normally an outstanding player. Defense, you know, I talked to them
about look at what we average holding our opponents to, and look what they
average holding their opponents to, and I think when you say things like that,
they really, really understand why we just really emphasize defense.  
  
I think Cal gives up about 70 something points a game, and we give up 50
something points, and when you play the good teams that match up with you,
sometimes that's the difference in the game is who's the better defensive
team.  
  
Q. The play they made at the end of the third quarter last night was a
buzzer beater but it was also a well-executed play.  
KIM MULKEY: Yes, it was, and we showed that to the kids in the film room. We
thought that was outstanding, and we also showed them where defense plays a
factor. I showed them some kids who gave up on the play for North Carolina,
not to be picking on North Carolina, but you have to show, well, why did that
work, and we just got through watching that.  
  
Q. I know you haven't played in a couple weeks, but was it important to
be able to get your starters off the floor last night and get them some
rest?  
KIM MULKEY: It's been important all year. That's what depth does for you. The
game dictates that. But if you can draw it up the way you'd like for it to, it
would be get them enough minutes to get back in the flow and then get them off
the floor for the next game. And we were able to do that. Yes, it was good.  
  
Q. Is the depth of women's basketball better? It seems like some of
these second-round games are a little more competitive or at least they appear
to be. Is it better, and why, if so?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I think some of the first-round games, not the 1 and 16
seeds, but if you look at some of the first-round games, I think some of the
lower seeds are getting beat. When I say lower, I mean the higher seeds are
getting beat by a lower seed. Why is it getting better? Maybe just kids are
wanting to go places to stay close to home or help start a new tradition
somewhere. Maybe a relationship with a coach. I don't really know, but it sure
is good. I think it's good for women's basketball.  
  
Q. Kim, what do you remember about Receé Caldwell? What does she bring
to them, and what about the match-up between her and Chloe if they're on each
other?  
KIM MULKEY: See, he already thinks I'm going to put Chloe on her. I will tell
you what I think of Receé Caldwell. Outstanding player. I don't know if you
were in here when we said we got a commit the night after her junior summer
and then she decommitted, so if we were recruiting her, I tend to think that
she -- we evaluate pretty good. I think she's a kid that has traveled to
numerous schools and wants to finish on a high note.  
  
I think she's their quarterback out there on the floor. She also can shoot the
perimeter shot, and she's not going to get in foul trouble. They don't have
much depth. I don't see any of them getting in much foul trouble through the
course of the year. So they're going to play a lot of minutes. They're used to
playing a lot of minutes. She's an outstanding player.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 24, 2019

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Thanks for being here. Appreciate the coverage. We're
certainly excited to still be dancing. It's the best time of year. We know
it's a huge challenge in front of us playing Baylor. They're the No. 1 overall
seed for a reason. The job that Coach Kim has done with this team is
remarkable, and it's a big task in front of us. But at the same time, I don't
think I'd be doing my job and I don't think we'd be doing our -- playing our
role as a basketball team if we didn't believe that we could come in here and
win, and our players are locked in and they're focused. We had a good
practice, and we'll take our shot against a great, great team tomorrow. We're
looking forward to it.  
  
Q. You mentioned them being the No. 1 overall seed and yet you guys
match up with them in a lot of ways, sort of favor each other in a lot of
ways. Is that exciting for you as a coach, to be so similar to a team that's
the No. 1 in the country?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I think any time you see the match-up in front of you, you
watch film and you look for ways to find how you could potentially be
successful.  
  
The fact that their size is their dominating characteristic and that we have
good size and good interior play is -- we say, okay, let's look at what we can
do to be successful. I don't know that anyone looks at a Baylor match-up and
gets excited about the match-up because of how good they are, but I think we
have a confidence about us because maybe we're more dangerous than our seed in
the sense that we have some players, Kristine included, and the rest of size
that can match up. But it may come down to perimeter play, if we're able to
kind of match up a little bit better inside than some teams do.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about that inside match-up there, but is it
exciting just to see two or three great post players just have a chance to go
at each other down near the basket there?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I think it's unique. I think there will be a lot of
eyes from WNBA coaches on this game, that kind of thing. I think you're
looking at a couple first-round draft picks, and I think from a women's
basketball excitement standpoint, for sure.  
  
We're looking at it just as Cal versus Baylor and how do we figure out a game
plan that gives us a shot to beat a great team. So the opportunity to play in
the second round no matter who the match-up would be would be exciting, but
obviously your eyes go to Kalani and Kristine, the front court. But like I
said, it may come down to the play of everybody else, and we're just looking
forward to competing against a great team.  
  
Q. You watched the game last night, obviously, Abilene Christian. Did
you see anything in that game that surprised you or stuck out to you?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I mean, not surprised at all because I watched so much on
film, but to see them come in with waves and waves of players that don't get
all the attention and all the minutes and yet they're still -- I think that's
what's so eye popping. They're just All-American after All-American coming off
the bench at every spot. I think also just seeing them in person, the size and
the length and how hard they play is really impressive, and they have an
incredible team, and it's not just one or two people. Obviously there's a lot
of attention around Cox and Kalani, but they can come -- like I said, roll in
players off the bench.  
  
Also, the other thing that stands out is what a wonderful atmosphere it is
here. The place was crowded for our game. Appreciate good basketball fans, and
I think the Baylor fans came out to see a really 8-9 match-up and then
obviously it really filled up, I think, how loud it was. I was in here doing
some media when the game started and you could hear the crowd. Those are the
things that stand out live. Most of the stuff I had seen on film.  
  
Q. You were obviously here two years ago and faced Baylor in the second
round there, as well. How different is this year's team for you guys than it
was two years ago?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Our team? Yeah. I think we shoot the ball a lot better. I
think we've turned ourselves into -- used to be Cal was kind of like maybe
athletic players into post play, but the knock was we couldn't shoot it, but
now I think we shoot it extremely well and we have for about the last half of
the season. That's a difference. And also just our veteran leadership. We were
very, very young when we came the last time, and I think that's a huge
difference, just players having been here before, having gone through a lot of
different experiences in the life of a basketball player.  
  
Q. Yesterday North Carolina sort of threw the first punch and got you
guys down by 12, I think, and then I feel like I noticed that there was a lot
more communication on the floor with your kids, especially coming from Receé.
Is that something by design? Is that something you needed to get them to do
starting at that point?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, I mean, Receé is -- she's an elite communicator, an
elite leader. She has been since I've known her with the USA Basketball team
when she was 16, 17 years old. She's really special in that regard.  
  
I think for our entire team, though, they did throw the first punch, and
they're a great scoring team. They came out, we weren't getting any stops. We
were having a little trouble scoring, and I think at that point you can't just
flip a switch and score 12 straight points. You have to change something that
will then ultimately change the flow of the game, and for us it was our
demeanor and our communication, and I do think that often starts with Receé on
our team. But I think we really did a nice job of kind of locking in and doing
a much better job after that first quarter, and it starts with that
communication and leadership, I think.  
  
Q. Kim talked about not letting the unexpected happen, not letting a
player maybe beat you that shouldn't beat you, that kind of thing. Is there
anybody on Baylor or maybe a part -- you mentioned the perimeter. Is that
something like you can't let their perimeter beat you, or what's an unexpected
thing against Baylor?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, you know, you obviously -- in some ways, you want to
try and make a team have to beat you with something they're uncomfortable
with, right, like you can't let them -- look, they're proven what they do well
is 31 wins and one loss, right, you have to try and make them win in a way
that they're not completely comfortable. But I would say for them, I always
think Melissa Smith is a big X factor for them. Gosh, the kid is so good. Is
only coming off the bench because they have two incredible other post players,
but I think she's an X factor for them because when she comes in and plays
like an All-American, that just puts them at a whole 'nother level, so I think
we have to not relax if one of the two starting post players gets a breather.
I would say she's a huge X factor for them.  
  
Q. Lauren Cox compared your size with Stanford's, the only team that
Baylor has lost to. Do you think playing in the Big 12, how has that helped
prepare you for this game?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Yeah, the Pac-12, I think the Pac-12 prepares us as well as
we can possibly be prepared. I think that the game plans of coaches like Tara
VanDerveer and Scott Rueck and Charlie and UCLA's pressure, we've seen all
kinds of different defenses, and I think our players are -- they understand
kind of what tournament play feels like before you're in the tournament
because that's what every night is like in the Pac-12, so we've seen a lot of
different defenses. We can learn from other people's defenses. We can learn
what they've done against us and other people, so I do think having seen size
and aggression -- no one is Baylor's front court. There's just nobody in the
country like them, which is why they are where they are, but I do think we
have faced all kinds of defenses against us and we have faced all kinds of
teams, and clearly you point to Stanford as having played them three times,
has given us a lot of knowledge that a lot of teams don't get.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 24, 2019

  

### [Lauren Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33249)

### [NaLyssa Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36658)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. Lauren, have you guys gotten to take a look at Cal yet? They seem a
lot like you guys in a lot of ways. Do you see that at all?  
LAUREN COX: Yeah, we just finished the scouting report. They have posts that
can bang with us inside. They've got some size. They've got some good guards
that can shoot on the perimeter. So it's going to be tough. We're going to go
over their sets in practice today and prepare as best we can.  
  
Q. Lauren, obviously they have Anigwe inside. She had like 22 rebounds
yesterday. That's always a point of emphasis anyway, but is it more the focus
now knowing that she's there?  
LAUREN COX: Yeah, for sure. I mean, Coach said we're not going to shut her out
and not let her get any rebounds, but as much as we can limit her, she always
says it's just as important that she doesn't get it as like one of us gets it.  
  
Q. NaLyssa, first tournament experience, getting to play a lot of
minutes. What was that like for you? How are you handling the tournament so
far, and do you feel like that's going to help you going forward?  
NaLYSSA SMITH: It was fun so far being that it's my first NCAA game, and I did
play that big amount of minutes. It was just a fun experience, and I just want
to keep going.  
  
Q. Lauren, you always like a challenge, so this Anigwe, you're going to
be facing her, are you looking at it as a personal challenge tomorrow, or is
it going to be Kalani on her?  
LAUREN COX: Well, to start the game it'll be Kalani but we're going to throw a
bunch of different people at her because it's going to be a team effort trying
to stop her. Like you said, I like a challenge, so it'll be fun.  
  
Q. NaLyssa, you've played a pretty big role in some of the games this
year because the first person coming off the bench for one of the other bigs.
You've got a pretty big responsibility. Do you feel like some of the games,
Arizona State in particular, have gotten you ready for what you might see
tomorrow?  
NaLYSSA SMITH: For sure. The games in the beginning have prepared me a lot for
what's going to be heading down to the NCAA Tournament, so from there I just
have to perfect the things that I did before and just make sure I use it in
the tournament.  
  
Q. NaLyssa, I'm not sure how much you pay attention to the bench when
you're in, but when the starters are out, they're just going nuts over there
on the sideline. How much do y'all feed off of that if you see it because Didi
and Lauren, they're going crazy when you do anything.  
NaLYSSA SMITH: We feed off of it a lot, just knowing that your team supports
you how they do, and when you score it's just a boost of momentum to see like
your teammates going crazy, especially the starters. It just sets the tone of
the games.  
  
Q. Lauren, Recee' Caldwell runs the point for them, graduate transfer
running the point, a lot like you guys have. Do you see similarities between
her and Chloe, and what do you remember about her from Texas Tech?  
LAUREN COX: She's a shooter with some deep range. Chloe is more of a mid-range
shooter. She likes to shoot the three. I think a lot of times when she drives
she's looking to kick it. Chloe is looking to score if she can when she
drives. But it'll be a good match-up.  
  
Q. You guys had a 12-day layoff. Did you feel like going in yesterday
you might have a little rust trying to get in a rhythm, but that didn't
happen?  
LAUREN COX: It was one of those things where you have to get back in game
shape because you can practice all you want, but running up and down the floor
is different.  
  
It was kind of that first five minutes of the game, and then once that media
time-out hit, you kind of caught your second wind.  
  
Q. Lauren, Coach has talked about you all looking forward to, you and
Kalani, when you play a team similar in size to you guys. Just kind of
elaborate on that, playing a team that has a similar size match-up.  
LAUREN COX: I know me and Kalani like it because they might still throw a
double-team at us, but it's not going to be three and four people coming and
crowding around us because they do have the size and they can bang around with
us inside. When you have smaller guard-like posts on you, they're just all up
under you, you can't really move much, and they're just trying to be physical
with you.  
  
Q. NaLyssa, coming in as a freshman, what were your expectations for the
NCAA Tournament? What are your expectations going forward, how much you're
going to play, the nerves, the quality of competition, that type of thing?  
NaLYSSA SMITH: Expectations, I really didn't know what to expect going into
the tournament, so really it's just whenever Coach calls my name I just know I
need to go out there and perform, when she does call my name.  
  
Q. Elaborate on that a little bit. Aquira said at the last game in
Oklahoma City that Coach called her name, she wasn't expecting it early in the
contest. What's that like when you're sitting there, you're having to pay
attention to the game but also listening for her to call, and she said she was
shocked when she got called in that early in the game. Does that happen
sometimes?  
NaLYSSA SMITH: That doesn't really happen with me because I know like whenever
a post player gets tired I know it's my turn to go in the game next. But I
guess like Aquira, she doesn't know when she's going to get her name called,
so she always has to be ready.  
  
Q. Lauren, can you think of another team you've played this year that
has the kind of size Cal has that might be comparable?  
LAUREN COX: I think the physicality of Cal is similar to Stanford. Stanford
really pushed us around, was really physical with us, wore us out. So I think
they have that similarity.  
  
Q. Lauren, y'all took and hit more threes than y'all normally do. Was
that sort of just the pace of the game, or is that something that you know you
can do and keep in your back pocket?  
LAUREN COX: I think it's something we know we can do. It depends who's
hitting. Juicy was hitting her shots. I think when Aquira hit that first one
she got the confidence to take a few more shots. Honesty hit one, Moon hit
one. It's something we're capable of doing, but it's just kind of the flow of
the game and who has confidence.  
  
Q. Lauren, I guess it doesn't count as a block, but was that out-of-
bounds kill, was that one of the more satisfying times that you've had that
kind of play?  
LAUREN COX: I honestly didn't think I was going to hit it like that. If
anything I was just going to get a tip or something like that. But I think
it's just -- I think the sound of it is more -- like gives you more momentum
than anything because it's just that loud bank and everybody was just like,
huh, just gives you some excitement.  
  
Q. Lauren, we want to clarify, so you didn't look up there and see Cal's
player sitting up there and give them a message, right?  
LAUREN COX: Well, it actually almost hit one of them because they weren't
paying attention. But they know that we're shot blockers, and I mean, they
are, too. They have the size. They knew that about us.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 24, 2019

  

### [Kristine Anigwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30389)

### [Asha Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33253)

### [Receé Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37082)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. Kristine, but really any of you guys if you want to chime in, when
you look at Baylor, they're the No. 1 team in the nation, yet you guys have a
lot of similar pieces as they do. Do you kind of like that, that they're so
highly ranked but you can compare yourselves with them so well?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Baylor is a really, really good team, and I don't think we're
trying to compare ourselves to them. I just think we're trying to figure out
like what's the best match-up, and I think they're incredibly talented, and
I'm excited to play them tomorrow.  
  
Q. Kristine, Lauren and Kalani both talked about how they actually like
going against bigger players, that it's really annoying when they have to face
the smaller. Do you enjoy that challenge just facing somebody your size, that
kind of thing?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Yeah, I enjoy playing basketball, so I enjoy playing if
they're bigger than me or if they're the same size as me or they're smaller
than me. It doesn't really matter. I guess playing against Lauren and Kalani
would be really great. Yeah.  
  
Q. Receé, obviously you were recruited by Baylor, I think at one time
committed to them and then played here when you were at Texas Tech. Do you
bring any inside info to your team when it comes to playing Baylor?  
RECEÉ CALDWELL: I'm pretty familiar with Baylor, just being in the Big 12 for
three years and being committed to them in eighth grade or whatever grade I
was in. I know a lot of the players. I know how they play. I still remember
scouting report stuff from like Texas Tech.  
  
I mean, having a sense of familiarity in who you play is really nice for me,
but at the end of the day, it's basketball, you know.  
  
Q. Kristine or Asha, you guys were here a couple years ago; how much
different is this team and I guess how much better prepared are you for this
challenge?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, playing Baylor for the second time in my career is
really cool because like again, a sense of familiarity with them, so it's like
playing against them and Lauren and Kalani, I've played against them, this is
my second time, and I have played against them in the past at USA and
McDonald's America and like in high school. It's kind of cool.  
  
ASHA THOMAS: I would just say this is a whole different team than we had two
years ago with new faces and different skill sets than we didn't have two
years ago. So I think it will be a better match-up I would say for tomorrow.  
  
Q. Lauren Cox said just about a half hour ago, she compared you guys to
Stanford when asked what team has Baylor played with the size you have. Would
you agree that you and Stanford are similar?  
RECEÉ CALDWELL: I could see that comparison. Alanna and Kristine, like we have
good guard play, we can shoot it. I think we have similar styles. Obviously we
have differences like every other team has. I can see the comparison.  
  
ASHA THOMAS: I would agree with that.  
  
Q. Asha, you hit some big shots yesterday to kind of help keep you guys
going in the first half and obviously that's a big part of your game. When you
watch the way Baylor defends the perimeter, that's become a big emphasis of
theirs. What do you see in how they do that?  
ASHA THOMAS: I mean, I know how to score. I know the ways to score, not only
just scoring but finding my teammates who's open, where there's a mismatch or
where -- areas that we're capable of scoring at, so we just play basketball.  
  
Q. Asha, what impact or what difference has Receé made in this team,
adding another nice piece to this roster?  
ASHA THOMAS: Definitely just her leadership, her overall leadership, being
vocal, seeing the floor, her IQ is very high for us, and she sees things two
and three steps ahead than maybe I do sometimes. But she's definitely a big
part of who we are right now.  
  
Q. What's the one thing you cannot let Baylor do tomorrow, that you feel
like you have to stop?  
ASHA THOMAS: Inside.  
  
RECEÉ CALDWELL: We have to attack the offensive glass and defensive glass. I
think that's going to be a big part of the game.  
  
ASHA THOMAS: Inside.  
  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: I agree with both of them, yeah.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, just kind of on a fun level, when Lauren Cox
blocked that pass, that pass in last night, it kind of came to y'all's area
where you were watching. Did that kind of wake anybody up on the bench or was
everybody watching pretty close? What did y'all think about that play?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: She made a play. She did what she needed to do.  
  
ASHA THOMAS: I don't think we took it any other way. She blocked the ball --
her mindset is blocking the ball and not letting it get in. That's just her.  
  
RECEÉ CALDWELL: We've seen Kristine make a lot of those plays, so we're all
right.  
  
Q. Kristine, like you said, I think you played with Lauren on one of the
USA teams a couple of years ago. What do you remember about that? I think you
guys won a gold medal at I don't remember what level it was, but you won a
gold medal. What do you remember about that experience?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: It was definitely incredible playing with her. She's a really
good athlete, a really good player. She came to a really good university, and
they utilize her well, so I think Baylor fits her style of play, and I'm
excited to play against her. I remember her playing volleyball when she was
younger, so that play, volleyball play. Yeah.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor 95, Abilene Christian 38  
  
Q. Just talk about the start this team got off. I know you got a good
start but the team as a whole and what that did to get you guys rolling.  
KALANI BROWN: I thought we came out with a lot of energy and that's what I
said to the team in the huddle before we came to the sideline. We got out and
started running in transition and getting the ball into the post early,
sharing the ball pretty much. It was a good team win.  
  
Q. Kalani, is there anyone in the country that can guard you?  
KALANI BROWN: I'm not going to --  
  
COACH KIM MULKEY: One-on-one or double or-triple team?  
  
KALANI BROWN: I'd like to see a one-on-one. I haven't in a while. I don't
know. Maybe you have to stay tuned.  
  
Q. Any of y'all want to chime in. A couple No. 1 seeds on the men's side
that had close games until halftime. Did you see that at all, want to make
sure that wasn't you guys?  
KALANI BROWN: We definitely watched the games yesterday, but I don't know, I
think we just hopped on them early and got them back on their heals in the
first half.  
  
DIDI RICHARDS: Definitely might be only one No. 1 team that had a close game,
so that's in the back of your head when you're playing sometimes. (Giggles).
We got it.  
  
Q. Juicy, at what point, and maybe it's from the very start, does Kim
say, "Don't even look at the scoreboard. Just play."  
JUICY LANDRUM: I guess you could say -- 30, very always says just look at the
score like it's 0-0 and just play like it's the start of the game.  
  
Q. There were several times where you and Lauren sat on the bench and
you were watching and you were watching the young players. What did you think
as you watched those guys play? You get to see from a players' perspective.
What did you think when you were watching?  
KALANI BROWN: I was proud, for one. NaLyssa got her first double-double in the
NCAA Tournament, and I was excited for her. Watching them work and not miss a
beat, I mean, it don't get no better than that.  
  
Q. Didi, Kalani just touched on it right there, but for this team to be
able to rest up a little bit, knowing how many games you have coming up in
these next couple weeks, how important was that?  
DIDI RICHARDS: Very important, I would say, because our legs could start
giving out eventually, I say, so being able to sub and keep running up the
score is a good asset that we have for this team this year.  
  
Q. Any of the players who want to answer. With as much emphasis as you
guys place on defense, how rewarding was it for you to get that 20-0 start?  
DIDI RICHARDS: It was really rewarding. The only part that kind of hurt was
when they scored. Might have been rewarding for the first couple minutes we
had it, but when they started scoring and got on a little run or whatever, it
kind of hurt, but we thought we were doing pretty good.  
  
JUICY LANDRUM: Hurrrt.  
  
KALANI BROWN: I just thought we were having fun today doing what we do best,
getting out in transition. I don't know, we were hitting on all cylinders.
Keep playing like that, hey, you never know. (More giggling.)  
  
JUICY LANDRUM: Like Didi said, always a dagger in the heart when you see the
score, but just having fun out there.  
  
Q. For all of y'all, speaking of having fun, I think the crowd got a big
kick out of Lauren's swat at the inbound pass. Y'all's reaction? I think it
went into the Cal team as they were watching the game.  
DIDI RICHARDS: Hopefully it intimidated them a little bit (more giggling.)
Kidding.  
  
JUICY LANDRUM: Thought the ball -- I had to look up to see. It almost went
into in the stands.  
  
KALANI BROWN: I'm used to it. I just know it was high and it went somewhere,
you know. She always like to cover the distance when she do that so (more
giggling.)  
  
Q. Exactly what you're looking for in a game like this, the start.  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I thought the atmosphere was outstanding. I thought the
crowd was great. They need to come back Monday night, 8:00 PM start from what
I've been told. So that's going to hit into the Geritol time for a lot of our
fans, so they need to take it, get their naps in, so that they can be back
here because, guys, that was special tonight.  
  
Yes, to answer your question. You're excited to play. We haven't played in
about 12 days I think. You get nervous when you're off that long a period of
time, or you're going to come out rusty. I didn't think we came out rusty.  
  
I thought when we hit a lot of threes, nine threes, 61 rebounds, they tell me
may be a record. I thought our posts ran the floor well early. I thought that
being able to play a lot of players double-figure minutes will help us,
hopefully, Monday night. It's a good game. It was just a good game on our
part.  
  
Q. You've said before just how much fun this team has together, and I
think we got to see an example of that.  
COACH KIM MULKEY: The silliness you just saw up here, they wouldn't be like
that if we hadn't won, but yes, they enjoy themselves. They play extremely
hard. They don't play silly. They don't play goofy. They play tough. But when
the game is over, you know, they are kids at the end of the day. They think
they are grown, but until they pay all their own bills, they are not grown
yet.  
  
Mr. Day, do you need that microphone? Give Mr. Day the microphone, Mr. Texas
Football for everybody that doesn't know. How old are you now, Mr. Day?  
  
Q. 94.  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Bless your heart.  
  
Q. Did you see Cal beat North Carolina?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I did watch that.  
  
Q. Were you impressed?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Yes. You know, Coach Hatchell for North Carolina, she's been
around. She's a Naismith Hall of Famer. Won thousands of games. Been around
the game a long time. In fact, you know, we played them on the way to winning
our first National Championship, and then when I was an assistant coach at
Louisiana Tech we lost with seven-tenths of a second on the clock and we were
up two, and Charlotte Smith hit a three, so it was good to see her.  
  
And then as you watch Cal, I think Cal's coach, Coach Lindsay, she needs to
just get a timeshare here in Waco because it seems like she gets sent here
every year for the NCAA playoffs. It was good to see her. Last time I saw her,
I brought her baby a gift.  
  
Very good team. Size inside. Experienced players on the perimeter. Grad
transfer that we are familiar with in Recee' Caldwell from Texas Tech that
started her career at UCLA. They are very good.  
  
Q. More on the characters of your team, more specifically, Richards.
What is it like coaching her? What do you think her personality is like?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, Didi, she was kind of silly today but Didi gets it.
She knows when to be serious and when to, you know, lighten up the mood in the
locker room. The kids, she's just an unbelievable defensive stopper. She has
length in on the perimeter. She's always active. She was great on the boards
today. People think a liability is on the offensive end with Didi, but she
can't come off the floor. She's not a liability. She figures out ways to stay
on the floor and to beat you.  
  
To answer your question specifically, I guess one of the things I'll write
about Didi in my next book, is I'll go in the locker room as intense as I can
be before practice or after practice and man, I'm just really challenging them
and getting on them. In the middle of it, Didi will go, "You tell 'em,
Mulkey." You know, she's got that little voice. She just cracks everybody up.  
  
Q. What can you say about the job that Coach Goodenough has done with
that ACU team in a short amount of time that they have been D1?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I would say to your administration, love her and take care
of her. She is everything that's good about women's basketball. I loved her
when she was at Oklahoma State. She's a family person. Those kids play hard
for her. Those kids had a good year, and she's found in my opinion the place
that she should stay until she retires and I just hope and pray that Abilene
Christian recognizes that.  
  
Q. In a game like this, how do you as a coach decide when it's time to
sit the starters versus letting them get some rhythm?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Just a gut feeling. You know, I don't have a blueprint or a
book over there I'm reading. Just knowing your kids what you might face down
the road, who your top eight players are, who needs to play together, who
needs to rest, who needs to gain some NCAA playoff experience, and today this
game allowed us to play a ton of players and to play them early. And teach
them in moments, really. You talk about being up 20-0. Well, I'm in that time-
out looking at them saying, which one of your teammates is going to give up
the first bucket. Challenge them so that they don't let each other down.
Things like that.  
  
Q. You know, you mentioned the rebounding margin. Their shooting
percentage was probably due to size difference. When you were watching film of
them, how much could you tell just from watching that film that your size was
going to give them a lot of struggles?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I don't know that I look at that. I kind of subconsciously
know that, no matter who we play. If they are going to bring it in there, you
are going to bring it in there with twin towers. But that's not something that
I look at first.  
  
First thing I look at is match-ups, who are we going to put on which players.
That's the first thing we look at because that's important.  
  
The second thing you look at is what are you going to do -- what they do on
ball screens, what are you going to do when they spread the floor and take
your bigs out. Everything you look at first is on the defensive end of the
floor.  
  
And then you think about, what will you see offensively, and they did exactly
what we prepared for, the 2-3 zone. We had seen on film that they do play man,
but because of the size difference and because of maybe the talent level, you
figured, you know what can you do to at least compete with bigs like that. And
I thought that our kids prepared well. The past 12 days, we were off several
days, but we expected everything that we saw today.  
  
Q. Obviously the game dictated how much she played, but can Aquira be or
develop into a serious three-point threat that can really help you in games?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Yes. Aquira came here and she was injured and she had the
little surgery that set her back a good three months, and it's taken her this
long to really settle in. Look at her size, same size and length as Didi.
Better perimeter three-point shooter. Can she go on that floor here during the
playoffs and not hurt you on the defensive end; I don't worry about the
offensive end, because she'll go to the floor, leaps out of the gym, can shoot
it. Can she move her feet; can she keep out of the paint, those types of
things.  
  
And she's certainly gotten better, and I thought she had a very good day
keeping her feet moving and keeping people in front of her.  
  
Q. I asked Coach Goodenough about the exchange before the game. What did
you take from way from that the exchange before the game? Is that more than
you normally talk to another coach?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Some of them don't like me, so I don't talk to them very
much. I don't like them, either.  
  
I just have always liked Julie. She just -- there's just some people you
connect with, and I haven't seen her in a while. I connected with her when she
was at Oklahoma State, and you know, there's just certain coaches you pull
for, you really do.  
  
And I've just always pulled for her. We played them several years ago and she
just does a good job. I don't remember what I said to her, good to see you,
how's the family, how are your kids. I hope they are taking good care of you
in Abilene. I didn't sing that to her -- she probably doesn't know it, either.  
  
Did y'all go look that up? Those people back there, do they think what is this
crazy woman talking about? Go listen to the words to that song. I wasn't born

_Waco, Texas_  
  
California 92, North Carolina 72  
  
COACH SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, we gave it all we had. I'm really proud of my
kids. I thought they played their hearts out. We just ran out of gas.  
  
First half, we played pretty doggone good, and then I thought second half, you
know, we got a little bit tired and the rebounding was huge. I mean, that's
been our Achilles' heel all year is the rebounding.  
  
But I thought our kids really played hard. I thought Janelle did a really good
job inside, especially the first half. She battled her heart in there. I
thought she did a great job. But the rebounding was you huge. But we gave it
all we had.  
  
We played really, really hard and our kids fought, and I thought we could make
a run there, especially start the fourth quarter, but like I said we just a
little bit ran out of gas. Some shots that we had made in the first half were
falling short, and it was physical. It was tough there. You know, as we
usually get a lot off penetration, it was pretty physical and we've taken it
in there but that's the way it is when you get in the NCAA.  
  
But the rebounding was the biggest thing. But they are a good team. They are a
really good team. They have all the ingredients that it takes, and you know,
because they have got shooters and they have got size and they are athletic
and can rebound like crazy. You know, should be a good game Monday if Baylor
wins, which you know, I know everybody's expecting that to happen.  
  
But I'm proud of these guys over here. Paris is our only senior, and you know,
she's done a great job for us this year with just everything. She's just a
great kid and she's got a great future. I feel very blessed to have had an
opportunity to coach a kid like her.  
  
Q. Janelle, if you would, that matchup in the post today, how difficult
was that, especially when they started making some shots?  
JANELLE BAILEY: I mean, it was difficult. I knew that going into the game.
Like I said previously, she's All-American, so I knew it was going to be just
difficult to guard her, and she does her work early. It's difficult, them
running the clock down to keep that focus and maintain contact with her.  
  
Yeah, it was pretty tough down the stretch and they kept hitting shots and
things like that, and we were breaking down on defense, not communicating,
which led to her getting offensive rebounds, and she had 22 rebounds.  
  
But I definitely don't think the stat sheet tells the story of the game. Like
Coach said, I myself thought I did pretty well the first half and my teammates
were encouraging me and I knew they had my back.  
  
So I thought we played well the first half, and like I said, we just ran out
of gas the second half.  
  
Q. They battled back in the third quarter and have a four-point lead but
bank in that three-pointer at the buzzer to end the third. Was that a gut
punch for you guys at that point?  
PARIS KEA: Well, we were trying to trap and rotate and I guess it kind of just
got out of whack.  
  
Q. What will you remember most about your time at UNC?  
PARIS KEA: My teammates. Coach always talks about family. I mean, these are my
sisters. Even though I was -- the biggest thing was just walking off and
giving everybody a hug. I think that's what got me emotional. I'm going to
miss them.  
  
Q. In the fourth quarter you had ten to 12 straight of your team's
points. Could you feel, not necessarily the season slipping away, but could
you feel the urgency of the moment at that point?  
PARIS KEA: Yeah, there was definitely urgency. But I was just trying to be in
the moment. Trying to enjoy it playing in a North Carolina jersey. That's
really all I was thinking about and just having fun.  
  
Q. Obviously a great first half from you. You had a lead through
halftime. When did you feel it started turning their way?  
COACH SYLVIA HATCHELL: Well, you know, they made a couple quick baskets
starting the second half and tied it up and we went back and forth, back and
forth there. But you're talking about that shot when they were three, four
seconds on the clock and we were trying to pick them up so they couldn't get
it down the floor and get a really good shot, but anyway that, shot went in,
and that was tough.  
  
I think it was a four- or five-point game, seven maybe, something like that, I
remember, but I thought, well, if we can hold them here, this is okay. We're
still in a good position.  
  
And these kids, they fought hard and have been really tough down the stretch a
lot this year. We don't have that much depth, and we've got some kids out, you
know, and Stephanie is not -- she's out right now. So we don't have that much
depth.  
  
But I thought that you know, some of the shots that we made in the first half,
we just -- they didn't fall for us, and like I said, we weren't getting to the
foul line, and you know, we were trying to take it in there.  
  
But anyway, it just -- the wheels came off, but I thought our kids really
fought hard and I thought they were -- in transition, they were bringing it
down the floor and going inside, and they were just bringing down and we were
trying a couple different things off the ball screens and stuff. But they were
just throwing it in there. You know, when they throw it up, they were getting
it and they are just -- that's the athleticism. Size and athleticism. We were
in there battling, but they were able to take -- I mean, when you can box out,
you can do all kinds of things, but still, as the game gets down to the last
few minutes, and you maybe can't jump quite as high as you did in the first
half or whatever, but when you're in there, they have a size advantage.  
  
When you get tired, that really makes a difference, it really does, and so I
thought some of that really came into play, especially in the fourth quarter.  
  
But you know, I mean, wow, when you got athletes like that that can run and
all, you know, that's pretty doggone good, and that's what we don't have. But
we got some coming in. We got a couple kids coming in that are very similar to
these kids we played against tonight.  
  
Q. As you mentioned, only losing one senior, albeit a very important
one. How much does this experience of making it this far help this team just
kind of moving forward into next season?  
COACH SYLVIA HATCHELL: It's been a steppingstone for us, and our goal was to
make the NCAA Tournament. I'll take the blame for probably giving them too
hard of a schedule this year.  
  
But they really, you know, they learned a lot and we played a lot of really
good teams really close and I think that helped us a lot to play the difficult
-- and we could have played a lot easier schedule and probably have another
six or eight wins and all, but these kids, they fought hard and they played
really, really well against a lot of really, really good teams.  
  
But what was -- let's see, oh, good the kids. Paris, losing her is big. But
we've got five, six new kids for next year, and they can all play. We got some
size and we got a transfer that will be able to play that was all SEC. We've
got some kids that will really help us step it up and give us a lot more
depth. So it's been a steppingstone the last few years, because we were --
three years ago, we were starting walk-ons. So we've come a long way, and
these kids have fought hard.  
  
But like Paris said, they have really worked hard. They are really good kids.
You know, and we've battled through some tough opponents. But right now, of
course they are not happy to lose but they have a lot to be proud of, and I'm
very proud of them.  
  
But we have a really good group coming in and with the ones we got, hopefully
get some injuries healed up and stuff like that.  
  
Q. Are there any similarities between this team and that '92 team, just
reset the standard for you guys in a sense?  
COACH SYLVIA HATCHELL: You want me to remember back to '92? But no, you're
right, because that -- I remember we made the NCAA and we thought, oh, this is
a big step, and then the next year -- Sweet 16 I think, because I remember we
lost to Tennessee at Iowa, I remember that. You rattled my memory.  
  
But I remember going to the Final Four and watching Texas Tech win with Sheryl
Swoopes. My sister and I were watching, that could be us next year, and it
was.  
  
But we got some help. We had a lot of kids returning and we also had Marion
Jones -- she was at the game today but we had Marion Jones come in which made
a huge difference. We have some kids coming next year that will put us on
another level, so I'm excited about that.  
  
But I don't want to forget these kids that have hung with us these last few
years and been tough there, persevered through a lot. I'm not -- I don't turn
my back like that. Those kids have really done a great job but we do have some
really fine players coming in that I think like I said will give us rebounding
and some size and more skill. We've got a couple guards that can really,
really take the ball to the hoop, and very similar to Paris.  
  
We enjoyed being at Baylor. You've done a good job, Rick May.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
California 92, North Carolina 72  
  
COACH LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Winning is really fun. Winning in the NCAA Tournament
is even more special and get to go play with this group that I'm fortunate to
coach, there's no words to describe it.  
  
First I just want to congratulate North Carolina on a terrific season.
Actually I've never matched up against them, and Coach Hatchell is a legend
with a National Championship and a thousand wins. So it was in awe being on
the sideline with them. They had a terrific year and gave us a really intense
battle.  
  
Proud of our group because they figuratively punched first and we had to find
a way. I thought they did actually a nice job on Kristine making her life
difficult. She still ended up with 18 points and 22 rebounds, which just,
again, speaks to the year she's had, but I think we needed everybody to step
in and that's what happened.  
  
I thought we really locked in after the first quarter and I'm really proud of
our entire team and various people stepping up individual, and as a group, our
collective will to get to the next round. So we're excited to be staying in
Waco.  
  
Q. Jaelyn, right before the end of the third quarter, you had a shot but
they had a turnover that opened that up. Just talk about that and then talk
about how the fourth quarter, you had a 14-2 run and put the game away?  
JAELYN BROWN: Yeah, end of the fourth quarter, there was maybe three seconds
left and I knew that we had to get a shot up. I think it was like two touch
passes in the shot and then that was just a really great moment just to get
the energy going into the fourth quarter, which just gave us a run and we did
what we had to do.  
  
Q. Kristine, I know that's probably not the first time you've seen that
defensive strategy this year, but how difficult was it for you, especially in
the first half, and in the second half after your teammates started making
some shots how much did that loosen things up?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Again, Lindsay said it. North Carolina came up with a really,
really good game plan. Their coach is highly respected and their team is
highly respected. I was really grateful that my teammates came and like had my
back. You know, it's not like a one-player team. We needed effort from every
single player on this team.  
  
I credit a lot to my guards and post partner. Asha always has really good
games in the Baylor gym, just credit to her performance. Jaelyn, I think she
missed a shot. It's just like, if I didn't have my team, we wouldn't have
gotten this win.  
  
Q. Asha, can you just talk about, I'm clear you guys were down 22-11
into the fourth quarter, and talk about what Coach talked about, the will and
desire to keep going and keep pushing and not letting that take you guys down,
especially when Kristine was having a tough time even getting touches.  
ASHA THOMAS: Right. I would just say her main message was just play Cal
Basketball. She knew that we wasn't playing our best, or even close to our
best.  
  
So I think it was just pick up the energy, do what you do. Of course, knock
down shots. Find our bigs down low. Just be aggressive. Really find your niche
and what you do well in and let's do us.  
  
Q. Like you said it is a team game and you had your teammates doing it,
but when a game like this is over with and you have 18 points and 22 rebounds;
when it seemed like every time we looked at you, you had three players around
you, what are your thoughts after a game like this, when you're still able to
produce with all that going on??  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: I felt like I wasn't doing enough the first half and I just
had to change my mindset and just focus on defense, something I've been trying
to focus on throughout the season and get on the glass because my offensive
game isn't going. I have to trust that my teammates are going to have my back
and I can always make an impact on the defensive end and that's what I really
tried to do.  
  
Again, like, they have a really good post player and she is -- although she's
young, she made really good post plays, and their group really battled, so
getting those boards wasn't easy. Again, trusting my teammates. Like they
really have my back this game. I don't know if I could have performed in the
second half like I did without them.  
  
Q. Asha, Kristine said that you always seem to play well on this floor.
Is there something special about Waco and being in this environment, or is it
just kind of a coincidence?  
ASHA THOMAS: I would definitely say it's a coincidence. Sure, two years ago, I
was hot. That's not my plan to just come in Waco and shoot well (laughter). I
want to come in every gym and shoot well the best that I can. Just happens to
be I'm shooting well and hopefully I can shoot well the next game, too.  
  
Q. Asha, ESPN said that your brother tickets left under somebody else's
name. Did you know he was coming? Was that a surprise?  
ASHA THOMAS: I had no clue but I think this one here had an extra ticket for
him. When I found out, the whole team, or at least the majority of the team
knew that he was coming.  
  
During shootaround Recee' said, "Is that Q?" I looked at her -- hold on. I
seen him just walking over and I just started smiling.  
  
Q. Coach Hatchell was in here and said that their team just wore down in
the second half. Did you sense that? Obviously had a lot to do with what you
were able to do to them. Did you sense that and feel the game shift?  
COACH LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I did. You know, I thought they came out with a really
terrific game plan. To be honest, I've watched a ton of film on them and I
haven't seen them play any post player like that.  
  
So I thought it might be a little easier for Kristine. I don't mean that in a
disrespectful way. I just haven't seen them load up on the post like that.  
  
We played a lot of teams try to create a game plan for her and it often wears
down in the second half because it's hard to stay disciplined in what you're
trying to do.  
  
The second thing, I thought at halftime, one thing we talked about is we
weren't exploiting them in transition well enough. I thought we could run
harder. I thought we could get some more easy looks, and so whether that was a
concerted effort by us to push more or maybe they wore down a little bit. But
I think we put pressure on them on the offensive end because so many people
contributed. I thought CJ West's minutes off the bench were huge. It's just
another big body and it's hard to handle two of them in there.  
  
And again I thought our guards were terrific. They knocked down shots. Our
most assists on the year, 23 assists to 13 turnovers, resay was a maestro with
three assists and 12 turnovers and Jaelyn and Teze (ph) and Kianna, they
knocked down shots.  
  
Q. That three-pointer at the end of the third quarter,, it would have
been a four-point game without it; it's a seven-point game. How much of a
difference was that?  
COACH LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I think it was a huge emotional lift.  
  
So Jaelyn is like our long-range, three-point, last-second person, and she
hasn't hit one in a game that's counted. I think she hit one after the buzzer
in a game, after practice. I've subbed her in a couple times in those
situations she wasn't already in. Sometimes we didn't find her or -- so I was
really proud, they were all locked in, get this ball to Jaelyn: I think we
threw it to C.J., who threw it back to a guard and over the top to Jaelyn and
she nailed it.  
  
Things like that are huge momentum shifts. The three points on the board is
really important. Four to seven is a big difference but gave us a fun,
emotional list but felt like the Magic of March. That's neat. Maybe it will
make the SportsCenter Top Ten.  
  
Thank you, guys, for your coverage.

_Waco, Texas_  
  
Baylor 95, Abilene Christian 38  
  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: First of all, we just want to congratulate Baylor on
such a great season and we wish them well. We honestly are huge fans of Baylor
and hope they go on and win the National Championship. Love Kim Mulkey, and
she does a great job with this program, and hopefully they will stay healthy
and make a great run through the tournament and bring the National
Championship back to Texas.  
  
I'd like to say I'm so proud of our team. A lot of people don't remember back
in the fall, we were picked 76th in the Southland Conference, and here we are
playing our first ever NCAA Tournament. Our team has really overcome a lot of
odds and really exceeded expectations of everybody outside of our locker room.  
  
I am so proud of our team and thought they played pretty fearless today.
Obviously we were overmatched in a lot of positions, and you know, just at a
huge size disadvantage.  
  
But just love our kids. Love our team. We have been led by Breanna Wright and
Sara Williamson all year. They have been tough as nails, and they have been
incredible examples of toughness and work ethic and just examples of striving
for excellence on the basketball court and off for their teammates. I really
appreciate their leadership and what they have done for our team.  
  
I can't say enough about our team and our program. Just really proud of where
we are right now. This is our sixth year to play Division I and we have won
three conference championships, so we feel like we're headed in the right
direction.  
  
Q. Breanna, as you guys were struggling to hit a shot there in the early
going of the game, was it trying to overcome their length and what they did
defensively, or was it sort of kind of that first game jitters or how would
you describe that process there?  
BREANNA WRIGHT: I think it was a little bit of a conversations of both.
Obviously coming from the Southland, the posts are normally the tallest on the
court and we had some length out on the guards, as well. I think we were a
little timid at first in the beginning of the game, looking for our open
shots, being shot-ready to catch; obviously that got better as the game went
on.  
  
Q. You got subbed out with about two minutes left to go in the game and
you got a standing ovation from the ACU fans that there are there. What was
that moment like?  
SARA WILLIAMSON: It was unbelievable. One of the amazing things is the
community we are surrounded with. These fans, they have traveled for miles to
come and support us and watch us play. That's just something we've always been
appreciative of. To have them here for the last game of my career and pretty
amazing and I really appreciate it.  
  
Q. Sara, just what was it like being playing for the last time in your
career?  
SARA WILLIAMSON: I don't know if I have the words to describe it except I just
feel honored and blessed. It has been a true dream come true to play for ACU
and under Coach Goodenough and alongside Bre and a couple of the other girls,
it's been a heck of a ride. Three championships in my four years here, I would
say is pretty successful, but I'll let you guys be the judge of that.  
  
Q. When we talked to the men on Thursday after their game, I was struck
by how easily they were able to reflect on everything that they had
accomplished that season. Is it easy already for you guys to see how good of a
season this was?  
BREANNA WRIGHT: We take it one day at a time but it's also really nice to look
back on what we have accomplished. We actually just put together a video just
of our journey here together. We tried to do that for our seniors, just to
kind of honor them and it's just been such a blessing to be here.  
  
So we will take some more time to be appreciative of what we've done and it's
just such an honor to be here and especially playing alongside Sarah.  
  
It's nice to look back. Sad that it's over, but we are going to be excited
about what we have accomplished, that's for sure.  
  
Q. For both you guys. You shot 30 three-pointers in the first half and
seemed to back off of the idea of launching it from beyond the arc in the
second half. Was that a conscious thing, or did y'all want to see if you could
go inside them more?  
SARA WILLIAMSON: No, we were just being true to our values. We were just being
a little bit more I guess, smart, for our shot selection, and figuring out
which were the collect shots to take.  
  
In the second half we got more layups than in the first half and we still shot
the three eyeball, as well. Didn't stray too far away from our values.  
  
BREANNA WRIGHT: I think a little more conscious about it -- to get some more
foul calls on their end and we wanted to attack and get some of those on our
end, as well. We were still shooting the three-ball like we do every game day
but wanted to see if we would get those calls, as well.  
  
Q. I know obviously it's a little bit tough right now, but besides the
three championships that you have had in your career, how would you sum up
your four years here at ACU?  
SARA WILLIAMSON: I'm never going to forget my time here. I never thought
originally coming in that I would just win a championship off the back, but we
did that, and I followed that up with two championships. And then to end my
senior year, my four years here with another championship is something that
I'm extremely thankful for.  
  
And without Coach Goodenough welcoming me to ACU and being a huge part of
these girls lives and everything, I wouldn't be here where I am today.  
  
So I have them to thank for everything and I will always cherish our
friendship and our sisterhood for the rest of our lives.  
  
Q. At that much of a size advantage, was there anything more could you
have tried to do on defense?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: I don't think so. We work out against a male scout
team on a regular basis, and we don't even have guys on our scout team the
size of Kalani or Lauren Cox and some of the other players that came in. They
are just so much bigger than our players.  
  
We were trying to double- and triple-team post players and tonight, they shot
the ball so well from the three-point line, as well. So it's kind of a pick
your poison.  
  
But the size disadvantage, I don't know what else we could have done, and they
beat us at transition a lot I think because of the size.  
  
So I think our players tried to do what we were asking them to do, but we
didn't really have an answer for the post game.  
  
Q. In the first quarter, you all had some good looks on threes and they
didn't fall. How frustrating was that in the beginning?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: I think our players were really rushing their shots.
Again, the defensive length I think made us rush our shots and made us feel
like we were going to get our shots blocked.  
  
We took three-point shots in the first half, but a lot of those, we just tried
to shoot them and get the ball out of our hands. I was aggravated we didn't
shoot about 45 threes in the game. We kept telling them: Get the ball in the
paint, kick it out, drive to the paint, kick it out. We did hit some layups
and our post players scored a little bit, but I really wanted to shoot 40 or
45 threes today, but I was disappointed we couldn't get more of those off.  
  
Q. First seven minutes -- were you hoping for a ball to go in to break
the ice for you guys --  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: Yeah, you know, it was almost impossible for us to
defend their transition. We needed to score buckets, so they weren't, you
know, so quick to get the ball down the floor and score on us, and so you
know, without being able to score, they were able to rally off quite a few
transition shots.  
  
So you know, I don't know what the answer was, except we need to put the ball
in the hole a little bit more in the first seven minutes of the game.  
  
Q. What was the experience like for your first NCAA Tournament?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: It was phenomenal. And I think for Abilene Christian
and our program, to play in our first-ever NCAA Tournament three hours away
from home where we had a thousand fans here, I don't know if we could have
script that had any better.  
  
Now, playing the No. 1 team in the country was very difficult. But we knew
coming in that we were probably going to be a 16-seed and I know that, you
know, with the NCAA Tournament for the women, it's all so geographical.  
  
We knew that we were probably either going to go to Mississippi State or
Baylor, and so it worked out as well as it could have so that our fans could
be a part of this experience.  
  
And for me personally, I love the Baylor program. I cheer for the Baylor
Bears, and I cheer for Coach Mulkey. And so to be able to be on this platform
with them and see them in person and battle against the No. 1 team in the
country, it's a great experience for us.  
  
Something that our players will always remember, and something I think that
will be special for our fans, as well.  
  
Q. What's next on the agenda in this off-season?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: Well, we are going to be talking the next year about,
we don't want to be considered a 16-seed anymore. And again, I know it's all
geographical, but we can't drop games at home in conference play.  
  
We need to beat somebody big, someone in a perceived higher conference than
us. We need to win the Conference Championship, the regular season, and we
need to win the tournament so that we're not a 16-seed next year.  
  
You know, you want to be able to jockey your position a little bit NCAA
Tournament where you can win a ballgame, and as long as we're 16, it's going
to be really, really hard. I think even being a 15 will be pretty tough.  
  
The conversations we'll have our players in the off-season and the summer is:
We can't be okay with dropping games at home in conference play and we have to
win games that we're not supposed to win. We've got to beat somebody we're not
supposed to beat.  
  
Q. Was this the best team you've ever coached against?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: Absolutely. Maybe except the last time we played
Baylor. No, I think it's the best team we've played. Gosh, they have got All-
Americans at every position, and Coach Mulkey does such a great job recruiting
players that respond to her style of coaching, play her style of play. I mean,
they are phenomenal.  
  
I am sincere that I believe they have a National Championship-calibre team and
we'll be cheering them on from Abilene and hope they do that. We would love to
say we got beat by the national champions. That would be a great way for us to
end the story of this team this year.  
  
Q. You and Kim after introductions had a little bit longer exchange than
we normally see between coaches there. Do you mind sharing with us what you
said to her and what she said to you?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: She was telling me how bad they were going to beat us
-- no, just kidding. She asked me how my daughters were, actually, and I asked
how was it to be a grandmother. So that was the exchange that we had.  
  
Q. What's going to be your message to the girls once you get back into
the locker room?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: You know, the only thing I can think of right now for
our team is just to tell them how proud I am of them. They exceeded a lot of
expectations of people outside of our locker room, so proud of them. They
really came together as a team.  
  
We have one senior this year and we have a Division I transfer that's been
sitting out with our team this year, so she's kind of been a part of our team.  
  
So basically we have this whole team coming back. But I did notice that she
played tonight. Anne McLeod played four minutes and she wasn't suited out
(laughing). That may cause some compliance issues. This team basically is
coming back without Sara, so we have just a really bright future ahead of us.  
  
Obviously there's a lot of different areas we need to improve on. Every year
is completely different with chemistry and who the leaders of your team are
going to be, but I'm just so proud of what they have accomplished this year,
and proud of Sara's leadership -- and the ACU Women's Basketball Program in
Division I history. She's won 88 ballgames and the first two conference
championships we won, we were not eligible to play in our conference
tournament, so we got the WNIT bid.  
  
So this is only the second year we've even been eligible to play in our
conference tournament, so I think that we've accomplished a lot this season.
I'm just really proud of our team.  
  
Dominique Golightly has been our leading scorer this year and she just has
been tough as nails. She came so far from her sophomore year to her junior
year.  
  
Breanna Wright has been starting point guard since her freshman year and that
kid, she just exudes toughness and confidence. Those two, with Sara, I think
those three, were the best guard trio in the Southland Conference this year,
and just really appreciate their leadership and them leading us to the NCAA
Tournament.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Would you like to make an opening statement?  
  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Tell them what you think, Rick.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's go to questions.  
  
COACH KIM MULKEY: This thing's high. Okay. Y'all want me to sink for you?
(Singing).  
  
Q. How important to have these first two games here in Waco?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: It's always important to play on your home floor and we've
been very fortunate through the years to do well during the season, and
receive a high bid from the NCAA where we can host. The fans have always shown
up and I anticipate another good weekend of women's basketball here in Waco in
the Ferrell Center.  
  
Q. Seeing what Julie has done with ACU, what have you seen from this
program as she continues to try and build it?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: First of all, I love that woman. She stands for all the
things I stand for, and she works hard. She's a family woman. Her kids play
hard for her. She's at a school that I hope appreciates what she represents
and what those kids represent, and I'm just looking forward to hugging her
neck.  
  
Q. You've tried playing off-site. Do you like this? Do you feel like the
game needs this right now?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I think -- well, I don't think. I know why they tried it on
the neutral courts. You would like to be, like it is for the men. But it
doesn't do the women's game any good to be televised and there's no one in the
stands.  
  
In order for there to be people in the stands, usually have to go to the top
seeds and those fans will show up. I know that it was discussed that that's
such a home-court advantage. I get it. But the game -- our game is different
than the men's, and you can't compare neutral courts and expect fans to travel
thousands of Miles or even go thousands of miles away, and just the general
basketball, women's basketball fans show up. It's been proven there's too many
empty gyms. Too many empty seats.  
  
Q. What did ACU do well to get here and win their so you believe land
tournament?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, they shot a lot of threes and made them. They will
play kind of a four-out, one-in motion type of offense. They have played man.
I'm sure with the size difference between us and them, we anticipate seeing
some zone. They just played well and shot it well.  
  
Q. When you go into game like this, you're in the NCAA Tournament,
prohibitive favorite at home. What is your message to the players and how do
you approach a game like this?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, it's the first of hopefully six. I break it down that
way. This is the last part of our season, and I asked them, how many games do
you have to win to win a National Championship. How many do you have to win to
get to a final four.  
  
None of that matters if you don't win the next one, and we talk about the next
game. We approach every game, and the kids can tell you this: We don't miss a
scouting report. We spend the same amount of time in the film room, and the
only thing that's different right now, I wish that we didn't have such a long
break. You know, I wish that -- you know, the men got it right. They get done.
They start playing.  
  
It's just a long break right here, and you get antsy and anxious and you have
to fill motivational moments through the course of the long week before you
actually play your first NCAA game.  
  
Q. Two questions. First, when you talk about them shooting a lot of
threes and making a lot of threes, does it kind of give you some confidence
that you guys are pretty battle tested at defending that?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: When the season's over, I'm going to go back and I'm going
to just look and go, who shot the most against us, because the numbers are
astronomical. Teams that don't even shoot that many threes shoot a lot of
threes against us.  
  
We prepare for that. I think our field goal percentage defense from the three
is much better than it used to be because we see it so much now. So it won't
be anything we haven't seen, Chad.  
  
Q. And then the long break that you talked about, you that's been a
routine for a little while now. Do you get used to it? Do you get kind of --
kind of a schedule in your mind of the way things need to happen during that
break?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, you're used to it. You know you've got to give them
some time off to get their legs back under them, but you can't go in there and
do the scouting report on the first day or the second day. You work on
yourself. You work on yourself those first few days, and then toward the end
of the week, you start working on who you play next.  
  
We don't even look past the first opponent. It's not like we give a scouting
report today on Abilene Christian and then tomorrow we'll give one on North
Carolina and then one on Cal. That's so much. That's so much. Focus on the
next game. We will watch the earlier game and then we will get to work if we
beat Abilene Christian. We'll get to work on our next opponent.  
  
Now, the coaches are in the film room all the time. One is assigned this team,
one is assigned this team and we flip flop and we talk. The coaches are ready
but you don't throw all that at a team.  
  
Now, during the course of the week, I may work on the things I've seen each of
the teams do, but I won't let the team know what we're working on it for, just
so that we are doing things without them really knowing it.  
  
Q. With this season going on, you all have been favorites in pretty much
every single game. How have you been able to keep your team in that moment day
by day and game by game?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, I don't know that we've been favorites in every game.
I would say people probably chose UCONN. Who else have we played? Stanford? So
I wouldn't say that we've been the favorite. We do recognize that we're one of
the top teams when a season starts. We do realize that you're going to get
everyone's best shot. We realize that and we embrace it. That's why those
players came to Baylor but it doesn't mean that we prepare any differently.
You push, you work; you know when to take off. It's just what we do. It's all
we know how to do, and it's new to the freshmen. All this is new for the
freshmen, so they are extremely excited, when they walk in and see a new Coca-
Cola machine in the locker room, "Man, look at that." When they come off the
floor and see their practice facility is now a big press room, they get
excited about that, and they should.  
  
Q. You mentioned throughout this time off that you've had to use
different motivational tactics for the team. What kind of motivational tactics
have you used?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, I sink to them a lot. I make them understand. You
know, we have a lot of kids that aren't from Texas. I wanted them to know
where Abilene was, so I play the music (singing) and then Sheryl Crow has a
song about Abilene, doesn't she?  
  
Y'all don't know these things. I can tell by the look on your faces, and that
disappoints me because I think y'all are well-rounded media people. Go listen
to those songs, and then before we leave, tell me who sang the song.  
  
It could be an article I read in a newspaper about a totally different sport
and I bring it to the locker room. It could be showing old film from the 2005
championship team, and it could be the 2012 team. It could be anything that
just hits my mind and a lot of times it hit my mind after I go to sleep and I
Wake up in the middle of the night and I just reach over here on a pad of
paper and say, hey, show this to the kids tomorrow. Nothing planned. It's just
what comes from the heart and the gut.  
  
Q. With as many young players as you have, do you have to find a way to
keep them engaged or is this team kind of self-sufficient in that way?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Not engaged. They have a very fun, unique, lively
personality as a group.  
  
What you have to do is about the middle of February, you have to realize, they
are tired and their high school seasons are just about to wrap up. They don't
realize, we're just about to head into postseason play, so that is something
that you have to get them over the hump.  
  
But not anything other than that. I mean, they are an exciting group, and they
-- you know, they just come bubbly every day, even on their lowest moments,
they are bubbly.  
  
Q. This is one and out time. Do you expect to see -- is this the time of
year where you see opposing coaches maybe try to surprise you or do something
different?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, I don't know, unless we're going to play three-on-
three halfcourt, I don't know that we -- we have been -- there's nothing else
we can see. I mean, there's not a new defense that can be invented. We have
seen everything imaginable. What happens this time of year is maybe someone
just an unbelievable game but it won't be because of something we have not
prepared for or haven't seen. Cinderella, you see Cinderella teams and you see
it more on the men's side, but we've seen it all.  
  
Q. For this team to make a deep run, for this team to win a National
Championship, everybody knows about Kalani and Lauren. Is there an X-factor
that will get a team to win a National Championship?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I think you should know about Kalani and Cox, but it takes
more than them to win a National Championship. I think we have to have -- I
think you have to have defensive stoppers, which we do. I think you have to
have role players, which we do. I think you have to have mid-range jump
shooters, which we do. I think you have to have a three-point threat, which we
do. I think everybody has a role to play surrounding those two great post
players.  
  
You've seen those post players sometimes not play well and the perimeter
players pick up the slack. So you know, you've got to stay away from injury.
You've got to have a little bit of luck when it's a tight game, and you've got
to have a team that's just on a roll. Just a team that's on a roll
offensively. That's what it takes to win a National Championship.  
  
Q. Brown told me she tells Kalani, "Sometimes you have to lead your
people to the Promised Land." Do you see that off the court as well as on the
court?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, Kalani's personality is she's a sweet kid and she
leads differently than a lot of people, but she doesn't have to lead this team
by herself. And I think she knows that. There are a lot of leaders in that
locker room, either vocally, by their play on the floor and I think that's
kind of what makes this team a little special is they don't try to be
something they are not. They let each player lead, and everybody follows.  
  
And gosh, it's fun to watch. Sometimes you just have a locker room and you've
got, what I call, Debbie Downers in there or selfish players. This team
doesn't have it, and Kalani's ma'am, you know, she's old school like I am.
She's going to be harder on Kalani than I will, and she was a fun player to
coach.  
  
Q. You've played on and coached teams that were supposed to do things
great or finish possibly with championships. What separates those who have
accomplished it from those who may not know how to handle it?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I have, Smoke, but I've also coached teams that didn't
finish it. Can I tell you, there was something that team that finished it and
the up with that is didn't finish it didn't do? No, really, it was the same
team. It was the same players. So I'll go back to answer it this way: Give
credit to the opponent. Go back to that Cinderella comment. Sometimes teams
just play out of their mind, and that's why it's such a fun time of the year,
March Madness.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Sylvia Hatchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15656)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina head coach Sylvia Hatchell.  
  
COACH HATCHELL: We're just glad to be here. Heard a lot about Baylor over the
years. Known a lot of people who went to school here. Actually had a distant
cousin that was in the registrar's office for many years. Everything I know
about Baylor is all good up until now and I'm hoping it continues. I'm sure it
will.  
  
But we're just glad to be here. And I've known Kim a long time. I was actually
on the staff at the Olympics when she was on the team. I've known her a long
time. It's an honor and privilege to be here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions?  
  
Q. Just talk about bringing a group of players, first-time experience
for all of them playing in this tournament, how do you prepare them for
that?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, I think our conference prepares us well because our
conference is pretty brutal. We've got No. 1 seeds in our conference, and we
were fortunate to beat Notre Dame this year. But our conferences are really,
really tough.  
  
But just anyone can win in the NCAA. It's been proven time and time again. And
these kids, they haven't been to an NCAA, but yet they are excited to be here.
And like I said, I told them, I said, "Your competition in the NCAA will be
like it has been in the conference." So I do think our conference has prepared
us for what we're going to face.  
  
Q. When you look at Cal and you look at Kristine and what she's done, 31
double-doubles in 31 games this year, I'm not asking for secrets, but how do
you approach defending someone like that?  
COACH HATCHELL: You pray a lot. She's tough, she's really tough. But she's one
player. The game is played by five. But she's very, very good. Around the
basket, you've got to try to box her out and keep her from getting all the
rebounds she's used to getting. She's so good when she gets the ball down low.  
  
But again we'll try different things defensively at her. And hopefully --
you're not going to stop a player like that. That reminds me of Turner when we
played Notre Dame this year. She got, I think, 20 and 18, but that was a
little bit less than her average.  
  
So you're not going to stop a player like that. But you just try to control
them a little bit and outscore them.  
  
Q. You had those wins against Notre Dame and NC State in a pretty short
time, close together. I know you've played other games since then, but how
much confidence did that give this team and how much can you compare back on
that at this point?  
COACH HATCHELL: It gave them confidence because all year long I'd been telling
them they were very good, even though wins and losses and didn't show that,
because we had had a really, really tough schedule. I think it ended up being
like fifth or sixth in the country and one time it was two and three.  
  
But we had played some really good teams and a lot of them on the road. And we
didn't have all the wins early on to show that. And then the conference
schedule, four of our first six were on the road against -- at Louisville,
Florida State, gosh. But then once, there in the middle of January, we won
those games and we had some close games we pulled out.  
  
But we've had some injuries that have cost us also. But I do think that once
we got over the hump with those games that our kids gained a lot of
confidence.  
  
Q. You mentioned Kim. You've known her a long time, since she was a
player. As you watched her as a coach, winning championship as a player and
assistant, what she's built here at Baylor in nine years, what you might have
seen in her as a player that might have seen this coming?  
COACH HATCHELL: It's simple to say. She took her tenacity as a player, as a
point guard in control, running the show out there, she just carried that into
her coaching career. She coaches like she played -- relentless, fearless. I
mean that's the way she was as a player. And she just carried her playing
personality and tenacity and all that into her coaching. And I mean it's
really simple.  
  
Q. Is it harder said than done?  
COACH HATCHELL: Well, yeah, because there's a lot of times great players don't
always make great coaches. You've seen that lots of times. In fact, I think
over history a lot of the kids that set on the bench -- we hear about Dean
Smith all the time at North Carolina sitting on the bench at Kansas, and I
could name several others, you know, that ended up being great coaches, but
weren't necessarily the great players.  
  
But Kim's done that. There have been several that have been the really great
players that have gone into coaching. So she's done some great things for our
game, no doubt about that.  
  
Q. Shayla Bennett has been playing some of her best ball here down the
stretch here. What have you seen from her growth and development just
throughout the season really?  
COACH HATCHELL: You're right. She's gotten better as we've moved along. And
Shayla, she is -- I mean, she can do a lot of things out there, but she
doesn't have to be in the limelight. And lots of times I've told her, Shayla,
we need to you take over a little bit more. Shoot the open shot. Take the ball
to the basket. Because she's very good at doing those things.  
  
But she sort of at times let other people have the limelight. But we've needed
her. And as I've challenged her to step up, she has done that. And it's just
gotten better and better as we've moved along. And I think defensively she's
really helped us a lot.  
  
Q. It seems as the year's gone along, more players have stepped up as
vocal leaders for this team. Who are some of those players and how have you
seen leadership increase from within?  
COACH HATCHELL: You're right. And you've experienced it in our film session
before we came over today. Different ones are stepping up and speaking out.
Because Paris is our only senior out there eligibility-wise, but we've had
other ones that have stepped up.  
  
And I think, they realize, I think, they sort of sit back, they don't want to
take somebody else's limelight, but now I think as they sense that, especially
as we move along and get in postseason play, they're stepping up more.  
  
And it's not necessarily the ones that play that much, but other kids, more
than anything else, just trying to be a great teammate and to motivate their
teammates. And I've been really pleased with that. Like I said, we saw some of
that in our film session before we came over here today.  
  
We're just glad to be here, thanks to Baylor and all their hospitality and we
look forward to playing.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Please raise your hand when you want to ask a question.  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Thank you. Happy to be here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: You have an opening statement?  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: We're just excited to be in the NCAA tournament. It's the
best event in all of sports. We're very fortunate. We're be back here in Waco
for or third time in six years. I just saw Coach Kim in the weight room and
she and I were joking that I should have bought property here back then and
invested in it.  
  
I'm excited to come with this group. We have a veteran group now. It's a
terrific match up in the first round with North Carolina, and we're just
excited to be playing on this stage, in this venue, and very happy to be back
in Waco.  
  
Q. Have any restaurant recommendations for me? No, you did mention
obviously you have been here. You have a group of kids, girls, that have been
here. Talk about familiarity at this time of year. Is there some advantage to
that and something to that?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: I do think there is something to the emotional component of
post season, right? There is Xs and Os and strategy; that stuff matters. Then
there is I think the emotional component, and that's a combination of
excitement, maturity, leadership.  
  
I do think we're at the high end of that this year. I have a group of seniors
that have been here - literally here - but also kind of on this stage, and I
hope that works to our favor.  
  
We have to put that all together on the court. We're going to lean on our
leadership in that respect.  
  
Q. I know you have another game tomorrow night before it even matters
what happens Monday. When the bracket comes out and you see you're going to
Waco again, possibly play Baylor again, you kind of go, What are they doing to
me?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Not really. I mean, obviously this year was a little
different with the whole way the bracket was unveiled, but first thing you
look at is the first-round matchup. There is no more kind of storied team
generally in basketball then we see with North Carolina Tar Heels. Our
attention is solely on them.  
  
In terms of where we're going to go, as you look and sort of see the general
seed we might be, there is only a handful of places you can potentially go.
Oh, wow, Waco again. Really then the focus becomes on the first-round opponent
in North Carolina.  
  
Q. You mentioned North Carolina. You have a senior guard who has got a
North Carolina connection. Talk to me about that a little bit.  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Sure.  
  
Q. Talk to me about her as a player, but her connection to North
Carolina.  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Sure, our senior point guard, Asha Thomas who is an Oakland
hometown hero, favorite; now all-time leading three-point shooter. She has a
brother Quentin Thomas, who is 11 years older who played for North Carolina.
There is a specific I have terrific picture of Asha as a little girl. Must
have been around ten or so, maybe eight or nine, shooting with Q when he was a
player at North Carolina.  
  
So her love of basketball I think a lot comes from her relationship with her
brother. They're a Tar Heel fan family. They've assured me they're all rooting
for the Golden Bears this weekend, but it's just a neat connection, a brother-
sister-family bond, and just so happens her senior year tournament that's who
we're matched up against.  
  
It's a nice story sure. He's been a huge support in her life, just a wonderful
young person himself, so it's neat that there is that connection.  
  
Q. Kristine, obviously we see the numbers. Talk about how she's has
developed and what that means to this program and all that she's accomplished
at this point?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: You ask about Kristine Anigwe and you say we've seen the
numbers, but have you really he seen the numbers? She's averaging 23 and 16,
which hasn't been done in the NBA in 40 years, hasn't been done in women's
basketball in 30 years, in a conference that we play in that has some of the
best defenses in the country. You're talking Stanford and Oregon State and
Arizona State. She's been ridiculously consistent putting up those type of
numbers, so the numbers are pretty outstanding.  
  
What I'm most impressed with is she came in as a very talented kind, a young
star, and she has matured into everything you hope to see in a young person as
they grow their college experience. She's been triple teamed since freshman,
media spotlight, so her growth has had to be more public, but it's been
remarkable.  
  
She is poised I think to lead her team in this NCAA tournament, but also ready
for what comes next in life, WNBA, getting that Cal degree and affecting other
people with that.  
  
She's been tremendous. I would say the thing that's most remarkable this year
is the consistency of excellence in every single way. A double-double in every
single game. 25 and 24 against Stanford as an example. Big numbers in the big
games and big numbers when it's not the biggest game on the schedule.  
  
She's been unbelievable, and I'm excited for the fans here to be able to see
here in person and for the country to see her on this big stage.  
  
Q. When you came here the first time in 2014 you were coming off a Final
Four the year before that. For you as a coach, how different are you now than
you were then? Players we see for four years; coaches we see for a long time.
How different are you as a coach, and how do you think you've grown in the
game?  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: That's a great question. Obviously the most tangible
difference is I was seven months pregnant at the end of that LSU game and now
he's a fun, exciting almost two year old.  
  
But more so I am just really grateful to have been at Cal as the head coach
for eight years -- this is my eighth year -- and to have a range of
experiences. And more importantly, now a family of players and former players
that I can watch them grow and develop.  
  
That group that you're talking about coming in here as a seventh seed the year
after the Final Four year, I remember the players and the faces and what
they're doing now.  
  
I think my growth, the story is told in what the players have done and
continue to do successfully in life. That's the biggest thing we do, is
prepare kids for the next stage.  
  
For me, I've grown in a lot of different ways. I would like to think the more
film I've watched and the more experiences I've had that I'm more savvy with
Xs and Os, more able to handle situations that many come your way. When you
saw me that first year, we were coming off a Final Four year and following up.  
  
We've had more losses since then. I don't think anyone's career goes where you
win almost every game. So you grow from learning experiences. Our league has
gotten better, has been challenged by the great coaching staff in our Pac 12
conference to get better. So probably more savvy and aware in a lot of the
different ways.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any other questions?  
  
LINDSAY GOTTLIEB: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Julie Goodenough](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16314)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: We're just so excited to be here. It's a privilege to
represent Abilene Christian University in the NCAA Tournament, and we're
excited that we're playing Baylor. We're excited that we're playing at a
location where our fans can come and play at our first experience in the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. You guys do well with things most people try to do against Baylor,
shoot from the perimeter, because it's hard to take anything against Brown and
Cox. Do you think that strength is going to maybe give you a chance come?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: We sure hope so. We do have some really good shooters,
and definitely the big post presence in the paint is a deterrent for most
teams and it will be for our because of the discrepancies in the sizes of our
players.  
  
But we do have really good shooters and you know, we like for them to be shot
ready and they all have a green light to shoot when they are open.  
  
Q. Tell us about the Southland Conference, how you had some close games
and came away with that victory?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: Gosh, started with our semifinal game. We were behind
well in the fourth quarter, staying along trying to stay in the ballgame. Our
players in the fourth quarter had a grit, no quit. We weren't going to let up
and play hard together as a team. Their toughness really rose to the occasion.
They showed a lot of perseverance and played great team basketball. We were
urging them, emphasizing them during our time outs, we have to get defensive
stops. We felt like we could score in transition and that's what it came down
to when the tide turned and went our direction, our players did a great job
with defensive rebounds, forced some turnovers and our players scored in
transition. They never got their heads down in the game. Always felt like if
they stayed gritty we would have a chance to win at the end. I've been asked a
lot of questions about the Lamar game and I felt Sarah was the voice of our
team throughout the game. She gave hope to our teammates that hey, we're in
this and we're going to be fine and her leadership gave us hope in the fourth
quarter that we can win if we play together as a team.  
  
Going into the championship, it was a smooth ride in the first half. Every
shot we took went in. We were reading them very well and then we changed ends
and figured it was that one end that all the shots were going to fall in
because everything fell for them in the second half. We struggled to score a
little bit. They did a tremendous job of rebounding but in the fourth quarter
when we felt it slipping away, I thought that Lexie Ducat, Sara Williamson,
their voices during time-outs were voices of confidence. We felt like we had
been in control the whole game even though we let it get really, really close.
They convinced their teammates, this is our ballgame to win.  
  
We never lost our lead throughout the course of the game. Our team really
persevered and kept their poise when the game could have gone south in a
hurry.  
  
Q. In a matchup like this, what is your message to your team, and does
it come down to just making shots?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: It's a daunting task. I saw on ESPN a couple days ago
that the 15- and 16-seeds records in the last 29 years are 1-231 losses. It's
a really tough matchup for us.  
  
So the thing we've been talking to our players about is we're just going to
control what we can control. We have no control over the Baylor offensive game
plan, what they are going to do on defense. All we can control is to work hard
and practice every day, focus on the things that we do well. You do need shots
to fall for sure. You need some rebounds to bounce your way, as well, and our
team just needs to come in and be scrappy. We have nothing to lose at all.
Just come in and play with reckless abandon.  
  
Q. When you watch Baylor on film, there's obvious things about them,
their size and the way they play defense. Is there anything subtle you see
that doesn't get talked about a lot.  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: When we compare their team to our team and the styles
of play, I think the significant size is the biggest factor. Obviously their
post players will tower over our post players. Their guards are about the size
of our post players.  
  
You know, we've got to do what we can to try to slow down the post play and
try to really protect the paint. I think the length they have, even on the
perimeter, is a real defensive weapon for them. I think the thing we are
talking to our players about is they are long, physical. They are going to
take up a lot of space.  
  
The big key for us is to really read the defense and make sure that we are
reading the defense correctly before we make decisions with the basketball. We
can't afford live ball turnovers. It will be very difficult to defend in
transition, so we have to take care of the basketball and every be shot-ready,
and be ready to execute when you have a chance to.  
  
Q. When you guys made the transition to D1 knowing that last year was
the first year you would be able to participate in something like this, did
you see you guys getting here in only two years?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: We have very high expectations for our program. We
talked last year about getting here, actually, in our first year that we were
eligible. We were pretty young. We were the sixth-youngest team in America
last year, and so we got kicked in the teeth several times last year and just
didn't really know how to respond. I think the experiences we went through
last year made our team a lot tougher this year. Had a great group of
returners that came back that understood work ethic and practice every day.
They understood how gritty we would have to be to be in this position.  
  
We lost a couple of games in the regular season that prevented us from wing
the out right regular season championship. I think the players saw a glimmer
of hope that if we just put three good games together, we can win the
conference tournament championship. Really, we've been talking about this
since June. It's almost ten months ago that our players set a goal to be here
where we are right now.  
  
Really just crediting our players with being salty and having a lot of faith
in our system, having a lot of belief in themselves and in their teammates.  
  
Q. Is there anything about having coached against Baylor before in
conference, some familiarity that helps you game plan in getting ready for
this game?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: I think this is my eighth time coaches against Coach
Mulkey. I have so much respect for her. Her teams are so well-coached. Her
staff does such an excellent job recruiting players for her style of play and
players that will respond to her coaching. They are tough to beat. They are
tough to beat, year-in and year-out. They have dominated the Big 12 for a
decade. There's no one even close to Baylor right now in the Big 12. I've been
on the USA Today pole. I'm a voter this year. Baylor's been my No. 1 every
week. I think they are a force to be reckoned with for sure.  
  
I don't know that my experience coaching against Coach Mulkey will help us
tomorrow, except that I know they are going to be super tough and they are
going to be well prepared and they are going to come out and try to put on a
show for the sellout crowd we are probably looking forward to tomorrow.  
  
Q. We were talking on Wednesday that everyone was so excited. Do you
feel like now that you've been here and about to have practice, do you think
the focus is there?  
COACH JULIE GOODENOUGH: I think so. They have done a good job probably the
last month of just focusing on the important things and trying to eliminate
all the distractions, so they are in the locker room right now preparing for
practice. We had a good meeting this morning. Watched video. Went back over
the games. They are getting their focus on now. I'm sure when they step out on
the court, they will feel this is a real, game like atmosphere.  
  
I'm quite disappointed yet, no one's asked me if I have a hole in my pants. I
really thought that was coming. (Laughter).

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Dominque Golightly](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37026)

### [Sara Williamson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37027)

### [Breanna Wright](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37028)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. How do you guys feel about earning this right to come and play
against the No. 1 team in the country?  
BREANNA WRIGHT: We are just really excited to be here. This is a great
opportunity for our team as a whole and we're just excited to take this
challenge on.  
  
SARA WILLIAMSON: Like Bre said, we're excited. It's an honor to be here. We
are excited to get things going.  
  
Q. Can you talk about attacking them, when you guys have the ball,
obviously you're not going to give away your game plan, is it a matter getting
on a roll?  
BREANNA WRIGHT: We're a high-calibre offensive team so we are excited to walk
out, on d and work on our game that way.  
  
Q. Dominique, can you talk about the confidence the team has coming off
the south land tournament and being able to beat Lamar, stuff like that in
does that give you confidence coming into the tournament?  
DOMINIQUE GOLIGHTLY: For sure. We are pretty excited. It's an honor to be here
and we're just ready to give it all that we have.  
  
Q. You've all been around the program for three, four years now. Knowing
when you started for the first one or two years of your career, you guys were
not eligible to play in the postseason. From all the way back then to where
you are now, did you think it was going to happen in this timeframe that you
guys were in school?  
DOMINIQUE GOLIGHTLY: Honestly I wasn't really thinking about that. My freshman
and sophomore year, we weren't eligible so I was just worried about winning
our conference championship, and so that alone was a huge accomplishment and
goal and dream for me. So for us to finally be here my senior year is just a
perfect way to end things.  
  
SARA WILLIAMSON: Just that it happened really fast. You asked, did we expect
it to be in this timeframe, it's just amazing. It's phenomenal that we were
able to accomplish so much.  
  
Q. What's the atmosphere been like in Abilene?  
SARA WILLIAMSON: We have a great community in Abilene. Everybody is so
supportive. We have an amazing chapel that was held for us and a great
turnout. We're getting a lot of coverage just from a lot of loving fans. Our
teachers, even, just super encouraging. The community is so tight night there
that it's just an amazing experience and especially to be able to experience
it with the men's team.  
  
Q. What was that chapel like? Did you pray for a win or anything like
that?  
DOMINIQUE GOLIGHTLY: There was some praying. There was some singing, just a
lot of glorifying God for what we were able to accomplish and to be able to do
it with our men's team. It was just amazing to be able to just stand up there
with our guy, as well.  
  
Q. Sara, your coach talked about how you led the team in those last two
tournament wins, and talked about the grit and determination that the team
had. But can you talk about that a little bit and then what you're saying is
the only senior on the club coming into this game, what you're telling the
younger players?  
SARAH WILLIAMSON: We played Baylor my sophomore year so I'm not nervous at
all. When I'm trying to give them words of wisdom, it's to have fun because
that's what we are here to do ultimately. It's an incredible opportunity and
we're blessed to be here and this tournament game, our entire team, everybody
that we had on the roster stepped up in some kind of way, whether it was being
on the bench cheering loud or people contributing on the court -- the
incredible free throws she made, everybody was clutch in their own way.  
  
Q. Being from down the road, have you followed the Lady Bears? Have you
been here for camps or anything?  
BREANNA WRIGHT: I made a comment earlier that I actually grew up watching
Baylor, just down the road. 45 minutes from Texas, as well, so it was really
fun. I'm just really happy to be at ACU and be competing here.  
  
Q. All three of you were part of the team in 2016 and 2017 with the big
four senior class. I've always equated that game as being a gift the seniors
because there was no postseason to go to other than the WNIT. Breanna, you
started, Dom and Sara, you both were reserves in that game. What are some of
the -- I know the team lost but what were some of your most memorable moments,
fondest memories from that first game at the Ferrell Center?  
SARA WILLIAMSON: Anything you do together as a team is just phenomenal,
amazing experience. So all of my memories are just being with my teammates, it
was with the four seniors, as well, so get to remember them as we play on this
court will be really fun as well. But we're here with a new team and we're
just excited.  
  
Q. When we talked the other day, you were overwhelmed with how excited
you are and that's probably still the same here today in the Baylor visitor
locker room. Kind of where is your head space at right now?  
BREANNA WRIGHT: We're kind of tackling it, it's another game for us and one
step closer to our ultimate goal, just go as far as we can in the NCAA
Tournament, so that's what we're trying to go into this approach with and
that's the mindset that we're having for our practice today.  
  
DOMINIQUE GOLIGHTLY: Feel like we are all pretty locked in. Really focused on
on our scout and what we need to work on in practice and we're just making
sure that we're focused on the task at hand.  
  
SARA WILLIAMSON: Slowly getting more real the closer we get to game time, so
it's exciting.  
  
Q. How do you guys guard and stop Brown and Cox.  
DOMINIQUE GOLIGHTLY: We're not going to give up our secrets -- nice try. Just
going to execute our scout what we've been preparing for the last couple days
and go out there and work hard and do our best to contain them.  
  
Q. Looking at the roster, everybody's from Texas except you. How did
that happen?  
BREANNA WRIGHT: I'm really not sure but it's great to be here. I love it at
Abilene Christian University. I wouldn't trade it for anything else.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Lauren Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33249)

### [Kalani Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30449)

### [Chloe Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32657)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
Q. Kalani, with this team being a favorite in virtually every game you
play except maybe for a couple this year, how have you been able to stay in
the moment each night and take care of what's right in front of you?  
KALANI BROWN: Just as you said, not looking ahead, not getting complacent with
an opponent and not paying attention to rankings or the amount of talent they
have on a team. We treat every team the same. We go out there and we execute
and we just take it one game at a time.  
  
Q. Chloe, this is probably one of the reasons why you came to Baylor, to
have a chance to go on a tournament run like this. Now that you're on the cusp
of having that happen or getting the chance to make it happen, what's going
through your head? What are you feeling?  
CHLOE JACKSON: It's a blessing to be here and playing on this stage with
Baylor across my chest, but just staying in the moment, not looking too far
ahead, like Lani said, but just realizing it's a blessing and just taking it
one game at a time.  
  
Q. Kalani and then Lauren, you guys are almost kind of a given at this
point. Everybody knows about you. How important is it for other players to
play their part, to step up when maybe -- whether you're having an off-night
or people are just controlling you?  
KALANI BROWN: You know, there's been times where we have had an off-night, and
I think a lot of people -- a lot of our guards have stepped up, Juicy, Didi.
We take that and we learn from that as a team. I mean, I don't know, there's
been times where we've both had a bad night, so I don't know --  
  
LAUREN COX: And Chloe, you know.  
  
KALANI BROWN: And Chloe.  
  
LAUREN COX: I think it's big for them to step up like that because when we are
on, it opens it up inside for us so we're not getting doubled and triple-
teamed when they're hitting shots from the outside.  
  
Q. Lauren, it's kind of like a broken record in terms of teams shooting
threes against you guys. Here it comes again. How much is the focus -- has the
focus been more this year on guarding the perimeter and making sure teams just
don't sit out there and bomb y'all from three-point range?  
LAUREN COX: Yeah, Coach has put an emphasis on that just because so many teams
have done it, like you said, and I think we're going to continue to see that
because you've got me and Kalani inside to start the game and then you have
Lys and Queen coming in who are both 6'2", 6'3", so a lot of teams don't want
to bring it in the paint because we're going to send it right back out.  
  
Q. Chloe, you actually played in the NCAA Tournament here in Waco
before. Have you allowed yourself to maybe reflect on just kind of the journey
that you've traveled since then coming back here beginning this journey now?  
CHLOE JACKSON: Yeah, it's been a long journey, but I do, I mean, think about
it all the time. I was here two years ago and the journey was cut short, so I
mean, just now being here, I want to go a long ways with Baylor.  
  
Q. Kalani, have you ever thought now that this is it, you have a career
in the possibly WNBA, wherever it might be, have you thought this could at any
time over the next two or three years your last game in college?  
KALANI BROWN: Yes, it's crossed my mind a few times actually, but I'm just
trying to make sure that it isn't. That's the goal.  
  
Q. Kalani, how did you celebrate your birthday yesterday?  
KALANI BROWN: We practiced. We just sat at Chloe's house and watched our men
upset Syracuse. Go boys.  
  
Q. Kalani, Coach Mulkey said she's been singing to you guys. She sang
the Abilene songs. What are your thoughts on her singing skills?  
KALANI BROWN: They're great. They're good. I'm not going to say nothing
negative about Coach. No, but she sings it over and over, so it does get a
little -- I don't know what's the word.  
  
LAUREN COX: She just stuck on that one song, and it's just nonstop, whatever
song it is.  
  
KALANI BROWN: Nope, it doesn't matter.  
  
Q. Lauren, this team is known for its defensive ability. When you don't
have as much time to scout as you get here in the tournament, what do you guys
have to do differently, if anything?  
LAUREN COX: I think you just go back on your basic defensive principles. I
mean, help side, denying on the wing, ball pressure, that kind of thing. Since
we don't have a lot of time to kind of go through their plays and all that,
you just go back to what you know and just play good team defense.  
  
Q. We've got a Pac-12 team in here and then we've got an ACC team. Do
you guys recognize going in that difference conferences have different styles
of play and does that help you know what to expect coming in?  
KALANI BROWN: Yeah, I definitely think so. Pac-12 is different, I guess. I
don't know. I don't know.  
  
LAUREN COX: We haven't really looked at either of those teams yet. We're just
focusing on Abilene right now. I think Big 12 helps us out a lot because it's
super physical, we play quick, so I think we're going to be prepared for
anybody who we have to play.  
  
CHLOE JACKSON: I agree with LC, but the Big 12 we see different types --
different styles of play, so I think when it comes time to scouting them,
whichever team we're going to have to play, we'll be prepared and ready to
play them.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Recee Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36608)

### [Kristine Anigwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30389)

### [Asha Thomas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33253)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Open the floor to questions.  
  
Q. Asha and Kristine, talk about the familiarity of not only being back
in the NCAA tournament, but being in a spot where you have played these games
and just what it's like to be back here?  
ASHA THOMAS: Definitely a blessing just to be in the NCAA tournament once
again. Like you said, we've been here before. I guess you could say we know
these rims a little bit more. We'll get used to it again.  
  
Again, we're just glad to be here again.  
  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: I don't know. I'm really grateful. Waco was really good to us
when we played my sophomore year, two years ago. We beat LSU. (Indiscernible)
had like sic 3s. Then we like got a Waco call to Baylor, and that kind of
prepped us for the next season.  
  
I just think that like not everyone gets this opportunity, and I'm really
grateful to be here playing a really good team. North Carolina is really good.
Should be a really good game.  
  
Q. Kristine, can you tell me how this is different from when we saw you
two years ago?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, me and Asha are seniors and we got Recee as a grad
transfer, so it's a little bit different vibe, a different feel, and it's more
family based. I think we all really, really love and care for each other. We
all have each other's backs.  
  
All the seniors are really, really close, so it's really cool having that,
growing together, learning from each other. I guess like the underclassmen are
really looking up to us, so this game is just going to show our true potential
and what we're about.  
  
Q. Recee, talk about getting a chance to play in an NCAA tournament, and
you get to do it in your home state to start it off. What's that like being
back in Texas?  
RECEE CALDWELL: It's a little bit surreal for me being in my first NCAA
tournament and coming back to Baylor. I've played here multiple times being in
the big 12 before. Brings a lot of familiarity for me. Just a great vibe all
around. I love that I get to do it with this group, with Coach Gottlieb as our
leader, and my sisters as I guess my teammates.  
  
I just couldn't pick a better group to be a part of.  
  
Q. How many family do you anticipate being here?  
RECEE CALDWELL: 30 plus, 30 plus people. Not just even family. My dad's club
team are based in San Antonio, so they'll make that three-hour drive. Really
grateful that I get to play in front of family and friends.  
  
Q. Asha, I've got to ask. We all know about your North Carolina
connections. Talk about that a little bit and the irony of playing against a
team you have a connection with because of your brother. I know you worked out
there before. How different and strange is it going to be playing them in an
NCAA tournament, and how many of those girls do you know?  
ASHA THOMAS: I think this is probably one of the best days I'll have just
because just our families are connecting, the program's families are
connecting. I don't know. It's definitely a blessing. I don't know too many
girls on the team, but just being the North Carolina connection, I don't know,
I think it's fun for me.  
  
I'm excited. I know my brother, he's going to cheer for us for sure.
(Laughter.) I think it's probably going to be one of the best days of my life.  
  
Q. When you first saw that bracket and saw what was going to happen,
what was the initial thought? Was what kind of what it was, or take a minute
to go, Wow?  
ASHA THOMAS: No, I just started seizing once I heard it and I saw it on TV. I
called my brother after that and he was just like, It's go time. Don't hold
anything back. Play your game. Just do what have to do.  
  
Q. Did you ever think about going North Carolina?  
RECEE CALDWELL: No.  
  
Q. Okay.  
RECEE CALDWELL: No.  
  
Q. So you like where you're at?  
RECEE CALDWELL: Yeah.  
  
Q. Asha, what do you remember about two years ago here? You obviously
had a tremendous game against LSU; what do you remember? What do you hope it
build on?  
ASHA THOMAS: That was our first time, my first time, myself and Kristine's
first time in a tournament. Never knew what it was like, the feel, the vibe.
First game was a battle, which we expected.  
  
Of course being a freshman, you don't know exactly what the first round is in
the tournament. Shots started falling for myself, got going. Won the first
round. Second round was Baylor. Touch team, tough players. Kristy Wallace,
Alexis Jones, like that's a team right there.  
  
And they gave it to us. We battled. But just the overall experience of the
first two rounds was something that I probably never thought I would be in,
but I'm glad I could play.  
  
Q. Kristine, we look the a your numbers and see all the double-doubles.
What is it you really appreciate about your game, and what is it that drives
you to continue to do that? What does that streak mean to you?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: I don't know. Like, I mean, this time last year I wouldn't
expect -- I didn't expect any of this. I was just trying to figure out what
basketball itself meant to me.  
  
I think this year kind of showed me that it's like bigger than me. Staying
present, taking everything in. Just honestly being present is just so key.
That's why the streak, when it was happening I wasn't really aware of it. I
wasn't really trying to manifest that, because I wanted to stay present, take
every game, every second playing with the Cal jersey, I wanted to appreciate
that moment.  
  
Again, like I said, I couldn't have been here without literally my teammates.
I know a lot of people say that, but my teammates -- like part of my team are
going to be my life for like ever, you know.  
  
The connections we made this year with Recee, Asha, McKenzie, has impacted my
life. I've never had teammates like them. This year is for everyone that
believed in me, like truly, like my family, my friends that are part of my
family, my coaches, everyone like literally. All the Cal family. So, yeah.  
  
Q. Was there a point where you realized there was a streak? Somebody say
something or just kind of keep playing?  
ASHA THOMAS: Everyone is tweeting about it. I'm like, Okay, that's really
cool. At the end everyone was like, You averaged 16 rebounds. I was like, What
the hell? Sorry. I was like, I've never just -- like in the previous years I
was just like, Okay. I'm 6'4". Everyone expects me to be on the glass, to
rebound.  
  
That means a lot to me. Just shows how much work I've put in and sometimes I
don't give myself enough credit. I tend to overwork because I don't think I'm
working enough. I think a lot of people on our team do that. Seeing the
numbers show the effort that I put in in the summertime and my teammates
helped me put in is a reflection of everyone that had my back.  
  
It's bigger than me. I could not have done that without the people that I have
in my life right now.  
  
Q. Recee, you were talking a minute ago about your sisters in this
group. Talk about engraining yourself in an established team knowing it's
going to be a one-year thing and how that process has been and could it have
gone any better than it has? Seems like it's gone pretty well for you.  
RECEE CALDWELL: Yeah, I've had a relationship with a lot of my teammates. We
were freshman playing in the Battle in the Boro. Really hot gym and she was
giving us work. I've just known a lot of my teammates for a long time. I knew
Kristine through USA Basketball for forever.  
  
So coming in I wasn't new. It didn't feel new. Felt like I've had a connection
with my teammates for a while now. The transition off the court seemed to be
less. It wasn't any like gap time that I needed.  
  
I would say on the court was more of a little bit of a transition for me. Off
the court, I mean, it was all love.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S 1ST AND 2ND ROUNDS:
WACO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+1ST+AND+2ND+ROUNDS%3A+WACO)

  

## March 22, 2019

  

### [Janelle Bailey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34674)

### [Paris Kea](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32666)

  
_Waco, Texas_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're joined by North Carolina student-athletes Paris Kea and
Janelle Bailey. Questions?  
  
Q. Janelle, when you look at Cal, the person that pops off the page is
Kristine Anigwe. You've got the defensive assignment on her. How does she
compare to some of the other elite post players you've had to defend this
season, Turner or Fuehring, for example?  
JANELLE BAILEY: First, she's relentless on both ends. She works really hard,
never stops. She has a continuous motor. It's going to be a challenge for me.
And I just have to remember the things that coaches have told me.  
  
I know she's top scorer, top rebounder in the country. So just remember little
things like it's not about if I get the rebounds; making sure she doesn't get
it. Because I know she's a great player.  
  
It's not about stopping her; it's about containing her, making it difficult
for her to score the ball and get rebounds, because her team relies on her a
lot. I realize she's a great player. She's All-American. So it's going to be
about containing her more than trying to stop her play because somebody great
like that you can't really stop them.  
  
Q. Paris, as the only senior on the team, Coach Hatchell talked
throughout the season how Carolina played one of the toughest schedules in the
country. Right around the midpoint of the season the win-loss record wasn't
enough to get you over the hump to this tournament. Was there ever a moment as
a senior you said, we've got to kick it into another gear if we're going to
qualify this year?  
PARIS KEA: Definitely. We go into every game wanting to win, trying to get the
W. Our biggest weakness is consistency. That's our biggest thing going into
the tournament is trying to find that consistency and stick it out all the way
through.  
  
Q. Clearly first time any of you all have been in the NCAA Tournament.
But the preparation that you have going through this, could you just talk
about that, how it's prepared you all for that? And do you kind of see this as
almost like an ACC game?  
JANELLE BAILEY: We play in arguably the best conference in the country. So
preparation for every game in the ACC is tough. We know it's a battle every
night. We know every ACC team we've played has great players, great coaches
and people that just fill their roles.  
  
So we know it's like a new season to us and it's kind of like a new beginning
and it's anybody's game. Every game is anybody's game. I could say we prepare
for it like that, but we do realize this is a new season. And we're thankful
that we're here but we just kind of leave the past in the past and play one
game and get this W now.  
  
PARIS KEA: Like I said, our biggest weakness is consistency. So I feel like
using those games that we won, use that as confidence going into the
tournament. And, I mean, the ACC is a very tough conference. We've played some
of the best teams already. So I mean we're not afraid of anyone.  
  
Q. Janelle, when you come in here, obviously it's an NCAA Tournament, do
you look around and you see all this. Is this the kind of stuff that teams
want to aspire to be in a lot of ways when you look at the championship
pictures and stuff like that? And what does it feel like when you play in a
building like that? I'm not going to ask you about them because you're not
playing them?  
JANELLE BAILEY: Yeah, it's something that everyone wants to strive for, but we
have stuff hanging in our arena, too. I think most ACC championships, if I'm
not mistaken, and tournament appearances and Final Fours and things like that.
So I think for us seeing this is just a way to get back on top and get back to
the old Carolina and keeping the tradition going. But we have our advantage
and our (indiscernible).  
  
Q. Paris, what has the addition of Shayla brought to the team this
year?  
PARIS KEA: Well, I feel like we've struggled a little bit in the point guard
position. So we're trying to maneuver and figure out everybody's role on the
team. So when I moved to the point guard and she found a lot of comfort on the
wing, and I think she's very consistent where she is. She loves it there.  
  
But I think the big thing she brings to us is consistency and leadership and
definitely her defense.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Chloe Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32657)

### [Kalani Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30449)

  
_Tampa, Florida_  
  
Baylor-82, Notre Dame-81  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Baylor. We'll start with questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Chloe, can you take us through the play for the winning bucket.  
CHLOE JACKSON: It was the same play we ran (Friday) against Oregon. (Coach Kim
Mulkey) told me just get to the basket. If the wing helps over, kick it to
Juicy. If not, get all the way to the rim. That's what I did.  
  
Q. Kalani, I remember you saying your goal was to get to the Women's
Final Four. Now you've done everything by winning the national championship.
How does it feel to add that to your résumé?  
KALANI BROWN: Feels great. Was the last thing on my checklist. Now I checked
it off. So I'm happy (smiling).  
  
Q. When Lauren got hurt, talk about what was going through everybody's
head. I saw you kind of pull everybody together. What were you thinking in
that moment?  
CHLOE JACKSON: It was tough when she went down. Obviously that's our leader,
one of our leaders, obviously, Kalani. We just had to come together. Our motto
is Together to Tampa. We had to stick together. We knew it was going to be
tough without her, but we had to do it for her. That's what was going through
our head.  
  
Q. With Lauren out of the game, how big was NaLyssa (Smith) and how she
played?  
KALANI BROWN: NaLyssa got some big baskets. She came in there like she would
not be denied. She gave us that spark, for sure because it was, like we said,
we don't miss a beat when they sub in.  
  
Q. Chloe, you didn't score in the first half against Oregon. You have
your Baylor career high tonight. Where did that come from, for it to happen in
the biggest moment in your collegiate career?  
CHLOE JACKSON: I just wanted to come out today being more aggressive. I knew
they were obviously going to be on our post players, I would have some open
looks. Just coming out early, looking for my shot, taking what the defense was
giving me.  
  
But really the confidence came from my teammates and my coaches. They gave me
the confidence I needed to go in there, be confident, knock down shots.  
  
Q. Kalani, when the foul horn sounded, you went directly to Lauren on
the bench. What did you tell her, share in that moment?  
KALANI BROWN: I just told her, We did this for you.  
  
When she went down, I can say we got a little rattled. But we had to pull it
together, pull it out for her.  
  
The whole time, she was coaching on the sideline. She was still involved. I
mean, she came out of that tunnel...  
  
I think that speaks volumes of her character. So I was just like, We did it
for you, babe.  
  
Q. Chloe, with 9:26 to go, you pick up your fourth foul. Take me through
what that was like with Kim, in your own mind, what followed from that
decision?  
CHLOE JACKSON: Well, I just looked at Coach Mulkey. She was like, You have
four. I was like, Okay, I got you. I'm not going to foul out.  
  
I knew my team needed me. I just had to play good defense and not pick up
another one, just stay composed.  
  
Q. DiDi, Notre Dame has been a fourth quarter team. You didn't expect
them to just fold the tent and go home.  
DIDI RICHARDS: No, we didn't. We knew they was holding something in their bag.
We kind of knew they was going to come the way they came in the fourth
quarter.  
  
KALANI BROWN: Yeah, they got hot that fourth quarter. With everything going
on, it's easy to get rattled and fall apart, but we didn't. We just had to
hold it together.  
  
CHLOE JACKSON: We know they don't start the game out very well. We knew
eventually they were going to definitely start hitting shots. Yeah, just
attacking us. They did just that.  
  
Q. Kalani, can you reflect on closing the circle in this way with Coach
Mulkey.  
KALANI BROWN: It's definitely going to be hard leaving Baylor. But I left on a
good note. I just want to thank Coach Mulkey for choosing me because this is
the best thing ever. I don't even know. I don't know, I'm just glad to be a
part of this team.  
  
Q. Chloe, on the shirts your parents wore, did you have any input on
that?  
CHLOE JACKSON: I did not have one input. It was a surprise seeing it. My mom
told me during the autograph session they were getting shirts. I'm like, What
shirts? Why aren't you guys here? Sure enough, they had my face on them, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: At this time we'll send the student-athletes back to the locker
room, and we'll start with questions for Coach Mulkey.  
  
KIM MULKEY: I'm going to give an opening statement tonight. I may never get
this chance again (laughter).  
  
I want to thank the NCAA Women's Basketball Committee. They got it right. They
got it right on geography, as best they could. Geography is always going to
play a part. They most importantly got it right on the S-curve.  
  
The City of Tampa, what great memories my basketball team has just going to
Tourney Town, signing autographs. The hotel, we're at the Grand Hyatt, which
was way far away, but the Tampa police made me feel like Moses when they were
parting the sea. They would stop the traffic and the kids just got a kick out
of filming that.  
  
Then lastly, I'm not a hockey fan, I really didn't grow up watching hockey,
but I'm going to watch the Lightning because I drank all their water and all
their Coke. You guys replenish that coach's locker room, and good luck to them
in the Stanley Cup.  
  
Notre Dame, do I even need to tell you how good they are? They're the
defending national champions, can score at all positions, play the zone
against us. I don't think people thought we could score against the zone. We
scored a lot of points.  
  
Just a great game for women's basketball. The worst part of the game was
Lauren Cox. We controlled that game from the start till the time she went off
the floor. We had to regroup. For us to win probably was a miracle in itself
when you lose a player of that caliber, not only the talent she has, but she's
our leader, people. She's our leader.  
  
For her to come back out on that bench, help those teammates, tell them
things. NaLyssa Smith, having to go out there and guard a senior post player,
you knew they were going to expose her on the defensive end. But she never let
it rattle her. She came back. Every time she'd give up a basket, she'd make a
basket.  
  
That is my opening statement. I'm done.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. You gave your eye makeup a workout after the game was over. Talk
about where all that emotion came from.  
KIM MULKEY: It starts with Lauren Cox. For two years in a row we've had major
injury to key players. Kristy Wallace gets hurt and tears her ACL in the last
regular season conference game, and it cost us. It cost us an opportunity to
get here last year. When she went down and didn't get up, I know my kids, I
knew she was seriously injured.  
  
But from the time I left her on that floor to get to that huddle, I needed to
regroup. I needed to regroup. I needed to make them understand, We're going to
still win this basketball game. It will be a little bit tougher now, but we've
got to battle, and we did.  
  
Q. Seemed like a little bit out of sync, particularly on the defensive
end, to start the fourth quarter. How big was Chloe to close out like that,
the same play basically she ran the other night?  
KIM MULKEY: I'm so glad you paid attention. It was the same play. Set a screen
for Chloe at the top, Duck your head, you get in there and score it.  
  
She had to go in there with (Brianna) Turner getting ready to alter and
potentially block her shot. I told her, Don't get rid of it unless the girl in
the corner, who is our shooter, that defender comes over and tries to take a
charge or something, then you kick it out.  
  
Chloe never gets rattled. She gave up a lot of threes to Mabrey there, but she
never got rattled.  
  
Q. That last possession by them, you probably knew it was going to go
Arike (Ogunbowale).  
KIM MULKEY: No way did I think that (laughter).  
  
Of course, I did.  
  
Q. She draws the foul. You probably think, We're going to overtime. What
was going through your head the last few seconds?  
KIM MULKEY: If you remember, they had no timeouts. They go out there, get set,
I call a timeout. What did I tell them at that point? I was trying to make a
decision, do I leave Moon (Ursin), who hadn't been in the game much, on her
with speed, quickness. She's a strong kid, or do I move Juicy (Landrum) on
her? That was the first decision I was trying to make.  
  
The second decision I was trying to tell Moon is, Whatever you do, give up a
two, but don't give up a three.  
  
Then I told her to be alert to the down screen. I thought they would down
screen four, bring her up, maybe try to go for the win.  
  
Moon had three-quartered her pretty good, but she just made one quick move,
they threw it quick, she turned and ducked her head, which all great players
are trying to draw the foul there.  
  
Q. With Lauren out, you had to regroup, NaLyssa goes out, Chloe, DiDi
had four fouls, a lot of your weapons that you use to win games this year were
gone. Did you feel like you had to invent a new way for this team to win a
game at the end?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, yeah. I went with four guards. If you'll remember, I didn't
put Queen (Egbo) in the game. When NaLyssa went out and fouled out, I had to
make a quick decision then. I just thought, DiDi is 6'1", battle your rear-end
off in there at the post, get a rebound for us, go with her at the four. I
haven't done that all year.  
  
I thought that she did fine. I put Moon in instead of Queen Egbo.  
  
Q. Specific to the moment 9:26 in the game, Chloe gets her fourth foul.
Your thinking and strategy? What do you think she showed WNBA talent
evaluators tonight with the kind of game she had?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I trusted her. I trusted her. I trusted DiDi. There is no
tomorrow, so why sit them on the bench? If they foul out, they foul out, then
I'm ripped to shreds by y'all and we lose the game because we didn't sub. I
get all that.  
  
But I have to trust my kids. Our best chance of winning the basketball game
when we were losing the momentum at that point with Cox gone was to have those
kids on the floor.  
  
The WNBA, I can't answer that. I can't control what people think. I can only
tell you she's a national champion. I can tell you she's played that position
one year in college. I think she's been so good playing that position for us.
She keeps it simple. She doesn't try to juke and jive, go one on one, shoot
this, shoot that. She keeps the game simple. She gets the ball to people who
need the basketball.  
  
She's a great midrange shooter. All our inbounds tonight, a lot of them were
for Chloe. She had some rattle in and out.  
  
Q. To be the champ, you got to beat the champ. No one is going to accuse
you of backing into this, are they?  
KIM MULKEY: I hope not. A lot of people thought we had the easiest region to
get here. When you're the overall No. 1 overall seed, you should have the
easiest region. We weren't playing in our backyard. We had to go East Coast
time, play in Greensboro. We got home 1:30 in the morning. We had to leave at
5 p.m. the same day.  
  
We're moving on fumes. But it's a great kind of tired. Guys, that wasn't a
fluke out there. So don't sit here and write, Baylor lucked up and won on some
miraculous shot, they played over their head. If you look at the stats, hell,
we shot 60 something percent and 50 something percent in the first half. Cox
goes down, we still keep it up there pretty high.  
  
That's against just a very good team that played a lot of zone that I don't
think people thought we could attack a zone because we don't shoot enough
threes.  
  
Well, the old school won a national championship. Whatever that means, I don't
know what 'old school' means, I just know how to win. Do you what your
personnel is capable of doing.  
  
Q. We talked yesterday about family. How special was it for you to share
this with your family?  
KIM MULKEY: I can tell you how special family is. I'm bawling my eyes out. I
shake the hands of the Notre Dame staff and players, and I turn around to go
talk to Holly Rowe. My phone is put in my face. It's my son FaceTime-ing me
with all his Cardinals teammates. He's screaming, they're screaming, I'm
screaming at him. Holly is pulling me to go on TV. There's some things that
are more important than an interview. He just needed to talk to his mom.  
  
So the tears kept flowing. I was emotional from Cox's injury. That kid, if she
didn't get hurt, and she will be back, God works in mysterious ways, would
have been the No. 1 probably pick in the draft next year. That kid probably
would have been defensive player of the year nationally next year. That's how
good she is. And she will be back, I promise you that. It may take her a year.
We'll rest her, do whatever.  
  
But you write about that because that kid's going to start winning awards she
should have won this year. She got overlooked because she's on a great team
and those stats don't just, bam, jump out at you.  
  
Q. 17 games this year that NaLyssa scored in double figures. Another
great game tonight. Coming into this year, did you expect that kind of
contribution from her? How excited are you to see what she can do going
forward?  
KIM MULKEY: Without a doubt. Probably should have played her more with Cox and
Kalani and put Cox on the perimeter some. But she has ice water in her veins.  
  
NaLyssa thinks she can score on every shot she shoots. What she has really
worked on, and we will continue to work with her, is on the defensive end.
She's a freshman. You saw them expose her on the screens tonight. She'll get
better at that.  
  
I don't know this to be true, but she may be the first kid from San Antonio, I
was told, to win a national championship in forever or years or whatever.
Check that stat out.  
  
I'm happy for her, her hometown of San Antonio.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
KIM MULKEY: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 7, 2019

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Brianna Turner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28843)

### [Arike Ogunbowale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32683)

  
_Tampa, Florida_  
  
Baylor-82, Notre Dame-81  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining now is Notre Dame. We'll take a statement from coach
and then take questions.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Really frustrated. Well, I'm sad for the seniors that we came
that close after getting down 17, clawing our way back. We had so many missed
opportunities both ends of the floor. Defensively, offensive rebounds we gave
up just really I felt lost the game in the first quarter. We just didn't come
out ready. That was disappointing.  
  
But I thought Jackson really was the key to the game. We really couldn't guard
her. Brown gave us a lot of trouble, as well. Those two really played well.  
  
It was a great season. Certainly a great career for Arike, Marina, Jess and
Bri.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Was Arike trying to miss the second free throw?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah.  
  
Q. Marina seems like she's the one who brings your energy level up. She
did a couple times in this game. What is it that allows her to not just do
that, but make her teammates better in real-time?  
MUFFET McGRAW: She's incredibly competitive, feisty. I mean, it hurt us when
she got the two fouls in the first half because we lost our edge. She was
really, really the one that was getting things done for us on the floor. It
was difficult playing without her.  
  
Q. It looked like it was a war out there. The referees let you play
tonight, didn't they?  
BRIANNA TURNER: Definitely. We knew coming in it was going to be a physical
game. Baylor comes from the Big 12. A lot of big players. So we knew coming
in, it was going to be a fight the whole way through.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: They were really physical and their posts played strong.
Their guards were strong. We knew it was going to be tough.  
  
Q. Brianna, will you address what the impact you thought of the Cox
injury was, just sort of did you feel like you needed a moment to regroup
there as well?  
BRIANNA TURNER: I think it's always tough whenever a player goes down from
either team. But we have to play through those injuries no matter what
happens. We wanted to keep fighting no matter who was in or out of the game.  
  
Q. Arike, you've had a chance to win these games, then you're at the
line with a chance to tie it. 80% foul shooter. What is your level of shock?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I mean, it's tough. It's tough. You can't really do anything
about that one.  
  
Q. Brianna, Arike has put you guys through so many big moments with big
shots. She kind of throws her head back after that free throw. What is going
through your mind?  
BRIANNA TURNER: It doesn't come down to the free throw. I missed the block the
previous play. I mean, we were down a dozen at halftime. I mean, Kalani was,
like, really hurting us down low. It didn't come down to a free throw. It was
much more than that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Talk about the impact of the Cox injury, that period of time. You
really made a charge at them after that point. Did you feel like you had to
pull your kids together and regroup a little?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I don't think anybody wants to see that. We've had so
many. Brings back bad memories. You kind of want to gather up, say a prayer in
your head, hope she's okay.  
  
But you've got to be resilient, just like we were last year. You've got to be
able to come out. I thought Smith came in and gave them a huge lift. I thought
she played really well.  
  
Q. What did you say to Arike after that? Obviously she knows that it's
not the free throw that makes the difference.  
MUFFET McGRAW: The game didn't come down to that free throw. I mean, the game
was 40 minutes. There were plenty of mistakes we made throughout the game that
caused us to lose, most notably the first quarter. Just didn't come out ready.  
  
Q. You had five people on the floor, of course, who can make shots in
that situation. Any question in your mind that call was going to be for Arike
in that spot? How much was what she's done in her career play a part in your
decision?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, we decided that probably a week ago. I mean, there's no
question that's what was going to happen. Worked on that play in particular.
Wasn't exactly how we thought it would go. She got to the free-throw line.  
  
Q. Baylor's guards take 42 of their 73 shots. You would think that would
be an advantage to you the way they play. You're a fourth quarter team. Is
that because of the mental and physical conditioning you have?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we're in pretty good shape. I think mentally they
definitely have a higher gear that they can get to. We didn't quite get there
on defense tonight. I thought we got there on offense.  
  
What was the first part of your question?  
  
Q. (No microphone.)  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I mean, Jackson was having a day. We were actually trying
to guard her. She just got a lot of really good shots, shot over us, went by
us, scored in pretty much any way. Really, really stepped up in the big
moment.  
  
Q. Having won with this group last year, does it make it any easier to
come this close tonight?  
MUFFET McGRAW: No. You know, it's always tough to lose. I think you're always
looking at that one thing you could have done differently to make the
difference in the game. Just disappointed about our start. I mean, that was
really unfortunate.  
  
But knowing what this group has meant to us, it makes it tougher to lose this
way.  
  
Q. We got the stat that Arike Ogunbowale, second overall in points in
this tournament, with her 37 tonight. Thinking back on what she's meant to
Notre Dame, maybe what she can be at the next level, what would you say about
Arike?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think she's going to be a great player in the WNBA. She is
incredibly skilled, great work ethic, wants to win. She can score in a lot of
different ways. Yeah, I think she's going to be a star.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2019

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_Tampa, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by head coach Kim Mulkey. We'll start with
questions for coach right away.  
  
Q. You were here in this position seven years ago, obviously winning a
title then. How have you changed in the last seven years as a coach from then
till now, if you have?  
KIM MULKEY: Some things will never change. I think holding kids accountable
will never change. Your disciplining of kids so that you have control of your
locker room. I think you change and you evolve as a coach based on the
student-athletes that you have, what motivates them, how to reach them.  
  
I have a locker room full of unbelievable competitors, but it's a totally
different personality than the 2012 team. It's my job to figure it out and
adjust to them when it comes to motivation and how to get the most out of
them, decide what their roles are.  
  
Q. How hard is it to prepare for a team like Notre Dame after just the
one day?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, you kind of plan ahead. I tell you guys back home all the
time it wasn't raining when Noah built his ark. As the bracket comes out, you
kind of assign coaches to different teams, but you focus on the next opponent.  
  
We had already done our work on Oregon and our work on potentially who you
could see, UConn, people down the road.  
  
When you get to that time to present it, you've already done the work as a
staff. All that's left to do is sit and watch who you play. You don't present
anything until you know for certain who you're going to play.  
  
We're running a little bit late this morning because we're 20-something
minutes away, we get in traffic. But we also have to present Notre Dame to our
team this morning.  
  
So I hope that's answered your question. You're trying to do all the
requirements that you have to do, but you also have to get their attention and
stay on track to what your normalcy is.  
  
They watched the game. I'm sure they've watched some Notre Dame games through
the season. They know how good they are. They know they're the defending
champs. They know basically they play five kids that won't be back next year
other than potentially Jackie Young. They have experience in the game.  
  
Does that help a little bit?  
  
Q. Yes.  
KIM MULKEY: All right (smiling).  
  
Q. Can you talk about the evolution of Kalani (Brown) a little bit from
the player you got when she first got here, the player she is today.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, there is no change in Kalani Brown's personality and who she
is as a person. Just the kindest, sweetest kid, happy kid. Basketball-wise, I
thought when we got her she played like that. I thought that she just really
kind of wanted to blend in instead of really using her size to be dominant. If
it was just asking for the ball, it's okay to raise your voice and holler,
Give me the ball. Sometimes that doesn't come natural for kids.  
  
Kalani, as you saw last night, went to the offensive boards. She had a
presence in that paint. There's nothing that's gotten phenomenally better
other than the maturation process. She's always been able to shoot the
perimeter shot. We just don't have to use it in our style of play with her and
Cox.  
  
She's got a beautiful shot. Maybe her mobility, as people want to call it, her
ability to guard people off the dribble, she works on that from the high post.
Has not had to go to the three much to do that since her freshman year.  
  
She plays for longer periods of time where she doesn't need rest. But her
fundamentals of the game were there. I attribute that to her mother. Her
mother was an assistant coach on her high school team. Her mother coached her
during the summers.  
  
Kalani is just Kalani. She's just a happy-go-lucky kid and very pleasant.  
  
Q. With DiDi Richards defensively, but offensively, especially as of
late, she's been pretty special. Her development in that area, could you speak
on that a little bit.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I think DiDi has figured out that she's not going to be a
liability on the offensive end when people don't guard her, so she cuts to the
basket, she finds open areas to do good things. If it's an offensive board,
cutting to the basket when our post players, who are tremendous passers, can
find her.  
  
She's very confident. She took a critical shot there late in the game, and she
didn't hesitate to do that. Now, that comes from her being confident. That may
not be, if I was drawing up a play, the option for her to be the first one to
shoot that. But, hey, she's gotten us to this point. It wasn't a bad shot. It
was a very makable shot for her.  
  
Q. After the game ended, the team was celebrating, you're crouched down
courtside and stayed there for a long time. What were you thinking?  
KIM MULKEY: Hell, I'm too old to get up (laughter). No.  
  
I just looked at 'em and thought, This is why you coach. I think I've done
that before, just taking the moment. Those kids had never been to a Final
Four. They were going to now play for a national championship. I just wanted
to just watch 'em.  
  
I think one of my assistants came behind and said, Coach, get up.  
  
I just wanted to take it all in. I just happened to be squatted at the end of
game because that's the position I was in. Just taking in the moment.  
  
Q. You mentioned how different this team is from your previous Women's
Final Four team. Was there something from that Final Four run that informed
this one, either something you wanted to make sure you did this time or you
didn't do, anything that kind of affected how you're managing the team this
time around?  
KIM MULKEY: No, not at all. You don't compare teams. Just do what we've been
doing for however many games we've been doing it this year, don't change who
we are. I don't have a team in that locker room that gets too high or too low.
They certainly don't stress over anything. They have fun.  
  
The fun part for me is just allowing them to be who they are. Think I only
lose two of them. I have a whole boatload of them back that are very talented.
Those kids are experiencing something that they won't ever forget. Hopefully
the younger ones will take it with them when we start next year.  
  
Q. Geno said last night that Notre Dame could get a basket any time they
wanted to, compared them on the offensive end to some of his best teams. What
do you see that would make him say those things?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, they're defending national champions. They all average
pretty much in double figures, except for probably in the playoffs, I think
they have four or five averaging in double figures. They have bigs inside.
They shoot the three ball, not like an Oregon, but they will shoot the three
ball. They're athletic. I guess just the fact that they can score at all
positions.  
  
Maybe Geno's trying to say he doesn't have that at all positions. I don't
know. I can't respond to why he said that.  
  
I know he went to Notre Dame and beat them this year, so his team is pretty
darn good. He needs to give them a little credit.  
  
Q. Muffet has talked a lot about the need for even more female role
models, how important that is. You probably saw a lot of her remarks. Could
you address that. With the two of you going for a national championship, I
feel like you two are the spokeswomen for women's basketball. What do you
think about being in that role?  
KIM MULKEY: Muffet's coached a lot longer than I have. She's a Naismith Hall
of Famer. What I think really doesn't matter.  
  
I will tell you this. I understand her points, without a doubt. But I'm of the
belief, I want the best person for the job. I have a son, and I would be
honored if my son wanted to coach next to me.  
  
She has a son. I think she would be honored if he wanted to coach women's
basketball. So I tend to stay away from saying the word 'never.' Bringing
attention to what needs to be fixed, but don't give an absolute answer because
I don't want to hire somebody just to be hiring them. I want to hire somebody
that can help us be successful.  
  
As a female and a mother of a son and a daughter, I'm very careful, you know,
saying 'never.' But I do understand what she is saying. Statistics are
glaring. She has a right and an opinion to say whatever she wants to say.  
  
I'm just very careful about that mainly because I have a son.  
  
Q. When you say 'let the players be who they are,' has that always been
the case? Is that something you've evolved where you let them be more who they
are? It seems like when I think of some of the players back in the past that
you had to deal with, knuckleheads...  
KIM MULKEY: Well, it's not that those in the past weren't who they are. It's
just they were a little bit more reserved. They didn't have the DiDi silly,
goofiness at a press conference. They were just more reserved.  
  
You've got to let players be who they are when it comes to team chemistry and
how they motivate each other and pull for each other. That's all I meant by
that.  
  
Q. You've had quite a bit of success signing post players with
considerable height. In recruiting, how much is that a factor, height, looking
for post players? Is that the factor?  
KIM MULKEY: We try to find the best players. We've just been blessed that in
our recruiting that we have had some of the greats of the game. I just think
you have to, as a coach, run a system that showcases their talents. If I don't
have post players, I can't run some of the stuff that I do.  
  
But I've been very fortunate that when a group graduates, we have younger ones
that are big coming into the program.  
  
Do we go in and say, Gosh, get me the biggest? That would be great. But, you
know, recruiting is difficult. We try to get the best that we can at all
positions, then whatever we -- whoever we sign, then we evaluate what we need
to run and what we need to do.  
  
Q. Lauren and Kalani a couple of weeks ago spoke about how fresh they
feel, basically sitting out the fourth quarter the majority of the season.
Both of them played high minutes, Lauren playing all 40. Did you see those
fresh legs last night?  
KIM MULKEY: Yes. When you have depth, you can play a lot of players. Not only
are you resting them for the playoffs, you're also letting the young ones gain
experience. I just thought we had a team, and I was allowed to do that a lot
this year.  
  
It's funny because in one of the playoff games, I want to say it might have
been Iowa, somebody questioned, You played them 35? Was it the semifinal, I
can't remember. Would they be ready for the next game.  
  
I'm like, this is why we rested them all year for six games so they would be
able to play those amount of minutes.  
  
Those kids, they'll do whatever you ask. If they need to play 40, they'll play
40. If they need to play 20, they'll play 20. It's playoff time. I didn't
think the players that played were fatigued at all.  
  
Q. You touched on this briefly last night. You mentioned the gap in
three-point shooting in the game last night. You mentioned that you like to
tailor your offense to your personnel. When it comes to having more of a
postgame, are you comfortable with that perhaps against a game more predicated
by deep shooting?  
KIM MULKEY: Again, I'm going to do what I need to do based upon what my kids
are capable of doing. You have to remember, we lost two perimeter three-point
shooters when the season started. Starting point guard and starting two
player. One transferred, one was dismissed. Those kids could stroke it out
there.  
  
I still say that the offense that we run with our two bigs, our leading scorer
should be a three-point shooter, or a perimeter shooter, because of the amount
of attention that they receive. I've always thought that.  
  
Am I more comfortable with that? I'm comfortable with whatever I need to do.
You never become stagnant as a coach that you go out and say, Okay, this is
the style I run, these are the kinds of players I need to recruit. That would
not be very smart on my part.  
  
Go recruit the best players at every position, and if they're big, great. Get
them there, then see what you need to run, and run it.  
  
Does that help a little bit?  
  
Q. How nice has it been for you to celebrate this run with your family,
your daughter being on your staff, your grandson being around all the time,
stealing press conferences? After 2012 you had a chance to repeat in 2013.
Talk about how difficult it is to win back-to-back titles. Notre Dame is one
victory away from accomplishing that feat.  
KIM MULKEY: Let me put it in perspective. How many national championships has
Muffet won? How many have I won? How long has she been coaching? How many
years? I don't know. Probably a heck of a lot longer than me.  
  
Does that tell you how hard it is? It's hard. It is so hard to win
championships. You can be the favorite and not win 'em. I've been the favorite
and not won 'em. I've been the underdog and won 'em. There are no guarantees
in this business. That's why you cherish the moment.  
  
To answer your question about my family, I don't think it's any secret that we
had just a horrible year with the death of a grandchild, yet I don't think as
a family, I'm talking about Makenzie and myself, we had time to grieve. You're
right in the middle of the season. We're opening up at UCLA. So our grief was
put into our work.  
  
She gets pregnant and has Kannon. You bet I'm going to hang onto him. Holding
a child up here is a heck of a lot more touching than holding one right here
that's deceased. I've done both in the last year and a half.  
  
Every chance I get, you bet, because in my world, anybody will tell you, it is
about family first. When I was hired, I told the president at Baylor, If a
decision has to be made about my job and my family, that decision was made a
long time ago. I live by that.  
  
I think my players know it. They see it. They feel it. They come first. It
should be in all of our lives. It doesn't just take the death of a child to
get your attention. But sometimes it really does. So you're going to see him.
The only thing I hate is Kramer is not here. St. Louis Cardinal fan. Another
single last night. Great story. Can I talk about him a little bit?  
  
So I get to the room, Why won't you answer my calls? He's playing during our
game. He's in the on-deck circle. He has the trainer. Get on the app. It was a
tie ballgame, whatever, late in the game. Still don't have a score, they go to
timeout. Mom, I go to the field, the whole team now is like they know the
signal. I'm at shortstop. I'm looking in the dugout. Just give me a thumbs up
or a thumbs down.  
  
He said, I'm freaking out out there. I can't focus. He said, I have a line
drive hit at me, I field it, get it. I see a thumbs up. All the guys on the
team are just, like, going nuts. You would have thought we won the national
championship, he said, because we were all trying to do our job, but we have
an interest there.  
  
I said, Well, Kramer, it was that kind of game. Nobody can give you a thumbs
up or thumbs down. So he was excited.  
  
I miss him being here. But you guys know family comes first with me. That's
all we have really at our lowest moments is our family.  
  
I want to say this. How many AP writers in here? Guys, I failed at the AP
awards thing to acknowledge you guys. That's a humbling thing to win that
award. Should have been the first people I thanked. So I'm thanking you
publicly. I'll put it out on Twitter. Y'all know that I only win those awards
because of the kids.  
  
I'm glad you brought that to my attention. You've been around the game,
Michelle, Hawkins. You all been doing this a long time. Y'all have been doing
it longer than I've been coaching. Y'all are much appreciated.  
  
Q. You talked a little bit about enjoying the moment, the quick
turnaround. With the quick turnaround, how do you walk the line of you and
your team smelling the roses but also know there's work to do?  
KIM MULKEY: We can't go out here and run up and down the floor. I don't think
anybody can. You walk through. You watch film. You know what you're going to
do. You just tell them, this is what we're going to do defensively, okay? They
know what we're going to do offensively. You got to get the soreness out. You
got to get baths. You got to get all the things you can to let their bodies
recover.  
  
We have requirements with media and ESPN, NCAA. We have an autograph session.
We're going to do those gladly, but with a little fatigue. But make sure that
you get rest, you get rest, too. It's a fine line, but we'll figure it out.
Notre Dame, we're both in the same boat.  
  
Q. During this run, how much is the team thinking about Chameka Scott?  
KIM MULKEY: We haven't talked about it a whole lot. We haven't talked about
losing Scout, my granddaughter. Those really are not things we talk about
right now. I think everyone is so excited, but yet they have a business-like
approach, too.  
  
I'll tell you this. One of the things, I've been doing it 35 years if you
count my 15 years at Louisiana Tech as a coach, I'm excited that every one of
my players' parents are in the stands. That might be a first. You know why
that is? Because the NCAA got it right. They allow you to help those parents
get here.  
  
I'm just telling you, they're all congregated right there in that one little
section in the stands. When I turned to thank our crowd, I stared at every one
of them. They all want to see their kid play. They don't always leave a gym
happy with a coach. I wanted to look at them and to say thank you to the
parents, you and your child are the reason why we're here. You believed in me,
believed in Baylor. Whether they played one second or not, they wouldn't be on
that floor without their parents. That's a good thing.  
  
Q. Men's, women's basketball, football, coaches become iconic to their
schools, both with longevity and success. You haven't been doing it as long as
Muffet, but you are that person at Baylor.  
KIM MULKEY: Would you tell Baylor that? Would you write that in your story,
that Baylor, you better cherish that program. That will get me a raise. That
might get me a Calipari contract. That might get me a name on the floor, a
street, something. So speak it, tell 'em. Why don't you come be my AD,
president (laughter).  
  
No, go ahead.  
  
Q. To that end, there is a Pat Summit court, there is a statue of her
outside Tennessee. She was that person. You and Muffet are that person to your
programs. I wonder if you can talk about that, because that does mean
something to have a coach be iconic to their program.  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know how to answer that. It's kind of difficult to talk
about what you think Baylor should do for you.  
  
I just want them to be proud of the program. I want them to say that woman
does her job. They pay me extremely well. Money has never been an issue with
me.  
  
I don't know how to answer that. I think that's left up to Baylor. I think
that's left up to the new administration. I think it goes without saying, the
new administration has probably not been in this room for the last 19 years
because they were at other schools and other places. So maybe those that have
been with the school the longest can really understand what you're saying.  
  
That's a Baylor deal. I don't coach to get into Hall of Fames. I don't coach
to get courts named after me. I coach to get a paycheck, I can tell you that.
We all want to retire someday.  
  
I'm very loyal. Maybe that's the word I will tell you. I really think I'm
loyal to a fault. I get into it with some of you when you're bashing Baylor on
other issues, don't I? Who is the one that usually speaks up. It's usually
Kim. It's usually me. When Baylor is at its lowest moment, it's me that
defends the university.  
  
I defend it not out of my loyalties as much as how I truly feel. That's all I
know to do, is to coach, to be loyal, speak highly of my institution. All that
other stuff, that's out of my hands. That is above my pay scale, that is above
my level.  
  
I think all coaches want a pat on the back. That's all it takes, a pat on the
back, that, 'Hey, we see you'. All that other stuff I'll let y'all write about
it. But I could deal with a Calipari contract. Couldn't y'all? Huh? I probably
wouldn't turn that down (smiling).  
  
Q. How big is rebounding in this matchup? Their numbers from last night,
22 offensive boards, out-rebounded UConn by 17.  
KIM MULKEY: We looked at that, too (laughter).  
  
If you go back to last night's game, I thought two areas we were not very good
at early: turning the ball over, just uncharacteristic turnovers for us in
transition when there was no need to, and then offensive boards. They were
getting more offensive boards and second-chance opportunities than we were.  
  
You know when you play Notre Dame, (Jessica) Shepard and (Brianna) Turner are
capable of doing that. It's going to be a battle. But it certainly is brought
to our attention.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
KIM MULKEY: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 6, 2019

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_Tampa, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Coach McGraw. We'll start with questions.  
  
Q. I know during the season you talk about how difficult it was to get
back to where you are now. Can you talk for a minute about how difficult the
journey was to get back to the title game. Only been a few teams that won
back-to-back championships.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think the journey this year has been difficult for different
reasons than it was last year. I think the expectation always weighs a little
heavier on you. I don't think it weighed quite as heavy on the players as it
did on the staff because we kept thinking, 'We're supposed to win, be here'.  
  
I think after we beat Stanford, I think it was a big feeling of relief, more
so than excitement. After last night's win, I think the excitement is
definitely back.  
  
Q. We talked a little bit about Jess's transition to the next level.
Take me through how you see the rest of your starting lineup, the way in which
they will be most effective at the next level.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think Arike will transform into the WNBA I think pretty
easily because she can play the same type of position she's playing now. I
think she's ready. I think her body is ready. She's in great shape. She can do
a lot of things, handle a ball. I think she's ready right now for the next
level.  
  
Brianna Turner, if anybody is looking for anybody that can defend any position
on the floor and run the floor, just give you great attitude and a great work
ethic every single day, I think she would be a tremendous fit for any team.
Offensively she's continuing to improve. You saw what she did at the free-
throw line last night. She's gone from a 50% shooter to about an 80% shooter.
She's really worked on her shot.  
  
I think Jessica can score in so many ways, plus she's an adept passer. She can
play the high post really well. She's a great facilitator. She can do so many
things, rebound, she can get the break going, she can finish the break. I
think her game is meant for that type of game because she really can face the
basket. She can shoot threes and play on the perimeter probably more than I
let her.  
  
Then Marina set the assist record last night. She's somebody that can pass.
She can certainly score. She has the three-point record at Notre Dame. She's
smart, feisty. As a coach, you love to coach a player like Marina because she
is such a competitor. She really never quits. She inspires the rest of her
team to do the same.  
  
Tremendous work ethic. I think if you need a shooter and somebody that can
think the game, she's the one.  
  
Q. Having so many returners come back this season after winning the
title last season, what type of value does that experience bring on your
roster?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think the experience is key. I think they've all been here
before with the exception of Brianna, and she was here I think as a freshman
in the final game. They've all had experience at this level.  
  
I think there's no substitute for experience. I mean, really, at the end of
the game I thought last night we looked really poised, didn't lose our
composure, did some great things defensively. I think being in this moment
before I think will help us.  
  
Q. You've been in this kind of cycle of trying to win a national
championship for back-to-back seasons obviously. Has there been a moment
either this season or weekend where you've been able to take a breath, just
realize the moment, how much it means, soak it in with your team?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We really haven't. You're in kind of just hundred-miles-an-hour
fast forward mode right now. Haven't had an opportunity to really sit back and
think about it. Probably won't till afterwards.  
  
I don't know anything about winning back-to-back. This is the first try for
us. Hopefully we'll be able to get it done.  
  
Q. For a lot of years Coach Summit was the de facto spokeswoman for any
issue that came up about women's basketball, sometimes just for collegiate
sports. Have you sort of felt like that? You've elevated to that role, and I
think to some degree so has Kim. Have you felt the need, the desire to be sort
of that spokeswoman?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think when we lost Pat Summit we lost an icon, we also did
lose the spokeswoman for our game. She did so many great things for women, for
the women's game. She was always about what's best for the game, not what's
best for me. She constantly empowered and promoted women. When we lost her, we
had a void. There was nobody to fill that spot.  
  
I think you looked around and wondered who would step up, maybe it would be
sort of a point guard by committee kind of thing that you have in your game
sometimes.  
  
I've just felt the need to be able to stand up and express some things that I
thought needed to be said. I think she would have said them or she would have
been certainly another voice that would step up and say them. I think our game
needs somebody that's willing to step out because the platform that I've been
lucky to have, I thought it was a great time to say it.  
  
Q. Can you talk for a second about the difficulty, the two teams haven't
played each other, you have one day to get ready for this big game, the
problems that Baylor presents for you.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, they present a lot of problems. This is the first time
we've played a team that has two outstanding post players. We've generally
thought we had abnormal advantage in the post. That would be our game plan, to
go inside. We do not feel that way. They have terrific players inside with
Lauren Cox and Kalani (Brown).  
  
Lauren kind of similar to Jess in the way she's got over 130 or 140 assists.
She's a great facilitator at the high post, make the high post jumper, shoot
threes. Two great shot-blockers in the back. Defensively they're really kind
of an intimidating presence inside.  
  
I think that our guards are pretty good. I hope that our guards will be able
to come out and play well because I don't know if we have mismatches
necessarily, but I think once you get to this game, anything can happen.  
  
Q. You talked last year about how Jackie Young has a chance to be maybe
the best player you've ever had. You just went through the other four,
significant WNBA prospects. Between all of that talent and winning the title,
on the doorstep of potentially winning another, where do you see this team
within the history of your groups?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We've had a couple of classes that went to every Final Four in
their four years. This class has only been to two. But winning a championship
certainly sets them apart.  
  
I think statistically what they've been able to accomplish is pretty amazing.
10,000 points. The way they play together. The way they lead. Everything
they've done for our program to elevate us to get to this point. To represent
us so well on the national scene outside of basketball. What Arike did for us
last year, what the rest of them continue to do every day as role models, I
think is phenomenal for all the young girls out there watching our team play.
I think they're all great role models.  
  
Q. Last year obviously going into the tournament you were the underdogs.
This year you're the favorite. How does that change your mentality from a
coaching standpoint?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I don't think we're the favorite tonight. I think Baylor
is the overall No. 1 seed. We're definitely in a different place than we were
last year. Last year we were giddy to get here. We could not believe it worked
out through all the injuries and all the things that went wrong.  
  
This year it was a different mindset. It was more of a business trip. I think
we came in kind of expecting that we should get here, then we got here. I
think being able to really focus and understand why we were here, not just
happy to be here. This year we wanted to win.  
  
Q. Regarding the WNBA, how well have the four ladies you've spoken of
compartmentalized? Getting ready for their futures, they don't have the big
window that NFL and NBA have. How well have they done with that? Has Jackie
made any type of decision?  
MUFFET McGRAW: It's yet another thing you look at, the difference between men
and women. The women have a couple of days. I mean, the draft is Wednesday.
They don't have time to search for agents and they don't have time to make
decisions. Jackie has not made one yet. The other four, every game they go
into, they're thinking about their future because if they play poorly, they're
wondering is their stock going to drop, if they play well, is their stock
going to rise?  
  
There's a lot of pressure on them, things they shouldn't have to be thinking
about at this moment, at this juncture when it's so important for us as a team
to come out and play well without that hanging on their head.  
  
They've handled it well really. I think they've all played well. They've
certainly done some great things to make the WNBA coaches take a look at them.
But, yeah, I mean, it's your future. Your future's hanging in the balance
right now. That's a lot for a 21-, 22-year-old kid.  
  
Q. Again, it really is this crazy type turnaround. What should the model
look like? Should it be in season like the MLB has before their collegiate
season is even done. How should it be designed? Should a WNBA combine be part
of that as well?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't know how it should be designed. I think there's people
that know a lot more than I do about the marketing part of it. It's difficult
during the basketball season when you have the NBA, men's and women's college,
to add the WNBA. I'm not sure the attendance would be as good, having their
own season.  
  
This year I think it was even different because the season was pushed back a
week. But certainly wait for a couple more weeks, going into May, to start
things I think would be better for the student-athletes. They've also got to
finish their degree. They still have to go to class. We finish the first week
of May. It's worked out in the past where they can work with their professors.
To give them time to finish up in school, finish up with a lot of other
things, be able to graduate, some of those things that are really a big part
of their lives. They're not able to do them.  
  
It's worth the sacrifice for them, I'm sure they would say. It also would be
nice if they'd have a chance to kind of relax for a moment and enjoy this.  
  
Q. You had a great crowd the first two rounds at home, then obviously
Chicago, Irish Green. Talk for a minute big picture, how this year, the last
couple years, women's basketball attendance is pretty good across the board
for NCAAs.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we set some records this year. The first and second
rounds were tremendous. Then the regionals. I thought the committee did a
really good job of placing teams in places where they were going to get good
crowds. We were so excited to be able to go to Chicago. I think it was
definitely great for the NCAA and for ESPN to see that. I think three sites
were really, really well-supported.  
  
When you have good crowds, the teams in the area that can get there. It's
tough on the bracket, to be the 2 seed, have to go to a place where it's --
it's tough to be the 1 seed and go to the 2 seed, and you saw geography won
out and the fans won out in those places.  
  
I think that's a little bit tougher to look at. I know we were going to be one
of those teams at some point in the season until we won the ACC tournament. I
don't think you get rewarded for being a 1 seed, then have to go someplace
where you're playing in front of the 2 seed's crowd.  
  
We have to do what's best for the game. Right now getting attendance is what's
best. Is there another model that works better? I think people are open and
willing to try it. We keep going like we've committed three or four years down
the road. When is it going to happen?  
  
Q. We asked Coach Mulkey about some of your comments on hiring women.
She said she agreed and supported you, but she was hesitant about the word
'never.' She mentioned if her son ever wanted to coach alongside her, she
would love it. Obviously you have a son. Do you feel in some ways was that
misconstrued, you're not saying you're anti-male coach, but opportunities for
women.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we need more opportunities for women in coaching. I
just hired a male video coordinator. I have just hired a male strength coach.
I'm not opposed to hiring men. I just think that women need those
opportunities, and those opportunities right now are going to men.  
  
We keep looking at ways to get our young graduates and alums into the game.
There's no room for them in the game. Women are leaving the game because of
the lack of a work-life balance. I think we can do a lot more to promote women
as coaches. I think that's really important, particularly when you have a male
head coach.  
  
I think Geno has done a great job. He always has an all-female staff. I think
that's a great way to bring more women into the game.  
  
I think we definitely need more women athletic directors, people doing the
hiring. Head coaches are doing the hiring of their staffs. When you look and
see more men than women on a woman's staff, I think that's not the optics that
I would like to see.  
  
Q. I don't know the answer, but the relationship with other coaches you
played, what is your relationship with Kim? I don't know how much you actually
see her.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, you know, I mean, I like her. We played probably a couple
times back and forth. We played them in the tournament I think last time. We
had two head women's coaches last time we were in the tournament with them. We
don't really have a close relationship.  
  
Q. Both of you did play collegiately, have become I would say iconic
head coaches for your programs. Could you address how big of an impact both of
you have had for a very long time on women's college basketball.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think most of the women's coaches in our game have all
played. I think that's another difference between that and the men on our
staffs. I think most of the women have played college basketball. They
understand the game from the player's perspective.  
  
I think we've seen it change so much. I'm a lot older than Kim. I've seen the
changes from playing, what the Final Fours were like when she was playing and
I was watching. It's been amazing how far we've come. I know we still have a
long way to go. Just the attention, to come to sellouts, to see so many fans
traveling, to see people talking about it, to see celebrities and different
people start to get involved in watching the game. I think we've really grown.  
  
I think it's been great for women. I think you've seen the changes in the
game, how women are so much more skilled. You see someone like Brianna Turner
that can play above the rim a little bit, you're seeing young high school
players that can do that. I think the game is changing. It's still a great
game, a very different game than the men's game, but it's exciting to watch.  
  
Q. You talked about what a whirlwind it was last year, obviously in a
lot of ways unexpected. You had ample time now to prepare for what this season
offered you. Were there some specific ways that you made a point of taking
time to enjoy it, to sort of mark the time along the way, knowing this was
potentially in the very near future for you?  
MUFFET McGRAW: That was the plan, but it failed miserably. We came into the
season with all that on us, No. 1, defending champs. Sometimes defending
champs aren't really because they don't have their team back. But we did. We
truly were the defending champs. It was a burden.  
  
We talked early in December, maybe not early in December, maybe right before
Christmas in December we talked right after the Toledo game. We're just not
having any fun. A lot of times the players will say that, but the coaches were
saying it, too. We all felt like it was way too businesslike. We weren't
enjoying it enough.  
  
I think from then on we started to enjoy it more, they started to enjoy it a
lot more. I still couldn't. It's not a celebration when you're supposed to
win, and you win by 20. Then you're like, 'We didn't play well enough'. Then
you start getting really picky. That was my problem most of the year.  
  
Q. You've said there's sort of maybe a subtle but definitive change from
when Skylar (Diggins) came into this program of confidence, saying we don't
have to be the gritty underdog all the time. That's translated over to you
personally. Is that fair to say or not?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I always love being the underdog. When Skylar came in and
brought that swagger, which is something you don't see in women a lot, women
aren't supposed to have that swagger, she managed to bring it while still
being just a confident person with a little bit of a swagger, with a lot of
charisma, that could get people excited about the game. She had such a passion
for it. The way she wore it was really well done. I thought she role modeled
that really well.  
  
It was contagious. Went over to a lot of the other players who had a little
bit of confidence but not as much as she did. That was great.  
  
When we got Arike she also transformed the way we kind of thought about our
team. This team is a lot more confident than any team we've had in the past. I
think Arike has a lot to do with that.  
  
All of them feel that as women, they often talk about when things happen in
the world, with sexual harassment, domestic abuse, Can you imagine if somebody
tried that on us? There's no way we would put up with that because they have
that strength and confidence. It's very different and really it's great to
see, it's great for the young kids watching our game to see.  
  
Q. What advice do you have for aspiring young women who are interested
in sports in the future?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think the important thing that sports teaches is so many life
skills. You learn how to handle adversity. You learn how to sacrifice, you
learn discipline. If you want to play on a team, sometimes your friends might
be going to the pool or the beach, you might be in the gym working on your
game. It takes a lot of self-discipline, a lot of commitment. If you want to
really be good, you have to be willing to make the sacrifice.  
  
I think it teaches you great things. When you go on in life, a lot of my
former players say, having gone through the experience of the toughness that I
learned, I can pretty much handle anything in my life.  
  
I would say if you want to go for it, you got to give it 100%.  
  
Q. I'm wondering if you were to go back in time and you could maybe
change your job, do you think you would, or do you think you would keep this
job that you have now?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I love my job. I think I have the best job in the world,
working at the University of Notre Dame, which I think is the best university
in the country. I wouldn't change it for anything.  
  
Q. I would like to know how do opportunities like this help the girls on
the team get drafted in the WNBA?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think when you play at a high level, you get on TV a lot
more. People watch your games a lot more. So everybody gets to see kind of the
whole season. They're not just catching one game in the tournament. So I think
the media attention is really good because scouts can't go everywhere across
the country all the time to find you, so being on TV I think really helps us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.

_Tampa, Florida_  
  
Baylor-72, Oregon-67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Baylor. We'll take an opening statement from
Coach Mulkey.  
  
KIM MULKEY: I don't have one. Let's do this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. DiDi, then work your way down [ the panel], did Oregon come as
advertised?  
DIDI RICHARDS: They did come as advertised. I think they're a real hard team
to guard. We stuck to our defense and came out with the win.  
  
LAUREN COX: Like DiDi said, they're tough. They're always moving, always
setting screens, driving, kicking it out, hitting threes. Like she said, we
stuck to our defensive principles and pulled it out.  
  
KALANI BROWN: Like Lauren said, it was pretty hard. You had to keep your head
on a swivel. Towards the second half, I thought we had a better defensive
quarter.  
  
CHLOE JACKSON: Absolutely. They were a great team. Can shoot lights out. We
just had to do our best. We were contesting. I think we got better at that
throughout the game.  
  
Q. Kalani, you hadn't been in close games in a while. People might have
wondered how y'all were going to react. Did you wonder how you were going to
react?  
KALANI BROWN: Definitely. I think LC [Lauren Cox] said something like that at
halftime. We haven't had this in a while. We were like yeah.  
  
We just stuck to it. We've been in situations, so we just kind of, I don't
know, looked back on those other games. We've been challenged before.  
  
Q. Lauren, you fell behind 64-61, then after that you had five straight
defensive stops. Before you got the stops, you got a big bucket. Was that a
play call? Describe the process of that one.  
LAUREN COX: To be honest with you, I don't even remember the play. But we just
get it to whoever can score. I mean, I don't even know what we were running.
Just play ball.  
  
Q. Lauren and DiDi, they missed 12 of their last 13 shots. What changed
or did anything change down the stretch for you guys?  
LAUREN COX: I mean, we might have just worn them out. We like to run. When you
got to run back on defense, stop us in transition, your legs get tired, shots
that usually fall might not fall.  
  
DIDI RICHARDS: Yeah, I agree with Lauren. I felt like they hadn't really
played a team that runs like us. I think we definitely tired them out for the
first couple minutes of the third.  
  
Q. Kalani, senior year, Final Four, now you're about to play for a
national championship. Describe that feeling.  
KALANI BROWN: The feeling is unreal. I'm still in shock. I'm overwhelmed. I'm
just happy to be a part of this team right now.  
  
Q. Chloe, you struggled offensively, didn't get your first basket till
late in the third. You rebounded well, dished out well. For you when you're
going through a stretch like that, did you think about it at all? How did you
get through that?  
CHLOE JACKSON: My coaches and teammates just kept telling me to shoot it, it's
going to fall eventually. My teammates just did a great job scoring, picking
me up basically. It was just my coaches, my teammates, kept telling me to
shoot it, don't lose confidence.  
  
Q. Kalani, two-point game, final minute, they have the ball. You get a
defensive rebound. Lauren goes to the line to make two free throws. Talk about
the defensive rebound, how big it was. Did it feel big in the moment?  
KALANI BROWN: Definitely. I know we had to rebound it and get the ball in our
hands. Coach was definitely emphasizing rebounding. I don't think I did a very
good job of that in the first half. Just to get that rebound made me feel
better about myself.  
  
Q. Lauren, no matter who you play tomorrow night, you're going to play a
team who has played in this game before recently, you guys obviously haven't
had that experience. Do you think that's going to make a difference on Sunday
night?  
LAUREN COX: We've played in big games, too. We've won Big 12 championships,
nine straight years. We've played in big games. Obviously we haven't been to a
Final Four in a while, but we're used to the pressure, used to that big game
moment.  
  
Q. Sometimes when you are knocking teams off with a comfortable margin.
Today did you have more fun in this one because it required you to lock all
the way in till the very end?  
LAUREN COX: I mean, it's always fun playing with this team. We get along so
well. We are always for each other. We don't have any selfish player. Whether
we're winning by 30 or it's a close game like this, we're always cheering each
other on and having fun.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for Coach
Mulkey.  
  
Q. You got outscored 36 to zero from the three-point line and won. Has
that ever happened before?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't know. We don't play that style of ball.  
  
Q. This was an example of old school pounding-it-inside basketball,
wasn't it?  
KIM MULKEY: I think that style that they play is very good for their
personnel. They don't have 6'7" and 6'5" in the paint. I cannot imagine if
they did that they would be shooting that many threes.  
  
You change and you run offenses based on what your kids are capable of doing.
I've been very blessed at Baylor to have the grinders and the Destiny
Williams, the list goes on. I think that's why we get post players, is because
people whose daughters are big, they don't want to sit there and rebound and
kick a ball out to three-point shooters all night, set screens for three-point
shooters all night. I think with the post players, they involve our perimeter
players. We don't have to shoot a lot of threes.  
  
DiDi will cut off our post being double-teamed. Juicy can shoot the three. I
have a couple of three-point shooters on that bench. Their day's coming, that
freshmen class ranked so high.  
  
I just believe the sign of a good coach is you got to figure out what your
personnel is capable of doing. That's what we're going to do.  
  
Q. Your team got five really critical defensive stops in a row in the
fourth quarter. I believe Juicy was on Sabrina that entire time. Describe what
you saw during that time.  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I'm glad you brought Juicy up. I was riding Juicy pretty
hard. She had some terrible turnovers, trying to thread the needle on things.
I just needed to keep challenging her.  
  
Juicy responded. She got two or three big defensive rebounds. She had to get
up and get them on the other end. When DiDi got in foul trouble, I had to make
a decision there. I actually brought her back with seven minutes to go in the
fourth quarter. That's probably not smart, had she fouled out. But, hey,
you're playing in the Final Four. There is no tomorrow.  
  
What we did is we left Juicy on Sabrina and let DiDi go get somebody else. It
moved Cox over to Boley some. Cox, she's so good at helping, Cox would get
down in there and help too much, they'd reverse it, Boley would get a three.  
  
I had to put somebody on her. I didn't want DiDi to guard her with four fouls
that early in the fourth quarter.  
  
Q. On the scoop layup by Chloe, was that a read, a call?  
KIM MULKEY: We tried to call a couple sets, but they sag so much, so she
couldn't turn the corner there. I'm trying to think what we did call because I
think we did. Oh, yes, it was. It's what we call five game. We hadn't run it
the whole game. You guys that have followed us all year, you've seen it.  
  
Bring Cox up for the single screen, put the shooter in the corner. If they
switched, Chloe take her. If they help, then kick it back to Cox at the top.
They kind of got confused, she just went in there and got a layup.  
  
Q. Did you learn anything about your team tonight that you didn't
already know?  
KIM MULKEY: No.  
  
Q. Did you wonder how they were going to do in a tight game?  
KIM MULKEY: I think y'all wondered. I didn't. They all say, they hadn't had
any tight games.  
  
Listen, I'm telling you, our practices are hard. That group that's sitting
over there, NaLyssa Smith, Queen Egbo, every one of those freshmen, they give
that group, they beat them sometimes in practice. Now, they're not running the
same offenses, that old school stuff you're talking about. When I've got Queen
Egbo and NaLyssa in the game together, we don't do that stuff. When we're
scrimmaging, they're running this, these bigs have to guard it.  
  
Our practices prepare us for this moment. Our Dream Team, our Baylor guys that
have to get eligible through clearinghouse, half of them are up in the stands.
Those kids prepare us for this moment.  
  
Q. Talk about the intensity you saw from Kalani in the second half.
Seemed like something we haven't seen in a while.  
KIM MULKEY: She finally started going to the offensive boards. Hey, I'm 6'7",
I'm coming in here, you're going to have to stop me. I tell Kalani all the
time, if she ever could just get mean for 40 minutes, she could be dangerous.
She's a gentle giant. A gentle soul, a sweet kid, she's pleasant. Like Cox,
they want to look to pass the ball. I want them to demand the ball, dominate
it and then pass. That's not their personality.  
  
I have to be real careful how much I challenge them because you want them to
be unselfish, but at the same time you probably saw it tonight, there was a
time Kalani was down deep and turned and go score the ball.  
  
But she did. She exerted herself there in the second half.  
  
Q. When you face Oregon, obviously containing Sabrina is a big part of
things. What was the key to keeping her in check at the end of the game?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, DiDi Richards and Juicy Landrum, just man-to-man defense,
getting over screens, not getting hung up. Then the post player who was
setting the screen, whether it was Cox or Kalani, guarding that post player.
You'll be very willing to help if she wants to drive.  
  
I just think DiDi has length. She's 6'1" out there. She's bugging you,
stripping you. She's just active. Listen, I hadn't even had time to look at
what Sabrina did. All I know is they're just hard to guard. She had 18, 6 and
4. I mean, to me that's a good job.  
  
I thought Erin Boley hurt us. I thought she really hit some shots. They would
set some flair screens for her, and we would be ball watching. She had scored
them on Juicy early, then on Cox late. That's a very good basketball team.
They're very difficult to defend.  
  
I thought if we held them below 39.9 is what we want to hold people to from
the field. I looked, for the game, I think they shot 36.8. You're going to win
a lot of basketball games if you do that.  
  
Q. On the moment when they went up 64-61, you called a timeout, what was
the message there? How big was Lauren's basket?  
KIM MULKEY: It was very big. I'd like to tell you that I came over there, man,
I drew up the perfect play, said the magical words. Heat of the moment.  
  
You know what I remember about that timeout? Kalani Brown opening her mouth
and saying, Juicy, we got this, we are all right. We got six something minutes
to be played. That's all that needed to be said. She's a senior. There was
nothing to draw up. There were no magical words to say. Go play.  
  
I thought late in the game, we got the ball in the hands of the people that
needed to take the shots. There was one that DiDi took. You want DiDi to have
that confidence. But DiDi is not the offensive threat that the rest of them
are. But I love that she had the confidence and wasn't afraid to take it. That
probably came from the fact she scored early for us, she was hitting her free
throws, been on an unbelievable run here in the tournament, she scores double
figures tonight.  
  
That's the only one late in the game where I might have said, Get the ball in
the hands of Cox or Kalani.  
  
Q. You said it all year, winning is tough, getting to the Final Four is
even tougher. Now you're on the brink of a third national championship for
Baylor. What is that like? What did you tell the girls after the game?  
KIM MULKEY: Just asked them why they came to Baylor. All of them screamed, To
play for championships. Well, you're getting to play for a championship. We've
won 20 Big 12 championships in my tenure there, two national championships.
Those kids in that locker room get to play for a championship.  
  
It's not just those kids in the locker room, really it's all those other kids
that are sitting in the stands that played for this program, that are playing
for that championship, as well. 'Perseverance' was a big word. We persevered.
We're playing Sunday. Y'all be here. I know you will.  
  
Q. Does it even matter who shows up in a colored jersey Sunday?  
KIM MULKEY: No, but I bet it's going to be somebody that has blue in their
uniform.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 5, 2019

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Arike Ogunbowale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32683)

### [Jessica Shepard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32622)

### [Brianna Turner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28843)

  
_Tampa, Florida_  
  
Notre Dame-81, UConn-76  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Notre Dame. We'll take an opening statement from
coach.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: That was an amazing second half. First half I thought we really
struggled to score. The second half really just caught fire. I think we played
our normal game in the third quarter.  
  
But I thought Brianna Turner was absolutely outstanding on defense. She now
has the blocked shot record at Notre Dame, beating Ruth Riley. So proud of
her. She really single-handedly kept us in the game the first half. She had so
many key blocked shots.  
  
Arike in the second half did what Arike does. She had some huge screens, made
some great plays, and then free throws down the stretch.  
  
Jessica Shepard, what an amazing game. 20 and 13. Bri, 15 and 15. We felt like
we needed to rebound in order to win and I thought we did that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Arike, seems the fourth quarter you take over games. What was your
mindset down nine?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think teammates talking to me. We said we had to get
defensive stops. I think we really as a team picked up our defense. We were
scoring, but we weren't giving stops. We were trading buckets. Once we started
getting stops, started getting scores, that's when we went on a run.  
  
Q. Brianna, you weren't on the floor with your team last year. Being out
here this year, what was your mindset heading into the game?  
BRIANNA TURNER: I was just really excited and focused, ready to go. I have had
injuries in the past. I really kind of put that in the back of my head. Always
looking forward.  
  
Really looked forward to this game, being able to compete out there.  
  
Q. Jess, for you to be out there 40 minutes, play every second of this
game, to finish strong the way you did, is there an extra bit of significance
for that for you given conditioning has been so central to the work you've put
in?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think strength coaches, I think the coaching staff just
does a great job of getting us in shape. When it does come March and April
we're ready to go out there and play. I think everyone played pretty high
minutes today.  
  
Q. Jessica, you come out of the timeout and go down nine, it doesn't
look like anybody is panicking.  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think for us as players, that was definitely the feeling.
We had coach a little bit stressed (smiling). I think we knew that as long as
we kept our composure, we just needed to get stops, we needed to get good
offensive shots. I think Bri came up huge in the fourth quarter.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I agree exactly what Jess said.  
  
BRIANNA TURNER: I think the maturity of this team, being mostly upperclassmen
playing tonight, just making sure we're staying relaxed, not getting too
anxious. We knew against, like last week, coming out versus Stanford, coming
out we were down, able to come back. Coach jokes we're a second half team. We
knew we had to come back, whatever it took, no matter how many points it took.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Has this team improved from last year or do you feel it still needs
some work?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I think Brianna gives us just a totally different look.
What she can do defensively, she can switch out and guard the point guard, she
can certainly guard the post. She's a shot blocking presence inside. I think
it makes us a little more dominant inside, which won't be so dominant against
Baylor because they're equally talented in the post.  
  
We've had the advantage I think in a lot of games with our size. I don't
expect that we're going to have that tomorrow or Sunday.  
  
Q. The fourth quarter seems to be when Arike shines the brightest. Such
a wonderful commentary yesterday about women empowerment. You have two women
in the finals first time since 2012. Mean anything to you especially?  
MUFFET McGRAW: The same two, I think, right?  
  
I thought it was great to have a chance to say some things. But this weekend
is really all about basketball right now. So we want to really focus on that.
But I am excited to have two women in the final.  
  
Arike just really got off to a slow start I thought in a lot of ways. She
probably feels like she has to carry us because she's our leading scorer. She
tries to do a little bit too much early, then sometimes not enough. I thought
she really settled in at halftime. I think her teammates really help her. They
continue to encourage her. She really came alive in the second half.  
  
Q. Players joke about how stressed you are. Do you ever wonder if the
magic isn't going to show up in the fourth quarter?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, that's the cause of my stress (laughter).  
  
I get so frustrated because it just seems so easy. We're man-to-man, they're
in zone. It's like they lose their focus, they're not paying attention, Katie
Lou is going off for three after three after three, they can't find her.
Offensively we call a play, we run something else. We looked a little out of
sorts. I worry a lot.  
  
All of a sudden shots start falling, we get a defensive stop, make a layup. We
look at the scoreboard, went on an 8-0 run.  
  
Q. You go down 62-55, did you take the timeout because you thought it
was slipping away or did you just want to stop Connecticut's momentum?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think that was where we were in the wrong defense, so we felt
like we really needed to talk about it again, to talk about we were supposed
to be in man-to-man, we needed to find Katie Lou, just to kind of reaffirm
what we were talking about at the start of the fourth quarter timeout.  
  
Q. Jess has talked about coming here to win championships. That's the
reason she came to Notre Dame. With the way your offense rewards facilitators
out of the front court, in some ways it seems like she's kind of the perfect
player for Notre Dame. Do you view her that way? Do you view that as an
indispensable part of what's gotten you here?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yes, Jess is indispensable to what we do. She fits perfectly
into our system. She is someone that loves to pass the ball. She probably
wants to be a point guard. She went coast-to-coast on a steal. She is a great
facilitator on who the post is. Over a hundred assists throughout the year.
She makes our offense go. Bri can go down and be on the block, not worry about
anything else because Jess is a great high-post player.  
  
Q. In Philadelphia there is a term called the Philly guard. Your girls
epitomize that, don't they?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Marina (Mabrey), for sure. She comes by it very naturally. She
is so feisty and so competitive, just never, ever quits. She missed a lot of
shots in the first half. She was fearless in the second half. Feisty on
defense. She's the one in the huddle that's really getting everybody going.  
  
Q. Jess, she can be 6'4 ", facilitate. How does that translate to the
next level? What kind of player do you see her being in the W?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think she'll be a great player at the next level. She can
shoot threes. In our system she doesn't get a chance to do that a lot. This
year she shot a lot more jumpers from the three-point line. Her free-throw
percentage has really improved. I think she's proven she can face up and score
in the WNBA.

_Tampa, Florida_  
  
Baylor-72, Oregon-67  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Oregon. We'll take an opening statement from
Coach Graves.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: First of all, I do want to congratulate Baylor on a great game.
They played like champions today, deserved to move on. That's a great
basketball team.  
  
We tried our best. We worked hard. In the end, they made the plays and we
didn't. But I'm really proud of our team, no question about it. We certainly
belonged to be here. We had our chances down the stretch. Just don't know if
we ever really got kind of our game going. We saw bits and pieces of it here
and there.  
  
Credit to a really good defensive team. Our field goal percentages were much
lower than normal, we turned it over 13 times, three more than our average. A
little out of sync. Ultimately that cost us.  
  
Credit Baylor. Again, I just want to say I'm really proud of my team. They
took us on a great journey this year. I got a feeling when you look at who we
have up here that this is a team that's going to be back.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Erin, did Baylor's size just wear you down over the course of the
game?  
ERIN BOLEY: Obviously they have two great post players. I think we worked hard
throughout the course of the game. We did what we could on both ends of the
floor.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: No, I mean, they have two of the best post players, obviously
very tall, very athletic. They were beasts inside. But we had to adjust and we
didn't.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: I wouldn't say they wore us down. Obviously they did a good
job, yeah.  
  
Q. Sabrina, did you feel like you were too reliant on the three-pointer
tonight?  
SABRINA IONESCU: No, I don't think we were too reliant. Those are shots we
usually make. They were good looks. I don't think we really forced too many
threes up. We didn't hit them tonight, but we're going to learn from it.  
  
Q. Sabrina, this team has made incremental but positive steps forward.
Talk about the journey, how difficult it's been or how joyous it's been, to
get here and come up short?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I mean, we continue to learn. We were put in positions
we haven't been put before. But I think this is just going to make us more
hungry. We got to this stage that our program has never got to. So I think
learning through this game and learning through the previous years, it's just
going to get us ready to want to come back.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I know you've been focused on this game. A great season for
your team. Have you given any thought to next season?  
SABRINA IONESCU: No.  
  
Q. Satou, what is going to stick with you from tonight's game and carry
you through the off-season?  
SATOU SABALLY: Personally I'm going to mature from this game. I knew before
every possession matters, it's going to come down to the important shots,
important drives. I mean, most importantly don't foul stupid. I don't know, I
got to be there for my team. That's going to stick with me. That's going to
hurt for a while.  
  
Yeah, it's a learning process. I'm definitely going to learn from this game by
just the little things.  
  
Q. Sabrina, when DiDi Richards picked up her fourth foul, they had to
switch, did that open you up to do a little bit more on the offensive end?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, yeah. Juicy [Landram] is obviously a smaller guard. I
think that allowed me to penetrate, see the floor a little bit better and hit
some midrange shots.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for Coach
Graves.  
  
Q. Coach, tough moment. Didn't shoot the ball as well as you'd like.
What do you tell your team after a game like this and season like this?  
KELLY GRAVES: I told them I'm really proud of them. It always hurts right now,
as it should. It hurts when you put a lot of energy and a lot of yourself into
it.  
  
I know all our team had a chance to voice how much -- how great they feel
about Maite [Cazorla] and Oti [Gildon], our two seniors, who had tremendous
careers. They're ones that really got this thing started.  
  
We're going to look back on this as a tremendous season and another step. It
always hurts. It does and it should. But this was a tremendous season. I think
what we've done for basketball in the state of Oregon is incredible. Again,
you see all three of these players up here, a lot more, this is a program
that's not going anywhere. It's only a program that's going to get better.  
  
Q. Was the game plan to trade their twos for your threes or is that just
how it worked out?  
KELLY GRAVES: To some degree. You saw, we actually tried to make some baskets
around the basket. It didn't go so well. Unfortunately for us, we couldn't get
Ruthy [Hebard] involved as much as we wanted to. That hurt us.  
  
32 three-pointers is too many for us. We're more comfortable in the 25 to 28
range. I just thought we shot a few too many, a couple not so good ones. But
that's what they were giving us tonight. If we have a normal shooting night,
those threes for twos are more successful.  
  
But I don't think that's where the game was lost. I thought we had a couple of
defensive breakdowns late. Even though the boards were relatively within
reason, they made some key offensive rebounds late.  
  
Q. Satou talked about learning something. Do you think there were
lessons learned tonight that you only learn if you play in this game?  
KELLY GRAVES: Sure, yeah. I don't know exactly which ones, I think we've got
multiple lessons we can learn tonight. I think with her being in foul trouble,
any time you're in foul trouble, it kind of changes who are, how you play. We
want to be aggressive, we want her to be aggressive. When she can't because of
foul trouble, that kind of hurts her game, maybe on her heels a little bit too
much.  
  
But, no, again, I think we just got to get here to take that next step. You
know what, we were in a position to win the game. That's all I can ask. It was
a couple of possessions late in the game. But we had a chance to win the game.
Credit them, they made those plays down the stretch.  
  
I thought in a close game, it might favor us because we've been in a lot of
them, and they haven't in quite a while. Now I see why. They are really,
really good.  
  
Q. When you think back on this game, with Ruthy having to battle through
what she's battled through over the latter part of this season, can you help
but wonder how things might have gone if you had Ruthy at 100%?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, I can't play that game. I mean, Ruthy gave us 100% of what
she has. What she has, I don't know. But whatever she has, I just know her.
She gave all of it.  
  
Again, it's never just that one person. It was collective. It was the team. We
just didn't get it done tonight, bottom line. I really liked our shot there to
tie the game. We just kind of played through that possession. I think we got
exactly the shot that we wanted, and it just didn't go. And that happens.  
  
Q. Got to have some solace in the fact that Baylor is the No. 1 team and
you played them down to the wire, nobody else did. You could have easily won.
Does that kind of help a little bit?  
KELLY GRAVES: No (smiling). It still hurts. We'll have a chance to look back
on this and say and realize that this was an incredible season, incredible
season. We've got a lot coming back, you guys. This is going to be a team
that's loaded. Where we ultimately got hurt tonight was some depth inside.
We've got Nyara Sabally, who will be one of the best players in the country,
sitting on that bench who loves to bang, likes to be in those kind of moments.  
  
Hey, we made the most out of what we had this year. You saw eight players, not
very often you have eight players in a uniform at a Final Four game. But they
gave us everything they had. I applaud them for it. I'm really proud of them.
I love each and every one of them.  
  
Q. Cox and Brown, how did you defend them overall as a team? They really
sunk down offensively and tried to get the ball inside.  
KELLY GRAVES: You know, if you had told me that we would have only lost the
rebound battle by five, held them to 72, I'd like my chances. I thought we did
a lot of good things defensively. They were the ones that killed us. We got
killed in points in the paint. That normally doesn't happen. We got doubled in
points in the paint.  
  
Yeah, sure, that hurts. But those all count, too. We needed to make a few more
threes. We weren't going to exchange them, but that usually works in our favor
and it didn't tonight.  
  
Q. What did you like about [Satou] Sabally tonight and what are some
growing edges for the future?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, Satou has just matured right before our eyes. Seems like
she gets better and better each and every game. I thought this year she took
her game from just kind of a spot-up shooter, a straight-line driver, now she
can create a little bit, continues to be a great shooter, added a little bit
of post-up. She's much better on the boards this year. I think for her to
continue to grow as a player, she's now got to be a creator for others, not
just for herself. She will. That's all natural development.  
  
I think you're seeing a future star there. I mean, Satou I don't think was
herself tonight, but she still put up pretty good numbers. She'll be the first
to tell you she was real disappointed. The other area I thought she made
advances defensively. She was a big liability last year. Not any more.  
  
Q. In Portland you said the atmosphere was electric. How much is this
going to help you recruiting down the road?  
KELLY GRAVES: I don't know. Do you have any leads (smiling)?  
  
Hey, listen, yeah, I think it will. I think it will. My staff continues to
work really hard. I think we've proven that this is a program that's on the
rise. We'll have some staying power with everything that we're given, the
resources we have at the University of Oregon. The administration and support
we get, the support we get from our community. We still have really, really
good players on our team. We've got really, really good players that are
coming.  
  
No, we're not going anywhere. This is a program that is going to be around.
Hey, listen, now we don't have to say 'next year.' This is the first time
we're here. If we can get here again or sometime soon, now we'll have a little
bit of experience and that always helps.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## April 5, 2019

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Katie Lou Samuelson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30887)

### [Napheesa Collier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33298)

### [Christyn Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37111)

  
_Tampa, Florida_  
  
Notre Dame-81, UConn-76  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by UConn. We'll take an opening statement from
Coach Auriemma.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I mean, obviously we're incredibly disappointed that we
didn't win the game. But we played a great team. They played really, really
well when they had to.  
  
We knew going in that we had to make a bunch of shots. When we went in at
halftime, after holding them to 29, it's now 30-29, then you know they're not
going to stay -- then we still had a chance. We just weren't good enough
tonight to do it. I mean, it's not anything other than they were just better
than us tonight. They were better than us when the season started and they
were better than us tonight.  
  
They had more good players play better and contribute more than we did. That's
just the way the world is. They deserved to win, and we didn't do quite enough
to win. That's it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Katie Lou, in the last couple of minutes, what did you need to do
that you couldn't get done?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: We needed to step up, make big plays, get stops. They
just made more big plays than we did.  
  
Q. The third quarter you had was awesome. 15 points. Did coach say
anything to you at halftime to get you going offensively?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: I think he didn't have to say anything specifically. I
know what I need to do better in times like that. I didn't do enough in that
first half.  
  
Q. Katie Lou, you were up nine in the fourth quarter. Did you feel you
had the game in control then?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: I mean, yeah, we felt confident, as we should be, in
ourselves. We knew that they make big plays. When it came down to it, we
didn't get the stops we needed.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Yeah, being up nine in the fourth quarter is a good position
to be in. We did feel confident in that moment. Then after that, we weren't
making, as Katie Lou said, the points we needed to and maintain the lead and
extend the lead.  
  
CHRISTYN WILLIAMS: Like they said, we felt confident, but they made some big
plays at the end. Unfortunately we weren't making the shots we needed to make,
so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for Coach
Auriemma.  
  
Q. Arike in the fourth quarter had 14 points or something. That's her
time to shine during the NCAA tournament, a fourth-quarter player. Is that
fair to say?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I mean, I don't think it was any mystery who was going to
be taking the majority of their shots in the fourth quarter. That's the way
they've always played since Arike has been there.  
  
She still has to make those shots and she did. She's an almost impossible
matchup one-on-one, you know. We knew that going in. We knew that they were
going to score X-number of points. We knew we had to make shots and we didn't.  
  
I thought we did everything else right, but shots we've been making all year
long, we didn't make them. Like I said, that happens at the Final Four.
Everything changes, you know.  
  
Unfortunately we didn't have enough. We didn't have enough. They had so many
layups that we can't get. A bunch of the layups we did get, we didn't make.
They're able to get layups almost any time they want. We just don't have the
ability to do that.  
  
Q. Could you reflect a little bit about Napheesa and Katie Lou, five
losses in their entire career, yet disappointments at the Final Four.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, five losses, and three of them are here, huh? We said
that in the locker room. It's not apparent sometimes while you're teammates
with Lou [Katie Lou Samuelson] and Napheesa, it's not apparent until after
they're gone, how much they did for you, how much they contributed to your
success, how much you're going to miss their presence every single day, on the
court, off the court, doesn't matter.  
  
Losing a game is part of life. You lose. You get beat. Whatever the case may
be. But there's always tomorrow. There's always another game. There's always
another season to get ready for.  
  
The thing that stings the most in your locker room, if you've ever played, is
you look around and there's some people in the locker room that aren't going
to be back next year. That hurts way more than the loss. That hurts way more
than the loss. When you realize that two people that you've shared so much
with are not going to be around any more.  
  
It's especially true with these two because for such a young team that we
have, such an inexperienced team in a lot of ways, those two really had a huge
burden to carry all year long.  
  
You saw us at times today where we looked like the best team in the country.
Then you saw us at times today where it was a real, real struggle for us.
Those two, they bore the burden of that every single day, every single game. I
can't be more proud of kids than I am those two.  
  
Q. What did you think you specifically needed to do when you were up
nine to seal the game?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, when we got up nine, two things we knew were going to
happen. One, they're going to pass it to Arike and she's going to go one-on-
one and score. Two, they're going to throw it into the post, whoever Megan is
guarding, because there's a huge mismatch in there. That's exactly what they
did.  
  
I've always said coming in here, all the time, there's certain things that
when you have a certain kind of team, there's certain things that the other
team can do to you that you don't have anything that you can come back with
and say, Well, I know how we can get a stop, we'll trap them.  
  
Well, that doesn't work against these guys because they always find the open
guy. It's either for a layup or a wide-open three.  
  
You have to be able to get stops playing one-on-one. When we had Liv [Olivia
Nelson-Ododa] in the game, it was much more difficult for them to get those
shots. When we have Liv in the game, our offense isn't as good as it can be
yet. That kid is going to be a dynamite player. She really stepped up today,
her and Christyn.  
  
But, yeah, we knew coming in there's things Notre Dame does that we don't have
an answer for. I've had those kind of teams a couple times (smiling).  
  
Q. Two of your players go 40 minutes, one 39, one 38. Did you feel
fatigue was an issue in the fourth quarter? Because of that, did you play a
little more zone than normal?  
GENO AURIEMMA: No. We were going to play a variety of defenses. I thought
there was a long stretch where zone was our best defense. I don't think a lot
of their guys sat on the bench either. So this was a game where those last
five minutes, somebody was going to make plays and somebody was going to win.
It happened to be them.  
  
I don't know that there's anything that we could say we're going to kick
ourselves because we should have done this. The shots we got were pretty much
the shots we wanted to get. When was the last time you saw Lou miss a wide-
open layup in the line? Or Napheesa air ball a seven-footer? Probably hasn't
done that in four years.  
  
We got the shots that we wanted. But, again, against a team like Notre Dame,
you only get so many chances and you need to capitalize at every one of your
chances. When we played them at their place, we did. When we played them here
tonight, we didn't.  
  
The first half, you can't defend them any better than we defended them that
first half. They probably went in the locker room saying, We played lousy and
we're down one. We went in the locker room saying, We played lousy, but we're
still up one.  
  
That should have been a 15-point game at halftime.  
  
Q. The shots you described that didn't go in, is it different if last
year or the year before goes differently than that, it's just all about X's
and O's, or is this just a moment where what's happened the last two years
shows up in the last two minutes of this game?  
GENO AURIEMMA: No, I don't think what happened last year had anything to do
with what happens here. I just think X's and O's is way overrated, you know. I
know some of the dumbest coaches in the world that have won a lot of games
because they got the best players.  
  
To me, X's and O's is you get your players in the right position. If they make
shots, then you're going to win. If they don't make shots, you're not going to
win. Whether it's in high school, college, pros, it doesn't matter. You have
to make plays.  
  
It's not about who has the best offense or who has the best scheme. Two years
ago they threw the ball to Brianna Turner as much as they did today, and she
wouldn't make those shots, she wouldn't make those free throws either. You got
to put yourself in a position to be successful, then you got to finish the
play. It's quite simple.  
  
Sometimes we try to make the game really, really complicated. It's not. It's
not complicated. Most teams are going to give you a chance to win the game.
They gave us a chance to win the game, and we weren't good enough to win it.
There's nothing wrong with that. They were better than us.  
  
They still had to win it. They still had to make those shots. When they were
down nine, they could have missed the next five shots, we would have went up
17, but they didn't. Why? Because they're defending national champions, they
have five All-Americans who are really, really good.  
  
Like I said, I remember being in that situation a couple times (smiling).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Thank you.

## April 4, 2019

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Kalani Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30449)

### [Chloe Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32657)

### [Lauren Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33249)

  
_Tampa, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Kalani, what does it mean to actually be here at the Final Four?  
KALANI BROWN: I'm happy. I couldn't be happier. I'm just excited to be here.  
  
Q. Lauren and Kalani, when you look at the contrasting styles of play,
what you like to do, what Oregon likes to do, almost feels like old school
versus new school basketball. How would you describe the matchup between you
guys?  
LAUREN COX: We're more of an inside-out kind of team. We have two big post
players inside. They're more of a, like, 41 team, one player inside, four at
one end.  
  
KALANI BROWN: I mean, she pretty much covered it.  
  
CHLOE JACKSON: Just what she said. A 4-1 team. We use more a post game. Our
game is pretty much ran through our post.  
  
Q. Chloe, I can remember talking to you earlier this year, how excited
you were about everything that's happened this season. I know you still have a
lot you want to accomplish. Can you put in perspective what this journey has
been like for you coming here and everything that you've done here?  
CHLOE JACKSON: I would say it's been a dream come true, just like I couldn't
have written a better story, honestly. Came here, wanted to win, to get to a
Final Four. We achieved that. We won the Big 12, got to a Final Four.  
  
We're not content. Just want to keep pushing, stay focused to win a
championship.  
  
Q. Coach has been here many times. What type of advice have the coaches
given you, enjoy yourself, enjoy the moment, but also it's a business trip, as
well?  
LAUREN COX: She's just trying to keep us focused. Our motto this year is:
Together to Tampa. She said we can't be content with just getting here. We
have to stay focused and want to make it all the way.  
  
Q. Lauren, with the 4-1, playing what they have, does that make you have
to get out, stretch out? How much does it help that you already played that
kind of team before?  
LAUREN COX: Yeah, I'm going to have to go out and guard on the perimeter some,
guard the three-point shot. I've been doing that all year. That definitely
helps to have that experience.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll let the ladies go. Thank you.  
  
We'll take questions from Coach Mulkey.  
  
Q. Would you agree with the characterizations, this could be looked at
as old school versus new school basketball?  
KIM MULKEY: No. You play your personnel. I'm 6'7" and 6'4", bring them
outside, tell Kalani you go outside and start shooting threes.  
  
You change, you adapt to whatever your personnel is doing. I have two freshmen
posts that are more athletic. You don't see us run the same stuff when they go
in the game. I guess you could call me old, if you want to. You can call me
old-fashioned. I'm good with all of it. I just play to win.  
  
Q. What do you remember about the first Final Four? How was it compared
to now?  
KIM MULKEY: I think that first banner you see out there was 1982, and I was a
part of that team. I don't remember a whole lot about a lot of things, but was
it Cheyney State, Vivian Stringer. Older than me (laughter).  
  
Deborah Wideman, that name familiar to you? Her brother is Dennis Rodman. She
and I came off the bench, we were co-MVPs. I always had assists at the other
end to Rodman and Lawrence. That's what I remember, is who we played, what
they did to us, and how effective I was in breaking the press.  
  
Q. There's been so much attention on your two bigs in the past couple
games. How important is Chloe Jackson to this team? Obviously with switching
her position earlier this year, what was the biggest adjustment or the
adjustment she had to spend the most time working on?  
KIM MULKEY: We're in the Final Four. We don't have a true point guard. Imagine
starting your season anticipating that you're going to have this great point
guard, anticipate you got to get rid of your quarterback in football, you have
to take a wide receiver, put them at quarterback. That's what we had to do.  
  
I just think that experience that she had has helped her. She doesn't get too
high, she doesn't get too low. The thing I had to do was work extra hard. I
didn't anticipate that. When I say that, it's every day. I had to teach her
everything about our defense, everything about offense. She's responsible for
everybody on that floor. Her personality is not where she's a big talker, so I
had to teach her to open her mouth, communicate. Had to do it quickly. That
kid, what she has done, is amazing.  
  
The thing I didn't want to do is take away her scoring ability. She -- in my
opinion, she's one of the best midrange shooters that I've ever coached. I
would have to think in the country. When Chloe misses a shot, you're
surprised. She keeps shooting, and she hits those big shots in the clutch for
you.  
  
Yes, we certainly are known for our bigs throughout probably my coaching
career at Baylor, but we also have some pretty good darn good perimeter
players. We had some outstanding role players. Then you take the Fab Five
freshmen that sit over there, the No. 1 recruiting class in the country. When
you mix all that together, they're happy, they like each other, that's a
blessing this day and time.  
  
Q. Kim, can you talk a little bit about your journey over the last few
years, what it means getting back to a Final Four. UConn is here every year,
Notre Dame has been here a lot. For you, the journey to get a team back here,
what it means to you.  
KIM MULKEY: '05 when we won the first national championship, it was the first
time Baylor had been to a Final Four. I sat at that press conference and said,
Enjoy it, I don't know if we'll ever be back. It's just so hard.  
  
We knew we were creating a monster and we had to keep feeding that monster.
What you try to do is try to remain relevant, you try to continue to recruit.
That championship opened doors for us in recruiting. We came back in '12,
excuse me, '10, we went to San Antonio, lost to UConn in the semifinals. Came
back again in '12, went 40-0. We lost some really heartbreaking tournament
games. But I walked off that floor realizing that that team just played
unbelievable. It wasn't like we gave it away. Wasn't like we played bad. It
just happens. That's why they call it March Madness.  
  
You just keep plugging away, you keep working. We're here again.  
  
I don't look at it like, Oh, my gosh, it's been seven years. I look at it
like, Baylor is still an elite program, they're in their fourth Final Four.
Coaches coach a lifetime and never make it. I just don't tend to put a
timeframe on it. I just want to always be one of the teams talked about that
has a chance to be there every year. I think we always have been that type of
program.  
  
Q. Some of your Oregon ties. What do you remember about winning the
championship in Eugene back in the day before it was the NCAA tournament?
Also, facing Oregon in 2005 on the way to the Final Four, what do you remember
about that as well?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, Coach Barmore probably won't want me to tell you all this. I
think Michelle did a story about the way you used to coach and the way you
have to coach now.  
  
Let's go back to Eugene when I was playing. I think it was USC. Who did we
beat in the semifinal? Or was it Tennessee?  
  
Q. USC, then Tennessee.  
KIM MULKEY: Okay.  
  
I say this, so don't make him out to be a bad guy, but this is the kind of
coach he was. What was the score? The semifinal? It was pretty convincing. We
won 16 points. We're excited. We get in that locker room, and they had trash
cans. I'm telling you, he let those trash cans fly. We just sat there. We're
getting ready to play for a national championship and you're throwing trash
cans.  
  
But we loved it. He knew we were that close to a national championship, and it
was just the intensity of the moment. What's wrong with that? Right? He got
our attention. Here I am 56 years old and I remember the moment. We can laugh
about it, talk about how wonderful it was. But he got us ready for that
championship game.  
  
Then we go out and win a national championship. I remember people saying,
Getting mean in Eugene, whatever that meant.  
  
Then the second time, we played (Michigan State) to win the first national
championship in '05. Things I remember, Chelsea Whitaker had to go get IVs.
She just sweat a lot. Her body would just cramp. That's your starting point
guard that we're having to nourish back to health to win a couple games there.  
  
Bales was your coach, right? Those are things I remember. I can't tell you
specifics of the game, but the excitement of '05 for our school and our
program started out there, and it just continued onto the RCA Dome in
Indianapolis, which is no longer there.  
  
Q. Geno said of Notre Dame, I think we're playing the best team in the
country. Is that wheelhouse for you?  
KIM MULKEY: No. Look, timing is everything in life. Timing is everything. We
just kept winning, everybody else would lose a conference game or conference
tournament game. So we were the fortunate ones to be selected as the overall
No. 1 seed. It really doesn't motivate me. It doesn't offend me.  
  
Q. From afar, everyone talks about Muffet and Geno. As a competitor
yourself, can you understand where competition, striving to be the best,
creates animosity?  
KIM MULKEY: Sure. Listen, we would all be best friends if we weren't coaching.
Hell, some of us may be married to each other if we weren't coaching, right?
You have the same interests, you know. But when you're coaching your
respective universities, it's not like you're kissing your sister and loving
on them every day.  
  
Usually type A personality coaches butt heads from what we do for a living.
You know, it's the nature of the successful coaches, not just in women's
basketball. You can go to pro football. You know, it may come across as
personal sometimes, but honestly if we weren't doing what we're doing, we'd
all be best friends. I really believe that.  
  
Q. Would you have been friends without the coaching ties?  
KIM MULKEY: Probably. Probably. Because we would have no reason to not like
each other. We would talk sports. Some would go sit around, drink beer
together. I'm not a drinker, so that would bore the heck out of me. I'd drink
a lot of Cokes with them. I just wouldn't see why you wouldn't get along if
you weren't competitors.  
  
Q. You talked about the five freshmen. When you're recruiting a class
like that, how much, with today's age with transfers, how much do you talk
about playing time coming in? How big have they been with this team?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't talk playing time. I talk about the position I'm
recruiting you to play. I talk to them about a personality. I talk to them
about how tough their freshman year will be at any major university. Then I
let them ask any questions they want to ask about me. There is nothing off
limits with me. That's the truth.  
  
You would be amazed at some of the questions I get asked. Can't guarantee
playing time. Can't guarantee championships. Can't guarantee that you're going
to get drafted. That's out of my control. But what I do guarantee those
families is that I will get your daughter home with a college degree. I don't
know how long it will take, but she will leave Baylor. The only reason you
wouldn't get a college degree from Baylor is if you walk away from it, or if I
have to dismiss you from the team, or you transfer. That's about the only
thing I tell them. My gift back to you and your family is that college degree.  
  
Obviously I think you're good enough to play for me or I wouldn't be
recruiting you. But you can't talk playing time with people. That's where you
get in trouble.  
  
Those five freshmen, unbelievable. If you haven't seen it, I hope they post
it. Queen Egbo was just dunking the ball in practice. Aquira DeCosta was
tipping in dunks and I'm sitting there with my mouth wide open. Where has that
been all year? Those kids came to Baylor to experience this, to win Big 12
championships. They knew what was in front of them. Their unselfishness of
watching them work every day, beat each other in practice, cheer each other on
in the game, it's a lost form of team chemistry right now with all the
transfer stuff you have going on because it's all about the welfare of the
student-athlete this day and time.  
  
To have 12 of them on the team that pull for each other, you don't have to sit
there and worry about playing time, all that stuff, man, that makes it fun.  
  
Q. I know Lauren has been Big 12 Defensive Player of the Year last two
years. She's one of the best post defenders in college. Talk about her
evolution. She came in good, but seems like she's really expanded how good of
a defensive player she is.  
KIM MULKEY: Michelle, you're right, but I'm going to go one further than that.
I think she's one of the best defenders at any position. She can defend any
position on the floor if I asked her to.  
  
That's what separates her from other people who think their kid is the best
defensive player in the country. You may be, down the block as a post player,
but can you go out there and guard a three player, guard the point guard if I
get in trouble with my point guard defender.  
  
That kid can play any position on the court. She can defend any position on
the court. She alters shots. She has a coach's mentality and understands and
can see things happen before they happen. She'll put herself in a position to
be a great help defender, help a teammate. She will communicate with a
teammate. She understands the game probably as good as any player that I have
ever coached.  
  
Q. The assist-to-turnover ratio, is that something that's been better
than average this year for you guys? Why has it been that way?  
KIM MULKEY: I think you start with Chloe Jackson and her unselfishness. Chloe
can score the ball and does score for us. Chloe has a knack to get everybody
else involved. We preach it all the time, that I'm going to take you out of
the game if you turn the ball over and you don't play defense. I'm going to
put you back in at some point, but if you don't take them out, how do you ever
fix that? How do you ever correct it? Tell them in a timeout to quit turning
the ball over? That goes in one ear and out the other. But if you put them on
the bench, they'll remember it.  
  
It's not something that you overemphasize with this team at the beginning of
the year. Like I said, we don't have a true point guard. I didn't know if we
were going to be a team that threw it all over the gym, we were going to be
wild. Quickly I learned Chloe doesn't play like that. Then DiDi and Juicy can
relieve her when she needs a breather or when she's trapped and they throw it
to one of the wing players. They can bring the ball up the floor for us. Then
you have to know that all they do is throw the ball inside. How difficult is
it to get the ball to a 6'7" kid and a 6'5" kid? So that helps as well.  
  
Q. I'm curious about the number 7. I don't know if you've given much
thought to it, but you won in '05, '12, this is '19. Have you given much
thought to that?  
KIM MULKEY: No, I haven't. But if you say so, I believe ya, okay? I don't give
much thought to it. But, yeah, that is kind of unique, isn't it? I don't know.  
  
Q. Can you talk about Oregon's offensive threat.  
KIM MULKEY: I won't tell you my plan, is that fair enough? I will tell you
that it all starts with Sabrina. What a talent. What a joy to watch. If you're
not having to play against her...  
  
The thing that I love more than her talent is I love the way she competes.
She's got that umph in her. She makes everybody around her better. She's just
a special, special talent.  
  
That's where I start and probably stop in answering your question. All those
kids know she makes them better. She'll get the ball to them in spots where it
makes them look good. She certainly is not the only great player on that team
but it starts and stops with her.  
  
Q. Can you describe DiDi's impact during the tournament, on both ends of
the court, her personality, what she brings to the team?  
KIM MULKEY: We'll start with her personality. She is the light in our locker
room, on the floor. She keeps everything light, but yet serious because of how
she plays. She plays so hard. She's just got personality plus.  
  
You talk about her basketball on the floor, she and Lauren Cox are our
defensive stoppers. We go as those kids go on the defensive end. Now, a lot of
people want to talk about her being an offensive liability. If you saw the
last three or four games, I don't think you'd say that any more. She has a
knack for cutting to the basket, getting offensive boards, a knack for leaking
out in transition. Our posts have played with her so much now that they know
they can find her.  
  
She is just pleasant, vocal, prissy, girly. That's DiDi.  
  
Q. After you guys knocked off Iowa, you were passionate about making it
here for your seniors, for your players. What did it mean being here for the
university?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, it's a positive. Back in 2005, we went through a lot at our
university the previous year. We were the shining light of Baylor University,
if you will remember. That was the big theme, is that women's basketball
quickly erased a lot of the negative. We certainly have been through some
negatives here the last couple of years. I'd have to think this is a positive
that will help a lot of people heal.  
  
Q. DiDi said in the locker room that she didn't see herself as a
defensive stopper when she first came to Baylor. The one way she knew she
would get on the floor is to be that defensive stopper. What has her evolution
been since she first stepped on campus to the role?  
KIM MULKEY: When you sit in a recruit's home, they don't really talk about
that. Reality doesn't hit them until they get to their first week of practice.
Then you separate the pretenders from the contenders. Who is really going to
be the one that contends, really, really buys into that defensive stopper.  
  
DiDi had the length on the perimeter. She had the quickness. She had the
personality to do it. She just, from day one, got my attention. Now, she was
inexperienced as a freshman. She had her lunch handed to her by upperclassmen
we would face. She has evolved into, I'm going to figure this out. Her
activity and effort was always good, but it was just footwork, principles,
running into screens. Listens to a scout report really, really well.  
  
Now what she's so confident at doing is kind of like Lauren Cox. It's not just
me, I have to help everybody on the floor. I have to know when to go help. I
have to do some things instinctively on the floor that coach didn't tell me to
do. She does a lot of that for us now because she's comfortable.  
  
Q. You're the only coach here who has played in and won a national
championship. How do you think that shapes the advice you do give your
players?  
KIM MULKEY: Well, I don't know that there's any advantage. I think the way I
coach, I am able to do and say things that maybe a lot of coaches aren't
comfortable saying and doing, because I coach with passion, I coach with a
great level of intensity. I'm not so smart that I'm never wrong. I tell them
when I'm wrong in the locker room.  
  
Kids feel that. Kids know. So they allow me to really push them beyond limits
that they think they're even having, but they know it's not to harm them in
any way. When you feel that from a coach, they'll run through that wall for
you. I was coached by the greats, Leon, Pat Summitt. Certainly I don't do some
of the things that they did back in the day, but I incorporate that passion
and intensity into my own funny, quick-witted personality. You wouldn't
believe some of the things I say to those kids, and they just roll their eyes.
I hope that I never, ever have to deal with some of the things coaches are
dealing with because they just know Kim is real, she's real, says things
people are afraid to say. She means no harm, doesn't want to offend anybody.
She just wanting those kids to have the most wonderful experience in
basketball and leave Baylor with a college degree.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
KIM MULKEY: Thank you y'all.

_Tampa, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll start with an opening statement from Coach McGraw.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think being anointed as the No. 1 seed early in the season is
not a blessing. It's hard to get here. I don't know that everybody knows how
hard it is to get back here. I'm proud of what this team has accomplished.
We've overcome some things. We've been very persistent. Very blessed to be
back here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Arike, after the Women's Final Four last year Notre Dame had, how do
you top it?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Well, I don't think we were can really top last year. What
happened last year was amazing. We're here to win, however we have to do it,
whatever fashion, we're just here to win. That's what we're focused on.  
  
Q. Arike, the meeting in December with UConn, after which you used
Twitter to apologize, what was the learning experience from that? How did that
shape the way you attacked the rest of the season? Why did you feel the need
to apologize?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I attack every game how I would, whoever the opponent is. I
go into every game with the same mindset. That's how it is. I'm just here to
win, here to focus on basketball. That is basketball. Like I said, I attack
every game how it is. So just basketball.  
  
Q. Brianna, you had to miss last year's Women's Final Four because of
injury. What is it like to be back here? What were your emotions last year
watching your team do what they did?  
BRIANNA TURNER: It was really exciting to see the success of our team last
year. But, I mean, my injuries are in the past. I'm really just looking
forward. I'm excited for my last weekend of, like, college athletics. I'm
really soaking it all in. We're all really excited to play tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Jess, I want to ask you, when you first arrived, what made you aware
of the animus, if there is any, between Notre Dame and UConn coming from the
outside of it? Did the level of it surprise you or not so?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I mean, I think Notre Dame and UConn are two programs that
have been doing it right for a long time. I think anyone who watches women's
college basketball knows about those two programs.  
  
I think we're not really focused about who we're playing tomorrow, but just
about, you know, winning the game, playing our best basketball.  
  
Q. For all three players, can you talk about what you learned from the
December meeting with UConn, why you expect this game to be different.  
BRIANNA TURNER: For the first game, I think we just learned a lot about
ourselves, how we need to focus on our defense, not get too riled up, making
sure we're staying focused throughout the 40 minutes, not letting up no matter
who the opponent may be or what's happening during the course of the game.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think definitely just after that game we really learned
how to play with each other. Marina was injured for most of the games before
that, that was our first game as a starting five. Definitely just it's a
process to be able to learn how to play with five All Americans.  
  
I think over the course of the season, that game really helped us.  
  
JESSICA SHEPARD: Yeah, I agree. I think just developing team chemistry since
that game's happened. I think just kind of refocusing as a team.  
  
Q. Muffet spoke a little bit about it in the beginning. Last year, all
year everybody kept waiting for you to fall, injuries were piling up. You
didn't. What is it like going through this year when you were all pretty much
solid and playing from the top all season, a difference in just experiences
between the two seasons?  
BRIANNA TURNER: Well, I think we all like being healthy rather than being
hurt. I personally enjoy being healthy. But, I mean, like, less people in the
training room, more on the court. I think we're excited. We have more bodies
in there, more bodies on the bench. I think it's better when you have more
people available to play and practice.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Kim Mulkey was in here saying, If we weren't all competitors trying
to go for the same thing, we'd probably be all friends. She said some of us
would probably even be married. I know you're married, I know Geno is married,
but do you think you two would have a normal relationship if you weren't
competing every year for the same thing?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, there's a question I didn't expect (smiling).  
  
I think being from Philly, Geno and I have a lot in common, especially with
Jim Foster as a very good friend of both of us. I could see us being friends,
but I could not see us being married (laughter). So the answer is no, if he's
proposing.  
  
Q. Those first couple times back in the '80s that these two programs
played, UConn kind of owned the series. What do you remember from those first
eight losses or something like that?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I've blocked most of them out, I think.  
  
I think back then, UConn was the measuring stick. I don't think we played them
in the '80s, I don't remember any of that. I remember the early days in the
Big East when they were the team, they were the team to beat, to measure
yourself against. They were the team, you looked at what they were doing,
that's where I want to get to. That team was then and Tennessee at the time.
Both programs were just way above everyone else. Those were the two that you
looked at to kind of hope you would get there someday.  
  
Q. How would you characterize the rivalry with UConn? You hear everybody
else talk about it being the best rivalry in the women's game, one of the best
in sports. A lot of people talk about animosity, respect, or hatred. How would
you characterize it?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think it's very competitive and intense. I think it is the
best rivalry in women's college basketball. I think it's one the fans and
teams all look forward to.  
  
Q. The discussion obviously is about the rivalry. What did you learn
from that first game when you played in December? What did you learn that will
help you tomorrow?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think any time you lose, you go back and you look at
absolutely everything that went on in the game, offense, defense. What did we
do wrong, substitutions, man, zone, what did we play. You break down the whole
game, try to find some things.  
  
That's why you play those games early in the year, because you want to know
what your weaknesses are, how teams are going to attack you. You learn a lot
from them.  
  
We did some good things. We did some good things at both ends of the floor. We
just didn't do enough good things. I think we didn't take advantage sometimes
of the mismatches that we had. So we were able to work on that. Our defense
was not as good as I thought. We've actually been working on that for the rest
of the year. I think you take away little things like that.  
  
[Christyn] Williams had a huge game. We probably weren't as prepared for that.
So now we're aware of what she can do. I think we learned a lot. Same as we
did for the other two losses we had.  
  
Q. I know you made some comments about hiring practices, what you would
do in the future. How important -- as your career has gone on, how seriously
do you taking being that voice, losing Pat Summitt?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Did you know that the Equal Rights Amendment was introduced in
1967 and it still hasn't passed? We need 38 states to agree that
discrimination on the basis of sex is unconstitutional. We've had a record
number of women running for office and winning, and still we have 23% of the
House and 25% of the Senate.  
  
I'm getting tired of the novelty of the first female governor of this state,
the first female African American mayor of this city. When is it going to
become the norm instead of the exception? How are these young women looking up
and seeing someone that looks like them, preparing them for the future? We
don't have enough female role models. We don't have enough visible women
leaders. We don't have enough women in power.  
  
Girls are socialized to know when they come out, gender rules are already set.
Men run the world. Men have the power. Men make the decisions. It's always the
man that is the stronger one.  
  
When these girls are coming out, who are they looking up to to tell them
that's not the way it has to be. Where better to do that than in sports? All
these millions of girls that play sports across the country, we're teaching
them great things about life skills, but wouldn't it be great if we could
teach them to watch how women lead? This is a path for you to take to get to
the point where in this country we have 50% of women in power, we have right
now less than 5% of CEOs of Fortune 500 companies.  
  
When you look at men's basketball, 99% of the jobs go to men, why shouldn't
100 or 99% of the jobs in women's basketball go to women? Maybe it's because
we only have 10% women athletic directors in Division I. People hire people
who look like them. That's the problem.  
  
Q. Were you not surprised that Geno hadn't said something about this?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I did not read his comments either. So I'm not aware of what he
said.  
  
Q. We've heard you up on the podium for many years now, you've been to a
million of these. I'm curious as to why now? What is it about now that has
made you come forth and be as strong about this as you are?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Enough. I think women across the country in the last few years
have just said enough. Time's up. Time's up. It is our turn. If it's going to
happen, we have to do something about it. You see women marching in record
numbers across the country. Women are coming out and being more active
politically.  
  
I've never watched CNN as much in the past two years as I am now. We have the
Equal Pay Act. Women are making 77 cents on the dollar. That's just white
women. Women of color are lagging way further behind. I'm not talking about
white women being coaches. We need more diversity in our game, as well.  
  
Q. You have a lot of continuity on this team, a lot of veterans that are
playing. You also have great continuity on your coaching staff. If you could
talk a little bit about Carol Owens as the assistant coach of the year, going
to the Hall of Fame, Beth Cunningham.  
MUFFET McGRAW: That's a great segue. Thank you for getting us back to
basketball (laughter).  
  
I think when you look at us and UConn, and I think probably Baylor as well,
you see the continuity in the staff. I think when you have successful teams,
you look at the staff and see so many things that they've done.  
  
My staff has been phenomenal. I love being around them. Carol Owens, so
grateful she was nominated and won the award this year for assistant coach of
the year. Beth has been a very successful head coach. So we've got a great
staff. I think we all have different strengths and I think we feed off each
other. We complement each other really well. We have a great time together. We
can laugh about things, which I think is really important during a long
season. I don't think I need to mention again that it is all female (smiling).  
  
Q. I think you've said that Mayor Pete has come out to games, been a
supporter of your program. After what you just said, have you ever had a
chance to talk politics with him? Has anybody in the political realm urged you
to run for something?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Mayor Pete is a phenomenal guy. He's around Notre Dame quite a
bit. He emailed me yesterday just to wish me good luck and said that he was on
MSNBC the night of the Stanford game. He said he really couldn't concentrate,
so distracted, because he kept trying to look for the score before he went on
with MSNBC. He's a huge fan and supporter.  
  
What a great guy. We're wishing him a lot of luck. Nobody has ever asked me.  
  
Q. Could you ever see yourself doing that after coaching?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I do. I would like to become more involved in the community,
for sure.  
  
Q. Beyond getting people in the position of power that hire more women,
what else can be done? What specific things would you like to see done to
change this more than it has in the last century?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I'd like to see more women supporting women. I think we don't
do a good job of helping each other. I think when people get to a certain
position, they need to be able to reach down and pull somebody else up, they
need to be better mentors. I think we can do a lot more on networking. Guys
have that down. They help each other. They know how the system works. We
don't.  
  
We need more men that are in positions of power to hire women. You've seen for
the first time KPMG, Deloitte, first time women CEOs of their companies. I
think that's because the culture of the company is that it's more acceptable
now. I think women need to have more confidence and apply for jobs. I think we
wait to be asked. It goes back to high school when you're waiting to be asked
to the prom.  
  
I think women go after jobs in a very different way than men do. We want
somebody to pursue us rather than really going for it.  
  
Q. You just talked about your staff, the praise, one of the best in the
country, no question. Same thing with UConn. Why haven't they gone -- is it
their choice? Have they gotten offers that they said no to or are they not
getting offers? Your staff is definitely attractive to athletic directors, we
have an open position, look at the Notre Dame staff?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Beth Cunningham was the head coach at VCU for seven or eight
years. Very successful. Went to post-season six of those years. When she
started her family, wanted to move back to South Bend. I think it was a
perfect opportunity for her. Her husband is also a Notre Dame grad. To come
back and be at a different level than she was at at VCU.  
  
Carol also went off to be the head coach at Northern Illinois, her alma mater,
had a successful tenure there. Didn't really feel it was the same relationship
with the players. I think as a head coach, your relationship is very different
with the players. I think she enjoyed the success that we had, being at a
different level.  
  
Niele [Ivey] gets called every single year. I mean, by multiple people. She's
not the type of person, nor are we, to announce that these schools are
interested in her. A lot of people like to use that to get a better job, to
get their name in the paper. But she gets plenty of calls. Every year at this
time I worry that we're going to lose her.  
  
Q. I know you talked about it a little in the espnW article. What drives
you more, the love of winning, the fear of losing?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I hate to lose more than I like to win, for sure.  
  
Q. If I dare ask about the game, first of all, how is Marina? Is
everybody else good to go? Secondly, what are a couple critical points knowing
that UConn is going to be better this times a well?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, Marina is good. She's fine. Everybody is good. Jackie had
her hand cut. She fell on the baseline, one of the cameraman, cut her finger.
She's fine also.  
  
We're at 100% strength. I think as much as you can be at this time of the
year. Same as UConn.  
  
It's hard to say what's the most important thing when you look at the team and
say, Well, we can't let [Katie Lou] Samuelson go off for 29, we can't let
Napheesa [Collier] own the backboard and do what she wants. [Crystal]
Dangerfield is so critical to their team. You don't want to let one of the
other two get loose.  
  
Really there's so many critical points. I think rebounding is always key for
us. If we can defend and get a rebound, that's going to help our transition
game. That's probably maybe the biggest key.  
  
Q. Back to the rivalry. What is it like? How would you describe going up
against the same coach at the same program for such a long period of time, so
many times?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, it was Pat and Geno for a long time, now it's moved over.
The Big East, we had at least two years in a row where we played them four
times, eight times in two years. That familiarity maybe was not as good. I
think a little distance has been good for us. Still playing them twice a year.
Really enjoy the rivalry. I think we don't have to watch them as up close in
the same league, I think that's been good for us.  
  
Q. World's worst final question here. Have you ever competed with Geno
at anything else, like golf?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We've played golf together once. I don't even recall. He's a
really good golfer. I don't think we kept score. Probably each kept it
individually in our heads and we both won (laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

_Tampa, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Joining us is Oregon. We'll start with questions for the
student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sabrina, first Final Four. What has it been like for you? Business
part with games tomorrow. What have the first couple days been like for you?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, it's been filled with a lot of fun. We didn't really
know what to expect coming in. Just landing, having a red carpet laid out, us
walking off. I think we've smiled so much this whole week, these last few days
for sure. We're definitely just enjoying the moment, enjoying the experience
and everything that it has to offer.  
  
Now it's game time. We're focusing on the game. We're not really going to
change who we are. We're going to enjoy and be appreciative of the position
we're in.  
  
Q. Satou, can you talk a little bit about you and Baylor? Baylor has
been here before as a program, but this group of players hasn't. Do you have
any sense of how the two of you being new to all of this is going to play
itself out?  
SATOU SABALLY: I just think that both teams are going to be really aggressive
and appreciative of where they are. We're not going to take it for granted
that we made it to the Final Four. We've come a long way and worked all the
season hard for it. The same thing applies to Baylor. They're going to be
thankful and aggressive in the game.  
  
Q. For each of the girls. Sabrina, you have so many weapons on your
squad. I want to know about Erin Boley, what she has meant to this team
offensively all year long. Actually, if each of you can talk about her
contributions.  
SATOU SABALLY: Erin Boley is just an amazing player, most importantly an
amazing person. She spreads the floor, like, opens up driving lanes for each
one of us. People can't leave her open. She has the quickest release in the
whole country. She's just really important to our team as well as a player and
personality-wise.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Satou kind of hit it. Just her ability to shoot the ball, be
on every single night is something that we don't take for granted, especially
as guards. That opens up the driving lane so much for us. Her length and size
helps her at the forward position as well because she can pick and pop, she
can set great screens, also get to the basket. That's what I think she's been
improving on, not really relying on her shot as much, cutting, getting to the
basket, free-throw line, rebounds. I think she's turning into a really
complete player for us. I think she's just going to continue to get better
every game.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: She has turned into a complete player. Her defense is really
great, helps us a lot, too. For the post players, she gets us open a lot,
spreads the floor, hits the threes. Overall, she's just a great person, a
great teammate.  
  
Q. Sabrina, last year I saw you and Kelly in the hallways in Columbus on
this day. You had come off a tough Elite 8 loss. What were you thinking that
day when you have to come here after you were trying to get here and you
didn't quite make it? Do you remember what you were thinking that day?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Oh, yeah. I remember it all. I remember talking, it was just
me and the coaches that were here. I told them we were going to come back here
and we were going to come back as a team. It wasn't fun coming alone, seeing
the teams you played, seeing the buses get escorted while you're standing on
the street watching, because I remember that like it was yesterday.  
  
I knew that I wanted my team to experience the little things that I had
experienced when I was here, getting my awards. Our coaching staff has been
here, they wanted to bring our team.  
  
I think we're really happy to be here as a team. Yeah, I remember everything
(smiling).  
  
Q. Ruthy, how did Sunday's game against McCowan prepare you to play
Brown tomorrow?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, Sunday's game was really fun. They're both two great post
players, have great teams around them, too. I think Sunday's game got me
ready, got me physical, in the mindset. I'm excited to take on Kalani
tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Graves.  
  
Q. Kim Mulkey said before how it's so difficult to get here. There are
coaches who spend their entire lives coaching who never have the joy of
getting to the Women's Final Four. You can now say that you're here as a
coach. What is it like for you to get here? Have you had a minute to enjoy
being in the Final Four for the first time?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, I mean, I'm enjoying it. There's no question about it. I
actually had a chance to spend a little bit of time with Coach Geno last
night. He kind of welcomed me to that club. That really meant something.  
  
I think professionally, obviously, this is something every coach wants a
chance to do. I was really emotional when I saw Tony Bennett, all the things
that he said, because he's been working so hard his whole life to get there.
It's a special time.  
  
The reality, I haven't really had a chance to kind of dwell on that a whole
lot. I think I will when it's all said and done. For us, as soon as we were
done Sunday, we had preliminary scouts that night on both Iowa and Baylor. For
us, it's another workday. We've got to keep grinding until that last game.  
  
Yes, in some way obviously very fulfilling. I'm super happy for the team. I
mean, that's why we do it that they have a chance to experience this. As a
coach, I think you have to wait until everything settles, then you might have
a chance to appreciate it more.  
  
Q. Some people have called you the Warriors of women's college
basketball. The team you're facing is post-centered. How would you describe
the contrasting styles?  
KELLY GRAVES: You mean warriors in that we're tough, that kind of warrior?  
  
Q. Golden State.  
KELLY GRAVES: Okay.  
  
We have plays that I guess resemble some of them. Steph Curry gave Sabrina
quite a shout out yesterday. I thought that was really cool. You know what,
yeah, she's a lot like Steph, how he's a conductor, is always a threat to make
a huge play, make those three-pointers.  
  
We don't really break their film down and try to be like them. We've kind of
developed our own style. It's happened over the years for me. This team just
gets it. They know how to play pick-and-roll basketball, they know how to
spread the floor, they love the three-point shot. It does really help we have
a hammer inside like Ruthy that we can go to if we need it. I don't know if
DeMarcus (Cousins) has quite gotten to that level yet. He's still looking up
to Ruthy, I think.  
  
Yeah, it is a fun style. I hear that from a lot of people. We get a lot of
coaches that come watch us practice, college coaches as well. I think they
try, because it is a fun style, they want to adopt it. These guys just know
how to do it well. Proud of 'em.  
  
I love watching them play.  
  
Q. Do you remember being in the hallways last year as everything was
going on around you, what you were thinking?  
KELLY GRAVES: I think when you get as close as we did the last two years,
yeah. There's part of you that pangs for being in that position. I remember
being with her when one of the buses went whizzing by, a shootaround or a
practice. She took it hard. She took it hard.  
  
I didn't as hard, but it's certainly something I wanted to have happen for
this group. I knew we were good enough and we were almost good enough in the
past, but not quite there.  
  
But I've been coming to these Final Fours for a long time. It wasn't quite as
difficult as it was for me as it was for her. That was her first time.  
  
Q. We saw Taylor wasn't practicing. Did she have a setback? Do you have
to rely entirely on Maite and Sabrina?  
KELLY GRAVES: Game time decision on her. She was getting better. With
something like that, you just never know. Yeah, she'd been practicing a little
bit. We decided to let her lay low today, give her more strength hopefully for
tomorrow.  
  
Q. What do you think Geno and Muffet and Kim know about this experience
that you don't know yet?  
KELLY GRAVES: A lot. They've been here, done that. I'm that new kid on the
block, so to speak. I've relied on a lot of my coaching colleagues and friends
to kind of help me through it. They gave me some dos and don'ts, some tips,
including Dana Altman, our men's coach, who was in the Final Four two years
ago for his first time. He gave me some really good words of wisdom, some
insight.  
  
That's really all I can go on. I've been watching these for a long time. Until
you're actually here, you don't know what the experience is really like.  
  
Q. I asked the girls this. Your thoughts on Erin, what she's meant to
the team, how much she's matured as a player into your team.  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, what I love about Erin is she's an efficient player. The
night she scored 31 points at University of Washington, she did so on four
dribbles. Kind of Klay Thompson-like. You mentioned the Golden State Warriors,
that was Klay Thompson-like. She took seven total dribbles. She had three
rebounds where she took one dribble out. That's what we need. We have a lot of
players, Maite, Satou, Sabrina, are comfortable off the ball, but they're all
very comfortable with the ball. You need that one player who really doesn't
have to have the ball in their hands.  
  
She stretches all the defenses. Allows Ruthy some opportunity to roam inside
one-on-one. As our players said, they allow Satou, Maite and Sabrina some
driving lanes. We need that, we're not the quickest team. The more space we
can create for ourselves in the halfcourt, the better.  
  
In this particular matchup, if they decide to go with Lauren Cox or Kalani
Brown on her, she does play technically our four spot, they're going to have
to guard her in the perimeter. So that's an advantage I think for us.  
  
At the same time she may, and probably will at times, have to guard one of
those inside kids. She just doesn't have the length they do. It will be a fun
chess match there. I would echo what they said, great kid, great teammate,
awesome student, just an amazing representative of our university. I think she
exemplifies everything that's good about intercollegiate athletics.  
  
Q. Has she talked to you about the Notre Dame connection?  
KELLY GRAVES: No, not much. We haven't really gone down that road, no.  
  
Q. What do you think it will take for Hebard to be successful against
Brown in the post tomorrow?  
KELLY GRAVES: 40 minutes of extreme effort, focus and concentration. She's got
her work cut out for her, whether she's guarding Cox or Brown or whomever
inside. They're tremendous players, All-Americans. She's just going to have to
suck it up and do it like she's been doing. I thought she did a terrific job
on Teaira McCowan last week. Kristine Anigwe is in our league, she's had to
guard her, too.  
  
She'll hopefully get some help from the rest of the team. In the end, she's
going to have to sit down there on that block and try to keep them as far away
from the basket as possible.  
  
Q. You mentioned you talked to some people like Dana (Altman), got
advice. Do you want to share a point or two of the dos and don'ts this
weekend?  
KELLY GRAVES: To a coach, they said, Have a great time, enjoy it, especially
for your first time. We hope to be back. But there's never an assurance of
that. That was an overwhelming theme perhaps.  
  
Secondly was, Be yourselves. Don't put in that special play, that new defense,
just do what's gotten you there.  
  
Number three, they said make sure you take care of your tickets. That's a pain
in the butt. I did. I told the team that first night before we get on our
plane to come to Tampa, make sure the ticket situation is done.  
  
Last, this media, just expect to get a bunch of questions. That's just part of
it. They said, Just enjoy it, just go with it. I had some wise person say,
Just steer into the skid, steer into the skid. Did I get that right (smiling)?
So I'm steering into the skid, yup.  
  
Q. All four of these teams left standing have really had to rely a lot
on their main five players to carry them. How rewarding is that for you as a
coaching staff to get this far into a season with that as your reality? What
does that say about this group to kind of carry that weight throughout a whole
season?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, that was the first question I had at the start of the
year. Were we going to be able to stay healthy? For the most part we were. We
lost Ruthy for a couple games during Pac-12 play down the stretch. We realize
she's very important to us. We dropped those two games, the only two games we
lost in conference play.  
  
For the most part, we've been just blessed with great health. I credit our
training staff. They've been wonderful. Our nutritionists, our strength staff.
Then as coaches we've tried to manage that. It hasn't been easy at times. But
I think we're as healthy as we've been in a long, long time here. So credit to
those young women for taking care of their bodies through this grind. It is a
long season. We started October 1st. I don't know what today is, but it's
April sometime, right (smiling)?  
  
Q. It's April sometime.  
KELLY GRAVES: All right. That's a long, long season. They've been wonderful.
We still stayed competitive. You still have to to stay sharp. But, yeah, we've
been blessed with good health. Knocking on desk -- plastic -- but good enough
(laughter).  
  
Q. You mentioned you've been here several times, not as a participant.
What can this mean to your program overall in the long run, the exposure,
being here?  
KELLY GRAVES: It means a ton. Oregon has got great athletics, there's no
question. It's an awesome academic institution, as well. For us to get here,
it validates, number one, our vision as coaches, number two, the kind of
talent we've been able to attract. I think number three, just going forward,
people knowing that this is a program that's not going anywhere. I think we're
here to stay.  
  
Again, I give my staff a ton of credit. They've worked their butts off,
carried my sorry butt most of the time. They've just done a great job in
attracting talent. The coolest thing about it, people like Doug Feinberg call
me back when I text him saying I need to talk to you. It's pretty nice.
Charlie Creme, he'll answer my texts now. I think Geno said it best, You're a
Final Four coach. Also said that gave me the opportunity to say anything I
wanted (laughter). I'll use some discretion there. I'll leave that to him.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Thank you very much, you guys.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 4, 2019

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

### [Katie Lou Samuelson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30887)

### [Napheesa Collier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33298)

  
_Tampa, Florida_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We will take an opening statement from Coach Auriemma.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: It seems like yesterday was November 14th or 15th, whatever it
was, that we had our first game. I can't believe how fast the season goes
anymore. You try to explain it to our players, it's just a whirlwind.
Especially the last three weeks, how quickly it flies by.  
  
But for me mostly, you know, this weekend, this NCAA tournament, really has
been about these two guys sitting next to me here in the sense that when you
have two seniors who have accomplished everything that they've accomplished in
their four years at Connecticut, every kid in America wants to be rewarded by
going to the Final Four. Who doesn't? Every kid in America wants to win a
national championship. Who doesn't want to win a national championship?  
  
You can't say that some kids deserve it more than others, because that's not
fair. But when you write down all the questions and you say, Why do these two
deserve to be here? You can't find a reason to say, Well, they don't. So for
me it's all about the fact that regardless of how it goes this weekend, these
two are ending their career exactly where it needs to end. I'm really, really,
really thankful for that. I really am.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. For both of you, the three times you've been here before, you knew
there was another year, another chance to get back to the Final Four. Coach
just said some wonderful words about both of you. What does it mean to know no
matter what happens this weekend it's your last chance to play in a Final Four
and win a national championship?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: It is really different. Even though, of course, every year
you come here, you know you want to make the season worth it, you want to come
here and want to win. Knowing that we don't have another chance, it's just
another thing that adds to the fact that we need to be really focused and
locked in, and we need to do everything we can in our power to reach the goal
that we want.  
  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: It's kind of unbelievable in some ways because it feels
like the UConn jersey is one we've been wearing forever. It seems like while
you're playing here, it's never going to end. You always are going to play
another game, have another practice. The fact that it is kind of the end of
the road, we just want to go out and give everything we have because we know
this could be one of the last few chances we get to wear the UConn jersey on
our chest.  
  
Q. For both of you, can you reflect on the way the last two Final Fours
ended for you guys, to what degree do you bring that back with you here?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: It is really hard having your season end like that,
especially two times in a row. It's kind of like the worst situation that you
can have. Overtime, a last shot like that, it happened to us twice. It is
really hard.  
  
It's something that our first year we were like, We need to use this, make
ourselves better. Then we didn't really take that to heart. We said it this
year. You could see I think even from the summer, everyone just came in really
focused, with a different mentality than we had the year before. Our team
dynamic even this year is so much better.  
  
So I think that especially being here now, about to play in that same game
that we did those last two years, you know that in practice we have to be that
much better and that much on top of things because we don't want that to
happen again.  
  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: It makes us probably more than anyone understand that
there's only one thing guaranteed at a time. For this Final Four, for this
section of the tournament specifically, we know it's just as easy to have one
game as it is to have two. We're not looking ahead of anything. All our focus
is going into Friday night. Whatever happens, we need to take care of business
and do and put everything on the line. We can't save anything for the next
game.  
  
Q. Napheesa, you guys this year are coming to the NCAA tournament with a
loss or two, something that didn't happen in the previous two years. You faced
adversity being down in games. Will that potentially help you now? Does that
help prepare you guys better that you've been in almost every situation this
year?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: It definitely does prepare us. As much as it sucks to lose
games during the year, it does give you that experience. We've had more close
games this year than we have in all my years combined. Again, that experience
really does help you because you're not in that position for the first time on
the biggest stage in the biggest game.  
  
We know if we get in those positions, we know what to do in order to bring
ourselves out of whatever is going on, to stay calm, kind of just trust in
ourselves and know we've been here before, there's no reason to, like, panic,
I guess.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. You're going to have two teams in one game where the players, neither
of their players, have ever played in a Final Four game. Another game where
obviously both teams have players with experience. Do you have any idea what
differences are going to manifest themselves based on that?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I don't know. I think when you've played in this game, and this
will be Napheesa [Collier] and Lou's [Katie Lou Samuelson] fourth time being
in this game, it's good and bad. You know this is what happens at the end if
you play great. You get to play in the national championship game on Sunday.
But you also have a lot of bad memories, too. Sometimes those memories pop up
in the last five minutes of a game.  
  
When you've never played in this game, you don't have any bad memories. You
don't have any good ones either, but you don't have any bad ones. Everything
is new, everything is fresh, you just play.  
  
Yeah, I would think the first game is two teams that are playing with a
certain amount of emotion, I can't believe we've reached our dream, we're in
the Final Four. Then you have two teams in the second game playing, No big
deal, we're here to win a national championship. Not that the other two
aren't, but I just think it's a different mindset.  
  
Q. You've been here 20 times, to this point. I think tomorrow will be
your 31st game at the Final Four. That's a full season of basketball basically
in this setting, which is rather remarkable.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Wow, wow.  
  
Q. I know each journey is unique for the people involved, but to you
does it still feel unique? It's not a surprise to see UConn here. Does each
one still feel like a unique experience to you, beyond the fact that the
players and opponents are different?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I think so. I think so. I'm just as like this (nervous) today
and tomorrow as I was the very first time. Maybe even more so, you know. The
first time ever here, I thought, What's the big deal? Nobody's expecting us to
win. We're going to play and we're going to beat Virginia. Why does everybody
think this is going to be really hard? This isn't going to be hard.  
  
When you're young, you're trying to do something, you think nothing can stop
you. I think as you get older, you start to realize, You know how many things
could go wrong Friday night? You start getting more, you know -- like I said,
it's like a golfer who has never missed a 5-foot putt and they keep winning.
Until when? Until they do. The next time they have a 5-footer, they remember
the one they missed. It's still there even more so than it ever was in the
beginning.  
  
Yeah, it takes your breath away. So I guess I still have it.  
  
Q. Same thing I asked the players. Obviously losing is never a good
thing, but for a team that has gotten to this point the last two years and
lost in the Final Four game, does it help going through what you did this year
to have been in tight games, in situations that they may not have seen in the
past? If you get down tomorrow night, We've been here before, like against
UCLA?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, yeah. It's crazy to talk about that. We had a lot of
adversity this year. We lost two games. I mean, just saying those words makes
you think, What an idiot, whoever would say we faced a lot of adversity this
year and lost two games? Some people lose two games in a weekend.  
  
Yet, at the same time, our players have already experienced something
different than they've experienced the other couple years. Any other team in
America, they lose the game, it's in the newspaper tomorrow, probably on page
4, or can't find it on dot-com anywhere. We lose a game, it's at Baylor, it's
on the CBS Evening News. Our kids have experienced that dramatic feeling of,
Oh, my God, we lost. They got up the next day, we still had practice,
everything was great.  
  
I think there's this sense coming out here this year, What's the big deal?
We've been down that road already. We know what it's like to lose. We know
what it's like to win. For the first time, I can honestly say in a long time,
in the UCLA, second half, and the Louisville game, I was coaching a
Connecticut team that wasn't burdened being afraid to lose, and was playing to
win.  
  
I wonder, last year and the year before, coming out here, and I know for sure
that they did, those teams were more afraid to lose the national championship
than wanting to win a national championship. That comes out, and it did.  
  
We might get beat. We might get beat tomorrow night. But we're not going to
lose. They're going to have to beat our [expletive]. We're not just going to
lose because we're afraid to lose.  
  
Q. You mentioned 1991. Kind of along the same theme here, how has this
experienced changed for you, going from the young cocky coach that went in
there with nothing to lose, but also the guy that went back in the archives?
You got emotional winning the regional that year. Now here you are as one of
the more well-known people in sports, people want to hear what you have to say
on this platform? It's a different world. Share your thoughts on the personal
experience and transformation.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I didn't learn to speak English till I was 8. I didn't
really learn how to speak it probably till I was 10. But once I learned, I
didn't want to shut up (smiling). The unique thing, like nobody cared what I
had to say.  
  
I've been saying things that are on my mind for the longest time that I can
remember. Now I'm a little bit like, What? when people go, Wow, Geno Auriemma
said that? So what? I've been saying stuff like this all my life, it's just
that nobody cared.  
  
Now, yeah, from a personal standpoint, I feel like I have to keep in mind that
my voice resonates different than it did years ago, and that just because I
say something, people think that it must be true. Or, Wow, this is what Geno
Auriemma thinks. So now I have to weigh in on it. I don't understand that.  
  
It's like people putting their whole life on Instagram or stuff. I'm in the
supermarket, look what I'm buying. Who gives a [expletive]? You do. You want
everybody to know what you think or what you're doing. So I don't get that
part. I really don't. Right? I'm like, Gene Hackman in The Birdcage, I don't
understand. One of the great movies of all time. He goes, I don't understand.  
  
Q. We were talking to Kelly Graves a bit ago. You mentioned how many
times, 20 times you've been here. He said that you guys had a chance to visit
a little bit. You had some words of wisdom, said, Welcome to the club. Share a
little bit about what you talked about, what you think of this Oregon program,
what he's done as a coach?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I told him he cost me money because I told the people at Nike,
when they hired Kelly, I said, I'll bet you a lifetime of free sneakers that
in four years Kelly will have Oregon in the Final Four, and it took him five.
He went on to explain why they didn't make it last year.  
  
I'm probably the least surprised person in America that Oregon is here. I told
him that the way he's done it and what he's done and how quickly he's done it,
just the way they play, everything about what they do, I just think is really,
really cool and really, really impressive. I've always had a great
relationship with Kelly. That's why we're going to play them in the future,
starting next year.  
  
Don't get me wrong, I'm encouraging Sabrina to leave early every time I talk
to her. Other than that, I'm rooting for Kelly all the way.  
  
Q. I think we've gone 12 minutes and we haven't mentioned the team
you're playing tomorrow night.  
GENO AURIEMMA: That's women's basketball.  
  
Q. Obviously you're very familiar with them. It's probably the best
rivalry right now in the sport. It's basically like Rocky 50 in movie
references. What is the theme about tomorrow? There's years you've played them
four times in a year, sick of each other. What is the mindset of playing a
team you played in December, beat them, what, handily? Is it just an opponent
or is it Notre Dame, back to what it used to be with you two?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I think mainly tomorrow's game is more about two really good
teams that are playing. I don't think the other 49 times we played them really
has any significance in tomorrow's game. It's just that in the last number of
years, every time we've played them it's been a lot at stake, even a stupid
regular season game like in December, it's 1 versus 2. One of us is 1, the
other one is close to being 1. It's a big game. That version of game of the
year, game of the century.  
  
I think that's cool because, you know, sports needs that kind of rivalry. We
used to have that with Tennessee. Now we have it with Notre Dame. I think it's
cool.  
  
Of course, it's exciting and it means a lot. But I don't think tomorrow's game
has any more significance whether you want to win or not just because it's
Notre Dame. Just because we beat them in December doesn't have anything to do
with tomorrow night.  
  
Same thing with Louisville beating us. It didn't really affect the outcome of
that game. I just think tomorrow's game is a completely different game. I
always tell our players whenever we win a big game in December, I say, Listen,
we're going to have to get a lot better fast. I'm assuming the teams we play
against, they're getting a lot better. And Notre Dame is a lot better today
than they were in December, no doubt in my mind. I mean, I think they're the
best team in the country. I don't think anybody else is even close. Baylor.
But I don't think anybody else, I think, can match Notre Dame when they're
playing their A game. They just overwhelm you, man, at every position.  
  
Q. You talked a few minutes ago about your teams in the past being
burdened by being afraid to lose. How does that manifest itself in the game?
Why didn't you see that over the weekend against UCLA and Louisville?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, those four years when we had to Stewie [Breanna Stewart]
in everybody on the team knew we were going to win. All those years we had
Diana Taurasi, we knew we were going to win. All the years when we had Maya
Moore, we knew we were going to win for the most part. When you don't have
that kind of iconic player, you look at your team, you go, Man, I don't know
if we have a lot of answers. Like if one of these kids gets in foul trouble,
we're dead. If something happens that we're not equipped to handle.  
  
When you know that, there's this palpable fear we have to play a perfect game
to win. When teams before you have won so much that now you're expected to do
the same thing, and you know deep down in your heart that we may not be good
enough to do it, yeah. Then the game gets close in the last five minutes,
yeah. If you're not careful, I hope we don't lose, I hope we're not the first
team to lose the national championship.  
  
So, yeah, you can see that. You can see it in their faces. You can see it
during timeouts. Why do you think we got down 17 last year to Notre Dame? Same
thing with Mississippi State the year before. Because there was a part of us
that didn't think we were good enough. It shows up. No question. When you have
that iconic player on your team that looks in the huddle and goes, What are
you guys worried about? You got me.  
  
I just hope they never turn around and go, Coach, we got you. Don't count on
me (laughter). I'll be like my dad, when the [expletive] hits the fan, I'll be
in the bathroom hiding.  
  
Q. Bear with me on this question a little bit. Earlier today Coach
Mulkey said in this very competitive environment that you guys live in, it's
impossible or close to impossible to have really close friendships. But if you
weren't coaches, had all these same interests, you'd all probably be best
friends. Maybe even some of you would be married. Muffet then was asked the
question. She said, Maybe Geno and I could be friends, but not the married
thing. I wanted to get your impressions on what Coach Mulkey had to say, the
idea that you guys could be friends if you weren't such competitors?  
GENO AURIEMMA: You think Tom Izzo has to deal with this crap (smiling)? I
don't think so. I don't think Coach K has ever been asked a question like that
at the Final Four. I don't think Dean Smith or anybody else has ever been
asked a question like that.  
  
I appreciate you asking it, but I think the issue around women's basketball to
me that I find a little bit disconcerting is the attention is always taken
away from the game and the players, and it's turned onto the personalities of
the involved coaches. God forbid, one coach is a man, the other coach is a
woman, there always has to be some kind of friction, tension, all that other
stuff.  
  
Like, I wouldn't marry me either. What's the big deal? I know me better than
anybody else knows me. I think it's crazy. It's like when you watch a game on
TV, a woman's basketball game, they talk more about the shoes that the coach
is wearing. Who gives a damn? Really, c'mon. Let's get over that. We want to
be taken seriously. Let's talk about sports, let's talk about the game. Let's
not talk about the other nonsense that's on TMZ. If we want to be taken
seriously, let's act seriously.  
  
Q. You talked earlier about the platform you have. Muffet today when
asked a question about future hiring practices gave a long and passionate,
dare I say emotional speech, about advancing women and the women's game, and
women everywhere. Do you respect her voice when it comes to that?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Sure I do.  
  
Q. You probably don't know what she said.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I don't. But sure I do. I think anybody that speaks up in
favor of advancing a segment of the community that could benefit from our
voice, absolutely. I've never had a guy on my staff as a coach, so...  
  
There's a lot of people out there advancing the game, advancing women. I'm all
in favor of it any which way you can, any which way, no matter what.  
  
I just come at it from a different standpoint. I just like to think that
there's probably a way to do one without the expense of another.  
  
So what are we saying at Oregon, they weren't trying to advance women's
basketball or women by hiring Kelly? That was a bad move. They should have
just found the best available woman?  
  
This is part of life. There's always going to be somebody who feels like -- I
remember going back, you know, when Muffet and I were both kids, that guys
felt like we don't have a place in women's basketball because no one will hire
a guy. When a guy would get hired, the women would resent the fact that the
men were intruding on their game.  
  
Now we're someplace elsewhere, you know, we're talking about maybe there's too
many men coaching college basketball on the women's side. But I just think
they should hire good coaches. If your preference is only to hire women,
that's fine. If your preference is only to have an all-male staff, that's
fine. God bless you.  
  
You have to do what's best for you, your program, how you feel about it. I
support that 100%, 100%.  
  
Q. I've heard you called a lot of things before, but bully is never one
of them, hasn't been one of them. Muffet called your coaching practice style
something along those lines. She used that word this week in a story that was
online. I was wondering what you felt about that?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I don't really have any feelings about it. Again, I would love
to be able to just talk about the matchups tomorrow night, who's guarding who.  
  
I think if I was that type, I think it would have come up a lot sooner than
now. We have a lot of administrators in this room. We have a lot of people
that I've been associated with in the league, whether it was the Big East or
the AAC, USA Basketball, any other place that I've coached, people that I've
been involved with.  
  
I would challenge anybody anywhere in America to dig up somebody that says,
Coach Auriemma bullied me. I dare you. Bring it up and tell me their name.  
  
Barb [Jacobs], can you think of anybody in our league, in the Big East?  
  
A. No.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: If I asked Barb[Jacobs] to tell me the God's honest truth with
her hand on her Bible, and said who was the most agreeable person in the room
at all our Big East meetings?  
  
A. Geno Auriemma.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Who always decided what was best for the Big East, now AAC, and
best for women's basketball, even at the detriment of Connecticut basketball.  
  
Q. Geno Auriemma.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Is that true for every coach in that room?  
  
Q. No.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Any other questions?  
  
THE MODERATOR: That's all the time we have. Thanks, coach.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2019

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

  
_Tampa, Florida_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good morning or good afternoon, depending on where you're at at
the moment. Welcome to today's Women's Final Four head coach media
teleconference. For the next 30 minutes you'll have the opportunity to visit
with the head coach of the Baylor Bears, Kim Mulkey, seeking its third
national championship in 2019.  
  
Kim, if we could start with an opening statement.  
  
KIM MULKEY: We are excited to head to Tampa. We've had a long night, got in at
1:30 this morning. We are going to regroup, repack, and looking forward to
some sunshine.  
  
RICK NIXON: We'll open it up for questions for Coach Mulkey.  
  
Q. Was there a time during the season where you thought to yourself you
may be good enough to get to Tampa and compete for the national
championship?  
KIM MULKEY: I can't tell you just one moment in time. I just watched our team
from the loss at Stanford when we returned in January and we started playing
in conference and we played Connecticut after Christmas that, you know, we
knew we were pretty good. We knew that there was a lot of parity this year in
women's basketball. We thought we had the talent.  
  
What we didn't know is the next two or three months could we stay away from
injuries, which has been a key problem for us the last several years late in
the year, and how good are we. I couldn't tell you that until we really got
into conference and just watched us play in the Big 12 and see the different
coaches throw different things at us, how we handle ourselves.  
  
Q. You've come into the Women's Final Four as the hunter and the hunted.
Does it help knowing you came in before as the team to beat?  
KIM MULKEY: I'm not sure we're the team to beat. I don't think we've been
picked to win it. I know we're the No. 1 overall seed, but I'm not sure we're
the hunted. I think we're one of four teams that can win it all.  
  
We happen to be the overall No. 1 seed probably because of the timing of how
losses happened late in the year. But we're just happy to get there, to bring
players who have never been there, and realize Oregon is an unbelievably
talented team.  
  
I don't know that we're the hunted or the hunter.  
  
Q. Going back to the one loss in season in December, you were calm going
down the list of things that went wrong, talked about what you said was a lack
of energy, communication, uncharacteristic play of your athletes. What has
changed since then? Was your calmness a sign of confidence in your team or in
California being Zen?  
KIM MULKEY: I think any time you play non-conference games that far away right
before your Christmas break, it's always a concern in scheduling. I think all
coaches would like to play as many home games as possible. We knew that our
team could handle whatever happened, and we needed to return to a game at
Stanford. What better program to play against to gauge how good or how bad you
are than to go against Stanford.  
  
That game was not going to define our season or how good we were really, but
it would give us a little bit of just kind of what we need to work on. Lauren
Cox, I barely played her in the second half. I thought Stanford played
extremely well. I thought they defended well, shot the three ball well.  
  
I thought it was a game that gave our freshmen an opportunity. We were down
when I took Lauren Cox off the floor, and the freshman post got to play a lot
of minutes. We were down maybe 13, I can't remember exactly, 15, and they cut
it to five. They got to grow up a little bit in that loss, as well.  
  
Q. Any specific things that you worked on since then with your team?  
KIM MULKEY: No, because I just thought some of the things I didn't like in
that game was focus. I thought you had kids that were probably thinking about
their plane trip back home for Christmas more than they were about what was
taking place on that floor. That starts with me. Maybe I needed to do a better
job in getting their attention.  
  
It wasn't overemphasized. It was a game we flushed immediately after we got
back from the holidays. We looked at the film, corrected things. You move on
to the next game.  
  
Q. Not many teams shoot the three as much as Oregon does. As the best
rebounding and shot-blocking team in the country, how do you try to prevent a
prolific perimeter shooting team from neutralizing your size advantage a
bit?  
KIM MULKEY: We actually have seen teams that shoot the three a lot. We see it
in our league. We also have seen it because of our height advantage inside.
We've seen teams change their approach when they play us that they do shoot
more threes than they normally would. It's not going to be uncommon or
uncomfortable for us to expect that and to see that.  
  
Certainly we will defend like we always do with the understanding that you got
to defend the three ball. We know what we face and how good they are from the
three and how hard it is to defend them out there.  
  
Q. Without giving away too much strategy, Stanford really made it a
point to run their big in the Pac-12 tournament against Oregon, to stretch
Ruthy, who was on a bad knee and still is. In your early impressions of
Oregon, do you think you'll call on Kalani and Lauren to run in transition
both offensively and defensively to try to put stress on her?  
KIM MULKEY: We do that. If you've watched us play, you go, Wow, their bigs run
the floor foul line to foul line, never stop. We bring in two athletic
freshmen that do the same thing. It won't be because of what we need to do
against Oregon. That's who we are. We're going to push the ball in transition.
Those bigs get up and down the floor.  
  
Q. You talked about it going into the Iowa game and afterwards about the
narrative around Kalani, about your team, some tinges of disrespect. What do
you attribute that to? Every team has things you nitpick, but it seems like
this year you have kind of gotten the brunt end of that. Do you have a theory
on why that might be?  
KIM MULKEY: I don't feel like we've gotten any disrespect. I just feel like
I'm going to defend my players. I think any parent, any coach in the country
would defend their players. I think I have two of the finest post players in
the country.  
  
There are great players out there that are better than mine. I'm not going to
allow other people, particularly media, to describe the weaknesses of my post
players. They're not at practice every day. I know what I have. I know what
they do. I know how good they are.  
  
I don't look at it as anything other than somebody's opinion. I have an
opinion, too. I see 'em every day. We don't feel slighted. We just speak from
our hearts. Those kids are great players.  
  
Q. Everyone talks about your size, the two post players. Everyone knows
you rebound at a high rate. You ranked statistically in the upper 10 in the
country in almost everything. Is there another area outside of low-post play
and rebounding that maybe people aren't talking about?  
KIM MULKEY: I think it's our defense. I think if you just look at field goal
percentage defense, that has to be an area that doesn't get talked about very
much because it's not pretty. Everybody wants to talk about the three ball.
Everybody wants to talk about offensive stuff, how many points people are
scoring.  
  
I think our defense is special. I think it's at all positions that it's very
good. Yes, we've scored a lot of points in these playoff games which we're
very capable of doing. We don't know we're going to do that every night. I
don't think any team can go and think how many points are we going to score.  
  
Our approach is we know what we can do defensively.  
  
Q. You mentioned you're one of four teams coming here to Tampa. If you
play the way you've been playing, if you bring your A game here, is there a
team that can beat you?  
KIM MULKEY: Oh, heavens, yes. We're humble, man. There's four teams there that
can win a national championship. We don't approach it like, Oh, wow, we're the
No. 1 seed, we're supposed to win. According to a lot of people, we're not
supposed to win.  
  
We're going to fight. We're going to claw. We're going to compete. We're going
to give it our best shot. I'm sure the other three teams are going to do the
same thing.  
  
Q. Coach Auriemma earlier said Notre Dame is the top team in the
country. Is that bulletin board stuff or do you care?  
KIM MULKEY: Oh, no. All we're thinking about is Oregon. We have got to focus
on the next opponent. We don't even know if we'll be playing. Certainly if we
are playing, we don't know if it will be Notre Dame. You just never know.  
  
These four teams, guys, I'm telling you, any four of these teams can win it
all.  
  
Q. We were talking to Kelly Graves, him being the newcomer in the Final
Four with coaches that have won multiple national championships. You've been
there as an assistant, player. Can you reflect back to '05, the first time you
went as a head coach, how different it feels? He said you have to win your
first one first.  
KIM MULKEY: It feels different in that you're experiencing something as a head
coach for the first time. I was fortunate to experience it as an assistant and
as a player. But honestly it doesn't feel that much different.  
  
The big thing is when you've done it for the very first time, for these
players that you take, they've never done it. It's their first time, period,
in any capacity. It's fun to watch them. It's fun to watch their expressions,
their excitement. That's what makes it fun for me now as a coach.  
  
I have had the pleasure, I've been blessed to do it at all levels. My pleasure
comes from watching those kids, taking my grandson, just watch all those happy
faces. When it gets time to play, if I have a little experience, it may be
calming them down, not letting them hyperventilate, you kind of say the right
words.  
  
It's fun when it's the very first time.  
  
Q. You said this year how much fun this team has been to coach, the
personalities. You talked about how a lot of it was how they were raised at
home. When you look at this group, can you recall a group that's come together
like this both on and off the floor?  
KIM MULKEY: Can I recall a group that has?  
  
Q. You've had good teams, but this has to stand out as a group that's
come together personality-wise on and off the floor.  
KIM MULKEY: It's like comparing children. I can't compare teams. I can't
compare what this team is like compared to the '05 or the '12. They're all
different. They all bring different elements to the table.  
  
I just know you can just watch them, how they interact on the bench, when they
mess up, how they help each other. They're pulling for each other. They don't
get too high, too low. It's just a joy that you don't sit there and have to
worry about pouty kids or kids that want more playing time. They all want to
play, but they all understand the bigger picture. It's far more important than
the individual.  
  
Q. How early did you see that in this team, they would be that way?  
KIM MULKEY: I saw it early. What I didn't see is could they sustain it or is
this real, is this truly who they are, or do they work it, having good team
chemistry.  
  
This is who they are. They're funny in the heat of the moment. They'll say
funny stuff to each other. They relax me. I'll be in a scouting report or
getting on them at halftime or something, and one of them, not out of being
disrespectful, but that's because who they are, they'll say, You tell 'em,
Mulkey. Just funny comments like that. They're just easy to coach.  
  
Q. Do you sense something different in Kalani this off-season that maybe
you didn't see from her because she knew there was a lot riding on her final
year here?  
KIM MULKEY: No, because you don't want to put pressure on her. You acknowledge
what's missing on her résumé. What was missing was a Final Four. She's got
that now.  
  
You never want to talk about it too much, but you bring it to her attention.
Let's stay focused. When you're a senior, sometimes kids lose focus. There's
nothing that a coach is going to really teach them. They know the system in
and out. They know the workout habits. They know when we're going to do
everything, how we're going to do it.  
  
You have to have ways of motivating them. Sometimes you motivate them by
making them mad at you. Sometimes texting them something. What does she mean?
Keep them on their toes, keep them motivated. That's what I try to do mostly
with Kalani.  
  
Q. Is there something you did that was most effective in keeping her on
her toes?  
KIM MULKEY: I've done some things. I don't know at the time if she liked it.
But I think she understood where I was coming from. Through a text challenging
her to do a little extra work in the weight room, come to practice early, stay
a little bit later. Just little things to where they know I'm not taking them
for granted, I need a little bit more out of you.  
  
Q. What players hear versus what coaches say. We're having this issue
across a lot of different sports, coaches being accused of verbal abuse. As
someone who played at the highest level, has coached at it, has that changed,
and does it make it challenging for coaches to get their point across without
it being taken wrong?  
KIM MULKEY: That's a question that you and I could sit for hours. I would love
to someday talk with you. I guess I can answer it like this:  
  
Has our society changed? Has our society changed? When you said, I was a
player, how I was coached, I thought it was the best. I thought it was the
greatest. There was nothing harmful about a coach challenging you.  
  
Yes, to answer your question, things have changed because I think back to some
of the greatest coaches that coached me, the things that were done and said.
They couldn't do it today because of what you just said. It's taken out of
context or they're not allowed to any more or it's considered abuse or
whatever.  
  
So, yes. I guess your question is, Has it changed? Yes, it has changed. I just
know my college years were the greatest years of my life. I played for intense
coaches. I played for intense international coaches. I guess if they were
still coaching, they would have to adapt because it has changed.  
  
Q. Kelly Graves was saying he felt like he had to change some things.
Have there been things you've had to change and adapt because of that?  
KIM MULKEY: You know, I don't feel like I have changed. I feel like I have
grown more mature and older with this generation. I have to attribute that
honestly to my own two children. When you're going through coaching young
people, you tend to be able to see your own children at those same ages in
society, how we have discussions at home about things.  
  
I think they have probably taught me what motivates the new generation. But
what I'm so fortunate to do with my players is that when I go into a recruit's
home, they know everything about me. What they don't know, I make sure they
know. No coach is perfect. No coach is going to make all the right decisions
through the course of the game.  
  
If you have an understanding, and you have the best interest of those kids,
then they will feel it. Now, they're not going to always like the decisions
you make when it comes to playing time. Listen, that's the hardest part. But
there's a difference in being perturbed at a coach over playing time than a
coach that's not for you or a coach that may have made the wrong call on
subbing you in or subbing you out.  
  
I just know there's no better coaches that I played for than Leon Barmore and
Pat Summitt. If I told some of the stories when they coached me, people would
be astounded and go, Oh, my God. My response would be, Thank God.  
  
Q. NaLyssa Smith, how has she adjusted to the college level? How much is
this experience going to help her as she moves on into the future at Baylor?  
KIM MULKEY: NaLyssa Smith is one of the best freshmen in the country. She is
playing her best basketball right now. She is so unselfish. She understands
the bigger picture. Like all freshmen, she hit that freshman wall a little bit
during the season, during conference especially, because everybody knows
everything about you when you get to conference play. She worked her way
through it.  
  
Man, she's special. Her talents are special. What a joy to coach.  
  
Q. How do you think this is going to help her as she furthers her role
there at Baylor?  
KIM MULKEY: This is why she came to Baylor. I hugged her neck as she came off
that floor last night. She hit critical buckets for us when I took Kalani
Brown off the floor. She's done that for us all year. You can go back to the
UConn game, the Arizona State game. NaLyssa steps in and is a tremendous
offensive rebounder. She understands. She would see Kalani. She and Queen
Egbo, they understand this stuff is valuable to us now.  
  
They're like all competitors. Listen, they want to play more minutes and all
that. They knew what was here when they got here. They knew they'd have to
work for playing time. They knew they would be challenged, and their day would
come. We are fortunate to have those kind of kids and that much talent in
those kids to play at Baylor.  
  
RICK NIXON: Kim, thanks for being with us. It's been a busy 24 hours. Safe
travels. Look forward to seeing you here in Tampa.  
  
KIM MULKEY: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2019

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

  
_Tampa, Florida_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good afternoon, welcome to today's Women's Final Four head coaches
media teleconference. For next 30 minutes you'll have the opportunity to visit
with the head coach of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish, Muffet McGraw, the
defending national champion. Notre Dame is making its ninth Final Four
appearance and seeking its third national championship.  
  
We'll take questions for Coach McGraw.  
  
Q. Was there a point during the season, a specific game, where you
thought you really may be good enough to get to Tampa and compete for the
national championship?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Honestly, we won a tournament in Vancouver over Thanksgiving,
played three ranked teams, played very well. I thought at that point when we
get healthy, because Marina Mabrey was just coming back, I knew we had a good
team, a lot of talent coming back, certainly had a big target on our back for
being defending champ. But I think it was evident pretty early on that we had
the talent to get here.  
  
Q. Your guards are basically the heart and soul of your team. They like
to play at a frenetic pace. You want an up-tempo game, don't you?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I do.  
  
Q. You and Geno both were at the same place, talk about your roots there
in Philadelphia, how it helped you become the coach you are.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Absolutely. I think Philadelphia was a great place at one
point. The Big 5 in its heyday, so many great men's coaches there. The women's
coaches were following suit. Cathy Rush, Immaculata, national champs. It was
not a big football area. None of the schools really had football in the city.
It was all about basketball.  
  
I think a lot of playing pickup, just having the camaraderie with all the
other women in the area and all the coaches. I mean, everybody just really got
along really well. It was fun place to be.  
  
Q. You were at Saint Joe's a year apart. Did you have any kind of
relationship, you and Geno, before you became the head coaches of the schools
you were at?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, we did. Through Jim Foster mostly. He was good friends
with Geno when I came on. We had some interactions at that point. Then he went
down to Virginia I think for a while, before he went up to Connecticut.  
  
We've known each other for, gosh, I don't want to say how many years, it's
been a long time. I think obviously playing in the Big East together, we saw
each other quite a bit.  
  
Q. I asked this of the other three coaches. In regard to the issue of
abusive language, things that coaches say, especially in the circumstances
with the ACC having one coach who lost her job, another who is suspended. Have
you found that you've had to change ways that you communicate with players
from when you were a player and how challenging is that?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think first it is incredibly challenging. I think it's an
emotional moment when you're in a game. Even in practice. I mean, I think for
coaches, I don't think people can appreciate the kind of stress we put on
ourselves, how we're always looking for perfection, how we're constantly going
over the same things over and over again.  
  
You have expectations for yourself, you have expectations for your program.
When you get to a point where you're not sure if you're meeting them or not, I
think it puts even more of a burden on the coach. I think the emotions get the
best of us.  
  
I think this generation is not tolerant. That's not a bad thing. But back in
the day, coaches could pretty much do anything, say anything. Nobody really
complained. Now they know better. They're demanding to be treated better.  
  
As far as the language, I think probably the women are very similar to the
men. I don't think there should be a double standard as to how they talk. But
women as players expect a different thing. I think male players probably can
take a little bit more in terms of language.  
  
It's a tough situation I think for everyone. I don't think it should ever
border over the line and go into abuse. I think kids are going to get yelled
at. They need to be able to take a little bit of that.  
  
Q. This is one of the great rivalries in sports now. This will be your
50th time playing UConn. Are there specific things from that first matchup
that you look at and say they apply going into Friday's game, or the fact it
was several months ago isn't really that relevant?  
MUFFET McGRAW: No, I think it's relevant. I think you can always look back and
see some things that you did, see some things that they did. When you're
watching the recent game, they're still running that or not running that as
much. They changed some defenses, playing things differently.  
  
It's always good to have that foundation. We don't know them quite as well as
we used to. It was good we were able to play them earlier this year to see how
that was going.  
  
Williams, that was the best game of her career. I don't think we'll find a
better game on film to watch to see how good she can be. I think we can take a
lot from that game.  
  
Q. I know you're not playing Oregon, but we talked to Kelly Graves this
morning about being the newcomer. He said, They had to win the first one
first. Reflect back on your first Final Four, first championship, how
different it feels now, if it does feel any different?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, the first one always is special when you get there. You
don't know what to expect. Everything's new. You're kind of giddy about
everything. Oh, I have to do six hours of media, I can't wait to get there.
It's so exciting to be here.  
  
I think when you've been there a couple of times, you try to find some ways to
have your kids continue to have fun. It becomes so much more businesslike. You
don't have a lot of free time. I think in that way, just knowing what to
expect helps a little bit. I don't think it ever gets old knowing you're in
the Final Four.  
  
Q. How good is it for college basketball? You and UConn have been there
back-to-back, Baylor is back for the first time since 2012, Oregon from the
west? What does that say about women's basketball to have that kind of
variance?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I thought the Pac-12 had a great year. They are a terrific
conference. To have them be represented in the Final Four is a great
accomplishment, especially seeing Oregon for the first time. They're a team
that everybody has been talking about all year long. Certainly Sabrina is one
of the highlights of conversation no matter who you're talking to about
women's college basketball. She's had a phenomenal year. I think people are
going to be excited to see her.  
  
Q. If you talk to teams that are No. 1 at the beginning of the year or
teams that essentially are anointed as finalists before any of the games
happen in any sport, coaches will tell you sometimes there's a real mental
weight that players have to endure throughout the year, the weight of
expectation. Even though your group got to where it wanted to go, the Final
Four, did you see any signs of that this year given so many people at the
beginning of the year anointed you guys as a team that was coming back no
matter what?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, that's a great question.  
  
We definitely felt that I think throughout the year. To be pre-season No. 1
was something I thought weighed a little bit heavier on us. We came out, we
played okay early in the season. There were times in January when the season
just seemed like it was so long. I think the team was fast forwarding to
March. This is kind of boring, could we just get to the tournament. We lost
our focus a little bit I think.  
  
Definitely the pressure probably helped a little bit, knowing that you're
supposed to win every game. Where is the fun? Where is the excitement? Where
is the joy? And we lost that.  
  
We actually met about that right before or after Christmas. I think it was
before Christmas. We talked about that. We got to have fun again. We're not
having enough fun.  
  
We did some things a little bit differently. I think we just came in with a
new attitude. I think that helped. Losing a couple games that you're not
supposed to lose is really good at regaining your focus, so we were able to do
that.  
  
It's almost like a relief when you get to the Final Four, when you're in that
position, the whole year, people keep saying your name as somebody that's
supposed to be there. That makes it a little bit harder, too. I am thrilled,
of course, to be here, but also I think a little more with relief than
excitement.  
  
Q. During the tournament I saw your team, if you want to use the phrase
play a little bit freer and without stress than they did at other times early
in the year. Would you agree with that?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I thought the ACC tournament was as well as we played all year.
We played great basketball. We won games by a pretty good margin. We had a lot
of fun. It was exciting to win. We got to the first and second round. I
thought same thing.  
  
In the Sweet 16, I thought we started to get a little tight again. Actually I
thought in the Stanford game, Abby Prohaska came off the bench and gave us
this huge lift. She makes a basket. I saw everybody on the team smiling on the
floor which they don't do very often. We needed something to break the
tension. So I think that was it.  
  
The Elite 8 game I think is one of the toughest games because there's so much
pressure to get to the next one.  
  
Q. Since the loss to Miami, 13 straight, 12 by 16 or more points, what
changed from that Miami game through the rest of the season? Do you think that
was a turning point for the team to get to the Final Four?  
MUFFET McGRAW: It was definitely a wake-up call. We lost to North Carolina,
but Jackie Young didn't play. In the back of our minds we had a little bit of
an excuse. That probably wasn't a good thing.  
  
We lost to Miami with a full roster. Now we had to take a good, hard look in
the mirror and say, What is going on here?  
  
I think it was great for us to be able to refocus. We came back and I don't
think -- we won by a pretty comfortable margin the rest of the way. I think it
was between that, that point in the season, where March was suddenly very
close. You could see it coming. We didn't have the grind of January, which we
did during the North Carolina game. We had a little more focus because we
could see the finish.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how this team is different from last year. You
returned a lot of players. That's obviously why everybody expected you to be
back here. How have you changed, gotten better?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, the biggest difference is Brianna Turner. Her defensive
presence, I think she's the best defensive player in the country. She was the
ACC Defensive Player of the Year. She changes the game inside for us. We're
not a great defensive team and she makes us better because she's a shot-
blocker in the back but can switch out and guard the point guard. She has made
us a lot better at the defensive end.  
  
Offensively she's playing above the rim, which nobody could do last year.
There were times last year when we would be looking for ways to get that weak
side pin, throw the ball inside. Jess Shepard is a phenomenal post player, but
she's more of a power player than Brianna. I think Bri helps our break. We
have somebody in there that can get 10 rebounds a game. We're much better in
that way.  
  
We also lost two really smart, good passing post players. That has been
probably the thing we've been trying to sort of regroup on.  
  
Q. Is there a different kind of confidence with this team because you
did win it all last year, you know what it takes?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we're confident, but I don't think you ever can look
and say, We did it before. We can do it again, but you know how tough it's
going to be. We won each game by a basket. It wasn't as if we were just
intimidating everyone.  
  
I think going into this one, it's different. The competition is going to be
the same in the first round. Two other different teams coming in. I think
we're looking at it just as it is: this year, new season, new team, see how
far we can go.  
  
RICK NIXON: Muffet, thank you for taking the time. It's been a busy 24 hours.
Congratulations again. We look forward to seeing you in Tampa.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: Thank you. See you soon.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: WOMEN'S FINAL
FOUR](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+CHAMPIONSHIP%3A+WOMEN%27S+FINAL+FOUR)

  

## April 2, 2019

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

  
_Tampa, Florida_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good morning or good afternoon. Welcome to today's women's Final
Four head coach media teleconference. For the next 30 minutes you'll have the
opportunity to visit with the head coach of the Oregon Ducks, Kelly Graves.
Oregon is participating in its first ever Women's Final Four in 2019.  
  
Kelly, if you would, start with an opening statement.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: We are definitely thrilled to be participating in the Final
Four. The last couple years, we've gotten to the Elite 8. Quite frankly, fell
short. The first year against UConn, they destroyed us. We really played no
good quarters in that game. We weren't quite ready for that stage. We got a
little bit better last year. But in the end weren't good enough to get Notre
Dame.  
  
I know one of the focuses this year was to get here to a Final Four. We didn't
want to be an Elite 8 program, we wanted to be a Final Four program. I know
our players were hungry and really determined to get there. Now that it's
here, we're certainly excited.  
  
To be going against really Hall of Fame coaches is a little bit daunting, but
at the same time it's exciting. We're looking forward to the opportunity to
compete there.  
  
RICK NIXON: We'll take questions for Coach Graves.  
  
Q. Two years ago or when you played UConn, you weren't prepared for the
stage. What makes you feel your team is ready for this stage now to be in this
Final Four, crashing the party with three teams that have won multiple
national championships?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I don't know if it was Sesame Street or Electric Station,
one of those shows where one of the these is not like the other. Obviously
we're a little bit different. But those programs and those coaches had to win
their first, as well, get to their first Final Four. It's a new experience for
us.  
  
We've had a lot of tension thrown on us. We've had some tournament experience.
This group has now won 10 NCAA tournament games. I just think it was
incremental progress. We finally were able to win that Elite 8 game, kind of
break through.  
  
Are we going to be ready? I don't know. That remains to be seen. I think our
kids are going to be prepared and we're going to fight, I know that.  
  
Q. About the matchup, clearly people look at UConn and Notre Dame, but
you're playing Baylor, the No. 1 overall seed, talk about the daunting
challenge of Baylor, what you see of them as you watch them on film.  
KELLY GRAVES: Really impressive. We got together as a team yesterday and
watched that game. It's a contrast of styles in some ways. They love that
high-low game. I know the three-point shot is not a huge part of what they do.
It is for us.  
  
It's going to be difficult to defend them because we just haven't played
anybody like that this year. I wouldn't say they're old school. When I was at
Gonzaga, we used to play high-low basketball, but it was tough for me to get
centers of the caliber of Lauren Cox and Kalani Brown. We changed to more of a
perimeter-oriented style.  
  
We've got our work cut out for us. They're not just tall, they're skilled. It
looks like sometimes they play volleyball with each other. They're just
throwing it up and over the opponents. There's no question, we got our work
cut out for us.  
  
Q. One of the things when you talk to women's college basketball coaches
who have been in multiple Final Fours, they say a lot of times you sort of
have to go through the experience to understand all the things that sort of
surround the kids and the program, all the commitments that are required
during the couple-day stretch. Have you tried to anticipate what the kids will
have to do, from family commitments to everything else? That's one of the
things that's very hard to simulate?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, great question. I guess you don't know till you actually
go through it that first time. But I reached out to a couple of my coaching
colleagues who had been to the Final Four, including Dana Altman, who was our
men's basketball coach, went to the Final Four a couple years ago, his first
one. I asked him about things that worked, things that didn't, what to expect,
how we can do it better and different, prepare our kids for us. We talked
about it as a team.  
  
The reality is, until you go through it, you don't know. Hopefully we'll help
them navigate some of this. But again, until we've actually been through it...  
  
I see Kim Mulkey and Geno, Muffet, they had to go through their first time,
too. We had to get here at some point.  
  
Q. Was there a point or a game during the season where you said to
yourself, We may be good enough to get to Tampa and compete for the national
championship?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I thought two games that really stood out for us. The
first Mississippi State game. They had been there, they had been to the
championship game two years in a row. We were able to win what was, again, a
great, great team at the time back in December.  
  
Then when we went down to Stanford and beat Stanford. Listen, they're the
standard by which we're all judged out here in the west. We were able to take
it to them the way we did. I thought those were real good barometers as to how
good we could be, when we were playing at our best, what we could accomplish.  
  
Obviously we played pretty well during the tournament. I would say those are
two of the moments during the year. I would add maybe one more. I thought the
semifinal game in the conference tournament, we were really banged up, playing
on little or no rest. Listen, I know everybody is banged up a little bit at
this juncture. I thought the way we gutted that win out and beat a very good
UCLA team, I thought also told me, hey, this team has the championship mettle,
the toughness you're going to need to get to a Final Four.  
  
Q. The atmosphere was electric in Portland. How important was it playing
there?  
KELLY GRAVES: I thought it was huge. We won the game because we executed well
and made baskets and defended the way we needed to. But there's no question
the crowd helped. There are those moments in the game when you need just a
little extra boost of adrenaline perhaps, and they gave it to us.  
  
I thought it was a great showcase for women's basketball. That Mississippi
State game, I'm telling you, that's one of the best-played games I've
certainly ever been a part of and one of the best tournament games I've seen.  
  
But, yeah, I thought it was great. There were times literally when sound had
feel. If you've been in some of those venues, you felt that, you know what I'm
talking about. That definitely happened that day.  
  
Q. Especially this time of year is conducive to buzzer-beaters. Do you
devote a practice period every now and again, crazy last-second situations
that might arise?  
KELLY GRAVES: We do. We do. We practice them pretty much every day. Sometimes
you have to get on the kids. I'll go, Okay, let's go late game. A lot of it's
dry run kind of stuff. They kind of, like, go through the motions sometimes
because we do it so much. I keep telling them that there's going to come a
time when we're going to need this and have to execute it perfectly.  
  
Yes, I think every coach does.  
  
Q. A lot of attention has been given to Sabrina and Satou. Can you talk
a little bit about the contributions of the other players, like Maite?  
KELLY GRAVES: That's a great question. Yeah, Satou, Sabrina and Ruthy get a
ton of attention. It's well-deserved, no question about it. They've certainly
had a great NCAA tournament.  
  
I think with any team, you got to have those unsung stars. Maite is that for
us. In many ways she's our most important player. She allows Sabrina to play
off the ball a little bit more, kind of do her thing when she does have the
ball. Maite is the one that brings the ball up, she's the one that organizes,
gets us into our offense. She's obviously made timely shots like she did the
other night. I thought her three-pointer late in the game against Mississippi
State was really the dagger.  
  
She's calm. She's one of the most quiet superstars you're going to see. Great
defender. She's our best defender, awesome feet.  
  
Erin Boley, she's that sniper from the perimeter. She can stretch the defense,
allows Ruthy more space inside to work. She allows Sabrina and Satou more
driving lanes because she spreads out that defense. She hasn't shot it well in
the tournament yet, but we all believe in her and know on any given night she
can let it fly.  
  
They've all contributed, had big games. I think we have four different players
that have 30-plus games this season, not many teams can say that. Our bench
has really given us a lift, especially Oti, she seems to come up in the NCAA
tournament. We're certainly more than those three All-Americans.  
  
Q. What is the most impressive thing that you've seen on tape so far
about Baylor?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I think they're more than just the two. Those two are very
similar to Ruthy and Sabrina for us. There are other really good parts. I
think Chloe Jackson, man, she is terrific. I remember watching her at LSU a
few times.  
  
But they're long, they're athletic, they can run a whole bunch of different
players at you, change styles if they need to. They shoot it, they're not a
prolific three-point shooting team, but a really good shooting team,
especially from the midrange.  
  
I think defensively they create a lot. They're so good in transition. I mean,
if I keep talking like this, I'm going to psych myself out. There's a reason
they're the No. 1 overall seed. They seem to be determined this year, as well.
They've added that.  
  
Q. Going into this Baylor game having two games, an analog for a 6'7 "
player, what does it take for Ruthy to come up again in that matchup, the rest
of the front court, what is it going to be like for them, to go against a
player like Lauren Cox, who is so big and strong inside?  
KELLY GRAVES: It's different. It's different than anything we've seen and had
to defend. I think it is a help, though, that we had to go through trying to
stop a powerful post player like Teaira. We have some experience and we know
it can be done even though I don't know what she ended up with that night,
maybe 19 and 15. Not like we held her down.  
  
We have some experience with one. It's the second that is so different. But
Ruthy, she is a hard, hard worker. She's a talented player herself. She's
strong and determined, but she's also going to need help. You can't stop those
players, that inside presence, with just one player. We're not built that way.
It's going to have to be a team defense to do it. We're all going to have to
be dialed in.  
  
My coaching staff is going to have to come up with a heck of a game plan to
make it work. Nobody stopped it yet. That's why they are where they are.
Hopefully we're the first team that can figure out that puzzle.  
  
Q. The four teams have 10 losses between them. Maybe people are
picturing you as a Cinderella. You lost four games. Is everyone here capable
of winning this thing?  
KELLY GRAVES: I certainly think so. I think if you get to that point, sure. No
doubt about that.  
  
Obviously the Pac-12 is a tough conference. We only lost two games in the
league, and both of those were one without Ruthy for the entire game, it came
down to the last possession, then one at Oregon State where she missed pretty
much the entire game. Even two of our losses were against really good teams
that made it to the Sweet 16 and without maybe our most dominant player.  
  
There's no shame in losing on the third day against Stanford in the conference
championship. We've had quality losses. Even though we have the most of all
the teams here, I think we're certainly capable on any given night of beating
anybody. We've proven that. The way we shoot the basketball, we're always in a
game. There's no doubt in my mind.  
  
Yeah, we may be the underdog going in, sure. I know our kids believe. We're
going to go in and fight. We're going to compete. That's who we are.  
  
Q. Obviously Sabrina has had a fantastic career for you all. What in
your mind is the most impressive thing about her?  
KELLY GRAVES: Consistency. I mean, that young lady competes every day. She
plays to win every drill, every sprint, every shooting contest, every
scrimmage. It's just who she is and how she's wired. That's rubbed off on
everybody.  
  
It's hard to put your finger sometimes on exactly what makes her so great.
That's one of them. The other is the competitive greatness, that drive she has
and the will to win.  
  
I saw she was going to have the game she did against Mississippi State. I saw
it in her eyes that day. You could look at some of the quotes from the day
before. I just saw a twinkle in her eye. That's who she is. That's how she's
driven. She's made for moments like that, games like that.  
  
She just has those intangibles that you can't really teach. On top of that
she's a highly skilled player. It's more than her playing hard, a lot of
people play hard, but she plays smart and has great, great skills. Her vision
is as good as any I've coached, and I coached Courtney Vandersloot who holds
records in the WNBA and college basketball. I've been fortunate to coach two
of the elite point guards in college basketball, and she's one of them.  
  
Q. You saw the twinkle in her eye the day before?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yes. The day before and the day of. You can tell. I can tell
those games when she's determined to go out and either get a triple-double or
whatever. I know that young lady pretty well. She's just wired differently.  
  
Q. Some of the issues we've had, including pretty recently with two ACC
teams, of coaches being accused of abusive behavior, where that line is. Coach
Auriemma talked about how that's very difficult to determine where the line
is, how players sometimes take things differently than coaches mean them, then
coaches are afraid of players at some point. From your perspective, how do you
feel about that? Have you had to change anything about the way you coach based
on generational differences?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, I have. I'm a demanding coach still. For the most part I
would consider myself a player's coach. Yeah, especially as a male coach, you
have to approach things a little bit differently.  
  
Geno is a heck of a lot smarter and far more eloquent than I am. I would agree
with most of what he says.  
  
I don't know, honestly, about the cases you're talking about. I've seen the
little ticker down below on SportsCenter stuff, but I don't know the
particulars so I can't really comment fully.  
  
But, yeah, I think as a male, it's not just a gender thing, but you're right,
players can misconstrue what you say. They read into tone maybe more than they
should. I know that I have always taken measures to, any time I talk with a
player about their role or about things they could do better to help the team,
I try to do it in front of the rest of the team. I always, always talk with a
player, if it's a personal issue or anything like that, with another assistant
in the office with me.  
  
My offices have windows. My doors are always open. I just long ago figured out
you have to take some safeguards about all that kind of stuff because you just
never know. You almost always have a female coach in with me when I talk to a
player.  
  
I don't know if that answers what you were looking for. I think you have to
adapt a little bit to this generation. They are different. They are wired
differently. They think differently. I think the best coaches figure out how
they can communicate differently with their players as they change.  
  
Q. From a strategic perspective of playing Baylor, this is a team that
doesn't shoot the three much, although they can, what is it like when you're
going against a team that you kind of know that is not generally how they beat
anybody, how you approach that defensively?  
KELLY GRAVES: I don't know. This is a very unique experience for us, unique
scout. We haven't had two players like this. We've defended one really, really
good post player. But to have two that are equally skilled and can play inside
and outside, it's going to be unique.  
  
I don't know. We're going to try to figure that out. Like I said, Stanford is
the only one that figured out that puzzle this year. We're hoping to be the
second.  
  
I can rely a little bit on the experiences as a Gonzaga coach because I used
to play high-low. I believed in it, loved it, we were good at it. A young
guard named Courtney Vandersloot came around and I stayed with that style of
spreading people out.  
  
I've looked at some of my old notes. I always keep a log of how people tried
to play us when we played high-low basketball. We'll see if that works. It
didn't work all the time for our opponents when we played at Gonzaga in the
WCC. Hopefully we can figure out how to stop Baylor.  
  
Q. When you're facing offensively and kind of try to neutralize their
shot-blocking ability, do you hope the perimeter shot can work to your
advantage?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, yeah, I hope so. The other side of that is if they do
shoot perimeter shots, you've got to go block out not just those two, but they
have other players that can crash the boards pretty hard. I've played against
teams that sometimes the first offense is the offensive rebound. They can do a
little bit of everything. That's, again, what makes them so tough.  
  
We're trying to figure this out. We've only had one day, not even a full day,
to scout them and to really dive into what they do. I've got an amazing staff,
as you well know. They've come up with pretty good game plans all year long. I
anticipate they're going to do the same thing.  
  
We'll have our kids ready and have them scouted as well as we possibly can.  
  
Q. Stanford and their strategy to push the pace on Ruthy, Mississippi
State didn't do that with McCowan, but it looks like Baylor could do that with
Kalani Brown. What do you try to do with Ruthy this week to get her prepared
for a team that might try to do that again?  
KELLY GRAVES: I think that strategy by Stanford was as much three games in
three days as it was anything else. I think Ruthy runs the floor well. That's
never been an issue for us. You might want to make her run, fine, she can run
with any center in the country.  
  
The strategy for Stanford that night was that's her third game. She had just
come off an injury. They knew they were going to be able to run her. That
might be a strategy they try to employ. I think we've done a good job in post-
season of sending two players back most of the time against transition teams.
I think we're going to be fine in that regard. Ruthy is as strong as she's
been in a month. She'll be ready to go.  
  
Lauren and Kalani can run the floor, no questions for players their size. It's
not that their jets. They're certainly capable of pushing tempo.  
  
Q. Sabrina, with a minute to go, makes the shot. You were unbelievably
composed in what was probably one of the bigger moments in a basketball game
in your career. How did you stay that composed in that moment?  
KELLY GRAVES: You saw that little wristband I've been wearing. I have the word
on there 'calmness'. I told the team that calmness comes from trusting your
team. I trusted and knew that that's who Sabrina is. She's going to make those
kind of baskets.  
  
Yeah, I think there was still a lot of game to be played. That was a six-point
game about a buck 20. No reason to get too high at that moment. Anyway, yeah.
I thought the dagger was Maite's 30 seconds later, three-point she hit.  
  
Q. One of Baylor's X factors is DiDi Richards. What is your goal to keep
her off the boards?  
KELLY GRAVES: We've seen enough tape to realize how good she is. I think
that's a mistake anybody could make when they watch Baylor, is thinking, We
have to stop the high-low game. You do, but there's a lot of other players on
that team that can play. Richards is certainly one of them. Athletic fluidly.
We have a player similar to her in Satou. It will be a nice matchup if those
two are matched up.  
  
But, yeah, sometimes a good part of their offense is that offensive rebound.
We're going to have to really, really focus on blocking out, no question,
going to get the ball, because they're certainly good at it.  
  
RICK NIXON: Thank you so much, Coach Graves. We appreciate it. Safe travels.
Look forward to seeing you here in Tampa.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Awesome. I appreciate the time.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP: WOMEN'S FINAL

## April 2, 2019

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_Tampa, Florida_  
  
RICK NIXON: Good morning and welcome to today's women's Final Four head coach
media teleconference. For the next 30 minutes, you'll have the opportunity to
visit with the head coach of the UConn Huskies, Geno Auriemma.  
  
UConn is making a record 12th straight appearance in the Women's Final Four in
2019. It will be the 20th overall appearance for the Huskies, and they'll be
seeking their record 12th national championship.  
  
At this point I'll ask Coach Auriemma to provide an opening statement, then
we'll take questions.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Thank you.  
  
Obviously it's that time of the year when only the good teams are left. That's
one of the unique things about our game. I think the guys are starting to find
that out this year. You get to this point in the season, Sweet 16, Final 8,
all the 1 and 2 seeds, all the best teams in the country are left standing.
You're going to have to beat a bunch of really, really good teams if you want
to win a national championship. There's very few surprises year in and year
out. This certainly is no exception. I don't think anybody is surprised the
remaining six or seven schools. To be in the Final Four, I don't think anybody
is surprised at the four that are in.  
  
We had a great weekend up in Albany. We really had to play some great, great
basketball against two really, really good teams. We found out a little bit
about our team that weekend. Even though it's a quick turnaround, you got to
get ready for an even better team Friday night.  
  
As tough as this weekend was, Friday's going to be even tougher. I think we're
playing the best team in the country. If you look at their lineup, the amount
of scorers that they have, experience that they have, just the quality of
their players, I think it's a formidable task for us and I think for anybody
to beat a team like that.  
  
I was really impressed with the way Notre Dame has played throughout the
tournament, and last night was no exception. Our team, obviously we're playing
really, really well right now, with a lot of confidence. We're going to need
all that on Friday.  
  
RICK NIXON: We'll take questions for Coach Auriemma.  
  
Q. There's another send-off rally scheduled for noon. In the past few 12
of these, these trips have taken on a feeling of routine. It feels a little
different this year. Can you discuss how and why it feels different to the
team and the fan base?  
GENO AURIEMMA: It's odd in a lot of ways. It's odd because what would be
viewed as a magical season at every single school in America except ours. This
is a struggle, man. 35-2, I don't know how they managed to do this. I have no
idea how they managed because it's so unlike them. I mean, two losses in one
year... It's remarkable that they're in the Final Four with two losses. It's
the most bizarre thing I've ever experienced.  
  
But it's commonplace here. I'm thrilled that there's this feeling of joy
because these accomplishments are meant to be celebrated. I do think our fan
base has become spoiled. I do think they've lost sense of reality. Hopefully
this year they realize this is really hard.  
  
The fact that we're going to 12 straight Final Fours, that shouldn't mean that
it's easy or we should expect to be there every single year by birthright. So
I'm glad people are reacting the way they're reacting. It's about time.  
  
Q. You and Muffet are a similar age, were at Saint Joe's within a year
of each other, you left as she came in.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Right.  
  
Q. Talk about your time in the Philadelphia area, how that contributed
to the way you coach and your career.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, sure.  
  
I think we're all products of where we grew up. Every one of us is shaped by
our environment and the people we were in contact with growing up.  
  
I think, for sure, where I grew up, where Muffet grew up, where we coached,
kind of places that we were fortunate enough to coach at, the people that we
came in contact with, either that we worked with or just had an opportunity to
associate with, had a great influence on me especially.  
  
You take on that personality and that kind of attitude. I imagine it's still
there. I've been gone from Philadelphia for a long time, but I imagine it's
part of the city, part of the basketball community.  
  
When I left Philadelphia, the problem is, I felt I knew everything about
everything, people in Philadelphia had invented the game of basketball. I
needed to go to a place like the University of Virginia to realize that, well,
not really. There's a lot of great places to learn about basketball. There's a
lot of great environments that can shape you. So I was fortunate to be able to
do that.  
  
I think growing up where I grew up, how I grew up, the people that I got to
associate with, no question has kind of made me in some ways the coach that I
am today.  
  
Q. You played Notre Dame obviously earlier this year. How useful is the
tape of that game? Specific to this team, I'm not sure there's a system or a
coaching staff maybe that you know better than them. Is the game tape earlier
this year effective or as it always has been for so many years, does it really
come down to execution at the specific time in that specific game against such
a good program?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, I don't think that a game that you play in December is
really going to tell you a whole lot about a game that you play in the Final
Four. There was a few years ago when we played -- Stewie was here, we played
Notre Dame, I think we lost to them three times in the same year, then beat
them really good in the Final Four. That Final Four game had nothing in common
with the previous three games.  
  
So, yeah, that was the case this weekend when we played Louisville. I think
when you play somebody once, you do get a feel for who they are, what they
are. But we already know that. We play them every year. We certainly have come
to know them and respect them, admire how they play.  
  
There isn't anything that you're going to be able to come up with and go, I
think I got an idea. I think we can show them something they've not seen
before. I don't know that you can do that. I think that this time of the year
you got to go in and outplay them. That's not easy for anybody to do.  
  
Q. This is the 30-year anniversary of your first NCAA tournament team
with Kerry and Wendy and Debbie. I know it's a lifetime ago. Is there anything
that sticks out in your mind about that team all these years later?  
GENO AURIEMMA: The only thing that's the same is that we were not the favorite
going down to the Final Four, not when you had teams like Virginia, Stanford,
Tennessee. We were not even close to being in the conversation.  
  
I think this year, we lost at Baylor, we lost at Louisville. I think there was
the sense of Connecticut doesn't have it this year, it's not one of their
better teams. I don't think anybody, when the NCAA tournament started, was
saying, Connecticut is the team to beat.  
  
We were undersized. We were counting on a couple seniors and a couple young
players. But in terms of where our program is, where the NCAA tournament is,
all that, it does seem like a lifetime ago. Sometimes I can't believe that
it's the same program. I reminded my players in the locker room after the
Louisville game, I said, I haven't felt like this since the first Final Four
in 1991. I think that was the last time I felt that feeling in the locker
room.  
  
They all looked at me: 1991? I don't even know if their parents were born in
1991 (laughter). So, yeah, things are completely different.  
  
Q. You as somebody who loves sports, all sports, can appreciate the
greatness of a rivalry. Can you put into context playing a team 50 times.
Obviously you know each other so well, but there's so many rich storylines
throughout that. Also, maybe comment specifically on this Notre Dame team.
There's so much emphasis on how many points their offense has scored, but what
makes this team particularly difficult to face?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, the fact that we were in the same league for a bunch of
years, and at times we would end up playing each other four times, you add
them all up, that's a lot of games. Then you throw in the NCAA tournament
games.  
  
There were a lot of memorable regular-season games, a lot of memorable NCAA
games with a lot on the line. There were some incredibly memorable NCAA Final
Four games, championship games where we're still I think the only teams that
would play in the championship game when both teams were undefeated. So much,
so much, so many great players on both sides, so many great stories.  
  
Even now when we're in different leagues, it seems like that hasn't changed,
that that same intensity level, that same anticipation is still there. I
always think when the season starts, Okay, no matter how far we go in the
tournament, at some point, if we go far enough, we're going to have to play
Notre Dame. It generally turns out that way.  
  
This team I think is one of the best teams they've ever had because they're
really not missing anything. There's no place where you can really exploit
because they've got great guard play, they've got players at every position
that are capable of taking over a game at any time. You saw last night, Arike
went to the bench with three fouls and Jackie Young just took over the game.  
  
People talk about Notre Dame, the first people they talk about is Arike, then
they talk about Jessica Shepard. Then you have a kid like Jackie Young. You
know you have a great team when maybe your best player is kind of the unsung
hero of your team, and she proves it every big game.  
  
They're big, they're athletic enough, they're really tough, they're explosive.
I mean, I don't know. Unless Notre Dame plays poorly, which you have to hope
for. When we played them at their place, we played great and I'm not sure they
played their best game. This is one of those instances, for us anyway, I
remember being in the Final Four lots of times and saying, If we play our A
game, we can't lose no matter what the other team does. This is one of the
times where if we don't play our A game, we're going to get blown out. Even if
we play our A game, we still could lose. That's how good they are.  
  
Q. There's been a lot of great Final Fours with great players. I think
people are excited about this because of obviously you guys, 20-time Final
Four appearances, then a team like Oregon making its first breakthrough with
players like Sabrina Ionescu. We're seeing east to west, south with Baylor, an
interesting group of Final Four participants and the individual players that
are in it.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Notre Dame and UConn, people have come to notice one or both of
us has a pretty good chance year in and year out, because that's the way it's
played out, to be in the Final Four.  
  
Baylor is back. They haven't been there since 2012, something like that. Saw
some graphic last night. Then Oregon for the first time. When Kelly Graves got
the job at Oregon, I remember telling the people at Nike, I said, I think
they're going to be in the Final Four in four years. I said, He's a really
good coach, and Oregon is going to obviously do whatever they need to do,
they're going to get great. It took them five years, I think.  
  
I'm not surprised that Baylor is back, obviously. I mean, they've already won
two titles. I'm not surprised Oregon is there, given Kelly is a terrific
coach, what they had to offer.  
  
But I think it speaks to the quality of play throughout the country, that
there's a lot of schools, Oregon is a perfect example, you get the right
person in there, you give them all the resources that they need. UCLA is
another example, we played them the other night, of teams that 10 years ago,
15 years ago, no one gave them a second thought, now they're contenders.
That's happening all over the country. The fact that a great program like
Baylor has not been to a Final Four in a few years, that shows you how tough
it is to get there.  
  
The game has never been more competitive, I think. When people ask me about
going to a Final Four for 12 years, stop asking me because I don't have words
to describe this. It's not normal. It's bizarre. I know how hard it is. These
teams that go there every year prove how hard it is.  
  
Q. After the last game, Muffet and Arike apologized to their fans for
what happened. I went back and watched the video last night. Arike hip checked
Crystal from behind, then she was not called for that, then she was called for
a foul when she grabbed her from behind around the neck or head. Did you think
that Arike owed Crystal an apology, or it's part of this greatest rivalry in
women's basketball? How do you keep your players poised through all this?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I think emotions run pretty high, especially in a game like
that. I remember there were some unbelievably emotional, difficult times when
we played Tennessee a couple times every year. I remember there was a
tremendous amount of back and forth going at each other in our Rutgers series.  
  
We've been through this a lot. We've been through this a lot. The emotions of
a Notre Dame-Connecticut game run really high. Arike is an emotional player.
Had some of those. I wish I had more of them. Things happen during the course
of the game.  
  
I don't think you can get caught up in what's going on that is going to affect
how you're going to play, the way the game is meant to be played. I don't
think anybody owes anybody an apology for anything. I'm going to do what I'm
going to do. If you don't like it, that's your problem. The referees have an
obligation to decide is that appropriate or not appropriate.  
  
I didn't expect an apology, nor do I need one, nor do I think one was
necessary. Players are emotional. Coaches are emotional. Things get said.
Things get done. You just move on.  
  
Q. Looking back, is this guy playing possum? When you were in Tampa a
while back, you said this may be the first time in Tampa you're sitting in the
stands and not on the bench. You meant it obviously.  
GENO AURIEMMA: You guys didn't believe me (laughter).  
  
Q. I believe you now. Having said that, how wide open do you think this
Final Four is? 10 losses between the four teams. Oregon is seen as a
Cinderella. They've lost four times. What kind of show is this going to be?  
GENO AURIEMMA: That's what I mean. I mean, there's this crazy perception out
there that if you lose once or twice... In men's basketball, if you lose once
or twice, that's not a bad month, you know. You lose twice in one month,
that's not bad. You come out with five or six at the end of the season, that's
okay. We've had a great year.  
  
Women's basketball, people are a little bit whacky. I think when you look at
the teams that are in the Final Four, there's just a lot of contrast. It's an
exciting Final Four because you've got different aspects to all four teams.
All four teams have certain strengths, they all have certain weaknesses,
although some have more strengths and some have more weaknesses, some have
less of both.  
  
I just think it's exciting because all four teams are used to winning. All
four teams have kind of thought of themselves as Final Four teams all year
long. All four teams have been in a little bit of a struggle to get there.  
  
I think it's going to be great for the fans. I'll tell you what, it's got a
ways to go to top last year's Final Four. Who knows? Maybe even the people on
TV will start talking about us.  
  
Q. You milking this underdog thing?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Underdog? We were the No. 2 seed in Albany. My friend Jeff Walz
kept saying, Louisville is the underdog, Connecticut is great, blah, blah,
blah.  
  
If three of my players don't come out for the opening tip, they're like,
Connecticut is going to only win by three, they're playing with two guys.
There's no such thing as us being the underdog in some people's eyes.  
  
Q. In light of a lot of what's gone on in college basketball over the
past few years, a lot of conversation about coaches being over the line and
players complaining, there being legitimate issues, as well. How do you as a
coach handle and figure out where that line is between motivation and going
too far? More to the point, what do we need to have within the industry to be
able to get that understanding? A lot of times I feel like players don't know
where that line is, but coaches too. Almost like you're driving on the road
without knowing what the speed limit is. What do you think should be done to
give everyone guidance?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I think everybody's different. Everybody has to coach to their
personality. Some people are very demonstrative, way out there. I've seen
coaches, male and female, completely lose it on the sideline, on their
players, on the officials, on everybody.  
  
Some people are very reserved. Some people act like they're very reserved and
play the holier than thou, then behind closed doors, when nobody's looking,
they're a whole different human being.  
  
Everybody's got to coach to their personality. Some people are better at
hiding it than others. Some coaches clap all the time. Some coaches are
miserable all the time. Some are somewhere in between.  
  
It's harder today than it's ever been to motivate players. I think what a lot
of coaches have done is, Okay, fine. If you don't want to get in your stance
and play defense, you don't have to. You don't want to run back on defense,
you don't have to. You don't want to pass the ball to your teammates, you
don't have to. I think coaches have given in. I'm a man-to-man coach. Well,
nobody wants to listen to me, we'll just play zone for the whole year.  
  
I think coaches have become afraid. Coaches are afraid of their players. The
majority of coaches in America are afraid of their players. The NCAA and the
athletic directors and society has made them afraid of their players. Every
article you read, this guy is a bully, this woman is a bully, this guy went
over the line, this woman was inappropriate. Everything you read.  
  
Yet the players get off Scot free and everything. They can do whatever they
want. They don't like something you say to them, they transfer. The NCAA goes,
Oh, somebody got mad at you because you didn't box out, that's dramatic, you
can go to another school.  
  
Coaches have to coach with one hand behind their back. Why? Because some
people have abused the role of a coach.  
  
Q. There's this dichotomy, there are coaches who are motivating, there
are coaches who have abused that power. Do you think something like a panel of
coaches coming together, trying to set some standards, guidelines, would allow
there to be a way to measure this, a measure of protection for coaches and
players at the same time?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I don't know. I don't know that there is. I don't know that
there is. I don't think you're ever going to be able to legislate someone's
emotions, someone's passion. Who is the judge and jury of that's passion,
that's over the line? One person's over the line might be another person's
passion.  
  
People gave Tom Izzo a lot of grief for something he did on the sideline. His
players loved that. He doesn't have to care what you think of it. He just has
to care what his players think of it. If his players all transferred, if his
players all quit on him, then he went over the line. If his players play
really hard for him, they keep winning, they love him, they keep coming back
to the program, then that's passion.  
  
Maybe people need to look at, like, what do the people that are involved, how
do they react. You're raising your kids. Are we going to have a judge and jury
that says this is how you raise your kid. You're being passionate with the
kids, you're over the line with the kids.  
  
Why don't you let the kids that are adults, young adults, 18, 19, 20 years
old, why don't you let them decide. If you don't like it, leave, transfer. Who
are we to stand on the sideline and watch people do their job and go, That's
inappropriate. There are things that are inappropriate. We all know what they
are. Everybody knows what they are.  
  
That's up to us and up to the athletic director, to the president. That's up
to the people that are directly involved to make that decision. It's not for
us to stand three thousand miles away and go, That's inappropriate.  
  
Who wants to come into your house and tell you how to raise your children,
what you can say, what you can do, what it means? I mean, enough already. Let
people fend for themselves. I mean, I get we have to keep an eye on things. We
don't want people to abuse the system. I get that. I'm all in favor of that.  
  
I just find it a little bit disconcerting that more and more coaches are being
told, This is inappropriate, you're not acting the right way. What is the
right way and who is going to decide what the right way is? I don't know what
the answer to that is.  
  
Q. If you don't know, I certainly don't know.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Hey, I'm probably the biggest culprit in the country, so who
the hell am I to talk?  
  
RICK NIXON: Again, Geno, thank you for your time today. We look forward to
seeing you in Tampa.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Thank you.

_Albany, New York_  
  
Connecticut - 80, Louisville - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by student-athletes and head coach Jeff Walz.
Again, student-athletes joining us, Sam Fuehring, Arica Carter, and Asia Durr.  
  
Coach, as it customary, we'd like to begin with an opening statement from you.  
  
JEFF WALZ: First, I'd like to thank the MAAC and everyone involved in putting
this Regional on. I thought everything was fantastic. I thought it was first
class. Everybody that I encountered was nothing but helpful, and we greatly
appreciate that.  
  
I'd like to congratulate UConn, of course, in what was a great basketball
game, a game that went right down to the wire. I was really proud of our young
women. We didn't quit, refused to quit, continued to compete, and that's what
you ask of them. I tell them all the time, if you're going to lose a
basketball game, just make sure you lose because you're not making shots.  
  
In the first half, to be honest with you, we had some great looks. We just
couldn't put the ball in the basket. We are who we are. We're a jump shooting
team. We're not a take it to the hole and-one, pound it in the paint, we're a
jump shooting team, and we have been all season. And we've been pretty good at
it. You don't get to this point if you're not pretty good. But unfortunately,
we just couldn't get some shots that normally go down to go down in the first
half. But we kept our head up, and we continued to fight.  
  
It sucks. I feel for these three young women here that have just given
everything that they have to our program, to our city, to the university, and
they've been nothing but outstanding role models. You can't put a price tag on
what these young women do, the impact they've had in our city. It's been
pretty remarkable, and I love them all. They'll be missed, but will never be
forgotten because they'll always be a part of our family.  
  
Thank you.  
  
Q. Asia, that last two minutes, you guys were down 11, could have thrown
in the towel, but just talk about the rally you had to cut it to have a chance
to win the game and what it shows about the heart of this team.  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, we fought back hard. We created some nice turnovers, Dana got
a steal, A.C. got a steal. We came back and scored both times. But I went to
the line and missed two big free throws. I mean, we fought hard, and that's
what shows -- I don't even know what I'm trying to say. That's what makes us
us. We don't stop fighting. It really doesn't matter how much we're down by.  
  
I'm just super proud of my teammates. We just kept fighting. That's all you
could ask for.  
  
Q. Asia, how frustrating was it for you? You started the game 0 for 8
from the field and then 1 for 10 at the half. Were you just thinking they'll
start going down eventually, or does it get into your head?  
ASIA DURR: No, you just stay patient. It's not the first time I went 1 for 10
throughout the whole year. I've had bad nights too. It's not the first time it
took place. I just tried to find my teammates out there on the court, but I
feel like I should have been more patient.  
  
Q. This is a question actually for Sam. Sam, I'm wondering, when you
think about the days and weeks ahead, how much is the focus shifting to
professional opportunities, and do you feel like you're ready for that
opportunity being in the WNBA?  
SAM FUEHRING: I'm honestly not focusing on that right now. I've got a few
things to work out before I can even focus on my future ahead.  
  
JEFF WALZ: Graduate.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Amen.  
  
Q. Arica, when Asia was having trouble scoring -- although she had like
10 boards in the first half -- you other guards kind of stepped in and filled
that stat sheet and kept yourselves within easy distance of UConn. What went
through your mind? Did it have anything to do with seeing she was not having a
great day?  
ARICA CARTER: That's the great thing about our team. When somebody is a little
off, we always have people to step up. Asia's a great player, and we knew she
was going to start hitting shots. But at the time, we just have to keep
playing the game. It happens. Shots don't always fall. A lot of our shots
didn't fall tonight, but that's the great thing about our team. There's always
somebody ready to step up, and we're always encouraging people to step up, and
that's what we tried to do tonight.  
  
Q. Even towards the end when you guys -- it looked like you were beat,
but then you cut the lead again. You guys always thought you were going to win
the game. This is for all three of you. Didn't you?  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, we always thought we were going to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Sam?  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, we're always working hard to try to get the "W." That's
what it is.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Arica, anything to add?  
  
ARICA CARTER: I agree. It's March. You never know what can happen. We've been
saying that the whole time. In our minds, the game is never over until the
buzzer horn.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. Congratulations on a terrific
season.  
  
Q. Jeff, congrats on a wonderful season. I'm guessing you didn't think
Sam was going to have a night like she had the other night today, but could
you just talk about it. She seemed to hit every big shot in the fourth quarter
when she needed to.  
JEFF WALZ: She made some big shots, but I've got to give credit to Megan
Walker. Megan Walker was the difference in the first half. You know, at times
you've got to roll the dice a little bit, and I thought we did a really good
job on Napheesa. But we backed off of Walker at times to help on Collier, and
she knocked down shots. You know, I thought she was the difference for them.
And I know it was in the first half, but she really kept them going and gave
them a bounce.  
  
And then Katie Lou came out. There's no question about it, she made some tough
shots. She made some tough ones, and then we had some breakdowns on a few that
you just can't have. She hits a huge shot and gets a four-point play out of
it. She definitely moved a lot better today than she did on Friday, so credit
to her. She's a great player. If she plays like this continuing on, they're
going to be hard to beat.  
  
Q. Coach, even though a lot of people saw Durr struggle in the first
half, what a lot of people didn't see was how she was participating and
helping her other teammates score and blocks and screens and contributing. She
never got down. If you could just speak on the character of Durr.  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I just think, if you're sitting here and you listen to her,
the first thing she says when there's a question asked to her is I missed two
big free throws. That's not the reason we lost the game. You can look over a
40-minute game and find a ton of areas that you could improve on, but that's
who she is. She takes that responsibility on.  
  
I've been in the same press conferences after she scored 47, and the first
thing she's saying is my teammates set me up. My teammates got me the ball.
That's why they all love playing for her, playing with her. It's who she is.
She's not only a remarkable basketball player, but she's just as impressive as
a person, and that's really -- you know, all these young women, I challenge
them. I push them to be great. Not just good, great in everything they do.  
  
I look at Sam and A.C. and Asia, and I see three young women that are ready
for whatever is in front of them -- if it's professional basketball, the work
force, whatever it might be -- they are prepared for it, and they are going to
succeed and do extremely well.  
  
Q. What can you say about -- what a game like this does in the Elite
Eight with players like Asia and Katie Lou does for the rising visibility of
women's basketball as a whole?  
JEFF WALZ: It's a great basketball game. I thought there was a lot of big
plays made by both teams. Unfortunately for us, they just made a few more. I
really think, if you didn't sit back and watch this game and you can't sit
there and appreciate it, appreciate how it was being played, then it's a shame
because I thought there were some big time plays by both teams.  
  
Q. Jeff, congratulations on your season. I just want to talk about Sam's
profile at the next level specifically, what she can do, the fact that she can
step out, the fact that she can bang with fours and fives. What do you see of
her at the WNBA level? Do you expect her name to be called, as Asia's almost
certainly will as well?  
JEFF WALZ: I would think so. After what Sam has done, especially in this
tournament, I think she's shown a lot of people that she can play inside out.
She has great hands. She has great instinct for the game. She's not afraid to
battle. She's not afraid to mix it up inside. But at the same time, she can
defend on the perimeter.  
  
I think at that level, she'll be a little bit like a utility knife. You know,
you're going to be able to get a lot of options from her. Not that she's a
knockdown three-point shooter, but if you leave her open, she can make them.
She's really good from 15 to 18 feet, would be great on a pick-and-roll, pick-
and-pop. And then she's willing and able to defend multiple spots. I'd be
shocked. If her name's not drawn, not announced on the 10th, I'll be surprised
if she's not picked up by somebody to come into a training camp.  
  
Q. Jeff, that final push, the kids said it, you guys refused to quit,
and there's the mentality you've instilled there. You're down four. You get
your best player to the foul line for two shots, and I've got to think, you're
sitting there thinking, okay, we're going to be down two, and we have a chance
to tie this game up. She didn't hit him. Just what you were thinking at that
point in the game.  
JEFF WALZ: Shit happens. That's what I was thinking. I tell people all the
time -- you know, I go to a ton of recruiting, and I see someone get fouled
and someone yelling, you gotta make it, you gotta make it. No kidding. Asia
didn't go up there with any intent to not make two free throws. It happens.  
  
Then Sam came down with the offensive board. So it's not like we didn't get
the rebound. I mean, Sam worked extremely hard. She got in there, and you
know, they had a nice block. I thought it was a good block. But we had our
chances. We continued to fight, continued to compete. I think we were down six
or whatever it may have been with 29 seconds, and they called a time-out. I
told Dee we're not fouling. We're not trying to foul. We're going to try to
come up with the jump ball because we have the arrow. And our kids came out
and did it. Everything we wanted, we got. We just didn't make two free throws.
That's part of the game. That's why you roll the ball out. You know, it hurts.
It stings. But that's not the only reason we lost the game.  
  
There was a stretch there where we just could not come up with a rebound. They
ended up with 11 offensive boards, but the last four minutes, they probably
came up with four or five of those, and those were really crucial.  
  
Q. Jeff, you were just talking before about not being able to make the
shots you normally make. When Asia was 0 for 8, 1 for 10, are you over there
on the sidelines dying for her, hoping that she gets it going?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I mean, of course. I didn't want her to go 1 for 20, but she
was taking shots within our offense. She was taking shots -- she would create
some. That pullup jumper is what she shoots. She had a couple -- the first
four or five of the game, there were like three of them that were in and out,
and those are shots she normally gets. I thought our kids did a great job of
finding her, setting screens for her to get her going.  
  
And, of course, you're sitting there, and like you said, she's 1 for 10, and
we're down seven at half. It's still a ball game because we're a good team. I
know everyone wants to say, Asia Durr, she's special, but everyone else on our
team is pretty darn good too. So we felt good. We went into halftime feeling
pretty good, like, hey, guys, we couldn't have shot much worse, and it's still
a seven-point game.  
  
We knew for us to have a chance, Asia was going to have to have a better
second half, and she did. It just wasn't enough from everybody. We had talked
about it. We said our performance on the 31st of January, we were going to
have to play better, and we just didn't.  
  
Q. Jeff, you talked about this after Friday's game, but they were up 11
with 90 seconds left, and you guys went on an 8-1 run, sparked by three
steals. So talk about that defense that's been ignored while everybody focused
on Asia.  
JEFF WALZ: We compete. I knew we weren't going to quit. That's why I saved my
two time-outs. I knew we could come up. Instead of after we scored, calling a
time-out, we jumped into the press as quick as we could. We come up with a
steal, we get a quick back door for a lay-up. And then all of a sudden, when
we needed to call them, I was able to call them, and we executed, and it was
pretty special.  
  
And then the last play there, we tried a little something thrown over the top
and just didn't complete the pass, but it was a great ball game. It just sucks
to be on this end of it, but that's part of life. We played a pretty good
basketball team today. I thought the crowd was fantastic. I thought they were
great. Our kids enjoyed it. Just don't really much enjoy the outcome right
now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thanks for doing this. Congratulations on a great
season.  
  
JEFF WALZ: Thank you everyone for covering us this season.

_Albany, New York_  
  
Connecticut - 80, Louisville - 73  
  
THE MODERATOR: As you can see, we've been joined by UConn head coach Geno
Auriemma, along with sophomore Megan Walker, senior Christyn Williams, and
senior Katie Lou Samuelson. We'll begin with an opening statement.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: As I said out in the arena, there's a lot that goes into trying
to do this. You have to be a great team to go to the Final Four. That's always
been the case, and especially tonight. I knew it was going to turn out to be
either Asia Durr, or somebody on our team that would step up for us to have a
great night. In these games, that's always what happens. There's no trick
offenses or trick defenses you're going to come up with or run any fancy
plays. At this time of year in these big games, either one of their guys or
one of our guys is going to be the difference, and tonight it happened to be
Lou.  
  
I don't know what to say about our entire team's performance. It was pretty
special.  
  
Q. Lou, was it -- were you feeling better today, or was the adrenaline
just going? What leads to a performance like you had tonight?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: There's definitely a lot of adrenaline that goes into
that, but coming into this game, we all felt like there was a little bit of
unfinished business from the last game. There was a little bit of extra
motivation, and we wanted to give ourselves a chance to get to the Final Four.
So with that, with that much focus and that many things all coming at you,
it's easy to just play, just go out there and play as hard as you can, play
with everything you have in you. So it was easy to not focus on anything but
the game at hand.  
  
Q. Katie, compare what you did in this game to the rest of your
season.  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Wow. Well, today I just -- I feel like I've been shooting
well in practices and stuff, and today I was getting some shots. And we were
doing a pretty good job of setting the screens, getting me open, and overall,
I think every single person on this team stepped up and did something big. We
had five players score in double digits, which is pretty impressive that every
single person is there, engaged, doing what they need to do.  
  
Megan stepped up and kind of controlled that first half for us with hitting
those four threes. They weren't expecting that. For her to do that, we have
that confidence in her. We're going to continue to keep going. It's going to
be someone different every game.  
  
Q. Just wondering what you did from, I guess, post-game Friday to today
in order to get you ready. Obviously, a much different game for you.  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Yeah, I think the way the games are played were different
too, I think, for us going into it. We approach our defense and everything the
same way, but for me I learned to make a little bit more of an impact
offensively and make sure I was involved. In Friday's game, we didn't
necessarily need that from me, and I felt today I did need to step up. So I
did what I could to help win the game.  
  
Q. Katie Lou, do you know it was said after the game on the court that
you guys celebrated like this was going to your first Final Four and not your
12th. I was wondering why is that? Obviously, going to the Final Four is
exciting, but what makes you guys so thrilled about this?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: I think this team has done a lot behind closed doors to
get to this point, and we've been through so much ups and downs, trying to
figure out how to work with certain people. You know, sometimes we have a lot
of mismatches and things like that. So this team has really fought our way to
get to this point. We experienced a lot of ups and downs this year playing-
wise, close games and close losses. And for us, to get to this point to win
and to win the way we have and the way we're playing right now as a team,
we're just so happy with where we are, and it's just special. This team is
special. And every single one of these girls are my best friends, and I'm glad
that I get this chance to go to the Final Four one last time.  
  
Q. Megan, it looked like they were cheating a little bit toward Napheesa
in the first half. Did you recognize that, and was that maybe giving you some
offensive opportunities there?  
MEGAN WALKER: Yes. Coach, we had a conversation earlier on -- in shootaround,
and I think the practice before that, they probably would sag off me. So I
knew I had to be ready to knock in open shots.  
  
Q. Lou, it's sort of been a recurring theme for your career with the
back. In the game where you scored 23 against Maryland, and you managed to
play through all of last year as well. I guess I wonder where this rates when
you think about it in terms of games where you've managed to overcome fighting
through different things, especially of a physical nature.  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Yeah, I think -- I've said this before. At this point in
the season, there's something that someone is going through. Every single
person has things they've got to fight through, and they have to be ready to
step up and get over that. So it comes down to just being -- are you mentally
tough enough to play? There's things that we all have had to do, all of us had
to get through, and for me, I'm just trying to do whatever I can to put my
team in the best situation they can be in.  
  
Q. For Megan and Christyn, Megan, I know you shot the lights out in
first half, and, Christyn, you had big plays in the second half. I wonder what
goes through your mind when you see someone like Katie Lou makes like a three
over Sam and the four-point play, facing the end of her career and really
coming up with those huge, defining plays for your program.  
MEGAN WALKER: Lou works so hard, so we see those plays, those type of shots in
practice. In my mind, I had no doubt that it wasn't going in.  
  
CHRISTYN WILLIAMS: Yeah, she does it every day in practice, so I was not
surprised. She's a great leader on the floor. She's just a great teammate. I
love you, man. I'm not surprised that she made those big plays and it helps us
because it gives great energy to the team.  
  
Q. Lou, start of the fourth quarter, you're on the bench, but before the
five went out on the floor, you made it a point to call them all together, and
there was only -- you were pretty -- I'm not sure what the right word is --
but forceful with what you were saying. I'm not concerned with what you said,
but why you felt the need to say it at that time.  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: I think this year, especially sitting out the games I
did, I found ways to make an impact not being in the game. I felt like, when I
have something to say, they all listen, and they all kind of come through. But
I went out there in that fourth quarter and said, we've got to bear down and
make these rebounds, and we're going to go to the Final Four. So I think, for
us, no matter who's out there on the court, we've been through so many
different things and so many different lineups, that at this point we feel
confident, whether I'm on the bench or not, we're going to be successful.  
  
Q. Christyn, Katie goes out with her fourth foul, and it looked like you
took it on yourself to just start being the Christyn Williams we saw at Notre
Dame and a few times since. Is that correct? Is that what you thought?  
CHRISTYN WILLIAMS: Yeah. It was kind of like, when she wasn't playing in the
conference tournament, somebody had to step up and play her role. So I just
took what the defense gave me, and offensively, it was there. I was just
flowing. So it happened.  
  
Q. Christyn, you've made a lot of big plays in the second half, but
arguably none bigger than that the steal to seal the game on the inbound pass.
Take me through that play right there.  
CHRISTYN WILLIAMS: This entire season, I've struggled defensively. So that was
a huge stop for me -- or for the team really. I saw it coming, and I stole the
ball. It was just a big play at that time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Our time with the student-athletes is expired. We appreciate
you taking time to be on the dais. Congratulations and good luck next weekend.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: It's Christyn's favorite defense, zone.  
  
Q. Geno, two-part question. You mentioned on the court how the team
celebrated like they've never gone to the Final Four before. You heard what
Katie said about stuff behind closed doors. Is this special for this group for
you to make it here even though it's been 12 straight years. And second part
just what Lou's performance was? You've seen a lot of great ones. What she did
tonight, where that ranks for you.  
GENO AURIEMMA: I know things are different at UConn. I know we're treated
different, the expectations are different at our place. When Lou and Napheesa
were freshman, we had the kind of players that, if Napheesa and Lou didn't
show up for the game, it was just a matter of how much we're going to win by,
not whether we were going to win.  
  
Now to see them at the end of their four years, it's all on their shoulders.
They have to play great, both of them or at least one of them, or we don't
have a chance to win. And this is the first time they've been in that
situation. And they kind of took that load and took it personally.  
  
Like I said, somebody was going to be big tonight. We knew what Asia was going
to. That's a given. We just needed somebody to match everything she did. We
got the lead, and we never lost the lead the entire game. We wanted to make
sure that we answered everything. It would have been a hell of a thing if the
only time we didn't lead was at the end of the game.  
  
Yeah, she made some shots today that only really special players make at this
particular time. This is when players separate themselves in these games.  
  
Q. Geno, what can you say about Megan and Christyn and just kind of
their growth and how important it is in the tournament?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I think like Lou said -- I think Christyn said it too. Not
being able to play in the conference tournament really, really helped. It
helped with Megan realizing she had to do more. All along, we've been trying
to get her to do more and do more and do more or trying to be more confident,
be more aggressive.  
  
Christyn -- you know, when you come from high school and you're the best
player in the country supposedly, and you have the ball all the time, and then
you come here, and you're going to have it some of the time, it's a foreign,
foreign world that you're entering, and it takes a while to get used to that,
to find your place, you know, where you fit in. I think, as the season wore
on, she did. She found her place, and she's starting to play now like the
player I saw in high school. And it's just made us -- you know, the two of
them, it's just made us a completely different team than the team that played
Louisville the very first time.  
  
Q. When you think about what it means for Lou to have the game that she
had in this spot today, it's just the fact that now they, as a duo, are going
back to the Final Four once more. What do you think it does for their overall
legacy here at the school and their ability to carve out their own identity.
Like you said, on a team that will started with -- it be eight players that
eventually going to play WNBA ball in 2016.  
GENO AURIEMMA: You know, kids get to write their own stories a lot of times.
As I said earlier, they could have had the same careers someplace else, and it
could have ended tonight, and it would be viewed as two of the best players
ever to play at that school. And unfortunately -- and fortunately -- they're
at a place where what they did today has become commonplace and expected. But
that in no way diminishes what they've had to do and the way they did it day
in and day out.  
  
It's not easy playing at Connecticut. I don't think the people understand the
pressures that go with playing at UConn, that the expectations are so
unrealistic, and at the same time, very realistic because we keep delivering
on them. It takes a certain kind of unique individual to be able to handle it.
The two of them have handled it as best as they ever have, with less
supporting cast than some other people.  
  
Q. How mind boggling or mind blowing is it to you that 12 years in a row
you're going to the Final Four? That isn't supposed to happen, is it?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I don't think so. I don't think it's supposed to happen. Not in
today's world, the way things change and the way teams keep getting better and
better. It's not normal, and it's something that's hard to describe. Because,
if you're writing a book and making it up, people would say that doesn't
happen in real life, and it has happened in real life. I'm still -- like you
said, I'm boggled. My mind just doesn't get it, how this could happen this
many years in a row with a different cast of characters that change so often.
But, no, it's not normal. It's not normal.  
  
Q. Geno, you have said one of your players was going to have to step up,
at least one. Did you have any idea, especially after Friday, that that player
was going to be Katie Lou Samuelson?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Talking today with our video coordinator, talking with Ben and
some of our coaches, and especially after yesterday's workout where Lou looked
less than ecstatic about being there, because she was just really hurting both
physically and mentally, I said, she's either going to have a big night or
it's just going to be terrible. I don't think there's going to be any in
between. And he said, every single shot she's missed is going to go in
tonight, today.  
  
I guess when you have a player that's done so much like she has in her four
years, you expect them to bounce back. I didn't anticipate -- you know, 29
points is 29 points, but the way they came. They weren't just stand there,
shoot open threes the whole night. So given where she was Friday and yesterday
and some of the things she's battling with off the court, remarkable. That's
the best thing I could say. Absolutely remarkable.  
  
Q. Geno, what kind of joy does it give you to see all the joy the kids
had after the game?  
GENO AURIEMMA: It's only happened a couple of times. It's only happened a
couple times. The one time, I said -- in the locker room, I said, you know,
guys, this team is really special. I said, this team reminds me of that very
first team in '91, and they all looked at each other, and none of them had
been born, obviously. And it was the first time that I'd gotten to experience
what a bunch of kids who had no expectations on them, no one expected them to
be able to do it, and the feeling in that locker room in Philadelphia when we
won is one I'll never, ever forget. To this day, that just is burned in my
memory.  
  
And then the '95 team, you know, because you do go through a point where we
might never win one. As good as we are, we might never win. So there's been a
couple times when it's been that incredibly joyous and spontaneous, and I
don't ever -- I'm glad that at my age I'm getting to experience this because I
don't ever want it to become -- you know, how the world is. What did you do
today? We're going to the Final Four. Good job, man. Like I don't ever want it
to be like, okay, what are we eating tonight? Like it's still got to mean a
lot, and you still have to feel it in your soul.  
  
I have felt everything about this team all year long. I've loved them. I've
hated them. I wanted the season to end. I wanted the season to keep going. I
wanted ten guys to transfer. I only wanted to coach one guy. I wanted to have
them over for dinner every night. I wanted to -- I wish they'd never eat again
the rest of their lives. Every single emotion -- we can't play defense. We
can't run offense. We're a great defensive team. Man, we run offense great.
Every single thought you could ever imagine was in my brain all year long, to
a point where -- you know, I can't even -- I don't have any more brain space.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Congratulations on the victory. Good luck in the Final Four.

_Albany, New York_  
  
Q. Asia, Coach said yesterday how the win in January helped give you
guys some confidence playing UConn just because you hadn't beaten them before.
How much does that win help you guys preparing for tomorrow's game for
mentally having confidence knowing you can beat them, and also what you guys
did well and what you didn't do well to help for tomorrow?  
ASIA DURR: I mean, that was great for us. It kind of gave us some good juice.
We played hard, and we had some great stops. We put together some great stops,
and we played great as a team. Obviously we held them to 44 points, so I mean,
that's huge for us, and that's what we're going to need tomorrow. So we have
to bring that.  
  
Q. If you can talk just a little bit about the defense and how important
it is at this time of year. You've played great defense all season, but moving
forward in tomorrow's game, going to the Final Four, how important the
defensive effort you guys bring every night is going to be?  
JAZMINE JONES: I think when we're in tune on the defensive end, it creates an
easy way for us to get offense. When we get stops, we get out in transition,
and I think when we're really focused on defense, we're really good.  
  
KYLEE SHOOK: Yes, defense is very important to Coach Walz and to us. If
offense isn't going, we always have defense that we can fall back on.  
  
ARICA CARTER: In order for us to win any games, we have to play defense, and
that's what we've been focusing on in practice. That's what we've been talking
about as a team. Because you're not always going to make shots. We can't just
depend on making big shots. We have to get stops in order to make shots. So
we've been working really hard on defense and making sure that we're having
each other's back when we're playing defense and communicating a lot.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, defense is very important. I mean, without it, the team is
going to run up the score. So I mean, it's important in every game just to
know that we play hard, and just getting stops, and what Jazz says, running
the floor.  
  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, they said some great things. During this time of the year,
we're playing great teams who can score really, really well, so we have to
play great D throughout the whole game. They said it right.  
  
Q. Both for Jazmine and Asia, I understand the importance of defense and
UConn will say the same thing, but you guys really made a difference in that
game down there with the three-pointers. How big can they be because they can
just give you that little extra bit?  
ASIA DURR: Yeah, I mean, they try to force us out wide, especially on hand-
offs. They try to mix some things up, so we just tried to make the right read
and the right play, so that's what we were trying to do. They were trying to
force us to make tough shots, so that's what we were trying to do, too, is
just make the right play and the right read.  
  
JAZMINE JONES: Asia was hitting shots that game. Asia was hitting the big
threes. Well said, AD.  
  
Q. I want you guys to be perfectly honest, if when you guys were growing
up, were you UConn fans watching them on TV, and if so, what's it feel like to
be playing them for a spot in the Final Four?  
ASIA DURR: I mean, growing up, doesn't matter who the team is. If there's a
team that plays really well and they're doing great things, you know,
obviously you're going to be a fan. I mean, people are fans of certain teams,
certain players. So if you play well, then you're probably going to be a fan.
You're not going to hate them. So it doesn't really matter who the team is. If
they're playing well, playing great, doing some great things, you're going to
be like, wow, that's cool. That's how I feel. I don't know how they feel, but
that's what I would say.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Yeah, I mean, I grew up -- like everyone wants to go to UConn
because of how good they are. They're a great program, great team. They are
the winningest. And yeah, I feel like everyone -- every young girl would want
to go there.  
  
But my junior year I was being recruited by Louisville. I ended up loving it,
ended up learning to love Louisville, and I'm a big fan here now. Like I'm all
Louisville. It's kind of like at first when you play UConn, you could be
scared, but then again, it's like you grow, and you learn that you're just as
good as them, and that's something that I've learned here at Louisville.  
  
ARICA CARTER: I mostly agree with Asia. Growing up, I was just a fan of any
good basketball, and UConn was a part of watching good basketball. So whatever
teams played great, played hard, that was a team I was a fan of, and I watched
because that's the type of player I wanted to be. I wanted to be a player who
did the little things and played hard, and UConn was one of those teams. So
yes, I did watch them, but that doesn't change playing against them. You know,
I want to come out and give our best and give them our best shot to know that
so they know that we can play with them, too.  
  
KYLEE SHOOK: I mean, I think they summed it all up.  
  
JAZMINE JONES: Yeah, I agree.  
  
ASIA DURR: Wait, one second. I have another joke, okay, guys? This is day two,
all right?  
  
Are you all ready? Y'all don't seem excited. All right, hey, hey.  
  
What do you call flying bread?  
  
A plane bagel.  
  
Come on, guys, that was funny. Boom.  
  
THE MODERATOR: If you would please begin with an opening statement, Coach,
either based on the performance last night, looking ahead to tomorrow, and
then we'll open it up to questions from the media.  
  
JEFF WALZ: Yeah, just thrilled to still be playing, and again, would like to
thank everyone that comes out and covers women's basketball. Very much
appreciated. You know, it's a time of the year that you're just trying to
survive and advance, and I thought we came out and played really well last
night. Went back and watched the film, and obviously some areas that you still
want to see some improvement in, but overall, I thought we defended extremely
well. And just looking forward to a good day of practice today, and then the
opportunity to play tomorrow.  
  
Q. I saw your tweet, it was tremendous, to the governor. It was just a
little -- let him know what's going on.  
JEFF WALZ: I was just trying to be helpful. I mean, you know, it's our second
year in a row. We went to a Final Four last year, and I'm not sure he knew
there was a women's basketball team at Louisville or in the state. He was
tweeting at Kentucky men for advancing, and I didn't say anything last year,
and that's fine. But I thought, you know what, these young women are pretty
impressive, and I think as our governor, if you're going to tweet at a men's
basketball team at any school, you should at least have someone hopefully
letting you know that, hey, there are women that play, too, and you've got a
pretty good program at Louisville that advanced to the Sweet 16.  
  
I saw today he did tweet our president, which was very nice of him, to
congratulate us on getting to the Elite 8.  
  
Q. Tomorrow when you guys play, I would imagine it's going to be a pro-
UConn crowd because they're so close. How do you try to combat that?  
JEFF WALZ: I'm still waiting to see that. I think more of their fans are
beginning to like me more than him. (Laughter). I get a lot of emails from
them. I can't say they're always, always very nice, but I respond to them all.  
  
No. It's been -- you know what, as I said, I'd rather, and our players would
rather, and I think for women's basketball, I'd rather be playing a game like
this tomorrow in front of hopefully 12 to 13,000 fans. And if nine-tenths of
them are here for UConn, that's great. The ball is the same. The rims are the
same. The length of the court is the same. Any player would rather play in a
great environment than possibly be playing where there's 1,500 people, 1,000,
that show up for a regional final.  
  
You know, as our game continues to grow, hopefully you can get a site where
it's not right in someone's backyard. But we had the same thing last year. We
played in Lexington, an hour away, to have a chance to go to a Final Four.  
  
You know, I can't sit here and complain knowing I had the same benefit last
year. So we're just excited that there's going to be a great crowd in here. I
expect it to be a great basketball game between two great teams.  
  
Q. You've talked last night about beating UConn in January and
confidence and it's the first time this group has beaten UConn. How important
is that? You've played them many times in the Big East and in the NCAA
Tournament, but to have a win, how big is that for you guys' confidence
tomorrow?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I mean, obviously it's important. But at the same time, it's
the next game. You know, I was fortunate enough to work at Maryland for five
years, and I think we were 0 and 9 or 0 and 10 against Duke. The only time we
ever beat Duke in the five years I was there was in the '06 National
Championship game. So it takes one time. So we didn't have any previous
experience of beating them and figured out a way to beat them in that game.  
  
And here, yeah, we did win in January, but it's going to be a whole new ball
game. We aren't playing at home. You're not going to have your home crowd
behind you. But it does give you a little bit of a sense of like, okay, if we
play our best, we can win this game. And we know the performance that we had
at home in January, we're going to need a better performance. I told our
players that this morning. What we did back then, we're going to have to play
better than that if you want to expect a chance to get to a Final Four.  
  
Q. Jeff, for those of us that are not around Asia that much, she's
pretty entertaining up here, telling jokes. She fist-bumped Kevin on the way
out. Can you just talk about her personally and what she brings?  
JEFF WALZ: Asia's growth from her freshman year when she first stepped on
campus to now, it's really been a joy to watch. Her confidence just in herself
outside of basketball -- she's always been a confident basketball player, but
getting up here in front of the media, her interaction with our fan base, it's
really been fun to watch as she's grown throughout her four years. Her
confidence in who she is.  
  
You know, her personality now is starting to show more and more. Now, I heard
the joke she told the other day, and I'm not sure that was a very good one.
She has some work to do on those. Was it better? Okay, good.  
  
But no, her teammates, she's a great teammate because she's easy to be around,
she always credits her teammates. It's never her. And she's genuine. It's what
I tell our kids all the time, if you're just genuine, people -- they might not
like it, but at least they know, hey, I'm not being fake. And that's something
that Asia is remarkable with. What you see is what you get.  
  
You know, when this WNBA draft comes up, I tell people all the time, to me,
she's a top pick in the draft. And the reason I say that is she's going to do
whatever you ask her to do. If you want her to score 12 a night, 15 a night,
she'll go out there and do that. If you want her to get the ball to someone in
the post, she'll go out there and do that. It's never been about her. It's
been about what she needs to do to help our team win, and I think that's why
she's so liked in our locker room.  
  
Q. I know that you have a good relationship with Coach Auriemma. What is
it like to go up against him and compete against him and UConn?  
JEFF WALZ: I mean, it's been fun. It's been 12 years now, and I think it's
only been one or two years that we did not play against each other, and then
there were times that we played each other four times in one year.  
  
I've got the utmost respect for Geno, his program, the way he does things. If
you can't have -- just appreciation for what he's been able to do year in and
year out, it's pretty remarkable. You know, he gets everybody's best shot
every night, and it's not very often that they're not giving their best shot
to everybody. And it doesn't matter who they play. That's the one thing I talk
to our players about.  
  
When you go see them sometimes play, and if they're supposed to beat someone
by 60, they actually beat them by 70. And it's not running up the score, it's
just how they play. And that's what impresses me. They play the same way no
matter who they're playing. And that's one of the things that we have tried to
set a standard within our program, and we're just really excited to have this
opportunity to play tomorrow.  
  
And we know going into it, we're going to be the underdog, and that's fine. I
know we're the 1 seed, but everybody has got -- we're going to be the first 1
seed to lose. The big talk about why in the world was Louisville a 1 seed and
UConn not. So we're okay with that. We know you've got to show up and play,
and tomorrow at noon, I expect a great, great basketball game.  
  
Q. It's been two months since the first meeting against UConn. Can you
talk about what went well in that game and would you expect a similar game, or
have things changed a lot in those two months?  
JEFF WALZ: No, I don't think a lot has changed. What went well is we scored
the basketball. It's the one thing I've always said. If you want to have a
chance to beat UConn, you've got to score. Their defense does so well because
I think their offense is so good. You go on a three- or four-minute drought
and a 2- or 4-point game can go to 10. I can go back -- we were, I think, 0
and 17 before that last game in January. And you know, there is a few games
where they kicked our butt, but there's a few that I can go back and say,
look, here's six minutes, five minutes. That's all it was. It's a 4-point game
and then they go on a 16-0 run over four minutes, it's 20, and it ends up at
20. That's what -- they can score so quick. And if you want to have a chance
to beat them, you've got to be able to score the basketball. You have to
execute. You can't have empty possessions at this time of the year. And then
you've got to rebound the basketball.  
  
I don't see a whole bunch changing in what they're trying to do, what we're
trying to do, so I just -- it should be fun. I mean, I'm expecting a great
basketball game.  
  
Q. You were talking about you being the underdog despite being the No. 1
seed. Do you think your team is getting the respect they should be getting?  
JEFF WALZ: Yes, for sure. I mean, we're a back-to-back 1 seed, played in the
Final Four last year, 30 whatever and 3. Yes, I think we're getting the
respect that we should. I think the kids have earned it. I mean, you go back
and look at our schedule, I mean, we've had a very competitive schedule. We
went on the road in the non-conference early and did what a lot of BCS schools
won't do: We went and played at Boise State, we went and played at Central
Michigan. I talked to Sue at Central Michigan and she's just shocked. She's
like, I can't believe you'll come up and play. I'm like, Sue, I think it's
great. The environment up there, it's a great test for our team. We played at
Western Kentucky, at Chattanooga. I mean, places where a lot of BCS schools
won't go play. We played at Middle in the past. It's a great place to play.  
  
I think it's great for our team. I always tell everybody when we schedule --
when I talk about it, I go, I want to know where we are. If we go to Boise
State and we get beat, then I'm like, guys, they're a really good basketball
team, there's no question about that. But what are we going to do when we go
to Duke, what are we going to do when we go to NC State?  
  
So I thought we played a great non-conference schedule, and then we've been
getting a lot of respect. I think our players have earned that, and I think
it's going to be fun. It's going to be fun tomorrow. There's no doubt.  
  
Q. Going a different direction for you, as a coach when you get this far
and you have a bunch of talented seniors, more so this round than the next
couple, there are extra things you've got to watch out for because this is the
time seniors might start thinking about if I lose my last game, et cetera, et
cetera, even if they've had a great year. You think about Holdsclaw, that game
against Duke in '99. Just wonder if there's something that stays on your radar
as an extra thing.  
JEFF WALZ: No, I don't even worry about that. We don't even talk about that.
Our team has known since we started this tournament -- well, actually the
start of the ACC Tournament, we talked, it's one-and-done now, guys. The "my
bads," the "hey, I'm sorry," it's not good enough. I tell them right now if
I've got to spend any energy on trying to get you excited, I'm just going to
take you out. Your teammates should not have to spend any energy on trying to
get you focused because your head is down because you missed a shot or you're
frustrated. Everybody on that floor has got to spend the energy on the
opponent, on themselves.  
  
Guys, this is the best time of the year, it's the most exciting part of
college basketball. So I truly believe our seniors are dialed in. They're
looking forward to the opportunity tomorrow. And I don't worry about that at
all.  
  
Q. Jeff, you've done an amazing job at Louisville getting them to the
Final Four and championship games in your twelve years a few times. Can you
appreciate what UConn's done making it 11 straight Final Fours.  
JEFF WALZ: Oh, yes.  
  
Q. Just how tough that is for any team to do year after year and the
expectations when you don't win it all for them and it's like, well, they had
a terrible year? Well, you made the Final Four.  
JEFF WALZ: No, it's -- you know, I can just talk from our end of it. 12 years
ago, the goal was just to get to a Sweet 16. I can remember like, hey, we just
want to have the opportunity to get to a Sweet 16, and now we've gone to nine
in 12 years. This is our fifth Elite 8. And we've been in three Final Fours.
And I've got my fans, which I love them, that before the ACC Tournament
started, we have our tickets to Tampa. I'm like, that's great. Now we've got a
few ballgames to play before then.  
  
But your expectations change, and that's what Geno has created here at UConn.
It's amazing, 11 straight Final Fours. You're not having a bad night. I mean,
it's -- for those 11 straight, you've got -- that's 44 games that you've
played in the NCAA Tournament, and you really have not had a bad night. That's
pretty darned impressive.  
  
I've got the utmost respect for it. It doesn't -- I know everybody would say,
hey, he's always got better players, he's got this, he's got that. We all have
some good players. It's just impressive that two or three of them have not had
a bad night on the same night. I mean, they've won 44 straight to get to the
Final Four. So we know we have our hands full tomorrow.  
  
But no, we take great pride in what we've been able to do here at Louisville.
My SID has in our game notes the 32 previous years Louisville had never been
to a Sweet 16. In 12, we've been to nine now. So I think it speaks volumes for
my staff, our ability to go out and recruit, and then our ability to motivate
players.  
  
You've got to figure out a way to get kids to do more than they think they
can, and then as soon as they start to do that, then they start to buy into
each other. And I say it all the time, I know when we've got a special group
when they really aren't concerned about me during a game. They aren't
concerned if I'm getting on them, you've got to box out. When I see them
talking to each other, going that's my fault on the box out, I'll get the next
one. Instead you have teams that are like, if somebody gets beat on a back
door cut, it's like, I hope Coach didn't see that. It's like, did he see it or
not.  
  
The great teams are the ones, they're holding each other accountable and they
don't want to let each other down, and that's what we've built here the past
few years, and that's why we've been able to have our success.  
  
Q. Your players were just talking about being an underdog legitimately
as if they believe that. Do you like them to play with a chip on their
shoulder or do you like them to be realistic that you have a pretty big chore
in front of them?  
JEFF WALZ: No, I mean, it's what we just talked about here. We're predicted as
the first 1 seed to get beat by ESPN. Everybody was upset that we got the 1
seed here. So I mean, I would say we are the underdog.  
  
But at the end of the day, it really doesn't matter. You have to show up and
play. We always step on the floor respecting whoever we're playing. We know,
and I've said it for two years now, our margin for error is thin. If you look
at the rankings of these players as they come out of high school, you know,
you've got No. 1, No. 1, No. 3, No. 5. It's pretty remarkable on that team
we're playing tomorrow. And then I've got a young lady by the name of Bionca
Dunham who wasn't even a top 300 on anybody's scouting service.  
  
We try to take pieces and put them into a puzzle that works for us. And then
if everybody does their job, we're pretty darned good. We're not going to win
tomorrow by playing one-on-one. We're not going to beat them with just a one-
on-one basketball game, okay, I'm better than you. We have to play within
ourselves.  
  
As I tell them, and I said it the other night, whatever you do well, do it,
and whatever you don't do well, don't let anybody see it, and that's our motto
right now. If you're not a good one-on-one player taking somebody to the
basket, don't do it. If you're a screener, screen. You can only have one
leading scorer on a team, and I always ask at the beginning of every year,
what do you want to do. I want to be the leading scorer. I said, well, there's
eight of you that have said that. Not one of you have said you want to be the
best defender.  
  
So you know, everybody on our team now has kind of bought into their role. I
thought what Dana Evans did last night and Arica Carter on their point guards,
Destiny Slocum, I think she may have woken up last night with a nightmare that
Dana Evans was by her because she just hounded her the entire time. It's not
that she stole it every time, but she put pressure on her. Well, that's what
she does great.  
  
Kylee is doing a really nice job now of finishing in the paint and rebounding.
She's a post presence for us. Arica Carter -- I say all the time, Arica Carter
is the YMCA 50 and over men's league player. She just spots up, she knocks
down spot up threes, she's in the right spot at the right time, she gets the
ball to the right people, but she's not blowing by you and making some and-one
mix tape move.  
  
But that's who we are. And then we've always had a player like Asia, you know,
somebody that, you know what, shot clock is running down, I can get her the
ball and she'll get her shot. She can get something up on the rim for us and a
lot of times it goes in. There were a few times in last night's game where we
isolated and went flat with her, and she makes that little step back off her
back foot, and I turned to the bench and I go, when you've got that, it makes
it nice.  
  
But everybody else believes in what they're doing. They've accepted their
role. So for us tomorrow everybody has got to play their role and do it well.

_Albany, New York_  
  
Q. Napheesa, can you talk about that game in January when you played
them and what you guys have learned from that game two months ago against
Louisville and what you need to improve on for the win tomorrow?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Well, we need to improve on everything. We played just not
our game at all. And we were watching the film, and we were just like, what
are we doing? That doesn't look like us at all, how we're playing now and how
we know that we can play. So just staying composed and knowing that we need to
run our stuff and not kind of getting so flustered as we did in that game.  
  
Q. Napheesa and Lou, what did fluster you in that game? They pride
themselves on playing defense. Were they just not giving you the looks that
you normally get or were you guys just not executing for some reason?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: I think we struggled to execute, and I think we tried to
do too many different things to kind of go at their defense, because it was a
little different than what we'd faced up to that point, when we should have
just stuck to what we normally do because there were times things were working
and we didn't go back to it.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Yeah, I thought a lot of it was definitely execution. Like I
said, we were just kind of not playing our game. And like Lou said, if we had
something, we wouldn't go back to it or we were trying too many different
things. So like I said, just staying and doing what we know how to do is going
to be a big key for us tomorrow.  
  
Q. Katie, I know you're probably getting tired of talking about it, but
Coach said last night he thought you had limited mobility with your back. How
is the back feeling today, and are you ready for tomorrow?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: At this point in the season, it's all mind over matter.
There's people all over the country that are playing still that have injuries
and have little things that are bothering them. Stuff that's going on with me,
I'm not letting it affect me. I'm doing whatever I can to feel my best, but
mentally if I feel good, then that's good enough.  
  
Q. Christyn, people talk about freshmen aren't freshmen anymore at the
end of the season. How much have you gained this year? Do you feel like more
of a sophomore at this stage of the season?  
CHRISTYN WILLIAMS: Well, yeah, this year has been challenging for me. I've had
my ups and downs but it's the end of the season now, so I kind of know the
ropes now. I'm still a freshman, but with the help of my teammates, they
encourage me and give me amazing confidence to do what I do.  
  
Q. Crystal and Phee, you guys talked about not being yourselves
offensively the first game, but Coach afterward made a point if you guys had
played the way you did in the last two and a half minutes, it would have been
an entirely different game. Did you do something differently then during that
time, or did a light go on, or did they just play you differently because they
were up more?  
CRYSTAL DANGERFIELD: I believe in those last two minutes, two and a half
minutes, we kind of were playing our speed, and we were kind of controlling
the tempo of what we wanted to do, how fast we wanted to score and normally
that's our game. You know, it's out in transition. It's quick ball movement
and things like that, and setting good screens, using the screens, come off of
it and getting our shots. And I think that's what was going on at the end of
the game.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: I think because we were a little bit flustered, so maybe we
were playing a little bit more timid than we usually did or not looking
straight away for the things, like Crystal said, that we normally get. But we
knew in the last two minutes if we didn't make a change -- I mean, we were
down at that point so we were going to lose. But we wanted to get back and
fight back as hard as we can. And so we weren't worried about -- there was no
time to be timid, that we weren't worried about making mistakes. We had to go
as fast as we can, and that's why we looked so much better, because we weren't
afraid to make those mistakes.  
  
Q. Katie, Geno said last night there are times when we, meaning you
guys, need to remind, hey, we're UConn and we're not going to be gotten rid of
that easy. Were there times in the game and maybe even last night where that
feeling kind of comes over you guys, that's sort of built up for a long time
for how long you've been there and your ability to believe in yourself in the
clutch?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Yeah, I think when it came down to some of the closing
minutes in the third and fourth quarter, it felt kind of like we know what
we're doing. No matter what the score is right now, we have that confidence,
we know what we're good at. And you could kind of see it in the other team,
too, that they know we're UConn, as well. And that goes a long way because of
what Coach has been able to do with this program. Being a part of it, you have
to be a certain type of player and certain type of person that can handle that
pressure and embrace it, but also use it to your benefit.  
  
Q. Crystal, speaking of last night, when Katie Lou got the flagrant foul
and went to the free-throw line, do you think -- you guys looked really pumped
up like everybody was standing at half court kind of clapping and you went on
your run after that and did some big things. Was that kind of like exciting?
Did that kind of pump you guys up a little bit?  
CRYSTAL DANGERFIELD: I think so. There are times in the game where you have a
play that can change the momentum of the game, and that was definitely one of
them. Another one was where she stole the ball and got the and-one, I think
that was really the one that shifted the game in our favor. It's plays like
that that Lou has made all year long that we -- we can happen and can push the
game for us.  
  
Q. I have a question with regard to the expected crowd. Megan, it will
most likely be pro-UConn. How much of an advantage is that and do you see that
as something to help continue to motivate you?  
MEGAN WALKER: At the first game, we were at Louisville, so I feel like that
definitely played a part in it. So with the crowd in our favor, it'll give us
a good burst of energy, and we'll feel like we're at home.  
  
CRYSTAL DANGERFIELD: You know, we're in New York and everything, but it's
still, like you said, pro-UConn. And we've played here before, so again, I
think it's the familiarity for this team, and we'll be comfortable out there
playing.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: We've been saying since day one when we got here, we have
the best fans in the country, so we know there's going to be a lot of people
tomorrow. And as you said, it's going to be mostly UConn fans, so just having
their energy and all the stuff that they bring is really a confidence and
energy boost for us. So I think it'll definitely be an extra thing that helps
us tomorrow.  
  
Q. How much was that a factor last night as you were climbing back to
tie the game and ultimately take the lead?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: It's a lot. I mean, like I said, to have the energy that our
fans have and the consistency with them, just when Lou has that steal or
Crystal makes those huge shots or Megan gets a rebound or Christyn drives,
anything like that, to have them roaring in our ears it just hypes you up so
much. Like I said, their consistency with us and the energy that they bring to
us is really invaluable, and so we're so lucky to have these fans.  
  
Q. Christyn, Coach was talking last night about when Olivia was on the
floor, she just kind of changed the game a little bit because of how big she
is. Was that kind of fun watching her get so involved and how much better
she's gotten in the postseason?  
CHRISTYN WILLIAMS: Yeah, Olivia has gotten a lot better. Just her presence on
the floor, she's big, she gets a lot of rebounds, blocked shots. So it's a
huge game changer when she's in the paint.  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: You know, there's probably no more, I think, nervous energy on
a team or coaching staff than the day between your Sweet 16 game and your
final 8 game because you just want to play. You know you've got to play a
really good team. You know you've got to play really well. You know what's at
stake in the game. You know what's the reward for winning the game. And the
prize for losing the game is your season is over.  
  
So there's a lot of anxiousness, I'm sure, that every team and every coaching
staff feels around this time. But that's kind of a good thing. We're ready --
I think, as ready as we're going to be. We kind of figured this is the team
we'd be playing. We'd be playing Louisville whether we were a 1 and they were
a 2, or we were a 2 and they're a 1. It really doesn't matter. This is
probably the match-up that was going to happen anyway, and we're anxious for
it to get started.  
  
Q. Geno, what's the biggest problem Louisville presents to you guys?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I think any time you have a player that can kind of create a
shot for themselves whenever they really need one, create some opportunities
for teammates. I think the NCAA Tournament is about great players, and if you
happen to have one of them who's used to being in that situation, and I think
Asia certainly is, I think you spend so much energy trying to defend her that
you hurt yourself at some other positions.  
  
I think you've just got to be careful that you don't get caught up in watching
Asia play and forget about the rest of the team. They're a really good team.
They're not just Asia Durr.  
  
Q. Geno, I know we talked to Napheesa a little bit last night about how
helpful it was that you've already seen Louisville once this season. Obviously
that was a loss, but what can you gain from that experience going into
tomorrow's game?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, the game was played in an odd sort of way. We wanted to
get the game moving really quickly in the beginning, and it moved so quickly
that I think Louisville got into a real comfort zone, and that first quarter
was pretty fast-paced. And the whole first half was pretty fast-faced, both
teams.  
  
So I was happy with the way we played. I didn't anticipate that third quarter
going the way it did where we just completely shut down. You know, we got away
from everything that we were doing well in the first half, and we were never
able to recover.  
  
I think the game's got to be played tomorrow possession by possession, a
40-minute game instead of us playing great in spurts and going long stretches
where we don't have great possessions. I think we're a better team than we
were when we played them the first time. I mean, I guess they are, too, for
that matter. So I think the game will reflect that.  
  
Q. In the first game against Louisville, you guys were still kind of
looking for a solid option off the bench. Now you kind of have Olivia as that
person. How do you expect she'll impact the game, and what are you looking for
her to do tomorrow?  
GENO AURIEMMA: You know, Liv does impact the game on the defensive end because
we just don't have anybody that can give us that kind of look. You know,
there's less lay-ups when she's in the game. There's less offensive rebounds
when she's in the game. There's a couple more blocked shots.  
  
So sometimes just seeing her standing in the middle of the lane is enough to
change the way a team wants to play on offense. And the fact that she's very
confident right now. I'm hoping that she adds some offense. But certainly
defensively she's helped us a lot.  
  
Q. Question for you about Asia Durr since you brought her up. You
actually had the opportunity to recruit her, so a two-part question. What was
that recruitment like, and what was it like when she told you that she was
going elsewhere?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, every recruiting story is pretty much the same. You know,
you always feel like in the beginning everybody is on the same level playing
field, you know. Everybody has got an equal chance. But then as time goes on,
you can start to see that sometimes you know you're going to get a kid and you
end up getting them. And there's other times when you keep trying, but you
know it's not going to work out.  
  
I think with Asia, it was obviously -- everybody was recruiting her, and only
one school was going to get her. And when she told me that she was going to
Louisville, I wasn't surprised. I mean, by the time you get a phone call
telling you where a kid is going, you already know where a kid is going. In
that respect, it was the same as recruiting every other kid.  
  
Q. How does the team dynamic change when your leaders and your top
contributors are seniors versus when they are not?  
GENO AURIEMMA: If your best players and your team leaders are the same people,
then it's actually pretty cool. Sometimes your best players and your team
leaders are not the same people, and then it's a little bit dicier. But
obviously if you're a senior and this is your first time in this position,
then you're not exactly in the same place mentally as if you're a senior and
this is your fourth time in this position. If you're a young kid who just came
to college and all of a sudden this isn't a January game where we have another
game on Wednesday, and now all of a sudden you're playing in a game where the
winner goes to the Final Four, that's a lot to ask for a freshman. I mean,
unless those freshmen are Duke's men's freshmen, then that's a little bit
different. But not everybody has those guys.  
  
So I think experience means a lot at this time of the year. It means almost as
much as talent. I think I'd trade, all things being equal, a really talented
kid for an experienced kid.  
  
Q. You're playing essentially your second game in about a day and a half
tomorrow, and I think you played all three of your starters all 40 minutes. Is
that a concern at all, especially as it pertains to Katie Lou with her back
issues?  
GENO AURIEMMA: You know, it can be. It can be. And at the same time, there's
nothing that they haven't done. Throughout most of the season it's been like
that, and hopefully we don't have to play them all 40 minutes. But sometimes
that's just the way it goes.  
  
As I said, the game will be played a little bit differently than it was played
down at Louisville, and we'll have to pick our spots, but I don't think
anybody is going to ask to come out tomorrow because they're tired. That
generally doesn't happen at this time of the year.  
  
Q. Following up on the experience question, something I asked Jeff. Over
the years you've talked about if your seniors, once you're getting to this
game, there can always be that little bit of, if I lose, it's the last game.
We could look at the Holdsclaw example, played great all year and then in that
Duke game in '99, she couldn't buy a shot to save her life --  
GENO AURIEMMA: It happens. You always worry about seniors, their whole senior
year, but especially in the NCAA Tournament. Some kids just take off and they
have incredible finishing acts to their careers. And other kids do get
worried, they do get a little bit apprehensive about what if, what if, what
if. They start to think that way.  
  
As a coach, I don't know that you can do anything to prevent that. I've been
in both situations, you know, where I've had seniors that they played their
best basketball during the NCAA Tournament, and I've had some older kids who
were a little bit gun-shy. You just hope, cross your fingers that you've got
kids that they've been waiting for this moment, and they know this is their
last time, and they're determined to make the most of it.  
  
Q. Geno, two-part question. I ask you this every year and you always
have a good answer on it --  
GENO AURIEMMA: Can you just write the answer I gave you last year?  
  
Q. You always say to get to the Final Four usually one player steps up
in this game to get you there. Do you think you know who that player will be
tomorrow? And the second question is: It's tough to beat you guys twice in a
year. I don't know if this has been asked before, but I think only Notre Dame
has done it in the last decade. What is it about you guys that when you play
someone more than once, that second time you usually don't lose to them?  
GENO AURIEMMA: We have a lot of really talented players on the floor that
second time that maybe weren't quite ready the first time. I think all the --
it's funny, this year all the stereotypes and all the preexisting theories
that I've heard, they just don't seem to hold up for me. Because this team
that I'm coaching right now is really unpredictable, and it's really quite
different than any other team that I've coached in the last 10 or 11 years.
You know, going into tomorrow, it's a different Louisville team that we're
playing, and I think it's a different Connecticut team that they're playing.  
  
But it still does come down to our best players have to out-play their best
players. That's the way it always works. I'm not going to come up with a
strategy tonight that's going to make a big difference tomorrow. Jeff might,
but I can't. And I think that it's more of a -- you know who your go-to
players are, and it's not going to be any different than it was during the
regular season, and you have to hope that they play exceptionally well. If
they don't, that puts a lot of pressure on somebody who's not used to playing
that well. That doesn't mean they can't do it, but the odds are against it.  
  
So that's why it's -- this is such a big game. And it's great to anticipate
it, because you're dying to see who's going to step up and be those kids.  
  
Q. This weekend Muffet McGraw in a pretty substantial story online
stated that she'll no longer hire male assistants. She's decided against that.
She's the defending National Championship coach. I was wondering do you think
there's a message there that could affect male coaches getting into the game,
or are the numbers just so stark with trying to get more women in the game,
men's and women's college, that she's on the right path? I just kind of wanted
to hear you out on that topic.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I hope she sends a thank you to all those guys that used
to be on her staff that got her all those good players that won a
championship. I don't know. I didn't read the story. I don't know anything
about it. But I look at some of the top programs in America, and they seem to
have pretty good coaches who happen to be men. So Muffet is entitled to hire
anybody she wants, you know. I don't know why she feels the need to make a
statement about it. I've never hired a guy as one of my assistants, either.
I'm not going to make a statement about it. Every coach does what they feel
comfortable doing.  
  
I don't think what's in that story is going to have any effect whatsoever
around the country, one bit. There's just too many good programs being run by
guys that all of a sudden athletic directors are going to go, you know what,
instead of doing what's best for my program, I'm going to do what's best for
Muffet McGraw. Not going to happen.  
  
Q. Jeff said that they're the underdogs tomorrow and that you're the
favorite, and also, if you could comment on that --  
GENO AURIEMMA: And he's still the coach at Louisville. I read that, too.  
  
Q. Do you see a parallel between their program and your program? Like
Jeff is trying to build there like the same thing that you have? And like a
little bit of his wiseguy-ness? Do you see a parallel between that?  
GENO AURIEMMA: You know, they've pretty much reached the place where most
people hope to go. You know, they have a great program. They have great crowd
support. They have great support from the University. They win. They go to the
Final Four. You know, they win championships in their league.  
  
You know, I think that's -- I think Jeff is a little too old to be crying that
they're the underdog, you know. We're on a losing streak with them, you know.
I mean, if that's what they need or if that's what he needs to get his team to
that point, then I'm okay with that. I think it's pretty funny. But I guess
you've got to do what you've got to do to get your team ready to go.  
  
Any time I hear these stories, I get a kick out of it. You know, I mean, I
don't remember the last time we've been an underdog. Can anybody remember
that, the last time somebody said Connecticut is the underdog? So maybe he's
going by that. We've just been the favorite so often. But I think we're
sitting on the wrong bench tomorrow, though, if we're the favorite. They need
to change the benches. And I think we're wearing the wrong uniforms.

## March 29, 2019

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Katie McWilliams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34760)

### [Mikayla Pivec](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32690)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
Louisville - 61, Oregon State - 44  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, congratulations to Louisville, first off. Excellent team,
great defensive team, and then just made the plays, you know, to win tonight,
and that's what great teams do. They hurt us in transition. They had just a
couple spurts where they separate. They hit big shots early in this game to
get the initial separation from us over the top. Fuehring was tough, I
thought. She just was a leader, like she is.  
  
I loved our effort tonight, however. I thought we played an excellent game
with the exception of shooting the ball. The ball just didn't fall, and that's
basketball.  
  
They did a nice job taking the rim away, forced us into perimeter shots. But
before tonight, anyway, we were fourth in the nation in three-point
percentage, so that's something we were very comfortable with. For whatever
reason they just didn't go, so 2 of 22 in a game that's 10 points with five
minutes to go.  
  
Looking back, I liked what we were getting, I just wish there was another gear
to hit or something else to do. But give them credit for taking the rim away.  
  
This team is unbelievable. Incredible character, incredible heart. Had a
phenomenal season, Jo and Katie did a great job as seniors for us. And so
afterwards I just said thank you. I said thank you for doing everything right,
for competing the right way and being incredible role models. They've had a
phenomenal season, and the ball just didn't bounce our way tonight.  
  
Q. For both of you two, Coach said shots just weren't falling. Was it
one of those nights where you were getting looks, shots just weren't going in
the basket?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Yeah, I felt like we got a lot of really good looks on the
outside. They were helping on the drives, and we had that kickback and we also
had opportunities for the guards to hit threes, and they just weren't falling
for us today. We've had a little bit of a stretch in this last month where we
haven't shot is as well as we usually do.  
  
KATIE McWILLIAMS: Yeah, shots weren't falling, but I thought we had a great
defensive game. We held them to 61 points, which is a lot lower than their
average, so just proud of what this team was able to do even though we lost
and even though we weren't shooting as well as we usually do.  
  
Q. Katie, question for you: Just when you think about where the program
was when you came and where the program is now, what do you think the
significance is of it that you're here in the Sweet 16, and that may even feel
like a disappointment, given all that you've accomplished and given all that
the program is able to do?  
KATIE McWILLIAMS: You know, it's been a high-end program ever since I came. My
freshman year went to the Final Four and then another Sweet 16, Elite 8, Sweet
16. We're nothing but competitors, and it's nothing but a great culture and
family program. I mean, they're going to be doing big things for a long time,
especially under Scott, and I know that my teammates that continue to play
here are just going to do amazing things as just basketball players and
people.  
  
Q. Katie kind of said it, but if you went into this game and someone
told you Louisville would have 61 points by the end of the game and 44 after
three, I'm guessing you would probably think you guys would be in pretty good
shape to win the game?  
SCOTT RUECK: I did. Just like I said, we got shots we knew we would get. We
missed stuff at the rim even, we missed a couple free throws that we normally
make. You know, but I liked what we had. Defensively I felt just as we studied
them, it was nice to have more than a day to study them in the depth that I
wanted to from a year ago.  
  
You know, I thought we made them go to the spots on the floor we wanted them
to. We made them miss, we made them shoot 40 percent. Our score is 17 1/2
points less than their average, and that's what we do. We're known for that,
and we executed those things.  
  
We couldn't get anything going inside. Give them credit. We got the shots for
the most part that we wanted on the perimeter, they just didn't fall. And so I
don't know, that's basketball, I guess.  
  
But, yes, I was very pleased with our effort tonight. Just unfortunate that it
didn't go down. Because it's a completely different game if we're hitting
shots, you know. They hit a bunch of shots but they're up on the board.
There's no scoreboard pressure. If we come out and we knock some shots down
and close the gap even sooner or earlier or further in the first quarter, then
maybe some of those perimeter post shots are a little tighter, and that's the
game.  
  
But they were able to keep us at bay, took pressure off them, were able to
continue to score in the fourth.  
  
Q. Third quarter it looked like you guys tried a few different things. I
saw Katie play out at the point and Mikayla. Were you just trying some stuff
just to kind of shake things up and hope to get some offense at some point?  
SCOTT RUECK: I'm always trying stuff, and so, yes, I was trying some stuff.
Just the way they were shifting their defense, I thought, could give us a
couple different options. Moving Destiny around I thought would be good for
us, so that was part of that. Katie. This team has been blessed with four
point guards that have played significant time at the 1, Katie being one of
them. And so putting the ball in her hands has always been, for the most part,
a good thing for us. Sees the floor so well. And so that was one thing to try.  
  
But you've got to try something, you know, just to spark a little bit of
confidence. What if one of those would have gone down? Honestly, if one of
those shots would have gone down I think everybody could have just relaxed,
like okay, this is the one, this is the one that's going down, and this is the
one, and there were a couple -- a couple from the other side where I'm kind of
lined up with the ball, like that's going down. Just didn't.  
  
Give them credit for being great on the defensive glass. We won the boards by
eight, another category that I felt great about. However, when we needed that
extra little O-board, they did a great job on the defensive boards to hold us
to one shot.  
  
Q. When you look up tonight, there were a few teams in the Pac-12, like
you, UCLA, Arizona State, Stanford -- when you look up, there's a slew of
teams that came into this tournament. I know you can't speak for everybody,
but just talk about how tough it is to win in the Pac-12 and what does it say
when you have that many teams coming down this deep into the tournament?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, well, it's a pleasure to be a part of such a fantastic
group. The competition in our league, it feels like tonight every night. Our
last nine games -- I'm a big mass e-rating fan. I don't know if anybody else
is, but personally I go there. I've gone there ever since my D-III days,
because they rate Division III. Right now there's nine teams in the top 35.
Our last nine Pac-12 games were against those teams. The Sweet 16 teams, Cal
and Arizona on the road.  
  
And so it's just been an absolute grind, and so we're all battle tested. It
didn't surprise me that UCLA came in and played the way they did tonight with
as much toughness as they did in their game. Nothing fazed us tonight. It was
just a night where the ball didn't go for us. In fact, we just walked by the
scoreboard, this is the same score as our Stanford game down there where it
was an amazing defensive performance, the ball just didn't fall for us. And
that's actually where our shooting struggles began that night, on a night very
similar.  
  
You know, and so this conference, I knew everybody would be battle tested and
ready for the tournament no matter what tournament it was and they would do
well. So I don't see it changing, either. The coaches are just too good
throughout and everybody is recruiting so well and working so hard.  
  
Q. As someone who's sent plenty of players to the WNBA, I'm curious in
two parts: Number one, when you think about Destiny and getting her from here
to there a year from now, what do you see as what needs to happen next? And
just also on Asia, just from seeing her up close the last couple years, what
do you think stands out and will make her an elite pro at the next level?  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, and hopefully for Destiny it's two years. She's got two for
us.  
  
Well, they're both dynamic. When you look at a player, like you mentioned,
we've put four in the WNBA the last three years, and each one of them had a
unique skill. Each one of them was un-guardable one-on-one. Each one of them
commanded a double-team. Each one of them had an incredible work ethic and had
ultimate confidence. And so Destiny is on her way.  
  
Taking a year off is hard. Last year she played the 3 in practice because we
needed Mikayla Pivec and Aleah Goodman to get every rep at the point, because
those were our point guards last year. For her to now step into the 1, to step
into a conference that defends and is as tactical as the Pac-12 has been,
there's been growing pains for her. We defend differently than anything that
she'd been used to.  
  
So I just spoke to her in the locker room and told her how proud I was of her
taking on all this this year with so much scrutiny and pressure and so many
eyes on her in this limelight position that she's in. I've never coached a
player with that much hype and that much attention going into a season with
zero experience playing for us. It was really a unique year. I think she's
handled it phenomenally.  
  
She's got another gear to hit in preparation. The game is so easy for her,
show up and be the best kid on the floor, get a shot off whenever you feel
like it, and she's just so dynamic in her skill set and her athleticism.  
  
For her, the future is just a different level of prep in every way, and just
to see herself as somebody that is a number one draft pick, and to do all
those things. So she's on her way. It's been a learning year.  
  
For Asia, I mean, what can you say about her? She's elite in every way. I was
thinking before the game just that commitment for Louisville, what that's
meant for them to get her and what she can do for that team and how she makes
everybody so confident.  
  
Her ability not only to create her own shot but to draw defense, to understand
the game and to create opportunities for her teammates, as well, and then you
saw a couple fantastic defensive plays. She's somebody that's fantastic on
both ends of the floor, which at that level you've got to have, and then I
like her ball security. She doesn't make mistakes, and I know at the WNBA they
don't like turnovers. She's going to be a fantastic pro.  
  
Yeah, and she's a classy competitor, too. I'll tell you that. I haven't
interacted with her much, but even tonight it was a real nice greeting after
the game: Congrats, Coach, you do a great job. She doesn't need to say that
stuff, but she did. So I'm a fan.  
  
Q. Scott, obviously you guys have proven during the season you're a
really good shooting team from the perimeter, but the last few weeks haven't
been real great. Is it possible -- you've talked about the grind. Did fatigue
set in here late in the season maybe, and maybe that was a little bit of the
reason?  
SCOTT RUECK: Maybe. We shot lights out in our practice yesterday. I mean, and
we went the bare minimum amount of time that we could. We didn't miss. Maybe
that was a problem. Maybe I should have cut off practice as soon as we made a
shot and said save them for tomorrow.  
  
But I don't know about that. I mean, lay-ups are easier to make through
fatigue for sure than perimeter shots. But there's a lot of threes going down
for other teams.  
  
The grind of the conference, who knows. You can speculate all you want. I
don't know. There's no way for me truly to know that. Shots looked good to me.  
  
But it has been a grind, I'll tell you that. It has been a grind. But I liked
our energy. I liked our effort, and we defended extremely well. And so I think
we had plenty of fuel in the tank. Just didn't fall.

### [Japreece Dean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30409)

### [Kennedy Burke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35194)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
UConn - 69, UCLA - 61  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, we'll ask that you provide an opening statement, and
then we'll have questions for the student-athletes.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Absolutely. I don't know what to say other than that talk in the
locker room, I've been doing this 26 years, and it doesn't get any easier. I
asked the team, you know, we lost to Loyola Marymount, who's a good team, lots
of respect for them at the beginning of the year, but if I had told them if
they would stay focused on the process and keep a growth mindset and get
better and give to each other every day that they could end up playing at this
level and competing at this level, possession by possession, with UConn, would
they have thought that was possible, and I'm not sure they would have been
able to dream that big at that point when we were really disappointed after
our opening game.  
  
And to watch them, they really taught this -- I think I said this yesterday,
but they just continued to do it. They taught this old lady about all the
things that I say out loud, but they made it go a little deeper in my heart
about what can happen if you stay focused on getting better every day and
truly making a difference in each other's lives as teammates. If you're a good
teammate and you grow every day, something special can happen.  
  
And I believed it, and I've seen it over time, but they really seared it on my
heart.  
  
You know, it's hard because we didn't come to play close. We came to compete
to win, and we believed it and fought for it. But all year long, and
especially in the postseason, I've told them over and over again to be where
your feet are moment by moment and don't worry about the past or what could or
could not happen in the future and just make sure you finish empty.  
  
As their head coach, I could look them in the eye and I could say: You can
have peace. You finished empty. And as a head coach, that's all I can ask for.  
  
Q. Kennedy, that fourth quarter you guys were up one, and I think they
scored the first six and then went on a 15-4 run. Was it something they did,
or what was the difference in that fourth quarter that got them over the
hump?  
KENNEDY BURKE: The biggest difference was our defense, and that's what we're
known for. We made some huge stops. I think we did have like four stops in a
row, and that made the change in the game.  
  
Q. Japreece, you and Cori spoke at halftime before you guys went into
the locker room. I'm curious what that conversation was like and how you sort
of took that into the third quarter where you guys made the run that you
did.  
JAPREECE DEAN: She just encouraged me, like she always does, and just told me
to stay aggressive despite my shooting and just to encourage the team and lead
and just stay on attack mode.  
  
Q. Kennedy and Japreece, I was just wondering, now that the season is
over, what are you kind of most proud of of the team, sort of reflecting
back?  
KENNEDY BURKE: You said individually or as a team?  
  
Q. As a team.  
KENNEDY BURKE: I just think that this particular year, this team was really
special. Even though we didn't start off well, we showed that we could fight
and that we could compete with any team. And this team is going to go a long
way next year, and I'm excited for them.  
  
JAPREECE DEAN: Yeah, I'm just proud of how we kept going despite the beginning
of our season and what outsiders were saying and who we lost and who we don't
have and how people stepped up into different roles and how we just stayed
level headed through any game we played.  
  
I felt like the Pac-12 got us ready for these type of games, and it was just
amazing to see how people stepped up and how people led, and it was just
great.  
  
Q. When Lindsey Corsaro hit that three at the top of the circle and you
go up by five, what's going through your head?  
KENNEDY BURKE: I think in that moment I was just excited for this team because
Lindsey hit a big shot, and we can count on her to make those big shots in the
games, and we just had to continue that on the defensive end.  
  
Even though things didn't go our way, I'm still proud of her confidence, and
just like throughout this entire year she's always been a leader for us, and
I'm just really proud of her.  
  
JAPREECE DEAN: I think mostly after that stop I was just thinking about
defense and trying to get another stop so we could go on our run and don't let
them go on theirs. So mostly just trying to get a stop after that big shot.  
  
Q. I was wondering if you could both speak about the house that Coach
Cori talks about throughout the whole season, this house that you guys are
building, and kind of even though you guys fell short today, what did that
house look like to you guys and what did that mean to you guys?  
JAPREECE DEAN: I think we built a mansion, honestly. People stepped up, like I
said before, into huge roles, and no one was scared and no one backed down,
and like I could respect that so much. The house just consists of, I don't
know, just people doing different things and staying together and being one
and being expected to win games and trusting the process.  
  
She never wavered when we were losing games in the beginning. She knew what we
could do, and credit to Coach Cori, she kept us encouraged, and we decided
that we were going to be encouraged and stay together.  
  
KENNEDY BURKE: Yeah, I would have to agree with her. I think the biggest thing
was just believing in ourselves, having confidence in ourselves. And yeah.  
  
Q. After you guys went up and they went to a 1-3-1 press and they
asserted Olivia, how did that affect your offense during the second half?  
KENNEDY BURKE: I think when they made that change in their defense, we -- if
someone drives, we weren't really moving off of the ball. I think we were
standing and watching a lot, and it just made us throw up shots that we didn't
really want. But I think overall we just showed fight.  
  
JAPREECE DEAN: I would just say it slowed us down. I think he knows that we
can get out in transition and run, so I think it was a great tactic just to
slow us down.  
  
Q. Japreece, getting that extra year of eligibility, does that make it
easier when you think about sort of what you've built and what there is left
to do? And, Kennedy, I'm curious if you can reflect on what the culture is
that's been built that once you got that extra year, there's a dog pile and
there's such joy obviously that went along with that?  
JAPREECE DEAN: I think the year is great, but I mean, right now it obviously
hurts that we lost the game, so I'm not really thinking about the extra year.
But credit everyone that helped me and supported me through that process to
get an extra year, and I appreciate my teammates for being happy for me. But
as far as right now I'm just kind of reflecting on this season.  
  
KENNEDY BURKE: When I heard that -- when we heard that Japreece was going to
get an extra year, I was just excited for the team. And even though when we
heard the news, it was still like during the time where we were preparing for
this tournament, I just knew that she would take us all the way, a long ways.
And I'm just excited for her, and she's going to lead this team next year, and
she's going to do great things for them.  
  
Q. Cori, same thing I asked Kennedy; that run to start the fourth
quarter, was it just defensive stops they were getting? What was the
difference in that?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think they -- their strength is their offensive execution,
and I thought they asserted the will of their strength more than our strength,
which is defense, rebounding, getting downhill in transition. Right? So which
team can play to their strengths in those pressurized moments, and the reality
is they played to theirs.  
  
We had to stop switching. We went to something completely different where we
had three people that were switching screens and two people that were chasing,
and you know, credit them; I also thought the big difference was some of those
big shots by Dangerfield. Those were really the backbreakers. They came in --
I thought we regrouped after their 6-0 run, and I think we scored, and I still
had a good confidence about us.  
  
But I saw our demeanor change when Dangerfield hit a couple of those big shots
late in the shot clock, and a couple of them were just good defense, better
offense. I thought that's when I saw sort of a little bit of doubt creep in
our eyes.  
  
Q. Kind of building on to that, you controlled the pace throughout, even
though you're a running team and you kept them deep into the shot clock. But
in the fourth quarter it didn't work so well.  
CORI CLOSE: No, it didn't.  
  
Q. What happened there?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think we weren't able to control the flow on offense, and
to your question about the press, it really put us in a more standstill, one
pass, make a read, and there was not a lot of rhythm.  
  
What you saw in their offense was a lot of rhythm, was a lot of fluidity, and
when they did their press and we sort of got on our heels, we didn't ever get
our rhythm back and getting players shots in rhythm.  
  
Credit their defense; they really stepped up and made what we wanted to run
hard. And obviously their game plan was to give us jumpers and see if we could
hit them, and we had a harder time with that today. That's about as worst game
of shooting as we've had in a long time. I didn't think we could have 26
percent again in the second half.  
  
But credit them, their defense. They rolled the dice on that, and it worked
for them. And it wasn't our best shooting night. The reality is I think they
played in a rhythm and fluidity, and we weren't able to find ours after that
point.  
  
Q. Obviously you said 26 years, it doesn't get easier at the end. But
you have a different group and a different spot, and there's so much talent
coming back next year and a great class coming in. I guess I wonder whether
you process it differently now, and is it easier or just different to process
it in the coming days?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, it'll be easier in a couple weeks. You know, I think the
reality is that we didn't -- I just love this group of young women. So right
now all I'm thinking about is these young women and my responsibility to lead
them in our mission as a program and to help them be their best as young
women, as representatives of the university, as students and, of course, as
competitive athletes.  
  
I'm excited about what we've had. I've been excited about it all year and very
thankful we're now at a place in our program where our culture is feeding
itself and our recruiting is becoming very consistent.  
  
I have a lot to be proud of in terms of what my staff -- really, they get so
much credit for what we have built, but right now I see the eyes on the faces
of these young women that I love very much and that are very disappointed but
have grown immensely.  
  
Q. What will you remember the most about this season reflecting on this
team?  
CORI CLOSE: One of our core values is a growth mindset, and I also will -- and
they did that. They just every week got better. Every week -- it got to the
point about mid-January. I started texting the leadership group the day before
our week started and said, What does our emphasis need to be this week?  
  
And the first part of the year, the staff would come up with that, like what
are the musts, how do we have to grow this week. And from about mid-January
on, our leadership group decided that. And they were really the drivers of the
growth of this team.  
  
The other thing I'll remember about this team is that they didn't let anyone
on the outside define who they could become. They didn't let a lack of
expectation or too much expectation -- they were like, no, I'm going to define
who I can become individually, and we are going to define ourselves what we
can become collectively.  
  
You know, it takes a lot of guts as an 18- to 23-year-old in this day and age,
and I'm really proud of how they learned to define who they wanted to be, and
that's something that's not only helped our team this year, but that's going
to stay with them for the rest of their lives, and I'm really thankful that
they have that moment to refer to.  
  
Q. I saw you in the Bridgeport bracket when you guys upset Maryland. Now
you come back this year and you beat Maryland, and people kind of seemed like
it was an upset because you were a No. 6 seed, and then coming in and going
against UConn, people probably felt like you were going to get blown out. But
you always give UConn a fight. You don't go away. Coming in, did you feel like
you were getting the respect that you deserve?  
CORI CLOSE: I don't know. I just always -- Coach Wooden had a quote that if
you focus on things that are out of your control, it adversely affects the
things that are under your control, and I just can't control that.  
  
I think it goes back to what I just said in terms of we just didn't let that
stuff define us. We really believed in the match-up. We believed in if we
played to our best, that we could win.  
  
We had a period of about six minutes that we didn't play our best, and we
didn't win. But I don't really think that ever fazed us, honestly. Every day I
would just look in their eyes and are they ready to battle again for another
week, and they were ready. Every time I looked at them, they responded.  
  
We have a phrase about, and we talked about it several times in the game, is
all we can control is our R, which is our response. And if you don't like your
outcome, then you'd better change your R. Over and over again, these women
just responded, over and over. I didn't really give it a second thought, and I
don't think our players did, either.  
  
Q. Coach, I asked the players this same question, when Lindsey Corsaro
hit that three to put you up by five, what's going through your head knowing
that you had completed sort of a comeback in the sense of you're back in the
game, you're up five? What's going through your head in terms of holding
UConn?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think I thought the same thing as Japreece. I don't think
we really ride the waves of that. I think if we did, we were going to be in
big trouble. I think it was really a possession-by-possession game. Obviously
as those things happen, you believe deeper and deeper, like we can do this.
And so I'd be lying if it didn't fuel our belief. I'm sure it did. But I
really do think it was a next-play mentality, you know, what is required of me
for this possession.  
  
So, you know, yeah, but I didn't think we started believing then. I think we
believed throughout, and maybe it grew, but I think it was just what do I need
to do to help our team get one more stop.  
  
Q. You talked about empowering your leadership team. There was a time-
out when we were down 55-50. You delayed about a minute before you went over,
you let the players speak and then you went in. Was that the idea behind it
empowering the leadership team?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think always. At this point in the year, I can't control
it all. I think all year long, we don't want to have a program that has a
bunch of plays and that I have to call the most brilliant game in order for us
to win. I want our players to not only feel empowered but to be equipped with
their skill, with their belief, with their confidence, with their
communication.  
  
And I think in March players have got to be feeling empowered to make plays. I
did the same thing at halftime. I said, What are you guys talking about? What
are you seeing? And I trust them. They've earned that trust. I didn't give
them that trust, they earned that trust, and I want them -- I think about most
of them want to go on and play professional basketball, so I have a parallel
mission to help us reach our potential, to help them grow as people and then
to prepare them for their next set of dreams.  
  
At the next level we've got to think and make plays and adjust to coaches and
different styles quickly, and they've got to be empowered to think on their
own if they want to make those next steps.  
  
Q. You're no stranger to seeing players make that leap to the W;
obviously Napheesa Collier is on her way. What do you see as her game at the
next level? What do you think she'll do best for her WNBA team when she gets
there?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, it's interesting. She's a little bit different than Kennedy
Burke in some ways but similar in others. They're very versatile. I think it's
going to depend on who drafts her and what system she is. But I think that her
ability to make an impact no matter where she goes or what system she's in,
she's a machine. She is so active away from the ball, she plays great defense
on the perimeter as well as in the post. You know, her post game was obviously
where they took advantage tonight, but over the course of scouting her ability
to take the ball off the bounce and attack that way, as she grows in her
confidence to shooting the ball, as well, she's just scratching the surface.  
  
But her consistency of tempo and her ability to affect the game in so many
different ways, you know, she's obviously got a really bright future.  
  
But I feel similarly about Kennedy Burke. I think she's an elite defender and
she's a match-up nightmare, and she's just scratching the surface, as well. So
I think you see two really versatile players that are going to make their
impact in the WNBA.

_Albany, New York_  
  
Louisville - 61, Oregon State - 44  
  
JEFF WALZ: First like to start off and congratulate Oregon State. We knew
coming into this it was going to be a hard-fought game. Scott does a
remarkable job with that program, with his team. They're always very well
prepared, run multiple sets at the offensive end of the floor, and then will
throw different defenses at you.  
  
So I thought we did a really, really good job of preparation. Coach Purcell,
Coach Williams, Coach Norman, my assistant coaches did a remarkable job. And
our players were confident in what we had gone over. And that's half the
battle. When you can step on to the court when a game is about to start and
your kids feel confident in what you've gone over, really it gives you a good
sense of just calm.  
  
So really, really pleased with how our young women played. Everyone I thought
gave great effort, and then everybody had a little bit to do with it
throughout the entire game. And that's what you have to have.  
  
I say it all the time: We might not have the best five players on the floor
every single night. Our margin for error is thin. But I do believe when we all
play together as a team, we're a pretty darned good basketball team.  
  
Q. Asia, can you talk about the defensive effort tonight? I know
yesterday you were talking about how you guys don't probably get as much
credit as you deserve for the defense you play, but to hold the team to the
points you did tonight, just the defensive effort you guys put on?  
ASIA DURR: I think we played hard throughout the whole game. We made them take
tough shots, and it was a whole -- what am I trying to say? It was a whole
team, it wasn't just one player or one person. During this time of the year,
that's what it comes down to. It can't just come down to just one player
guarding their best player. It has to come down to the whole team. That's what
we did a great job of doing that tonight, and I'm glad that we got the win.  
  
Q. Asia, you're usually the three-point threat. Tonight it was Sam to
start the game. How cool was that? And Sam, when did you really know that you
were feeling it tonight?  
ASIA DURR: You know, I'm proud of Sam. I've said it all year long, like my
teammates can score. That goes to show you that's what they do. I'm very
confident in them and very proud of Sam for showing off that three-point shot.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Thank you, Asia.  
  
ASIA DURR: You're welcome.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: But when did I start feeling it? I mean, shootaround we've
practiced it. Coach Walz has given me confidence in that. The coaches have. My
teammates have, too. But yeah, it was all shootaround really in preparing for
the game. That's why I shot it and it went down, so I just kept shooting it.  
  
Q. Who is the best player at Scrabble right now in the lobby? There's a
Scrabble board in the lobby.  
ASIA DURR: I haven't played.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: I didn't know.  
  
ARICA CARTER: I would definitely win if we played.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Definitely me. I was in the spelling bee, too.  
  
Q. Asia, forgive me for going ahead already to Sunday, but it's going to
come up pretty soon. You guys are going to be playing UConn again. Can you
reflect back on the victory you had against them in January? You guys did a
lot right, including 11 three-pointers, outrebounding them, and what will it
take to do that on Sunday?  
ASIA DURR: Well, the same thing but 10 times more. We're going to get their
best shot. It's going to be a challenge for us guarding them. I'm very
confident in my team, though, and we're going to accept this challenge and
have fun with it.  
  
ARICA CARTER: I think Asia hit it on the head. We've just got to come out and
play hard. It's March Madness, so everybody is going to give you their best
shot. We've got to make sure that we do the things good again this time and
fix the things that we didn't do so good last time.  
  
Q. Asia, Scott talked about your defense, and defensive metrics really
love the game you've put up, especially this season. I wonder if you think
people are starting to catch up with perception, the reality of your defensive
abilities?  
ASIA DURR: My defense?  
  
Q. Mm-hmm.  
ASIA DURR: What are they saying?  
  
Q. There's an appreciation for it, your synergy numbers are top 10
percent.  
ASIA DURR: So this is like Gary Payton now? I'm just kidding.  
  
Q. But do you think that your defense --  
ASIA DURR: No.  
  
Q. You don't think --  
ASIA DURR: Do I think what?  
  
Q. Do you think your defense deserves greater appreciation throughout
your time at Louisville?  
ASIA DURR: Honestly, I couldn't tell you that. I don't pay attention to what
people say. So I don't know. I just try to dial in. I know my team needs me to
guard, and I don't want to be the weak link, so I just try to step that up.  
  
JEFF WALZ: It's definitely improved. As a freshman, no one could go by her.  
  
ASIA DURR: Anybody can go by you, my grandma can. No, just kidding.  
  
Q. You tied a low-scoring number on the season. What was it like
battling that defense?  
JEFF WALZ: No, you know, was that our low you say? Was it? Tied it, okay.  
  
You know what, I thought we came out extremely well in that first quarter. The
first quarter I thought we came out, we were focused, the ball was moving. And
then we got a little stagnant there in the second quarter, only scoring nine.  
  
But we were fortunate that we continued to defend, and that's one thing that
we continued to talk to our players about, if the ball is not going in the
basket, you can't worry about it, and then you've got to get back down the
other end of the floor.  
  
You know, our goal every night is to get 70 plus. I think it's in our game
notes, Nick has got it in our game notes, our record when we score 70-plus is
pretty impressive throughout our 12 years here.  
  
That's our goal offensively. But in a game like this where Scott does a great
job of executing, and they're going to run through their stuff, and there's
just -- there's not a ton of shots, you know, we had 57, they had 56, and then
there's 13 free throw attempts for them, 11 for us. So it's not -- it wasn't a
high-possession game.  
  
So when that's the case, you've got to make sure that you're being efficient
at the offensive end.  
  
I think the stat of the game for me, what I'll talk to our kids about, is we
gave up 11 offensive rebounds, but they only turned those into three points.
We ended up with four offensive boards and came up with five. And that's what
you have to figure out -- you've got to figure out a way to get some easy
baskets, and one of those, I believe, led to a three in the first quarter.  
  
Q. You always joke about how winning games by scoring more points than
the opponent, but it seems a lot of success you've had in the NCAA Tournament
and getting to the Final Fours is on the defensive end. Looking at the game
tonight, defense helped UConn win, other games around the country, same way.
Is defense more important in a sense this time of year because everyone has
scouted everyone well enough to know what to do?  
JEFF WALZ: I know what you're saying, and yes, it's important, but I really
believe if you want to win in March, you've got to figure out a way to score,
especially on Sunday. We're going to be playing a team that puts the ball in
the basket at a pretty high rate in UConn.  
  
But of course, we sit here and we take great pride in putting a scouting
report together. We play each and every individual player differently, and our
kids do a remarkable job of it, because it's not easy. I tell people all the
time, it's another class. They're taking 15 hours in college, and this is
another class, because of the detail that has to go into it.  
  
But they've done a remarkable job all season, and that's how we've been able
to continue to have success. So yeah, we'll come out here on Sunday with a
plan. We're going to have to do everything we can to at least make them take
contested shots, and then we're going to have to rebound the basketball
because that's the one area that obviously we got out-rebounded again tonight
by eight, and that's always been a concern of mine.  
  
Q. Earlier I asked a question to the Oregon State coach about how
impressive his conference was with the Pac-12. When you look at your
conference with NC State and of course the champs, Notre Dame, when you're
playing teams like that in your conference, how much preparation does it give
you going forward when you're facing a team like UConn in the tournament?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I think it's a ton of preparation. The one thing about our
league that I've always enjoyed is there's so many different styles of play.
It's not just one style. And that helps prepare you for the NCAA Tournament
because there's somebody that you're going to be able to tell your players,
hey, this team reminds me of Syracuse. This team reminds me of Miami, whoever
it might be within the league.  
  
And because we have I think such really good coaches in the ACC, they're going
to throw different looks at you. They're going to challenge you. You know, the
one thing we knew coming into this tonight, that Oregon State was going to
change up defenses. And I thought we handled that really well. And that's
because that's what you get when you play Clemson. And that's why I think you
have teams in the ACC that have success in postseason, because you are
prepared for it throughout your league play.  
  
Q. They went 2 for 22 from three and they can shoot it pretty well.
Sometimes it's just the ball not going in. Did you do anything special in
terms of getting out on their shooters or --  
JEFF WALZ: Well, you're right. We gave up a few open looks. Like the one at
the end of the third quarter was a straightaway three from the corner, I
believe, for McWilliams, who normally knocks that down. But I thought we had a
little bit to do with it because I thought we got them playing a little faster
than what they possibly like to play. And when you're sitting there and all of
a sudden there's a great look and here comes someone flying at you, your
routine speeds up. And then all of a sudden you're a little shorter or you're
a little long, and I think we had something to do with that. But at times, it
is luck.  
  
I mean, I think there were two or three that were halfway down and popped out,
and that's why I always say, this time of the year, anything can happen. And
then you've got to get a break here or there in order to figure out how to
squeeze out a win.  
  
Q. UCLA gave UConn a good run in that fourth quarter, just UConn was
UConn. UCLA has never beaten them, your kids have at the end of January. How
important is that, to have that confidence of having beaten them?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I think it's really important. I think that just to have that
knowledge of, hey, we can do this, we've done it in the past, they were at
full strength when they came to our place. And at the same time, you can't be
overconfident thinking, oh, hey, all we have to do is show up, we beat them
last time. I'm sure it'll be out there somewhere, but when is the last time
someone beat them twice in one season? Was it in '13 maybe? Did Notre Dame
beat them twice in '13? It hasn't happened very often.  
  
So we know what's in front of us, and it's -- now you're in the tournament. I
tell people all the time, gosh, you're on the same side as UConn, you're on
the same side of the bracket as UConn. I can tell you from experience being on
the opposite side isn't very good, either. I mean, I think we still own the
record for the worst defeat in a title game.  
  
So you know, it hasn't worked out very well for us being on the opposite side.
So let's see how this works out.  
  
But it's going to be fun. I've got the utmost respect for Geno and for what
he's done. I mean, how many Final Fours have they been to? 11? I've got to use
my toes to get to it. I mean, I tell people, he makes it look easy, and I
don't -- it's not easy. It's really remarkable.  
  
You know, we're going to have a chance to come in here on Sunday and lace it
up and see what we can do. We're going to give it everything we have. I tell
my kids all the time: If we're going to lose a ball game, I want to lose just
simply because we missed shots. I don't want it to be because we didn't give
great effort, we didn't follow a scouting report. I just want it to be
because, you know what, we missed shots. We got good shots, and we missed
them. And it happens sometimes.  
  
So yeah, we're excited. We're going to enjoy this win tonight, which I guess
it's over already, and then we'll sit tomorrow, and it's not going to be one
where we're up and down and doing a whole bunch, because we just can't. We
have to get some rest.  
  
Q. You guys made it really hard for Oregon State to get the shots they
wanted inside. How do you translate that to Sunday with the likes of Collier
in the post?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, it's going to be different. It's a completely different look
for us in terms of how they spread the floor. You know, it's going to be a
challenge. Napheesa is playing as well as anybody in the country. I enjoyed
watching her in high school and then having the opportunity to work with her
with USA Basketball. She's just -- she's a competitor.  
  
Same thing for Katie Lou and Crystal. What Crystal did there in that fourth
quarter was pretty darned impressive. She threw them on their back and said,
Come on, people, let's go. I think it was either a 7-0 or 9-0 run that she had
herself, and they were not easy shots. That one three she hit off that screen
was from about 24 or 25 feet and then the step-back she hits driving on the
left baseline were difficult shots.  
  
So we're excited for it, and we're going to enjoy this tonight, though, and
then get a plan together and come out on Sunday.

_Albany, New York_  
  
UConn - 69, UCLA - 61  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: The game kind of speaks for itself. You know, I don't think
there's anything that came easy from the very opening tip. You know, it was a
struggle. We had to work really, really hard for everything we got. There was
a tremendous amount of pressure on our guys to make plays. Every pass was
contested. Every cut was contested. Every shot was difficult to come by.  
  
There were a lot of opportunities for us in the second half -- because we only
played four and a half players, so to speak. We just found a way, somehow --
When we really needed to make some shots, when we needed to make a play. A lot
of times - I tell the players this all the time - nobody is going to trick
anybody this time of year with some fancy plays. You know, you either have
players that can make big-time plays or you don't. And we had these three guys
up here, they made some big plays at crucial moments. That's what it takes to
win at this time of the year.  
  
Q. Crystal, that fourth quarter run you guys scored the first six points
in a 15-4 run, I think you had 9 of your 15 in that stretch. Did you have to
do something offensively to get this team going? What was the difference in
that fourth quarter for the team?  
CRYSTAL DANGERFIELD: It was really taking what the defense was giving us.
Coach challenged us at halftime to get into the paint, not really looking for
fouls, but just going in there to score, and he wanted to make sure that we
had a balance of inside shots and outside shots.  
  
Q. Napheesa, can you address what Coach was saying, just they are so --
UCLA, not that you guys aren't incredibly athletic, but they're so athletic
and they just get in your business on everything? Can you talk about that and
how you were able to keep your composure with that?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Yeah, they're incredibly athletic and physical, and they're
all kind of the same height. Our biggest thing tonight was rebounding, And
while these two did amazing today, especially as they addressed Crystal in the
fourth quarter, I was really proud of Megan Walker and how we talked before
the game about how it's really going to decide us rebounding and boxing out,
and I thought she did an amazing job. I think she had 11 rebounds, so I
definitely want to give a lot of credit to her.  
  
I think we're all going to need a soak and a ice bath tonight. It was really
physical. But we grinded it out, and I'm really proud of how we played
tonight.  
  
Q. Napheesa, you talked about how physical it was. Talk about how you
guys went in the second half, the 1-3-1 zone press, you guys kind of stagnated
the offense. Do you think that was the turning point of the game?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Yeah, I thought our press was really disruptive for them. I
thought it made them kind of slow down and have to do things that they were
not comfortable with, and the press is something that we like to do a lot. I
think we're pretty good at it and we do disrupt teams, so I thought that was a
good turning point for us.  
  
Q. Christyn, first off, how are you feeling after that big leap? And
second of all, can you just talk about how you came out of the game? You
really started the aggressiveness for the whole team.  
CHRISTYN WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'm okay, by the way. I was just going after the
ball. I'm perfectly fine. You know, Coach always is on me about being
aggressive from the jump, so that was my mindset going into the game is being
aggressive at all times, and I thought I executed well. So yeah, that was my
mindset.  
  
Q. Napheesa, you've gotten to a point where the 20/10s are just
automatic, and it seems like you decide early on to take control of these
games. I am wondering how much of that is directly coming from you and how
much of that is coming from just what defenses are allowing to happen.  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: I think it's a mixture of a lot of things. Obviously I try
to work as hard as I can to get position and get in a place where I can be
successful with the ball, but my team does a great job also of getting me the
ball, like I said, in the places that I want to be successful. I think just
being aggressive from the jump is what I've been trying to do a lot, and, like
I said, kind of just finding position early and sealing, I guess. I don't
know.  
  
Q. I'm curious when that changed for you, when you decided it was
important to be aggressive right away? At what point in your UConn career did
that happen?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: I mean, it kind of happened more so my sophomore year just
because my freshman year I was just a freshman floating around and didn't
really know what I was doing. My sophomore year I knew Kayla and I would have
a bigger role, so I knew I would have to be more aggressive. And I thought I
kind of got away from that last year, so I knew coming into this year that I
never wanted to do that again and I wanted to kind of change my mindset and
never, ever doubt myself or be timid or anything like that. So I kind of came
into this year knowing that I wanted to be more aggressive.  
  
Q. Crystal, you guys got down a little bit in that third quarter; how
important was it for you guys to stop that at five and then just kind of hang
back in until you went on that run in the fourth quarter?  
CRYSTAL DANGERFIELD: It was huge. You know, basketball is a game of runs. We
were going to have ours, they were going to have theirs, and I think it was a
matter of getting one stop. And once we did that, I think we got out in
transition a little, Lou got that big steal, we were hitting our shots, going
to the free-throw line and things of that nature, and I think that really
turned the game for us.  
  
It's not always going to go in your favor, but I think tonight we did what was
necessary, getting a big rebound like Phee said about Meg, she came in and did
her job tonight, and I think that was the game changer.  
  
Q. Crystal, coach was saying at this time of the year it's about making
big plays. Did you have a moment, you look up at the scoreboard, you guys are
down by one, you've got 10 minutes left, did you have a moment in yourself
where you thought, this is my time, I have to make big plays?  
CRYSTAL DANGERFIELD: Not necessarily that it's my time but it's just that a
play had to be made. He kind of said it after the game, we didn't know where
it was going to come from, but it was definitely going to happen. And that's
the kind of confidence that we've kind of grown to have in each other over the
course of this season.  
  
Again, it was just really taking what the defense was giving us, and that was
really where the run was coming from.  
  
Q. Napheesa, it just seemed in that fourth quarter you guys stayed so
poised, like Crystal just said, you kind of knew that was coming. Just the
composure that you guys had when UCLA was jacking up shots and everything. Can
you speak to that for a second?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Well, I think we've had a lot of practice, honestly, with it
this year. There's been a lot of games where we've been down at one point, at
some point in the game. And so as hard as it was obviously to lose those games
and to kind of have a different dynamic this year, having that experience is
what I think is going to help us down the road and helped us today because
we're not getting flustered in those situations. We know that we've been
there. We know that we have the fight to push back and to come back from
those, which is exactly what we did tonight. Like I said, as hard as it was to
go through it during the year grinding it out, I think it's definitely
something that's prepared us for this tournament.  
  
Q. Coach, last three years you've seen Crystal Dangerfield really
develop in front of your eyes, taking on bigger roles, dribble drive
penetration. Overall from freshman year to now, what do you see as her biggest
asset to now?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I mean, basketball always, as much as people want to say when
they talk about a dominant big man, basketball is dictated by the people that
have the ball in their hands the majority of the time. It's always been my
feeling that if you have really good guards on your team, then you have a
chance to have a really good team, provided you have some of the other pieces.  
  
But I think Crystal's biggest adjustment or biggest growth has come from
taking on more personal accountability, more responsibility. I think as you
grow in our program, you start to see that at some point it's going to be all
on you. Her freshman year and her sophomore year, she had a lot of people
around her that if she didn't play well or something didn't go right, they
could bail her out. And now she's in a situation where she looks around and
says, "It's all on me". And I think sometimes that forces you to hold yourself
more accountable, to understand, like today, if I don't make these plays, it's
not going to happen and we're going to lose, because I can't expect Christyn
to do it. And Lou isn't going to have the ball in her hands, I've got to get
her the ball. But in the meantime I've got to make sure we win this game.
That's part of growing up for sure.  
  
Q. Geno, you mentioned they were four and a half. Was it Lou's back was
the issue today? I assume that's the half you're referring to.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, we got some great mileage out of Liv. I thought Olivia
played really, really well in the minutes that she got. Yeah, I mean, Lou's
mobility is not the same as it was. I'm sure that her back is still an issue.
But it was made -- it was compounded by how long and how athletic they are and
how physical the game was. You would never know it, but it was kind of
physical. We didn't necessarily shoot a lot of free throws, but it was
physical. I don't know that Lou's mobility was where it needs to be, and she
really struggled. Really struggled.  
  
We went in at halftime, what, up 5? And Lou and Crystal didn't score. So we
kind of felt okay. I thought Lou would do something in the second half, you
know. I never thought that her big moment would be on a defensive play. That's
like the biggest shocker of the night. And a three-point play.  
  
Q. I'm just curious, seeing Cori and what she's built from the outside,
a couple years ago they played you relatively tough, but obviously it wasn't
at the same level, wasn't the same sort of challenge. It is in the Sweet 16
now. I'm wondering what that view is for you from the outside, but also what
it says about the state of women's basketball, that there are more Coris
building, there are more programs that can challenge and around that wasn't
necessarily a challenge in the past for bluebloods?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, well, generally speaking, two things have to happen to
try to even the playing field. The teams that are at the top have to come back
a little bit, and the teams that are trying to catch them have to come up a
little bit. Because for a bunch of years, the teams at the top, and I know
because we were one of them, we just kept getting better every year. So no
matter how hard other people worked, the gap was always the same and was
actually getting worse.  
  
Well, that started to change. The teams like UCLA with what Cori has done,
they've gotten progressively better over the years, and the cycle was going to
change. All those teams that used to dominate the top, they've kind of come
back to earth a little bit, so it's made them much more competitive game. More
people were in the mix, you know.  
  
We've been to, what, 11 straight Final Fours? That's probably not -- I mean,
not healthy for me, but it's probably something that should be impossible to
do in the real world of competitive sports. It should not be possible to go
that many years in a row. And it's going to get much, much more difficult each
and every year from here on in.  
  
And there's a lot of good young coaches out there. And at a place like UCLA,
you almost have to say to yourself, how could you not? UCLA, Oregon, Oregon
State, just those three out there. She's done a great job. She's done a great
job.  
  
Q. The question I'm pretty sure you've heard this many times as the
tournament started, you came in as a No. 2 seed, which was shocking to a lot
of people, and even though you're winning, you're not blowing teams out by 40
or 50 points. How much of an edge does that give you going forward, and how
much edge has it given you in this tournament?  
GENO AURIEMMA: That's a hard one to answer because a lot of times those
emotional things, that doesn't last a long time. When people talk about you
bring a ton of emotion to a game, at some point you're going to have to win
the game with how good you are, not how emotional you are. So there was a
point in today's game during one of the time-outs where we looked like we were
in trouble. The look on their face looked like they were in trouble because we
couldn't get anything to drop, we couldn't get a call. They started burying
threes. So it was like, well, what are we going to do, we can't guard them
inside if we have to go out. So we're going to have to give something up. And
it looked like we were like searching. But then all of a sudden, something
happened, and I think they remembered that we're UConn, and this is what we
do. And it doesn't always work, don't get me wrong. Sometimes it just doesn't
happen. But you know, there's just enough times with four, five minutes left
in the game. Our kids need to be reminded sometimes, we're still UConn, you
know. We're not going to die easily. It's not going to be that easy to get rid
of us.  
  
I think that does come from this little whatever you're carrying around with
you that no one has picked us to win it, I don't think. But I don't know that
that's going to help you win a game.  
  
Q. Olivia had a huge block in the beginning of the fourth quarter; what
did she mean to the shift in momentum obviously defensively for you guys?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, it changes what we look like, obviously, against their
size and their athletic ability. They're just bigger than us at every position
on the front line. So putting Liv in there changes what we look like. So we
look like -- I can never use the word "Olivia" and "imposing" in the same
sentence, but we look long, and it is kind of disruptive, and she's able to
just by her presence -- I think she was a big, big factor in tonight's game,
even without having to score a lot of points or do anything spectacular on the
stat sheet.  
  
Just having her out there I think was -- and she looked like she belonged out
there. Like her look on the bench was like, Yeah, I got this, Coach.  
  
Q. Did you remind them that you're still UConn and that you're not going
to die easily, like you said in that time-out? You said they needed to be
reminded or they figured it out themselves?  
GENO AURIEMMA: No, I didn't say anything. I think C.D. noticed that it didn't
come from me or any of the coaches. I think it took us getting down five to
really change how we were looking at the game. I think the whole time we were
winning, when we were up, it was like, yeah, okay, well, we'll figure out a
way to win it. But when we got down five, I think there was a sense of, uh-oh,
now we need to dig down deeper and we need to find something. And we did. We
did. It was -- I was probably more proud of them in that fourth quarter, this
particular group of players, than any time since they've been at Connecticut
because this one they really -- it was all on their shoulders and they had to
win it. Gabby is not going to bail you out with some superhuman plays. Kia is
not going to lock up their best player on the perimeter. They had to do it on
their own. I was really proud of them. They showed us a lot tonight.

### [Arica Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34761)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Walz, thank you for joining us. Congratulations. Welcome
to Albany.  
  
JEFF WALZ: I appreciate it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: As is customary, we'll ask that you please open with a
statement as far as your team, how you got here, and your expectations, and
then we'll open it up to members of the media to ask questions.  
  
JEFF WALZ: First off, I just want to start off by saying I'm the head coach at
the University of Louisville. I think Geno would be a wonderful candidate for
that position that is open. So before the questions start coming, I'm the head
coach at the University of Louisville. I've loved it, enjoy it, it's been
great. So now I'll start talking about our team so we can focus on that.  
  
It's been a great year for us. Really, really been impressed with how these
young women have figured out some new roles, have taken on new
responsibilities. I think with the graduation of Myisha Hines-Allen, I think a
lot of people were questioning how are we going to replace her? It's what I
said when Angel graduated, Shoni graduated. You're not going to replace them.
You've just got to find players that can do similar things, and that might
take four or five of them. That's what we've been able to do.  
  
I thought Bionca Dunham has had a great year for us. Kylee Shook has started
to come on very well. Sam Fuehring has been very consistent. And then you've
got players like Dana Evans, who's sixth man of the year for us, who had a
really good freshman year but has gotten better as the year has gone on. Arica
Carter, Jazmine Jones, you just go through -- everybody's just given us a
little bit more. So it's not that we replaced Myisha. We're just getting more
from everybody on the team, and that's what you have to do.  
  
We're really excited for the opportunity to still be playing. Only 16 teams
left practicing. It's not easy. It's difficult. And it's something that we're
really proud of. Oregon State, a great basketball team. I've got the utmost
respect for Scott. I've had the opportunity to be out at USA Basketball with
him, and I've watched him coach. He's just a great tactician. Really enjoy
watching his teams play, and I know tomorrow night it should be a great
basketball game.  
  
Q. Jeff, first part of the question is did Magic Johnson call you yet?  
JEFF WALZ: Not yet.  
  
Q. And the second part is we joke about it, but is it distracting?  
JEFF WALZ: No.  
  
Q. This time and all that stuff going on out there?  
JEFF WALZ: It happens every March. It's the same thing -- Samantha Williams
was just named the head coach at Eastern Kentucky, and I can't tell you how
excited I am for her. Our players are excited for her. And I'm getting e-mails
and text messages. Our fan base is fantastic. We have some very passionate
fans. They're like why are you doing this now? It's distracting the team.  
  
And I joke with our players all the time. I'm like, guys, you can solve this
if you just suck. If you don't win games, nobody will hire any of my
assistants, and you won't ever have to worry about my name coming up for
anything. If we're 3-21, I promise you this is not a discussion. So I tell
them, even when Cam Newbauer was here with us for one year in 2013, we make
that Final Four round and get to the championship, and Cam gets a job at
Belmont. The kids were sad. He was only with us for a year. As an assistant, I
wanted a chance to be a head coach one day. That's what I wanted to do, and
I've told everybody on my staff, if that's your goal, we're going to do
everything we can to get you that job.  
  
You know, Cam was one, I'll tell you, after a year, he's like, gosh, I just
don't feel like it's right. I'm like, Cam, if we can get you the job you want,
let's get it. With Eastern Kentucky, when that opportunity came up, Sam
Williams was like, okay, let's go after it. Why are they announcing it now?
Well, they had an opening, and Sam is the one they wanted. It's not a
distraction to our team. Our players were excited for her.  
  
And this comes up every March. Names are thrown out. Cori's name is in the
mix. Scott Rueck's name is in the mix. You might as well put Geno's name in
it, and have all four from this region. It's just what happens.  
  
So, no, our kids are fired up. They're excited to play. We know what's at
stake. We've been through this. We know everybody playing right now is really
good. You've got to give them your full attention, and you've got to be dialed
in, and I know these young women are.  
  
Q. When you watch video of Oregon State, what do you see from Mikayla
Pivec, and specifically, the intangibles?  
JEFF WALZ: She's really good. She plays so hard. She's one of those players
that, as you continue to watch on film, you know, her stats are good. But I
think it's everything that you don't see on the stat sheet is what she does.
She's diving on the floor after loose balls. She's getting her hand on a pass.
She's always in there mixing it up for a rebound. She comes up with big plays.
That's what really impresses me about her. We've talked about her as a staff
as well as everybody on that team. She is one for sure that really stands out
just because of the energy level that she plays with.  
  
Coaching the game, the Xs and Os part, everybody, I think, can do that with
players, but finding players that will just play hard and have a motor that
doesn't stop is what's really hard to find. And she is one of those. I've
really, really been impressed with her.  
  
Q. UConn's been the No. 1 seed for 12 years in the East. And here you
are, you're the No. 1 seed. Are you surprised that you're the No. 1 seed?  
JEFF WALZ: I mean, no. Should I be? We're 31 and whatever going into it. I
thought our kids have worked extremely hard, have played well. I'm not even
sure we were the fourth number 1. If you look at what everybody had done, I
thought we were right there. And at the same time, we got beat pretty handily
in the ACC Championship game. There's no question about it. When you're
without two starters, your starting point guard, we find out a half hour
before the game she's not going to play, and then Sam Fuehring plays for 12
minutes. I can promise you, when you're playing Notre Dame, you'd better be at
full strength. You aren't going to beat them with two or three starters out.
They score the basketball too well.  
  
And then after that game, I figured we'd be coming here to Albany as a 1 or a
2, and what's it really matter? It really has no bearing on anything. But I
did feel pretty confident, I think my staff can tell you, that we were coming
up here. Now you've just got to show up and play. It doesn't matter what seed
you are. When you get to this time of year, when you get to the Sweet 16 --
I've said it since my first year. When you get to the Sweet 16, anything can
happen. It's not the best team that's always going to win, it's the team that
plays the best that night. And then a few breaks here and there. Ball goes off
of your foot out of bounds, but they give the ball back to you. You know,
anything. It's what it comes down to.  
  
I go back to '13. If we played Baylor 100 times, that may have been the one
time we beat them. All you've got to do is beat somebody one night, one game.
So the 1 and 2 seed to me really doesn't matter, but, no, I was not surprised.
Michelle may have been, but I wasn't (laughter).  
  
Q. Oregon State's played a couple of the tournament games really close
down to the wire, a couple ones later in the season. What have you noticed
they've done to be able to kind of pull those out?  
JEFF WALZ: They scored more points. And it's one thing -- we talk about it as
a staff on film. It's one thing, they don't panic, they just continue to do
what they do. It's really impressive because they have had a few ball games,
and I think everybody was like, oh, look, they're about to get upset, and then
when the clock expires, they've won. I think they went on a 20-0 run against
Utah earlier this year to win the game. They just continue to do what they do.
Scott's done a remarkable job with them the past several years, and they
believe in what they're doing. That's what good teams do.  
  
He's just got a great group that believes in what they do as individuals and
as a team.  
  
Q. I do want to go on the record saying I think you guys would have
beaten Baylor more than once if you played them a hundred times in 2013. But
you beat them the time that counted, right?  
JEFF WALZ: That's right.  
  
Q. I don't think any of your teams were on the all-ACC Defensive Team,
and yet this is, I think, one of the better defensive teams you've had, and we
saw this in the first couple rounds. Do you think that's because you play such
good team defense that not one person stands out?  
JEFF WALZ: This is back-to-back years we've led the ACC in defense and points
allowed per game in either year. Neither have we had a player on the All-
Defensive Team. I think that's because we do play such good defense. There's
not one person that's leading the conference in steals.  
  
Now, Sam Fuehring, last year I was a little bit surprised. She might have led
the country in charges taken. I think she had 70-something throughout a
season. It's pretty remarkable. I think she had 8 in our first game when we
played at Ohio State. But, yeah, it's a group that takes pride in it. Like it
was really neat because we're sitting there playing in that second round game,
and our goal is to try to hold people under 50, and we gave up a 50 towards
the end, and the kids were like, oh, gosh. And I'm going, you know what, it's
pretty nice when you've got a group of players that, even though you're going
to win the game, you know you're up, they still are taking pride in trying to
get stops.  
  
Q. What's Carter's health status right now for you guys? And in your
beginning statement, you talked about everyone, I think, getting better. The
one name you didn't mention is Asia, and obviously she's very good.  
JEFF WALZ: She's been bad all year (laughter).  
  
Q. I figured as much. But what she's brought to you guys in the season
and her career so far?  
JEFF WALZ: Arica's a competitor. I don't even ask her half the time because I
know what the answer is I'm going to get -- I'm fine. I'm fine. She'll go
today. I asked her, hey, are you practicing today? She's like yeah. I said
okay. And then she'll play tomorrow. Is she 100 percent? I don't know if she's
at 100 percent, but she'll never tell me.  
  
The one thing that we have a good enough relationship is like, hey, you just
have to tell me if you can't go. I'm not going to put you out there if there's
any chance that you're going to get injured. So you've got to be up front and
honest with me on that. That's one -- she came to me in ACC finals, and she
was like, Coach, I can't do. And I knew that, okay, if she's telling me that,
she's really hurting. And then she could have played in the first round game,
but I thought, if we could afford to give her an extra day and a half rest, it
would only benefit her, and it did. She says she's ready to go for tomorrow
night.  
  
And then Asia, you know, it speaks for itself. She just -- she's fun to coach.
She's fun to work with. She's just a kid that gets in the gym and loves what
she does. There's a handful that you can truly say, hey, this is what they
want to do. Asia wants to be a professional basketball player. On top of that,
she was our ACC Scholar-Athlete of the Year. So not only does she want to be a
professional basketball player, but she's taking care of business in the
classroom as well. She's the last one out of the gym. She's in the gym before
practice. She just loves -- she loves the game.  
  
Q. Real quick, just wanted to ask you a little bit more about Asia. This
time of year, we've talked a lot this season about how much she helps her
teammates, but what does she do to help her teammates this year especially?  
JEFF WALZ: Well, I think you just go back to that second round matchup against
Michigan. She's got the first two assists in the game. She's really developed.
She's gotten better and better through her four years. And what I challenged
her with last year in the off-season was becoming that player that can read
when you're getting doubled or someone that's sending the blitz at you, being
able to get off the ball at the right time. And I thought that Michigan game
-- you know, she came off two ball screens, and they attacked her, and she
makes the right read. Now all of a sudden, it's two assists. As a coach, if
you're on the other side, it's like, God, what do I do now?  
  
So she's been doing a great job of getting her teammates involved. She knows
the pass to make. She knows where they're supposed to be. But then at the same
time, she understands when she's got to put the ball in the basket. She's got
to be aggressive for us tomorrow night. She was aggressive against Michigan.
That's what we're going to need in order for us to continue to have a chance
to win.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, first of all, welcome. Thank you for being here.  
  
Q. Asia, Coach said that it's not distracting to you guys when rumors
come out about coaches. Obviously, Sam got the new job at a school already. Is
he right? You guys see social media, I'm sure. Is it distracting when you see
your coach being listed as potential candidates for other coaches, and in the
past other coaches from Louisville getting offers from other colleges?  
ASIA DURR: He's right, yeah. That's not really a distraction for us. I don't
know why. People ask like why don't you let it bother you? I'm just like we
just don't. We're here to play ball. We're not really worried about what's on
Twitter, Snapchat, all that type of stuff. We're here to play ball.  
  
Q. For Asia and Sam, you guys played Oregon State last year, and I know
it was a tough first half. What were you able to do in that second half to
pull away from them. And do you expect a similar type of game in the first
half against them this year?  
ASIA DURR: It's going to be a dogfight. It sure will be. They're going to come
out on fire. They're going to come out with a bad taste in their mouth from
last year. So it's going to be a challenge for us. We're going to get their
best shot, so we have to be prepared for that and play our game as well.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: I think they're going to be fired up because of last year's
game, but, yeah, we're just going to attack them like we did last year. And to
add on to what Asia said, we had a fire start. We were all together with that,
and we're going to try that again and hopefully keep that throughout the
entire game.  
  
Q. This is for Sam and for Arica. Obviously, the ACC final was kind of
tough. Arica, you weren't able to play, and, Sam, you got hurt during that
game. Jeff said afterwards, we kind of just need to regroup a little, get
people healthy. Can you just talk about what those two weeks were like and how
well you were able to play in the first round and just getting that bouncing
back after that ACC final.  
SAM FUEHRING: I feel like those two weeks -- well, a week because I took a
week off. But I mean, the trainers and the staff, they were all hitting my
phone, all calling me. It was like treatment in the morning and like treatment
after practice and then treatment later that night. So it was like three times
a day type of treatment. There was times -- I mean, A.C. was in the training
room with me, and I was like, I have to do treatment again? It was just so
much. But I understand it now because of how fast I got back, so I'm
appreciative of that.  
  
ARICA CARTER: I think we just did a great job of focusing on making sure that
we were doing everything right to get healthy. I mean, me and Sam were sharing
a Game Ready at home to make sure we were continuing to ice our areas.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: And not to mention she stole the ice from my freezer to use it.  
  
ARICA CARTER: It's okay. We're a team. We did it together (laughter). We just
made -- our staff and our teammates were making sure we're okay and doing the
things we need to do to get back because, when we're a complete team, we're
hard to stop.  
  
Q. Sort of piggy-backing on Michelle's question, Arica, Coach said that
discussing whether you want to play or not, whether you're healthy or not, and
your answer is usually I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. But he said before the
ACC Tournament final game, you said, I can't go now. I can't. How do you feel
now, having a little time off, where you are physically for this weekend?  
ARICA CARTER: I'm excited. Like I said before, I've been doing everything with
treatment that I can do to make sure I'm ready for today. I'm not 100 percent,
but I'm going to find a way to go. My teammates are always there for me, and
my coaches know, if I can't go, then I really can't go. But I'm doing
treatment every day, like Sam said, three times a day. So I feel like I'm
going to be ready for the tournament.  
  
Q. Sam, I asked Jeff about this. I think he said you guys the last two
years haven't had an all-ACC defender or on the All-ACC Defensive Team, and
yet you've been the best defensive team. He credits that a lot to just the
team defense. Can you talk about that and also talk about your personal
fearlessness in terms of taking charges?  
SAM FUEHRING: I mean, I'm willing to give my body up for the team no matter
what. As for the defensive stuff, I don't really care about the awards. I
don't know if you guys do.  
  
ASIA DURR: No, not at all.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: We work together well as a defensive team, offensive too. But
like, say somebody gets beat, we're having their back, and we're going to help
them too. That's what makes us a great defensive team. They can't give a
single award to everybody on the team. So that's not going to happen. But I
think we're the best defensive team, so we don't need an award to show that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Asia, do you have anything to add on the team's defense?  
  
ASIA DURR: Sam hit that all. She hit the jackpot on that.  
  
SAM FUEHRING: Money, money.  
  
ASIA DURR: Y'all like that, huh?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Any questions for your teammates?  
  
ASIA DURR: I have a joke to tell. Mykasa, my teammate, told me to tell you.
What does a blanket falling say?  
  
Oh, sheet.  
  
THE MODERATOR: With that, we'll thank our student-athletes, thank them for
their time, and wish them good luck.

_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Good afternoon, everyone. We've been joined by Oregon State
coach, Scott Rueck. As a reminder, please raise your hand. We'll have the
microphones brought to you for questions.  
  
Prior to that, Coach, if you could please supply an opening statement with the
outlook on your team, how you got here, and forecast, if you will.  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Sure. I hear rain. I hear rain, which will just be similar to
what we left actually. It was beautiful right when we left. We had a little
rain this week. Feels like home, to be honest, the temperature and everything.  
  
Everything was smooth travel-wise. It's great to be in Albany. Appreciate
Siena and the MAAC for hosting. Everything has been real easy. Travel was as
easy as it could be to get here.  
  
We always talk about any place, any time. So it doesn't matter the time zone
or whatever, we're excited to compete.  
  
As far as our team goes, this has been an incredible group to coach. Just a
resilient, tough -- I don't know. Just another really special Oregon State
team full of high character individuals. We've had some adversity this year, a
little more than we ever had before. We had our first season-ending injury
this year in Kat Tudor to open up Pac-12 play opening night actually in the
first half. So when you lose a dynamic scorer like that, such a big part of
what we do, someone who brings a swagger and a confidence to the court, other
people have to really step up.  
  
That's what everybody who's watched us all year has seen, is the team just
continue to rise. Now, this week, for the first time, I can really say this
conference is the best one in the country. We've got five teams remaining out
of 16, and I don't think any of us are surprised by that. I'm not. And we're
all battle-tested. So what a pleasure to be a part of a conference that is
coached as well as it is and to compete every night with your back to the
wall, and that's what life in the Pac-12 has been.  
  
So I'm really happy for the other four schools to get to this point and
excited about all the challenges that we face.  
  
Q. Scott, it's usually said in March it's survive and advance, and you
guys live that, it seems. I mean, Boise State and then the Zags. What's it
been like for you as a Coach? Is it more fun in the games like that, or would
you rather have an easier road to get here?  
SCOTT RUECK: That's a great question because we're learning to love these
grind it out, crazy finishes that we've been part of. It's almost become a
habit, it seems like. I can tell you this coming off -- you were at the Pac-12
tournament. That didn't end the way we had hoped for us, of course. That was a
lot to overcome, and to live with those feelings for 15 days before we got to
play again, you know, where it's by far the worst loss of the season for us.
Everybody else we've lost to is still playing, by the way, this year.  
  
I thought it took us a while just to remember how to play. Then you're playing
a team as good as Boise State. And anybody who watched that game can see how
dangerous that team is, how gritty and tough and well-coached they are and how
skilled they are. So literally, to survive that game, to come from four down
with 17 seconds to go and find a way to win it in overtime speaks to the
things I said earlier. And that's just the toughness and resilience of this
group and their will to win with their backs to the wall and come through and
make plays.  
  
Then to turn around and face a Gonzaga team who beat Stanford this year,
another 28-4 team, only lost to two teams all season long, that expects to be
here, and is so well coached and good. So I thought those were just two great
wins. I thought they were signature performances for this team because that's
what we've been doing all year. I think it just reiterated who we are, to be
honest.  
  
So now we're ready for the next one. But I did think we played more like
ourselves against Gonzaga. There was an intensity on both ends of the floor,
and I liked seeing how many different people rose in that game. Maddie
Washington had one of her best games of the year, and that was something that
we couldn't have predicted necessarily before. We'd hoped but couldn't have
predicted. So it's a good sign going forward.  
  
Q. Scott, what do you think Louisville's strengths are? And do you guys
go into this game considering yourself the underdog?  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, I think they have a lot of strengths, actually. Everything
points to us being the underdog going into the game, so I'd have to say yes to
that.  
  
Asia's unreal. I've been watching her since she was in high school on the
circuit. We didn't recruit her, but we were in the same gyms watching. Just a
remarkable talent, remarkable competitor, does everything right. I mean, she's
what it is. She's what it's about, in my opinion. I love her game, always
have. So when you've got a player who has that level of ability, she makes
everybody else get better. And she gives so much confidence to that team --
well, everybody else is good too. So it's just a team that can play at
different tempos. It's a team that's very versatile. It's a team that can hurt
you inside and outside. So they are a 1 seed for a reason.  
  
They're very dangerous. They're outstanding in the open court, and yet they
execute well in the quarter court. When you take everything away and there's
three seconds on the shot clock, they can throw it to one of the best players
in the game, and it's really difficult to keep her from getting a good shot
off. So they're extremely dangerous in a lot of ways.  
  
So a great team and a great challenge.  
  
Q. Hey, Scott, last year you go into Knoxville, beat Tennessee. Then you
go home, then you go back across the country to Lexington, and you beat
Baylor. Can you kind of take us through that Louisville game, your thoughts
about what happened in that game.  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, it was a heck of a journey. This year it's kind of nice
that finals were a week earlier, in comparison, or as it relates to the NCAA
Tournament. So we didn't have finals this past week. We were on spring break.
So we were able to focus a little bit more.  
  
What that team accomplished in those two highly emotional games was
incredible. And then we go into Louisville, in Lexington, in front of 6,000,
7,000 people wearing red and going crazy. So it was a home environment for
them without a doubt. I thought they rode that emotion very well, and we could
not get settled. They did a really nice job on Marie in that game. They were
very physical with her, kept her off her spots, and that skewed us just enough
to put us on our heels.  
  
Louisville does a great job with pressure. They sense weakness, and any time
you demonstrate that, they came after us. They turned us over, got in the open
court. We were -- I actually felt good at halftime down eight in that game. I
didn't feel like we played great, but then they came out and had just an
incredible third quarter. I think they scored 28 points in the third quarter
just to separate, and that was the deciding factor. Marie fouled out for the
first time in her career on her last game. So it was just one of those days.  
  
Looking back at that film and even this week reflecting on it, I don't think I
did a very good job in putting us in position to be successful in that second
half, in particular, and it was just one of those games that got away from us.
But it's a grind from a 6 seed, I can tell you that, to get to that point with
all the travel and just how emotional and draining all those things were. But
they were a great team. That's the way that game went.  
  
Q. You mentioned the Pac-12. The Pac-12 has an 11-1 record. UCLA is
here. Can you talk about competing, not just for Oregon State, but on behalf
of the Pac-12 and the camaraderie maybe you have with Coach Close and some of
the other coaches in the Pac-12.  
SCOTT RUECK: It's a great group. That's something that's been fun to watch.
When I came in -- this is my ninth year at Oregon State. It was the Pac-10
when I first got there. We were known as Tara and the rest basically, so
Stanford and everybody else. And I think now this conference is obviously not
that. You've had a different champion the last five years. She had won it 14
straight until we won it in '13/'14 -- or '14/'15, I guess was our first.  
  
So to watch everybody elevate and everybody see themselves differently and
everybody see that it's possible, not necessarily to win the conference, but
to compete nationally. The Pac-12 network came in. Women's basketball, nearly
every game, is on TV. Everybody started paying attention to it. And if you
weren't really working, you quickly fell to the bottom, and there was a change
made.  
  
Now you look across the board, the conference has hired proven head coaches
with very few exceptions, and everyone's doing a fantastic job. We're
scheduling much better as a conference. We're recruiting much better. We're
able to keep West Coast players west. That was not happening a decade ago. And
now it doesn't always happen, of course. People have their preferences. But a
large majority are staying now because there's so many great options which has
just increased the talent level. So you've got a combination of great players
and great coaches. And then we beat each other up, like I mentioned a little
bit ago, over and over, and there's really nothing we haven't seen to this
point. We've seen great players. We've seen great schemes. And so now we're
all battle-tested going into the NCAA Tournament.  
  
So I mentioned it at the tournament actually, anybody who is able to get to
the postseason is going to be ready, and that's proven true.  
  
Q. Is a 9:30 start helpful to you? I mean, an earlier game would be all
right, but the fact is you're still in your natural West Coast working deal,
and it could be later if the game goes into overtime.  
SCOTT RUECK: 6:30? I'm teasing. It's 6:30 our time when we tip. I mentioned
before, I don't put much on those things. I think those become distractions if
you give it any kind of credence. So any time, any place. We have to play
11:00 a.m. games sometimes at home. We had to play 8:00 p.m. time. Sometimes
we play 8:00 p.m. on a Friday and a noon game on Sunday in the conference with
travel in between. So we don't pay much attention to those things.  
  
My goal is, I can tell you, to keep our team on West Coast time this weekend.  
  
Q. Scott, as somebody who's such a great defensive coach, can you
evaluate Louisville from that aspect for us? They led the ACC in defense the
last two years. A lot of people pay attention to Asia being a great offensive
player, but defensively they've been tough, and you can compare them from even
last year to this year.  
SCOTT RUECK: I think -- I mentioned the word versatile earlier, and I think
that's what makes their defense what it is. They can play different styles.
They'll give you different looks to keep you off balance. And so you just have
to play the game, and you have to be ready for anything. Nothing can throw you
off. Maybe they're going to trap you this time. Maybe they'll play position
next time. Maybe they'll go to their zone. Maybe they'll pick up in a zone
press. Maybe they'll man, full. Maybe they'll trap out of that.  
  
So I think they do a great job of adjusting on the fly, and their defense in
general, their mindset is zonish. But like I mentioned, if they sense
weakness, the pressure will come. So they have an identity that's defensive,
even though they're an outstanding offensive team as well, which is a sign of
a great team, my feeling. You've got to identify on both ends of the floor and
play multiple ways, and they do a great job of that.  
  
Q. Scott, I know you probably figure control what you can control and
not worry about things that are out of your control, but I'll ask this anyway.
The NCAA changed this rule a couple years ago that you couldn't have two teams
in the same conference play in the same region until a certain point. Texas A
&M and Baylor game in 2012, I think was the fourth time they met. With a
regional in Portland, would you have minded playing there, potentially seeing
Oregon again in the regional finals or semis versus traveling across the
country? I would think Portland is pretty close to you guys geographically
than flying cross-country.  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, we're the closest.  
  
I honestly felt that might happen. I thought we'd see Gonzaga in Corvallis if
we were able to host, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that at all. I
thought maybe we'd both be there. Whatever. It is what it is, and like you
said, I can't control it. So wherever we go, we play. So here we are, and so
Louisville is next. The next 40 minutes are all I care about.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get started with our student-athletes from Oregon State.
I'd like to introduce Katie McWilliams, Destiny Slocum, and Mikayla Pivec.  
  
Q. For all three of you, obviously, the Pac-12 Tournament did not go the
way you wanted. Coach said it took you a couple days -- or I think he said 15
days until you played again. How long did it take you guys to sort of get over
that and say, okay, you know what, we're still playing. We still have goals to
meet. How long did it take you to get over that loss to sort of refocus and
get ready for what you've done so far in this tournament?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: It was a disappointing Pac-12 Tournament for us, very short
stay. We tried to get over that as quickly as possible because our season
wasn't over. At that point, we knew we'd be playing in the NCAA Tournament. We
weren't sure if we'd be hosting or if we'd be traveling, but we knew we got to
play another game. We were excited about the opportunity.  
  
Obviously, we were, the first couple days after watching the other teams play
in the Pac-12 Tournament, disappointed about that, but it was time to refocus
on the next step. So we had a couple of days off to kind of refresh, give our
bodies a little bit of time off, and then we had a couple of practices
together as a team, just our players while our coaches were out recruiting.
And then we came in the next week and started full blown into our practices on
that Monday.  
  
So it was trying to forget about it as quickly as possible, but then learning
from those mistakes we made and getting ready for the next step.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Katie, how long did it take you to regroup?  
  
KATIE MCWILLIAMS: I mean, Mik said most of it, but I will say I thought the
Boise State game we were -- we started off well, and then I felt like there
was still kind of that rust there, like we weren't maybe the best team that we
could have been. And then I felt like we were back together again in that
Gonzaga game. We had a great overall game in terms of executing offensively
and defensively. I feel like we're that team back again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything to add, Destiny?  
  
DESTINY SLOCUM: Yeah, I just think that the Washington game was over after it
happened. There wasn't much we could do about it. There wasn't much we could
change. As a team, we talked after, just moving on, and that we had an
opportunity, and we still have an opportunity to do something uncommon and
continue in the NCAA Tournament, something that not a lot of teams get to do.
So I think right away we had to be on to the next. There's not an option, and
it's what's carried us through the last two games.  
  
Q. Katie, I'll ask you this. To lose Kat so early, right there at the
start of the Pac-12 season, you guys kind of had to just regroup emotionally.
Could you just go through how you guys dealt with it and then just what sort
of an inspiration she's been just being on the bench and helping you.  
KATIE MCWILLIAMS: You know, that's something you never want to happen to any
player, but we've all had to step up in our roles. And that's what Coach Scott
said right away, the next day after it happened, that just everyone's going to
have to rise for this team.  
  
Obviously, Kat was such a big part of our team. I mean, one of our top scorers
and lights out from the three-point line. So even though she's been hurt and
been going through that recovery process, she's been such an energy booster
off the bench. I mean, you can see her on the sidelines just going crazy after
we make shots. She's just very competitive. So she kind of brings her
competitive spirit into us.  
  
So just a great teammate and someone that -- I see her doing her recovery
routines, and I just know she's working really hard, and I just know she's
going to be back better than she was.  
  
Q. A question for Mik and Katie, and then a question for you, Destiny.
The question for you guys, what's it going to be like to have this rematch
with Louisville? And for you, Destiny, what's it going to be like to play in
your first Sweet 16 with Oregon State?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: We're excited about this opportunity against Louisville that
we'll be playing tomorrow. They ended our season last year, ended Marie
Gulich's career. They're a very talented team, we know that, and we'll be
excited for the opportunity tomorrow.  
  
KATIE MCWILLIAMS: I just know I'm happy to still be playing. Just to be here
at the Sweet 16 and to get another try against Louisville is just an exciting
opportunity for us.  
  
DESTINY SLOCUM: I'm excited to be a part of the journey this time. Last time I
was watching from home. Everything that they were doing was awesome. I'm happy
that I can be here with them and continue the journey.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Mik, your coach talked about the competitiveness of the Pac-12.
Could you speak to that and how it's prepared you for this tournament?  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Shout out to the Pac-12, five teams in the Sweet 16. It's
awesome. We're always rooting for the Pac-12 teams when we're not playing them
ourselves. Pac-12 play has really prepared us well for this tournament, seeing
a whole bunch of different styles of play, seeing teams that are super
athletic and disciplined, teams that can really shoot it, teams that are super
athletic. So it's prepared us pretty much for any team we'll see in this
tournament, and we're excited for the next step.  
  
Q. Along those lines, do you guys text other players like on the other
Pac-12 teams and say, hey, great job. Congrats on advancing and still playing.
I'm sure you have friends on other teams. Is that something that goes along
with it? The coaches have all been saying, it's great. We all tell each other
we support each other in that way. I see you support the other schools. Is it
just rah rah, or do you have friends and you say great job. Maybe we'll see
you guys in the Final Four?  
KATIE MCWILLIAMS: I don't really necessarily talk to anybody specifically on a
personal level in the Pac-12. But I know that on Twitter we've just been
congratulating them as a whole, just as a Pac-12, as the conference as being
so tough and for all those teams making it this far.  
  
DESTINY SLOCUM: Yeah, same.  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: I don't personally text other people on other teams. I know
when I watching their game, I'm rooting for them. We played a game at Gill
Coliseum and they were showing the highlights on the board of updates of the
scores, and UCLA beat Maryland, and all of the Gill fans started clapping and
cheering for each other.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. Good luck to you tomorrow.  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Thank you. Go Beavs!

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
ALBANY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+ALBANY)

  

## March 28, 2019

  

### [Napheesa Collier](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33298)

### [Katie Lou Samuelson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30887)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Once again, good morning. We're joined by Connecticut senior
student-athletes, Katie Lou Samuelson and Napheesa Collier.  
  
Q. I guess for both of you, what have you seen from UCLA so far on film
that's impressed you about them this season?  
THE MODERATOR: Katie Lou?  
  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: I think they're just super aggressive and one of the best
rebounding teams in the country. For us, that's something we've struggled
with, and so that's something we've really got to focus and be ready for.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Yeah, they're really aggressive. They're really athletic.
Someone had asked if you think it's going to be harder or not because of their
size, and I thought that's something that we looked at too. They're all kind
of the same size, so it's something that we're going to have to be really
conscious of. Like we said, boxing out and making sure that they're not
getting the things that they normally do.  
  
Q. Katie Lou, last year you missed the UCLA game because you were home
with an ankle injury or foot or whatever it was then. Did you look at this,
when you got the chance to play UCLA, irony, coincidence? How close are you to
any number of players? I know there's one high school teammate, but any number
of those players growing up.  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: I think now, being a senior, there's definitely less
players overall on the team that I played against growing up. But just getting
the chance to play a team that's so close to home, it's going to be a lot of
fun. I'm excited to kind of get that chance. I didn't get it last year. So
should be fun.  
  
Q. Katie Lou, were you surprised that you guys didn't get the No. 1
seed, and does it matter?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Oh, I think definitely it was a little bit surprising to
see that, but we can't control anything that people decide. That's out of our
control. For us, it hasn't necessarily changed anything that we've done as we
approach these games. It might have given us a little fuel or added some fire
there, but there's plenty of teams that are deserving of what they get. And
like I said, we have no control over what the committee decided, so we're just
going and taking care of what we can control.  
  
Q. Napheesa, can you address that as well? Were you surprised you were a
No. 2 versus a No. 1 seed?  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Yeah, I think almost everyone was surprised. We were
surprised. But as Katie Lou said, it's not something we can control, so
there's no point in dwelling on it or getting angry about it. We're just going
to do what we have to do and prepare the way that we need to in order to
continue on in the tournament.  
  
Q. For each of you, I know you guys are used to playing in front of huge
crowds, and you've played here specifically, but to be less than three hours
away from Connecticut and to play in front of 10,000 people on a stage like
this, how cool is that for you guys to be able to play? Obviously, I'm sure, a
lot of family and friends come too.  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: It's really cool, especially, like you said, being so close
to Connecticut. Our fans are amazing, and I have no doubt that they'll
probably make the trip up here. So just being here again, especially it being
our last time, it is really special. We're just so grateful to have this
opportunity, and we're really excited for the game.  
  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: Yeah, like she said, we got the chance to play here last
year, and it was a great turnout. We're hoping that we get the same kind of
support from our fan base.  
  
Q. Again, for both of you, you have some younger teammates that have not
been to the Sweet 16 before, whereas you guys have obviously been here a fair
amount. Have you said anything about the bigger stage? Obviously, you play on
a big stage to begin with, but any advice you've given them about this round
and potentially the next round?  
KATIE LOU SAMUELSON: I think the biggest thing is just not putting too much on
them and not giving them too many things to worry about. Just breaking it
down, doing what they know they can do every day in practice. As soon as they
know that, Phee and I tell them we've got their backs for anything that
happens during the game. We can control that. So as long as they're putting
forward their best effort and what they're great at, we'll be okay.  
  
NAPHEESA COLLIER: Yeah, it's kind of hard to tell them what it's going to be
like because you don't really know unless you're in that situation. Like we
said, we just told them you focus on what you have to do, what you're really
good at, and like she said, we have you back. We'll handle the rest. Just do
what you need to do, what you've done every day, and you guys will be fine.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Seeing none, we thank you for being here. Wish you well in this
tournament.

## March 28, 2019

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Kennedy Burke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35194)

### [Michaela Onyenwere](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37106)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
THE MODERATOR: As you can see, we've been joined by Coach Close. Thank you
very much for being here.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Thank you for having me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: As is customary, we'd ask you to begin with an opening
statement, and we'll have the media ask questions following.  
  
CORI CLOSE: You bet. Thank you so much for having us and thank you for
covering our great game. I was just walking over here and thinking about what
great coverage this is already getting. Just really excited for all the young
women from the four teams that are going to get to have their stories told.
Appreciate you all.  
  
We're excited for the opportunity to play in such a great field. It's a great
challenge for us, and really proud of our team's growth and what has had to
happen for them to put themselves in this position. We're just excited to be
here.  
  
Q. Coach, you were 9-9 at one point after a loss to USC. Then it was a
trip to Arizona-Arizona State. Was there something in between there or winning
those games, or what basically happened that's led to this surge?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, if I was smarter, I would have figured it out sooner so we
could have turned the tide. I think it was a culmination of a lot of small
choices that eventually hit a tipping point when we went to Arizona for that
swing, to play Arizona State and Arizona. But I really think it was the
commitment to the journey.  
  
You know, coaches talk like that all the time, and sometimes old ladies like
me need to be reminded from a team like this. Because really that's what we
had to have, when it was really uncomfortable, when we weren't being rewarded,
to stay committed to growing and giving every day. That's what I ask of them
every single day when we start practice is: Do you have a plan to grow, and do
you have a plan to give?  
  
I think our chemistry really kept us in the mix that way to get us to that
tipping point because they really enjoy each other, and I think the times in
between practice and games, where they got to enjoy each other's company and
experience what we call remember whens in our program, I think that really
kept them going while they were giving and growing to get to the point where
we were actually good because we weren't good for a long time.  
  
I do think that weekend at Arizona and Arizona State was the tipping point
where we earned a lot of confidence, but I don't think it was one thing. I
think it was a series of really hard choices over a long period of time.  
  
Q. Can you tell us a little bit about your travel from -- I assume you
came from College Park to here.  
CORI CLOSE: Correct.  
  
Q. Is it a good or bad thing that you're basically a week and a half
away from home?  
CORI CLOSE: I think, given the alternative to go all the way back to L.A. and
then come all the way back here, I think it's the right choice to come
straight here. We're on spring break, so we don't have any classes, so we're
not missing extensive class time by staying on the East Coast. I think it
would have definitely been a detriment to our ability to be competing at the
highest levels to have had to go cross-country again before we came up here.  
  
But, yes, the next day after we won in College Park, we flew up here to
Albany, and we have been enjoying your great city ever since.  
  
Q. Hey, Cori, I was just wondering, even like at the Oregon-Oregon State
home series, you had said at the kind of post-game presser that your team had
the potential to make a deep run in the tournament. I was wondering if you had
always kind of felt that your team would be able to end up here. And if so,
what kind of inspired that faith early on even before you were sort of seeing
the success that you've seen now?  
CORI CLOSE: I think two things. I really am a strong believer that culture
wins and that relationships are everything. I think I really have confidence
in the relationships we've built with each individual player, and I knew what
they brought not only from a skill potential standpoint, but from a heart
level standpoint. And I also really believe in the culture that we've built
and what we stand for.  
  
Our word for the year back in August, our word for the year that we picked as
a team was expectant. And I shared stories of teams in the past that lost a
lot of fire power, that the next year with great determination and teamwork
ended up being good or better, and people maybe didn't expect it.  
  
So I think that, yes, I did have faith in this team. Now, I'm not going to
lie. They were doubting moments in the midst when you start 3-5. It was not
easy. It was not an easy journey. And I really give credit to our assistant
coaches and support staff because there were many days when they kept me
going, and they were relentless believers in our mission. And I think over
time that was really instrumental.  
  
But to answer your question, I did believe in this team. I thought we could be
a more balanced team over the long haul. We spent a lot of time watching
Jordin Canada and Monique Billings last year, and I think maybe we didn't
experience as efficient teamwork as we could have. And I think we were forced
to have that this year, and I think it's paid dividends in the NCAA Tournament
because I think we are really harder to match up with.  
  
Q. Two questions, Cori. One, what is your relationship with Geno and why
the exchange of wine and stuff like that? And secondly, what makes you guys
such a good offensive rebounding team? You're not overly big. You have good
size, but why are you so good offensively rebounding?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, first of all, I wouldn't say that Geno's my buddy or
anything. I really -- I have a really big respect for who he is, and I have
really sought, not just Geno, but his staff out. Last year I called Kris Daly
in the spring and asked her to give me a brutally hard scouting report on my
team. And just through the years -- they are at the pinnacle, right? And they
have set the standard. And I really desire our program to grow to that level.
So I would be foolish to not seek out their advice. And just have built a
relationship way through the years when Jamelle Elliott was on the staff. A
long time ago I had a friendship, still have a friendship with her.  
  
But their entire staff has been wonderful through the years. So I just have
really appreciated the way they have opened up their doors and I'm allowed --
our staff has flown back there to watch practice. I've gone back there two
different times in addition to that. And you know, I do appreciate that he
appreciates good wine as well, and it's been a fun exchange.  
  
I wouldn't say we hang out, but I think I just have really appreciated that
he's allowed me to learn and he's been willing to invest in me as a growing
coach.  
  
Oh, I'm sorry, rebounding. Oh, yeah, that. Rebounding, I think I have kids who
understand who we are. We aren't the best shooting team in the country. We
have to have each other's back, and at the same time, I don't want kids
thinking about their shot. I want them to step up confidently. If it's a shot
they practiced that they know they can make for our team, I want them to shoot
with confidence, and one of the reasons that they can do that is they know
they have the people behind them that if, by chance, they were to miss,
they're going to pursue the rebound with everything they have and get us extra
possessions.  
  
And also your shooting percentage goes up tremendously on an offensive
rebound, about 70 percent actually. Sometimes our best offense has been
getting a decent first shot that's a predictable shot that we can go get a
second opportunity, because that shooting percentage is pretty darn good.  
  
Q. Coach, you talk about rebound, and you talk about shooting as well.
What do you think your team has that can take down a team like UConn?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think rebounding is a really big thing. If we get the same
amount of possessions that UConn does, we'll lose. I think that the reality is
they are so fluid, and they take really high percentage shots. They know each
other really well. That's one of the things I admire most about their program
over the years is just the fluidity of their offense. They don't run plays.
They have playmakers out of a fluid system, and he's taught them to be -- to
read and react so well, which I really admire. I don't want to have a program
where we're like robots running from place to place.  
  
It's not up to me to create, make every perfect call from the bench. I want to
build players that have the confidence to have that moment, and I think
they're a little bit -- a few steps ahead of us in their confidence that way,
so we have to do it a different way. I think we've got to control. We have to
make sure we value the basketball and take care of the basketball. Because
they're very aggressive at certain points in the game to try to create
turnovers, and that gives them run-outs on the other end, and it's an empty
possession where we don't have a chance to get an offensive rebound, right?  
  
And obviously, on the rebounding end, we have to control them to only get --
they've got some pretty good rebounders on their team too. And we've got to
make sure we do a good job of controlling the defensive boards, and we're
going to have to fight like crazy for extra possessions on the offensive glass
as well. That's where I think the battle will be won, either team. Both teams
will say that's a pivotal point, and which team can have the conquering
mentality of that will probably come out on top.  
  
Q. We talked about in Maryland you've drawn a lot of Connecticut teams
over the years. What makes this team a little bit different than maybe some of
those teams you've seen in the past? And the second thing is just Oregon State
is here. A lot of Pac-12 teams doing well. Can you talk about the camaraderie
maybe you have amongst those coaches? You've been very vocal on Twitter
supporting Pac-12 schools.  
CORI CLOSE: Absolutely. I don't know -- Connecticut has only lost two games
all year. Let's be realistic. I just got done saying that culture wins a lot
of the time for my team and my program, and their culture is extremely strong,
and their identity is extremely strong. We will have to play our best
basketball of the year to have a chance to win this game, but isn't that what
you want, right? You want to be in situations and competitive environments
that demand your best. And you work all year to put yourself in a position to
grow into -- in our case, to really grow into a position that we can be in the
range where our best effort gives us a chance to move on. And that's really
what you want.  
  
So I don't know if they're -- they're really good. You know, I'm just not
going to say they have chinks in their armor or anything like that. I'm not
buying that. They're a really good basketball team, and they're an excellent
basketball program, and I think both are significant pieces. So it's going to
be a great match-up for us. I do think it is good for us mentally that we're
familiar. Every single one of our players on our team has had a match-up with
them through the years.  
  
So I think the mentality and confidence that we're not playing this fictitious
TV UConn, like we have been in the trenches, and we know what the mistakes
have been and we know what the victories have been in terms of the little
moments. So I think that does help us, having that past experience, but it's
going to demand our best.  
  
In terms of the Pac-12, I just think being a part of the Pac-12 has made me a
better coach. I think Oregon State has led -- what Scott Rueck has done is
simply amazing. If you trace the history of that program, what he started
with, how he built it, it's incredible. I have so much respect for Scott --
obviously, he's in this region -- but for all of the Pac-12 coaches. And I do
think one of the things that's been really special about being a part of the
Pac-12 conference is we truly do celebrate each other. It's not just a PR
thing. It's like how can we help raise the whole level of the conference? What
commitments do we need to make from a scheduling perspective? How do we need
to commit to in recruiting wars that we're never going to put each other down?
All these little things. And we have been committed to building the Pac-12 and
not just building our own individual programs. I think that's what's playing
out.  
  
Q. Hi, Cori. I just was wondering what have you seen from Japreece Dean
this season in terms of her growth and her leadership?  
CORI CLOSE: She's been a scoring point guard in a point guard-sized body in
the past. This year I've seen her grow into a leader and someone who thinks
globally about the team and an influencer. That is really rewarding. She would
like to play professionally and wants to learn to lead a team. She would go
last summer and watch most of the NBA guys work out on UCLA's campus, and she
would go and just study different workouts and was jumping in with them. They
were really kind to her, worked out with different players. I won't go into
names because I'll get myself in trouble there. But she really did the work,
and she studied.  
  
She'd come in and say, hey, coach, what do I need to do? Each week we'd have a
leadership challenge behind the scenes, and most of her teammates didn't even
know that was happening. And she was talking about learning the game mentally
and building her IQ and learning how to facilitate. And I also give her
credit, Shannon Perry runs a program called LIT, leaders in training in that
program, and she's a part of that group. It's voluntary. You commit to it. But
I really do think over time it's transpired into her being a great leader of
our team. She's growing by leaps and bounds. She's growing in that.  
  
It's really fun to coach someone with that much passion for the game. She'll
say basketball is my life. I love it! I was a point guard back in the day when
dinosaurs were still around, and it's so fun for me to see her passion even
exceed mine. It's fun to watch her on the court to grow, and she's obviously
an explosive playmaker for us. But I think I've seen her leadership grow and
her defense grow most of all.  
  
Thank you all for your time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: I want to say welcome to our student-athletes, Kennedy Burke as
well as Michaela Onyenwere. Again, as a reminder for folks in the media please
speak into the microphone.  
  
Q. I'll address this to Kennedy, but both of you can answer it. When you
left L.A. last week, were you told to pack for a week and a half, and did you
really believe you would still be here at this point?  
KENNEDY BURKE: Yes, Pam Walker told us to pack for a long trip, and that's
what we did. So far, we have been enjoying the trip that -- we came from
Maryland and now we're in Albany, and we're both really excited.  
  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: Yeah, Coach Cori told us to pack for 10 days. I think she
believed in us that we'd be here. Having coaches that believe in you really,
really helps everything when it comes down to these games.  
  
Q. Quick followup. What are you guys doing besides practice since you've
come to Albany?  
KENNEDY BURKE: We've been resting our bodies but also enjoying just the fun
times together, like going to the movies or going to the mall and hanging out
and stuff.  
  
Q. Just wondering, for either of you, Coach Auriemma had said that he
feels like their team may have gotten the toughest draw with you guys in the
Sweet 16 because you're one of the hotter teams in the country. Do you feel
like you are one of the hotter teams in the country, and why do you feel like
you're playing your best basketball now?  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: I think that's such a compliment. I think that Geno is
such a legendary coach. What he's done at UConn is just unmatched, and it's
really, really great to hear that from such a great guy.  
  
I think that, yeah, we've been working really hard, and we've been competing
together for a really long time. We didn't start off the best, and I know it's
super hard to go through that with a young and new team. We've come a long
way. I'm just proud of our team and our growth, and I think that kind of is a
testament to how hard we've worked over the course of this season.  
  
KENNEDY BURKE: Just to piggy-back off of that, we didn't really start as we
wanted to, and throughout our journey, it just showed that we could compete
with any team in the country.  
  
Q. Just to piggy-back off that for both of you, the start probably
wasn't what you expected or hoped. Was there a moment you can remember, wow,
things changed, a practice, a meeting, or something that got you guys going
with the run you've been on for the last two months or so?  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: I think that the coaches never -- their faith in us never
wavered, and I think that's something that's really important for a team who's
really, really new and really just kind of finding their identity. But I think
I would say probably when we -- the Arizona trip when we won at both, I think
both those wins were very staple wins, and I think that instilled confidence
in us, okay, we can really do this. Those are great programs, and one of them
is actually here -- or in the Sweet 16. So it just kind of shows how much
we've grown from that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Kennedy, anything to add?  
  
KENNEDY BURKE: I forgot what I was going to say, but I think with every game
that went by, we've gotten like one percent better each game. Coach mentions
that a lot that every day we get one percent better, and it showed.  
  
Q. Kennedy, can you talk about just the senior urgency that we're seeing
from you. I mean, the Tennessee game, you really just took over at the end of
that game and made two really spectacular defensive plays. Can you talk about
how that feeling has been in being a leader for this team this season.  
KENNEDY BURKE: Coach talked about how that, if I'm not really doing as well on
the offensive end, that I should just contribute more to the defensive end. My
goal for this team is to be a lock-up defender, and I feel like I've done
that. I think my teammates have given me the confidence to be that for them.  
  
Q. Michaela, can you talk about the difficulty of facing Napheesa
Collier and Katie Lou Samuelson, among a lot of good UConn players, obviously,
and maybe what challenges the team will have in terms of offensive
rebounding.  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: Napheesa and Katie are great players. We've watched a lot
of film on them, not specifically them, just the whole team. They're great
players. It's going to be a little harder to score on them because they are
bigger than me, but I think I've found ways to score over people who are
bigger than me because I am undersized.  
  
As far as the challenges, they're just a high-tempo, high-scoring team, and I
think that's something we're going to have to focus on within the next 24
hours is just how to contain everybody because they are scoring at all
different type of ways.  
  
And to add on to that, I would just say, if we just continue with our
offensive rebounding being a strength, that will get us a long way, especially
like with the game coming up tomorrow.  
  
Q. K.B., I remember talking to you last year before the UConn game, and
you mentioned how the previous year before that, so your sophomore year, you
were kind of sick going into that game and last year not really having the
best performance offensively. Can you talk about kind of redemption this year
and if that's on your mind, and just facing them for the third time in your
career.  
KENNEDY BURKE: I don't know if it's redemption, but I just feel like I just
want to be the best version of myself for my team and just leaving it out on
the floor for them because I'm not really sure if it's going to be our last
game. So just being there for my teammates and just doing the best that I can
will help.  
  
Q. Is this a game -- when you can face a team like UConn in the Sweet
16, I've got to imagine it doesn't take much to get up for. Is this a game you
guys get excited for as opposed to kind of being intimidated?  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: I don't know. No, I think that I feel the same for every
single game. I think that we come out here, and we try to compete and we do
our best to win. I think the coaches have prepared us very, very well for this
game as they do any other game. I think that is just another game. It's a lot
at stake. We want to go to the Elite 8, and I think that's what our goal is.
It's like any other game. We have to compete. We have to work hard, and we
have to play together.  
  
KENNEDY BURKE: I think it's just mostly excitement for us. This is a once-in-
a-lifetime thing. So we're just really excited.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
ALBANY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+ALBANY)

  

## March 28, 2019

  

### [Geno Auriemma](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14072)

  
_Albany, New York_  
  
GENO AURIEMMA: Just want to let everybody know that I'm still the coach at
UConn, and I intend to be the coach at UConn next year in case anybody had any
questions about that.  
  
Getting to the NCAA Tournament and winning two games and then getting to a
Regional, it's never an easy task, and it seems like it's getting harder each
and every year, as evidenced by the way Buffalo played, and you watch some of
the other games that took place around the country. So for us to be here again
is a great accomplishment for our team and doesn't get any easier from here on
in.  
  
We may have gotten the worst draw of any team in the country getting UCLA
right about now, as well as they're playing, and all the great things they've
been able to do. It's not the same team I saw in St. Thomas earlier this year.
Cori's done a phenomenal job with this group. So we've got our hands full
tomorrow night.  
  
Q. Geno, you've played UCLA the last couple years, but obviously there's
no Jordin Canada and no Monique Billings this year. How are they the same and
how are they different, and how about their younger players who have stepped
up to get them here?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I think that's the big difference, that their young players
have gotten progressively better each and every game this year. When you watch
them on film now, they don't seem to have missed a beat. You talk about not
having their two seniors from last year -- I don't know. When I watch them
play, their point guard right now looks a lot like Jordin Canada. And I watch
their big guys, and they look a lot like Monique Billings. In some ways, they
may even pose more of a problem.  
  
Yeah, they lost two great seniors, but you would never know it watching them
play on film. I'm just really impressed by what they do. I just can't believe
it's the same team that I saw in St. Thomas.  
  
Q. Two-part question. I'm guessing, based on your opening statement,
you're not upset you're the only coach in this bracket that didn't get the
Tennessee potential nod in the papers down there. And secondly, UConn is part
of the AAC deal now for ESPN+, potentially losing games on SNY, and you've
been a huge proponent of SNY helping out UConn basketball. What's your
thoughts on the new deal for the AAC and how it affects you guys?  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I mean, I don't have all the details of it, obviously. I
know that it's probably a great deal for the league as a whole, and I'm sure
that was the intent to get a great deal for the entire league. I think any
deal that keeps us off of the kind of television we've come to understand and
our fans have come to appreciate, specifically SNY, anything that keeps us
from being able to do that for our fans is not such a great deal for UConn.
Hopefully, they can work something out.  
  
We have a great relationship with SNY. They've done a great job for us,
probably a better job than anybody in the country does for their teams. So I'm
hopeful that something can be worked out that allows us to continue that
relationship.  
  
Q. Coach Cori Close always mentions that you guys exchange bottles of
wine. Can you talk about your relationship with her and how you guys met and
your relationship thus far.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Yeah, it goes back a ways. When Cori was at Florida State, we
played them a bunch of times. And she brought her staff up to Connecticut for
three or four days a few years back when she was just starting at UCLA. So I
had a chance to get to know her and her staff. She has a lot of energy. I like
the way she handles herself and UCLA. UCLA was great a long time ago, and then
they were really good a long time ago, and then they were really bad for a
long time.  
  
Ever since Cori's got there, they recruited great. They've accomplished an
awful lot on the court, and they seem to be in this position a lot lately.
She's one of the bright young coaches that's taken a big job, you know, going
from an assistant to taking the UCLA job. That's a big job. A lot of young
coaches that have done that kind of a move have not been successful, but she
has. So I'm happy for her. I'm proud of her.  
  
Q. Geno, a lot of people have written because you guys got the 2 seed,
that you're playing with a chip on your shoulder. Do you feel like that, or do
you feel like you're playing with a chip on your shoulder?  
GENO AURIEMMA: I don't even know what that means today. I know what it used to
mean. Kids would get pissed. That's what it meant when they said they had a
chip on their shoulder. They were pissed. They felt disrespected. And when
they felt like that, you actually saw the results on the court. I remember
some of my players telling me that, after we lost in St. Louis in 2001, from
the day we got home from that trip until we won the National Championship in
San Antonio the following year, not one day went by that those kids didn't
think about that, and it showed up in practices every day and the way we
played every day.  
  
Today the chip on the kids' shoulders lasts until the next text. So we've got
a chip on our shoulder, the chip in their phone. That other stuff, it doesn't
exist anymore. How are you going to have a chip on your shoulder when your
best friends are all the kids you play against? You've got everybody on speed
dial because you played against these kids growing up. I liked it better when
everybody hated each other. All the hate's gone. It's no fun.  
  
Q. So forgive me, speaking of hate, but Doug alluded to this earlier.
Obviously, a pretty big seismic shift in Knoxville yesterday with Holly
leaving. I just wonder if you could sort of share your thoughts. I know
they're an adversary, but the position she was in was difficult. And then what
does it mean for Tennessee to be sort of entering this new world with a new
leader? And you guys are going to be playing them next season.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, I think if you look at -- if you look at any great
program -- I don't care whether it's high school or college, pros. If you look
at any great program that had kind of an iconic leader, you know, and that
leader kind of defined the program, and then all of a sudden you're trying to
replace that and you're replacing it with someone who's been part of that
staff for the longest time, that's already not an easy transition because the
specter of the former coach -- you know, Pat left a big shadow.  
  
So it wasn't easy from day one to do that job. And then, you know, you add the
pressures of what's expected at a place like Tennessee and the fact that
everybody else has gotten better and it's much more difficult to recruit the
same players that were being recruited back then, and you add it all up, and
it's not easy. I don't care if you look at the Montreal Canadiens or go all
the way back then, or the New York Yankees for the longest time. Anybody that
takes those jobs, it's not easy, especially for a young, first-time head
coach. It's not easy. So Holly was in a very difficult position from the
minute she took the job.  
  
Given the landscape that we're working in now as older coaches -- you know,
she's a young head coach, but she's been around the game a long time, like I
have. These are not easy times for coaches who hold on to -- want to hold on
to some things that we think are very, very valuable. It's not easy. It's not
the job that it used to be. Actually, it's not the profession it used to be.
It used to be a way of life, a profession, and now it's just a job. And like
any job, there's some pitfalls to that, obviously.  
  
I feel terrible for her. Every school is entitled to have their own coach,
obviously, and Tennessee is entitled to have whoever they want as their coach.
I don't know the details of all that, but I just -- any time a coach is in
that situation, I feel it because we're all part of the same community. Holly
will land on her feet for sure.  
  
Q. Geno, Michelle asked basically what I was going to ask, but just to
follow up a little bit, how about whoever the coach is moving forward down in
Knoxville, kind of the mix of recapturing what they've accomplished over
history and the different -- the opportunity, and what it might mean if the
next coach is able to push Tennessee back to the elite status that they once
knew.  
GENO AURIEMMA: Well, it won't take long. Again, getting the right coach is
always a huge, huge key, and getting someone who knows how to coach, someone
who's been in some pressure situations before. So I think if they make the
right decision and the right person gets in that job, it won't take long for
them to be back where they were. I don't think that's going to be very
difficult at all.  
  
But their fan base is a lot like ours. They're impatient. They want everything
right now. There's not going to be a lot of patience for whoever the next
person is, so they're going to have to be great right away.  
  
But when you have the tradition that they have and you have the fan base that
they have and the resources that are available to them, I don't think it's
going to take very long at all. I mean, I think we have a two-year contract
with them. I think we play them twice. I think depending on who the coach is,
we may play them ten more times, or we may not play them at all. I'm anxious
to see who the coach is because it may only be two years, maybe one. I may try
to get out of it next year.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
CHICAGO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+CHICAGO)

  

## April 1, 2019

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Dijonai Carrington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35195)

### [Alanna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32740)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Notre Dame - 84, Stanford - 68  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: They made some tough shots, and I think they'll be a great
representative from this bracket at the Final Four.  
  
I thought our young players really stepped up to the challenge, and our --
kind of our leaders with Alanna and DiJonai and Kiana really had -- made some
outstanding plays for us to even be ahead at halftime and compete.  
  
But I'm really proud of our team. I just want to just congratulate Alanna. She
had a great career at Stanford, and we'll really miss her next year. But I
think that with the returners, we can build on a great season and this,
playing in this Elite 8.  
  
Q. Could you talk first about the start? You guys sort of really had
them. And then secondly, you got your three-point game going that you didn't
have the other night.  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: I'd just say we came out, we had a great game plan, and we
executed it in the first half.  
  
I think we had a few slip-ups in the second half, and they are a great team
and they were able to exploit those.  
  
But, I mean, all in all, I'm proud of our team, and I think that -- I think
that we played a hard game, and, I mean, they're a great team. But yeah.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I think D said it. We had a great scouting report, and
yeah, just -- I don't know, we have to play 40 minutes, and we didn't. We
played 20 minutes really, really well and had one bad quarter.  
  
Q. What was the reason for that bad quarter do you suppose? Let-down by
you guys or them or both?  
ALANNA SMITH: Probably both.  
  
Q. Coach, this is a program you're familiar with over the years. What
was the scouting report telling you to set up your game with them, and how
successful of course it was early?  
TARA VANDERVEER: It was. I thought we -- you know, they're a very talented
team, and I thought we did a good job of knocking down shots. We hit our
threes early, made some late, too.  
  
But we did not do a good enough job defensively. We fouled them too much,
putting them at the free-throw line. They shot 16 free throws, we shot six.
They got on the O-boards, dominated that, especially in the second half. I
don't know the numbers, first half, first or second half, but that was
something they did. And we turned the ball over too much.  
  
But again, they're a team that -- they've played together a lot. They're
basically five seniors playing together, and they play very well together.
They pass well, extremely well, and they're very physical.  
  
This is I just think something -- I thought we competed very hard and very
well, but they were the better team today for 40 minutes. We did it for 20,
and we didn't get it done in the third quarter, in the second half.  
  
Q. How beneficial will this experience be for your younger people going
forward?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I hope that in some ways it can work two ways. It
should help Kiana, DiJonai, maybe Lexie with their confidence, and it'll also
point out to people, hey, things they need to work on, things we need to get
better at.  
  
But this is a really, really close team, a really fun team to work with, and
I'm very proud of -- only one team is going to be really happy at the end of
the day, and I'm really proud of this team, and I don't think that one game
should define or even 20 minutes should define the season for them. They've
had a great year. We've dealt with some adversity, and we hope that we'll get
some other people healthy, and we have great recruits coming in next year that
will help our team a lot, so it's something to look forward to.  
  
Q. Care to speculate on Notre Dame going into the Final Four as a
National Championship team?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I think any time a team beats you, you're excited to
see them win. I think if they go head to head with Oregon, I'm going to root
for Oregon because they're in our league, but otherwise I'll root for Notre
Dame.  
  
I think they have a great program. Muffet does a tremendous job, and they're
really an elite team, and we were -- I'm really proud of how we competed
against them today.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
CHICAGO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+CHICAGO)

  

## April 1, 2019

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Arike Ogunbowale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32683)

### [Jackie Young](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35203)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Notre Dame - 84, Stanford - 68  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: That was unbelievable. First half, could not make a shot. I
thought we looked just completely out of sorts, very unlike what we normally
look like. I think credit Stanford's defense. They were hitting the boards
hard. They were packing it in. We couldn't get anything going. And then second
half we looked like ourselves again.  
  
I thought that Arike was just phenomenal down the stretch. Jackie Young picked
up where Arike left off in the third quarter when she got her fouls, but I
thought Abby Prohaska gave us such a huge lift. That momentum really helped
turn the game around.  
  
Q. Arike, what felt different first half to second half for you guys,
and just getting to the Final Four again, how does this year's feel different
for you, if it does?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Well, the difference in the halves, we weren't knocking down
shots, but we also gave them a lot of second-chance opportunities. So I think
once we hit the boards in the second half, that really changed it around.  
  
I guess it really feels the same. We got there the first time, at least in our
careers, and to get back there again, it really feels the same, but it's a
long way to go. We know we're not done yet, so we're celebrating now, but
we've got to get back to work.  
  
Q. Arike, a couple years ago obviously things didn't work out the way
you wanted them to, especially with that last possession against Stanford. How
does that feel to get the taste out of your mouth?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I mean, it's been out of my mouth, but it's definitely a
good win. They put us out two years in a row my freshman and sophomore year,
so that was tough, and to get it back is great. But they're a great team. They
gave us a great run, and they really played us well, so it's great that we
came out on top.  
  
Q. Just describe the frustration, such a big game, having all those lay-
ups, point blank, just bouncing out like they did? What's that like?  
JACKIE YOUNG: Yeah, I mean, it was definitely frustrating, but I thought that
we kept our composure and were able to just lock in and focus for the second
half. We knew that the shots were going to fall in the second half, and that's
what they did. But I think it had a lot to do with our defense and just
getting rebounds.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Definitely what Jackie said.  
  
Q. Jackie, what was clicking there for you in the third quarter?  
JACKIE YOUNG: I was just being -- I mean, I thought I was aggressive the whole
game, and I just kept that same mindset, and the shots were starting to fall.
They were sagging off me a little bit, so I just had to read the defense and
take what they were giving me.  
  
Q. Besides just talking X's and O's at halftime, was there anything else
said just to kind of remind you guys to keep your composure? Was anybody
mentioning anything or Coach said anything that got you guys back in the
groove?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think as a team collectively we just talked about we have
20 more minutes to get back to the Final Four, and a lot of the mistakes and
reasons that we were down was us, we weren't really holding good defense, we
weren't getting rebounds. So if we could fix that without even the shots
falling -- we knew the shots were going to be able to fall the second half,
because the first half was rough. But if we just held defense, it would get us
back in the game, and with our shots falling, we could take the lead.  
  
Q. You know the All-American list was announced earlier today, and you
guys didn't have any first-teamers. Do you think that's a testament to the
balance you have on this team, or were there any upset feelings about that,
possible snub or not?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think we didn't really come to college to do individual
accolades. What we're doing right now, we're getting to the Final Four, and
there's only four teams that were allowed to do that. We played great team
basketball, and we're not focused on anything with individual. We just want to
get team wins, and that's what we did today.  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: I forgot to mention, I wanted to thank DePaul, Jean Ponsetto
and the Wintrust Arena. It was a fabulous venue. I liked that it was very pro
Irish, very green. But everything here was so well run, first class. We were
so happy to come here and represent the Chicago region, taking them to Tampa.  
  
Q. What does it say about your team that you guys really hadn't trailed
by very much at all in this tournament, but to keep their composure in a big
game like this and the way it started?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, it was difficult at halftime. We kept talking about how
it was mostly us. We were getting the shots we wanted to get, we just weren't
making them; that we were going to be able to make them the second half.  
  
I didn't think we rebounded well. We needed to do a better job on the box outs
so we could get our break going, which we weren't able to do in the first
half. I thought the defense got going in the second half, which allowed us to
run, and I thought that was a big reason why things turned around for us.  
  
Q. Following up on that, does it take a veteran team to not get rattled
by that?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, absolutely. The thing today was it really was everybody.
Sometimes there's somebody -- I thought Brianna Turner was playing okay, but
the other four really weren't playing like they normally do. Normally somebody
is going to pull us out of it, so they did. They kept their composure. I
didn't see a lot of frustration out there. We did talk about that at halftime,
about their body language and just running back on defense, and I thought we
definitely kept our composure in the second half.  
  
Q. When you got that -- you finally built that lead at the end of the
third quarter and then kept the pressure on at the start of the fourth. The
one thing you seemed to do is, even though they hit the five threes, you kept
them from getting a run that got them within two or three possessions, you
maintained that lead. How important was that to keep that gap and keep them
from getting back in your face?  
MUFFET McGRAW: It was huge because I was worried we were trading three for two
on almost every possession, and we did talk about trying to get some stops.
But we were able to answer, and I think that was key. We were able to make our
free throws. That was a huge key, also. And then we were able to milk the
clock a little bit more.  
  
Q. Does it feel like déjà-vu again that you're going to be facing UConn?
And what can you take both from the game this year and the game last year in
the Final Four?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, last year's game was a great finish, so I wouldn't mind
seeing that again. But they're a great team. They played really well against
Louisville in the final yesterday. They're a team that has so many weapons.
Katie Lou looks like she's back in good form. Napheesa has had a fabulous
year. Dangerfield is a great defender, and she can score, as well. They have a
lot of weapons. And similar to us, they don't have a very deep bench, so I
think there's a lot of similarities between the teams.  
  
Going back to the first game, we really lost our composure in that game, so
hopefully we've learned a lot of lessons since then.  
  
Q. What did you say to the team during halftime to really turn the game
around?  
MUFFET McGRAW: We talked mostly about what we were doing wrong, not so much
what they were doing. We needed to box out so we could get our transition game
going. We were getting great shots, we just weren't making them, so it was
really just about relaxing, take our shots, keep doing the same thing.  
  
We needed a little more motion in the offense, so we went to some different
sets in the second half so we could get a little bit of movement. I thought we
were standing around too much in the first half.  
  
Q. As many Final Fours as you've been to and winning the championship
last year, what feels unique about this run or this team?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think I'm just so happy for Brianna Turner. She had to miss
all of last year, and she wasn't able to be there, and when you have a veteran
team like this, it's great for the freshmen to get a taste of what it's going
to be like. I think it feels -- it's probably a little more relief than
excitement because we were a No. 1 seed who was supposed to get there. Last
year that team showed such resilience, it was kind of amazing that we got
back.  
  
Q. You came over to the side in the stands and took a picture with a
group of people. Can you share who that was and just what it kind of -- I
think sometimes when you step away from the court and you see family or
whatever there's a different kind of sentimentality.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, for sure. Two of my sisters were here and two of my
college teammates were here. And then I have kind of a support group from
South Bend that we meet after every game, and they were all here, so there was
quite a nice crowd for me.  
  
I'm so appreciative of the support that I get from people because they really
helped me get through a long season.  
  
Q. That 10,000-point record, is that a big deal? If you could speak to
that, about achieving that.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I mean, it's a milestone and certainly the first time it's been
done, men or women. It's pretty amazing, but it really doesn't mean anything,
except they get a lot of shots.

### [Dijonai Carrington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35195)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Q. I'm guessing there's absolutely no secrets about Notre Dame as
players, you're familiar with them. Does that help you, or at this point is it
just a matter of knowing about them and stopping them are two different
things? Is it just at this point of the season you just have to execute?  
LACIE HULL: Yeah, I think definitely it's all about executing. We're going to
be spending a lot of time on scout today and tomorrow, and I think that
focusing on that is also really important but also focusing on our own game is
going to be a key of the game.  
  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: Yeah, I'd agree. They have great players on their team,
and we have great players on our team, so it's just going to be a matter of
who shows up tomorrow.  
  
KIANA WILLIAMS: I'd agree with my two teammates. Like we know who their top
players are, and like D said, we have great players, also, so we're just going
to come out and execute our game plan and play hard.  
  
Q. Just for any of you guys, how much did that game against Oregon on
your home court kind of change things for you? Maybe you've been asked this
about 20 times and I apologize, but how did that affect you guys, if at all?  
MAYA DODSON: Yeah, definitely was a wake-up call. We didn't shoot well. After
that game we just had to regroup and move on, and the second time around, we
played how we were supposed to play. It's always just about learning.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, obviously having a loss like that, you don't want to lose
like that again, and I think, like Maya said, it's a learning opportunity. But
then again, it's also in the past. I think if you look at that game and then
look at us playing now, we have improved. We're a different team.  
  
It's important to look back at games like that to learn, but it's also
important to move forward from them.  
  
Q. Yesterday Notre Dame, they had four scorers in double figures, but
again, I think they only really went five deep. At this stage of the season,
do you think your depth might help you?  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: Absolutely. I think that's a strength that we've been able
to use all season, just knowing that any 14 of us can step up at any moment
and each of us has confidence in the others to make big plays. And like you
saw last night, a lot of us were off, Anna stepped up and she had a big game.
Multiple different people have stepped up in multiple different big games, and
none of us care who steps up, just as long as someone does it.  
  
So I think just knowing that we can go deep, deep into our bench and we don't
have to play five people for 40 minutes; we can all get some rest.  
  
Q. What kind of a physical presence does Jessica Shepard provide, and
how do you stop that?  
ALANNA SMITH: Obviously she's a very talented, strong player, and she does
present a challenge in the paint because of her skill set and her strength.
But we've played against, I think, some of the best post players in the
country, being in the Pac-12. I think that's prepared us really well. We've
played against Kristine Anigwe, we've played against Ruthy Hebard, both very,
very talented post players.  
  
So we're prepared for the challenge, and I think our post players are ready to
step up to it. We're going to watch a lot of video. We're going to scout hard,
and we're going to put in 100 percent effort.  
  
Q. For any of the players, is there anything you can take from the game
two years ago against them, and also, when you're going against another
traditional power, is there anything extra involved there, just when it's two
powerhouse programs like that?  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, we definitely look back at that film. It was an exciting
game, and I think that was an exciting year for us, too, and I think it's
really important to look at how teams were successful against them, and
looking at our own team is the best example that we can get.  
  
But you know, again, we're a different team now, too, so yeah, we're watching
film, and we're watching what was successful, but we also want to keep in mind
that we have other weapons now, too.  
  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: Yeah, I'd agree. I think just looking back on that game,
one of the things that stands out to me is the fact that we were down 16 and
we battled back and won that game, and so I think, like Alanna said, we are a
very different team this year, and they are a different team, as well,
different strengths, different weaknesses, but that's one thing that has
remained the same is that grit and that fight within us. Just being here at
Stanford, it's something that I think is a part of our culture, and so I think
they're going to go on their runs, we're going to go on our runs, but it's a
matter of just sticking with it.  
  
Q. One thing you said that changed a little bit in two years, they're a
different team, you're a different team, but I believe -- I think at the end
of that game they had the ball in Arike Ogunbowale's hands again, which she
did again last year. At crunch time they seem to get the ball to her. What's
it like to play against her?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: I've never played against her, but it's going to be fun. She's
a great player. She's done so much for her program, and it's going to take a
collective unit to stop her, stop their offensive weapons, and I'm excited for
tomorrow.  
  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: Yeah, Kiana said it best. We're going to all have to come
to the party tomorrow. It's not going to be any half effort that's going to
get the job done, by nobody. I think just sticking together, making sure it's
a tag-team effort on her and on the rest of them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll go ahead and start with an opening statement, Coach.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: It's very exciting to be playing in the Elite 8. I'm really
proud of our team. This is just a spectacular venue with a tremendous
opponent, and we're going to have to work very hard, but we're really excited
to be here and want to play very well tomorrow night.  
  
Q. I think this is the fourth time in five years you've met Notre Dame
at the regionals, either the Sweet 16 or Elite 8. Obviously there's no secrets
at this point. Do you worry about their players, or do you just have to
execute?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Yes, it is the fourth time. I don't know that it's been the
Elite 8 every time, but it is -- we've been in their bracket. We play them --
I do feel like we do know their team very well. They have a tremendous team,
their coaching staff is outstanding. They're just really elite at everything
that they do. They're really obviously very experienced players. They're very
physical. Everything -- they're fun to watch when you're not trying to prepare
for them.  
  
But like you said, we have to -- we just have to do the best that we can. We
have to be able to come out, and our players have to really understand taking
good shots, working hard defensively. Rebounding will be a real big key, and
just -- I think that last night's game was -- again, we're very excited to be
playing in the game, but was really one-sided event. Our defense was awesome,
and our offense needs a lot of work. That can't happen tomorrow night. We're
going to have to bring both our defense and our offense and our rebounding.
Pack it all.  
  
Q. Brianna Turner in particular, what dimension does she bring to them,
and what does she allow them to do on the perimeter defensively because she's
in the back to clean up mistakes?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, we played against Brianna Turner her -- I guess it was
her freshman year and her sophomore year, and then unfortunately obviously she
was out with an injury. But having her back adds great size and athleticism to
their team that already were national champions. She's the recipient of some
tremendous passes. The fact that they have four people that have over 100
assists is -- I don't even know if I know another team that has that.  
  
They're a really unselfish team. They pass the ball really well. And you know,
you can't -- you have to kind of, quote, pick your poison. She's inside with
Shepard, and then you've got Ogunbowale and Mabrey, and they're all extremely
talented players.  
  
She does add, I think, a different dimension to this year's team than last
year's team. I think she's also shooting about 65 percent, so...  
  
Q. What does Shepard bring to the table for them?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, she -- I think a couple things. First of all, I think
she's a tremendous passer. She has great vision and understanding of the game.
She runs the floor well for -- she's lost weight this year, so she looks more
mobile. She runs the floor really well. She hits mid-range shots. She rebounds
the heck out of it. She gets on the glass. You know, they're really -- she's
very physical, gets on the O-boards especially well.  
  
But I think her basketball IQ is really elite basketball IQ. She's really a
very smart player out there.  
  
Q. How much time will you spend looking at the video from two years ago,
and is there anything you can take from that game that would apply to this
one?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I'd like to spend all my time watching two and three years
ago, but that probably won't help us that much tomorrow. You know, they have
experienced players, and we have played against them a little bit, but this is
a new team for them, and we've got to get ready for this team.  
  
You know, I think there are things to be learned just coming into each of
those games, we were clearly an underdog, and I'm really proud of the effort
and the confidence that our team played with, and there are things that can be
learned from both of those games.  
  
But it's a new day in terms of who they have playing and how big they are and
how physical they are and just really -- it's not so much that they're doing
new things, but they are a different team than the teams that we've played.
They go inside with a real vengeance. Their bigs are just really big and
physical, and that's a bigger part of their game than maybe in years past.  
  
Q. What's it like to go against Muffet on the recruiting trail and her
people, and how often do you find that the case that you guys are after the
same type of players and type of characters, and the Fran battle in
particular, was that fun, and have you ever shared anything with Muffet about
what that was like?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, that's probably one thing that coaches probably
don't talk about, recruiting. There are some players that we have gone head to
head with, but I think that players -- they really figure out what's the best
fit for them. And they have a great team and great players. We're really
excited about -- obviously we're excited about Fran and Haley Jones, who both
visited Notre Dame. Our other two didn't. But we do bump into them a little
bit.  
  
A lot of women are looking for a great education and great basketball, and I
think that Stanford and Notre Dame fit those bills. But there are a lot of
other really, really good choices for women. So we go up against a lot of
different schools. But we're really excited about the kids that we have coming
in next year and just how much they will add to our program.

### [Jessica Shepard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32622)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Q. Some of you have played against Stanford in the past. The two
programs have met four of the last five years, at least at the regional level.
I know, Arike, you played against them at the end of the 2017 game. Talk about
playing a program like that, good athletes that you're familiar with.  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think they're a great program. They have a great coaching
staff, and they really are pretty good at scouting. And like you said, we
played each other a lot, so they know our players and they know what we like
to do and vice versa. So it's definitely going to be a game of discipline and
runs. We're both good teams, so who can execute the game plan better.  
  
BRIANNA TURNER: Yeah, they're obviously such a great team coming from a really
good Pac-12 Conference. Tara VanDerveer, over a thousand wins, so yeah, we
know we're facing another phenomenal coach. So we know we have to just come in
and play hard, make sure we get stops and play our game.  
  
MARINA MABREY: Like both of them already said, they're just really a great
team. They execute really well. We run a lot of the same stuff. We have a lot
of the same tendencies. It'll be key for us to play really good defense.  
  
Q. Jessica, when you were looking at transferring, what appealed to you
about Notre Dame, how did you see yourself fitting in, and does it feel like
now as a senior everything went according to plan? And Brianna and Jackie, if
you could discuss what it's like to have her on your team, what she's added.  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think when I transferred I was looking for a place just to
grow as a person and as a player and a chance to compete for championships.
Obviously choosing Notre Dame, I had prior relationships with three of the
four people up here with me, so I think that helped a lot, and just definitely
the coaches, it's just a family feel and they're just real with you, and I
think it was a great fit for me.  
  
BRIANNA TURNER: Jessica is such a phenomenal player inside and out. She's the
strongest player I've ever played against or with, so that just speaks for
itself. Her ability to like chase down rebounds and just offensively, as well,
just her strength is really one of her great assets.  
  
JACKIE YOUNG: Yeah, like Bri said, Jess is a great player, and she's a huge
post presence for us, definitely one of the best post players I've ever played
with. She's also great at passing the ball, and so it's just nice whenever
we're getting to go out in transition because of Jess's rebounding and passing
abilities.  
  
Q. Arike, what do you remember about that game two years ago and the
lay-up and how that unfolded, and can you just describe how different it was
going from that experience two years ago to last year where you were the one
hitting the big shots in the Final Four?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I mean, that was a tough shot. They played well in the
second half. They came back. We played well the first half, but second half
not so much. So it came down to a shot which is not really -- we don't really
want that. Stuff happens. You grow and you learn. I guess it's better to be on
the opposite side my junior year of making the shot rather than missing it.  
  
Like I said, you just grow. You've got to kind of forget about those things,
use it to make you stronger, motivation. You always remember how you felt in
that moment and you don't want to feel like that again.  
  
Q. I want to follow up to what you said about her strength. You have
some certain examples or stories that come to mind of either plays or even
working out, things that really stand out?  
BRIANNA TURNER: For instance, in the weight room, I'll grab like a 30-pound
dumbbell, and Jess will grab like 60. So just simple instances like that.  
  
But yeah, just like just playing and how she can just literally move players
without fouling, is one of her strengths. So yeah, definitely the weight room.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: She beat me in arm wrestling once. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Was there any player you modeled yourself after, and if you could
talk about just your development even through high school and how you learned
to use that as an asset?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I don't think I necessarily like modeled my game after anyone
growing up. I think I watched a lot of basketball, obviously, but growing up I
played a guard pretty much all the way up through high school, so I think that
definitely helped in just court vision and just being able to pass the ball
ahead. But yeah.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's welcome head coach Muffet McGraw. We'll go ahead and
start with questions for Coach this afternoon.  
  
Q. How was Jackie today physically after taking that shot, and how is
Marina physically at this point?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, everybody came out of the game fine. Got a lot of
treatment, and they are ready to go.  
  
Q. The players were talking about Jessica's strength, and each one of
them kind of had a funny, maybe made-up story about how strong she is. But
what does -- how unusual or rare or unique is the strength she has, and what
are some examples of that? And then on top of that, to be a good passer, as
well as scoring, rebounding? Kind of seems like she does a lot of things for
you.  
MUFFET McGRAW: She's incredibly versatile, but she's tough to move when she
gets her spot down on the block. But she is such a great passer. She can put
it on the floor. She can read the defense. She's a really willing passer,
also. But I love her strength. When she gets the ball down low, she's pretty
hard to stop.  
  
Q. What have you learned about going up against Tara these last few
years, and did it surprise you that Notre Dame and Stanford went so long
without playing each other before that?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, no, we've played them, I think, maybe three of the last
four or four of the last five, whatever. She's a great coach. She is somebody
that just is a consistent winner. She gets pretty good players, but she makes
them better. I think she's a great strategist and just has a great mind for
the game.  
  
Q. What was that like over the years to battle on the recruiting circuit
with Stanford? And then the Fran pursuit in particular, how did that unfold?
What was that like?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, that was a battle. The thing you know when you go against
Stanford, there's not going to be any negative talk in the recruiting process.
So it's always a good, clean fight.  
  
Fran was somebody that we went after hard, and we were disappointed when she
chose Stanford, but certainly couldn't make a bad decision between the two
schools.  
  
Q. Just another follow-up about Jessica, when you knew she was
transferring, what did you see in her, and how did you think she could develop
in your program?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, we heard that she was going to transfer, and a couple of
our players had played with her in USA Basketball. You know, they talked to me
about her, but my first conversation with Jess, all she talked about was "I
just want to win. I want to come someplace where we can win a National
Championship. I don't care how many points I score, I don't care about any of
the stats. I just want to win."  
  
I just immediately -- I hung up the phone and said to my husband, "That's
somebody I would love to coach." But I knew she could make an immediate
impact.  
  
At Nebraska she got to shoot a lot of threes and she got to play away from the
basket, and we kind of forced her down on the block a little bit more than
probably -- I mean, her game is able to go out on the perimeter, but we really
needed her on the inside, and she played so well, had such a great year.
Finding out she was eligible the first day of our exhibition game was like a
gift, an early Christmas present, and she has been so important to our team.  
  
Q. You guys I think are the highest scoring team in the country.
Stanford is unbeaten when they hold people under 70 points. How important is
it -- I think you're going to get runs on both sides, but how important is it
to kind of dictate that tempo and play your style as opposed to letting
somebody else dictate it?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, you always want to control the tempo. We do like to run.
We're a transition-type team. I think our offense feeds our defense, which is
kind of the opposite of the way it's supposed to go. But we can get out and
run. We enjoy playing the game a lot more. We can play half court, and we
certainly have some pretty good weapons on offense. But they are a very good
defensive team. That'll be a battle.  
  
Q. I know it's probably like an annual conversation about how to get
more attention on the women's game, the women's tournament. I know there's
been talk this year, too, about the NCAA doing more to promote it. Do you have
thoughts on that, or ideas of what can be done, and do you see improvement
there?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Well, I thought last year was one of the most exciting Final
Fours ever, and I thought it transcended the women's basketball community and
really just went throughout the country. I thought everybody was watching,
maybe because it was Easter Sunday or the games were so close, it was so
exciting.  
  
I think that went a long way to building a lot more fans. I thought it went
over to the WNBA. We had a huge uptick in their attendance. I think ESPN was
really happy with the numbers. I think first time maybe we were in the black
in the tournament. Columbus did a great job. So I think we're heading in the
right direction.  
  
I think probably the regionals this year, this venue was fantastic. Everything
about it, it's a great building to be in, everything is first class, and the
fans were phenomenal. So it was great to see because the regionals are where
the problem is in women's basketball. It's really not the first and second
round, and it's not the Final Four. So I think we need another plan for the
regionals.  
  
Q. Any ideas on --  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think we should come to Chicago every year. I think that
would be great. (Laughter).  
  
A lot of people are floating the all 16 to one site, eight to two sites. We've
got to do something, I think.

_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Stanford - 55, Missouri State - 46  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: We're really excited to be playing Monday night. I think that
our team worked really hard. I thought our defense was really locked in. We
obviously struggled shooting the ball, but people stayed with things really
well. We had great contributions off the bench. I'm proud of how Anna came in
and really helped us.  
  
First of all, I think that congratulations to Missouri State for their season,
and what a great job their coaching staff, Kellie is doing and their coaching
staff, just a very, very tough team, very gritty team. They played really
hard, and we had to work really hard to beat them.  
  
Again, we're excited to be playing Monday, and we're going to work as hard as
we can to have a great evening against Notre Dame.  
  
Q. You're both very accomplished players. Have you ever experienced
anything like the shooting trouble your guys' team had today, and how
frustrating was that for you guys within the course of the game?  
ALANNA SMITH: I would say that, yes, we have experienced shooting trouble.
Probably not to the extent that it was like tonight. Usually we'll start off a
little not great in the first half and then pick it up in the second, but it
persisted the whole game.  
  
Honestly, I think the feeling on the team was we weren't worried. We know that
we can hit down those shots, and we weren't today, so we had to go to
something else.  
  
And I think Tara said it, you could just tell that we stayed with things, no
matter what our percentage was. No one was freaking out, and I think that was
really good on part of everybody on our team because we kept each other
accountable, we kept each other in the game.  
  
ANNA WILSON: Yeah, we obviously didn't shoot as well as we wanted to. I think
in regard to that, I think that our team really stuck with things, and when we
needed to score, we did. I think the most important thing is that we just
stuck together and we never got down on each other. We continued to encourage
each other. So yeah.  
  
Q. Was there any part of the game where you felt your team had an
opportunity to perform better than it did, and the frustration just got to be
a little more than you expected?  
TARA VANDERVEER: That was an absolute root canal. You know, again, I think
that there are some real positive things that came out of that. I thought we
worked really hard on defense, to hold a team as talented as they are to 46
points, and we've really hung our hat on our defense, and today we actually --
we got on the glass a little bit better. We out-rebounded them, and I have
never seen -- I can't ever remember a Stanford team that has struggled so much
from the field, not just threes, but lay-ups, you know.  
  
And to move on to the Elite 8 with a game like that, I'm so glad that's not
our last game because I really believe we're a lot better than that. But it
was -- I was not sure what Alanna wasn't worried about. I don't know what game
she was at. I mean, wow. We just -- we tried a lot of different things. We
tried a lot of different people, and we struggled.  
  
But it was -- we found a way to win, which is -- this is March, and it's
survive and advance.  
  
Q. You kind of alluded to this at the end there, but how much does
experience help? You guys have been in the Sweet 16 the last however many
years. How much does all that experience help when you get into a game like
that and your shots aren't falling and everything?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I just think that more than anything, our league has
prepared us for this in that we have been in very close games with other
schools in the Pac-12, and playing against a team like UCLA, playing against a
team like Arizona, we're down to the last -- things were not going well for
us. We struggled shooting the basketball.  
  
But I think that if you took that aside, we rebounded well. We defended well.
People were into it the whole game. We didn't have meltdowns or -- I thought
we did really a lot of things to get us ready. The experience of playing in
the Pac-12 is really what helped us as much as anything else.  
  
Q. Somehow you managed to build a 13-point lead despite the shooting
difficulties. Even when they made the run, you were able to work that clock
down the stretch.  
TARA VANDERVEER: We were trying. I think that that was something that we were
really trying to do. I mean, we struggle when we have our key people in foul
trouble. DiJonai was in foul trouble, Alanna was in foul trouble. Ki picked up
an early foul but she stayed with things really well, even though she really
struggled offensively. She made key plays for us.  
  
You know, it just was hard getting anything going, and we did get that lead,
and we did try to milk the clock a little bit so that knowing that -- coming
down and taking a quick shot wasn't going to help us any.  
  
That's where I think an experienced point guard, to your point, someone that I
feel like is a coach on the floor, I felt like she really did a good job with
that.  
  
Q. How much of a lift did Anna give you off the bench in the second half
when you guys were struggling?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Oh, I thought Anna gave us a lift at both ends. She scored.
She got a nice backdoor lay-up and finished. She scored in transition on a
nice pass from Lexie. She hit a three for us. Her defense, she worked very
hard defensively, and people on our team have confidence in her. Our bench
really helped us a lot between Anna, Shannon, those two, Lexie Hull, I think
those three especially really came in. We needed maybe a little more help. I
thought Alyssa grabbed some rebounds. But just for whatever reason, we just
struggled finishing at the rim or even from the three-point line.  
  
If you had told me we'd shoot 10 percent from three and win, I'd be surprised.
But we did.  
  
Q. Your impressions of Notre Dame and the challenges that you guys will
face Monday night from them?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, we've played against some of their players. They look
-- I thought that was a great game, watching Texas A&M and Notre Dame, two
really, really tough teams. You know, we know that we'll have to play better.
They have a great inside game. They have phenomenal individual players, one
through five. We've played against some of them already. We haven't played
against Shepard. But for the most part, we've played against everybody else.  
  
They have an outstanding team. I mean, they're basically -- everyone is back
that won a National Championship, and then they add Brianna Turner to that
mix, and they're playing kind of in their backyard. So we know it will be a
big challenge, but I have a lot of confidence in our team, and we know we'll
have to play better and I know we can and they know we can, too. But Notre
Dame, I mean, there are no chinks in that armor. They have everything. Muffet
and her staff do a tremendous job, and they just really -- they're the leading
scoring team in the country, right? So it's going to be fun.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
CHICAGO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+CHICAGO)

  

## March 30, 2019

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Arike Ogunbowale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32683)

### [Jessica Shepard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32622)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Notre Dame - 87, Texas A&M - 80  
  
MUFFET McGRAW: I thought Gary Blair did an outstanding job this year to get
his team back to the Sweet 16. They had a whole new team built around Carter,
though she is a phenomenal player. We obviously struggled to guard her.  
  
I think it was a really entertaining game to watch even if you didn't care who
won, just a lot of great shots, a lot of big shots. I thought Jessica Shepard
with the double-double, she was unstoppable down low, and then Arike hit big
shot after big shot. I thought the steal for a lay-up late in the game I
thought probably is the one that sealed the victory. Arike wins it with a
defensive stop, I think that should be the headline.  
  
Q. Arike, it seemed like you did take things to another gear. Can you
describe what it felt like in the fourth quarter, and then also the play your
coach talked about, how you saw that develop?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Yeah, it's just fun being out there with my teammates, and
we had a lot of fans. Our fans really traveled and supported us. So the energy
was high, and I was just trying to do anything to help the team. That play was
big. It was a real momentum changer. It made them call a time-out, and we had
the crowd going crazy, so that definitely was good for us, the energy.  
  
Q. Jessica, the first quarter offense was looking for some stability and
you provided that with 11 straight points. How big was that, especially with
you being able to have your double-double?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I mean, I think we knew our offense would get going at some
point, so I think in the third quarter they did a great job of getting me the
ball and then just finishing strong inside.  
  
Q. Arike, what did the official say to you about that technical, and did
you feel like it was justified or were you surprised by it?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I mean, it was justified. I got a little too excited and let
my emotions get the best of me, but it's basketball, so it happens. I'm glad
that we were up by enough that those two free throws didn't die it up or
something. But I've got to be smarter than that, but like I said, it's
basketball, I was in the moment.  
  
Q. Arike, you got 10 points in the first half, 24 in the second. Were
you looking for that shot more, the way they were playing defense?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think I tried to keep the same focus, same mentality and
just things opened up a little bit more. The game picked up and we got steals
and we got in transition and we were getting rebounds, we had better defense
in the second half, so when we get rebounds and get in transition, we get a
lot of points there.  
  
Q. Arike, Chennedy did score 35 tonight, but she took 34 shots. What was
the key to forcing her to tough shots and holding her to such a low
percentage?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: She's an amazing player. You can have two people on her, she
gets a little bit of space, she's shooting it in. She has a great stroke. She
can get to the basket, she can shoot. So she's hard to guard. But I think we
got stops when it mattered. Fourth quarter we held her, we got stops. And like
I say, we got stops when it mattered. So that's all that matters. We win and
we go on.  
  
Q. Both Arike and Jess, did their physicality surprise you at all, and
how good do you feel about how you responded to it?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: No, I think we knew coming into the game our coaches did a
great job of scouting that they were going to be a physical team, and I think
in the first half we kind of let them get too many rebounds and weren't really
controlling the glass, and then I think we did a much better job in the second
half.  
  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I would just agree with Jess. We knew they were going to be
physical, and we knew it was going to be a high-tempo game, but I think we let
it go a little bit in the first half, but we responded better in the second
half.  
  
Q. You faced them in the same round last year. I know they've had a lot
of roster turnover, but how did this year's game compare to that one?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: I think they lost a couple players, but the other players
that they had stepped up a lot. They have great players, Chennedy, of course,
but the other players around them are really good. They got to the basket.
They did exactly what they were supposed to do. They're a great team. I think
they're going to be really good in the future. But, I mean, they're a good
team.  
  
JESSICA SHEPARD: Yeah, I think they're a very well-coached team, and I think
they just came out and played hard today, and I think they'll be very good.  
  
Q. Just wanted to make sure the deck was cleared on this game first, but
I do want to ask you about you as a group are closing in on 10,000 points.
You'll need eight Monday. Can you wrap your head around that at all, the
absurdity of what you've done collectively?  
ARIKE OGUNBOWALE: Yeah, I think we have really five All-Americans on the
court. Even if they didn't put us in the list, we have five All-Americans on
the court, and playing with everybody that can score 30 on any given night,
each one of us is just amazing, and I think that's credit to the coaches
recruiting us and getting great players and developing us over these four
years, three years, whatever it is. I mean, that is pretty amazing.  
  
JESSICA SHEPARD: Yeah, I agree. I think we come into every game and we know we
have five people on the court that can be All-Americans. I think, yeah, that's
something that's hard to kind of wrap your head around, but I think it just is
due to the coaches putting us in the position to score and then us just being
willing to play together.  
  
Q. Muffet, can you kind of sense when Arike is going to take it to
another gear, and how special is it to have a player who has those moments?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, the bigger the moment, the bigger she plays. She's not
afraid of a big moment by any means. There was a lot of times we were just
running stuff for her, and we ran a lot of sets for her, and she responded
incredibly well. She has just got that mentality of "I want the ball in a
clutch situation," and she's not afraid to miss.  
  
Q. Coach, following off that, she had those two big shots during that
four-, five-minute stretch when it was tied. How much do you feel your
experience that you've been here, you had a senior team, and Gary didn't, how
much do you feel --  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, do think experience plays a big factor when you get to
this point in the tournament. Having been there before, having won this game,
gone to the next round, I think that is definitely -- and with a senior group,
we just have such veteran players who have all played on the big stage. So I
think experience down the stretch was huge for us.  
  
Q. Jackie had another spill there; what was she dealing with and maybe
the toughness she showed to come back and have a fourth quarter like that?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she got hit hard on the screen, and it was loud. We were
trying to call it. But she just got the wind knocked out of her again, I think
for the second time. She'll be pretty sore tomorrow, I think, but she'll be
back. The resilience she has.  
  
I kept looking down the bench waiting for the trainer to give me the word she
could go back in the game, and she came up big. That free throw jumper I
thought was huge, and she had a post-up. I think when they tied the game, put
us ahead.  
  
Q. How about the defensive job she did?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she did a much better job in the second half I thought on
Carter. She struggled a bit in the first half, we all did, but I thought in
the second half, especially late, down the stretch, she did a better job.  
  
Q. You mentioned a couple days ago that you didn't really like any of
your options for guarding Carter. So that being said, what were you hoping for
defensively? What were some of your goals knowing that?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I'm apparently a prophet. I mean, we had a lot of ideas, and
none of them worked, and double-teaming was the last idea, and I thought that
was a little more effective when we remembered to do it. But she's really hard
to guard. She might be the best individual player that we've played all year.  
  
Q. Back to Jackie, they scored the first five points in the fourth
quarter to go up by two, and then Jackie had that driving lane to tie it up.
Talk about how big that play was, not only for the team but also for her and
her confidence in the fourth quarter.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, she wasn't getting a lot of shots. I thought she was open
in the first -- really the first half. I didn't think we did a really good job
of sharing the ball in the first half. I thought we were putting it on the
floor, trying to drive it a little bit more than I would have liked.  
  
I thought we could have got more in transition if we would have moved the ball
a little bit more. So she really didn't get a lot of opportunity. Second half
we went to her more, late shot clot, we ran some stuff to get her the ball and
get her the opportunity, and she really came up big for us.  
  
Q. Coach Blair said he was thrilled about how competitive this game was
in light of the other six, I guess, being double digits in this round. Can you
be as thrilled as him and --  
MUFFET McGRAW: Am I ever?  
  
Q. Right, but is it a game you can even appreciate the quality as it's
being played, or does that come later?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Probably later. I think that it was a very entertaining game,
and I thought that was -- it was probably a great TV game, and the crowd was
phenomenal. The crowd really, really made for just a great environment for us
to play in, and that was -- I'm just stalling because I forgot your question.  
  
Q. I do want to ask you about the closing in on 10,000. I imagine that's
not something you ever set your mind around imagining, having a group that
would do that.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, it's pretty exciting, men's or women's, that's never been
done before. I think it's just interesting because of the way the class
settled in with Bri coming back for the fifth year, Jess coming in. So to go
out with them, I mean, that is five All-Americans on the floor at the same
time.  
  
But more impressive, I think, are the assists. I don't know if we're setting
any assist records, but four people over 100 I think is pretty unusual, too.  
  
Q. Gary said that such a competitive game, and he said this is what
women's game needs. Do you feel that way, too?  
MUFFET McGRAW: Absolutely. I think it's great this year just to see the
parity. When you get down, especially -- the Sweet 16, there's 16 good teams,
but the final eight, boy, anybody could win it.  
  
So I think it's great for the game for people to turn on and see competitive
games at every level. I think we had a couple of competitive games yesterday,
and maybe there will be a few more today. So I think it's really good for the
women's game to see that there's parity now.

### [Kellie Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30789)

### [Jasmine Franklin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37118)

### [Danielle Gitzen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37110)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Stanford - 55, Missouri State - 46  
  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, we're disappointed that we don't get to keep on playing
and the journey doesn't get to continue with this group. It's been an exciting
run. It's been a lot of fun. Obviously Stanford is a really tough team. We
knew that coming in.  
  
But I'm proud of our players going out and competing and giving it their all
and not backing down. So it's been an exciting time, and I'm really proud of
this team.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you take me through your thoughts and how you're
doing?  
DANIELLE GITZEN: I mean, obviously it sucks we lost. We definitely wanted to
keep going, but at the end of the day, I'm honored to have put on the Lady
Bear jersey and represent Missouri State University these past four years.  
  
It's definitely been an amazing experience, especially senior year being able
to go to Sweet 16, and along with that, I'm just really proud of our team to
be able to go to the Sweet 16, and we only have, what, three upperclassmen is
something that's pretty amazing. And I think we kind of put Missouri State on
the map, and, hey, you're going to want to watch the Lady Bears the next
couple years because it's going to be a good team.  
  
Q. Just kind of take me through the future. It's a young roster that
you're leaving behind, but seems to be in good hands.  
DANIELLE GITZEN: Oh, yeah, for sure. Just in one season, the freshmen have
matured so much. This one has matured so much, and the fact that they can make
such a big impact, just their first and second years, I think it just puts
like the goals limitless. I feel they can go -- I feel like they're going to
be a good team to watch.  
  
Q. Jasmine, can you take me through what Danielle has meant to you?  
DANIELLE GITZEN: Let's hear this. (Laughter).  
  
JASMINE FRANKLIN: Danielle has been a really good leader to me. As you see,
I'm very vocal on the court, and I share my feelings out, and she's always
helped me calm down, talk to the reps.  
  
And on and off the court she's helpful. In practice she helps me when I don't
know the plays. She's just a very helpful person, and I appreciate her so
dearly.  
  
Q. You said the other day how you think they're going to get better and
better. How much has this experience kind of showed you that you guys are just
going to get better?  
JASMINE FRANKLIN: This experience definitely tells me that our team can hang,
like even though we're the underdogs we still can keep going. We've got a
little fight in us, and I think these next few years will definitely be great.  
  
Q. How much did their length bother you guys offensively when you drove
in the lane and tried to get your shot off?  
JASMINE FRANKLIN: Post-wise, I started to realize that they were jumping a
lot, and so kind of shot fake and go up really helped. But it did bother me
personally a lot because no one wants their shot blocked. But yeah.  
  
DANIELLE GITZEN: I would say that, yes -- well, first of all, Stanford is a
great team, and they're very long, and I think that it definitely was
disruptive having their long arms and getting into passes, but I think also we
got good looks, we just couldn't hit them at the end of the day.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you kind of take me through this emotional day starting
with that pep rally when you jumped on the microphone all the way through
hugging Kelly.  
DANIELLE GITZEN: A little bit of a roller coaster, mixed emotions. I guess
going into it, I wasn't thinking, hey, this is going to be my last time
playing, last time going into a pep rally, going in front of the fans, and
obviously to now definitely stinks.  
  
But at the end of the day, I mean, I wouldn't give up the experience for
anything. I've met so many amazing people on this journey, made so many
memories, and Missouri State fans and the community as a whole has been the
most supportive towards me, and so it's been -- it's definitely been a mix of
emotions.  
  
Q. Jasmine, to get a couple upsets in the opening weekend and then make
a team like Stanford just scratch and claw their way past you guys, what kind
of statement do you feel like this team has made in the last two weeks?  
JASMINE FRANKLIN: Definitely don't sleep on us because, once again, we can
stick around. Don't sleep on Missouri State. We're still here.  
  
Q. I guess for both of you, if you're to recap the whole season, does
this kind of set a new standard do you think for the program, what you guys
have been able to do?  
DANIELLE GITZEN: Yes, I would say so. I think coming in you kind of know the
history of the program. We have Jackie Stiles as one of our coaches, so
getting back to kind of that standard and that level of play is always
something I think in the back of our minds.  
  
So I think, yeah, coming in and proving that, hey, we can fight and we can
play with the best of the best is definitely going to set a standard for
Missouri State moving forward.  
  
JASMINE FRANKLIN: I agree. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Danielle, how are you smiling through all of this? How are you able
to keep it together right now?  
DANIELLE GITZEN: I don't know, I guess at the end of the day, it's just been
such an amazing, I guess, last year. Yes, it's sad -- I don't know if it's
fully like hit me yet. I'm trying to kind of take everything in and experience
it and just take the opportunity.  
  
So I feel like maybe later tonight or a week from now I'll kind of be like,
okay, it's over type thing, but as of right now, I'm just, again, so proud of
what we've accomplished as a team and what my teammates have done, and I guess
that's kind of why.  
  
Q. Coach, some games where it's a little faster paced, 13 points is
easier to make up when every possession is not such a grind. Would you agree
that that slow pace made it really hard to come back at the end?  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, yeah, we were still pushing the ball offensively. We
weren't able to knock down some shots that we -- we got it close and just
couldn't get a bucket or two when we needed it down the stretch. You know, and
they started chewing up some time offensively on the other end.  
  
I thought the two big threes they hit were really daggers because I thought we
had a little momentum and they knocked those two big shots down.  
  
Q. I think you talked about it yesterday that you were a little worried
about their length and how it might affect you guys. Did you see that sort of
borne out in how the game went?  
KELLIE HARPER: Oh, for sure. I thought early on their length created a lot of
adversity, really, for us. We were shooting over taller people. We didn't get
a lot of clean looks that we're used to getting. We couldn't get a lot of lay-
ups, couldn't get all the way to the basket early on. I didn't think our
spacing was great. We tried to change a few things.  
  
I thought we did a better job in the second half, but still we missed open
shots when we did get our open shots, which I just felt were few and far
between. I just felt like they could be a little bit late and still contest
with their length.  
  
I was definitely worried about it, and I do think it affected our shooting for
sure.  
  
Q. Can you just take me through Danielle's last game, just hugging her
for the last time and just the emotions of losing her right now?  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, I'm like Danielle, it doesn't quite sink in yet, and you
don't go into a game ever thinking, oh, what am I going to say, what am I
going to do if this is our last game. I don't ever have that game plan. You
know, it will sink in later. We'll have a postseason banquet and we'll get all
emotional and teary eyed then for sure. The one thing I said to her when she
came off, I just said, you have had a great year, and she did. She had an
unbelievable season for herself personally, for this team, and I couldn't be
happier for her. She's been everything we needed her to be.  
  
Q. Can you just kind of put into words what kind of run you guys just
went on, one senior, one junior, being able to make it to the Sweet 16? Does
it sound crazy?  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, yes. Yes, it does.  
  
You know, we felt like we were going to be a good basketball team. We had to
get there. And we felt like we had talent. We just had to figure some things
out. And we did. And they bought in. And you were able to witness it. We
played four great games in a row and put it together at the most important
time of the season, and I was -- I'm so, so proud of them. I'm so happy for
them because as a coach, when you're asking for their best and you're asking
them to believe in the vision and the possibilities and they can't really see
them yet but they have that blind faith, and then to see it come together, I'm
just so proud, so happy for them.  
  
Q. And when you just look at the youth on the roster, how excited does
it make you to possibly get back here?  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, let me tell you, getting here is hard. Getting here is
very, very hard. You've got to be a good basketball team. You've got to get a
great match-up and you've got to be playing well. Everything has to come
together. But I love the experience that our young players have had through
this. I think their level of expectation is higher for themselves and for our
basketball team, and I'm not talking about wins, I'm talking about execution
and what we need to look like to be a championship team. They've got something
that I couldn't teach them otherwise, so this has been great for us moving
forward.  
  
Q. You talk about their length, but also your defense was pretty solid.
I mean, you were out on their three-point shooters, you contested when they
did drive the lane. So just talk a little bit about how well you guys played
defensively.  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, I'm pretty sure that this was a season low in points for
Stanford, and they -- you may have to correct me if I'm wrong, but that's what
I was told on the way here. They missed some shots, but man, our team played
tough. Our team lined up and guarded, and that's what we've been doing through
this stretch.  
  
Unfortunately, I think we were also season low in points, as well,
unfortunately for us. But I'll tell you what, we've said, and I truly believe
it, we felt like somebody was going to have to beat us. We weren't going to
come in here and back down. Somebody was going to have to beat us. Stanford
beat us. They had to work hard to do it.  
  
Q. This is the 50th season of the Lady Bears. What's it like knowing
that this was the 50th year and this is what you guys were able to do?  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, I think for us what's been really special, throughout the
season we've been -- we've put this team in the record book. I mean, for
different things, for wins on the road and different streaks. So I think this
team -- I think it's just really special that this team has made their mark on
a very storied program and such rich history, and this team is -- they have
their name in there, and that's a big deal.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
CHICAGO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+CHICAGO)

  

## March 30, 2019

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [Kayla Wells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36634)

### [Ciera Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36633)

_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Notre Dame - 87, Texas A&M - 80  
  
GARY BLAIR: First, this is what women's basketball needed. You just saw six
games that were all double-digit wins that were a little bit of a runaways. We
just played arguably maybe the best team right down to the wire. We don't ever
give up. We find ways to get the job done. It was a tremendous ball game. I
had to call time-out two minutes into the second half. They made a couple of
good plays. We made mistakes. We had our chances.  
  
That's all you can want. But folks, this is what women's basketball needs
right now. They don't need the double-digit wins and all of that. We lost the
ball game probably because of the paint points that they got, whether it was
Arike posting up or their two bigs inside, and this is why they are better
this year than they were last year, because of Turner. She changes the game,
rushes shots.  
  
But the heck with them. I want to talk about these three right here, okay. I'm
going to tell you one thing, all you people that are out there listening, if
she doesn't make State Farm All-American this year, something is doggone
wrong. Now, think about it; why does she have to wait until she becomes a
junior or a senior just because there's very quality at the top? And you saw
one out there tonight. But if she's earned it, and she has, and she's done it
for two straight years, this is a kid that needs to be All-American this year,
and I'll go to bat for her and what she's doing, and I'm proud of her. This
one right here, she controls the boards, controls the rebound, does a great
job. She's our captain and our leader.  
  
And the one down there, she doesn't know who Jamaal Wilkes is. Maybe you young
ones don't, either. But he was called "Silk" back then when he played for the
Lakers, and this is our version of Jamaal Wilkes and "Silk" because she's so
smooth. She's so smooth.  
  
But give credit to this team. Notre Dame is probably the best team we've
played this year, them and Mississippi State. So give them all kudos. Muffet
made some great calls. Their high-low game was hurting us. That's why they're
defending national champions.  
  
Go.  
  
Q. Chennedy, can you talk about how you were able to settle down after
picking up the two quick fouls?  
CHENNEDY CARTER: Just stay calm. My coach kept me out there. Keep my head up.  
  
GARY BLAIR: You can give a little bit better than that. Go ahead, expound a
little on that one. Come on down.  
  
CHENNEDY CARTER: I mean, it's simple. You get two fouls early, you're not
going to complain or quit. Keep playing. Keep your head together. It's fine.
Stay within the system. Keep playing defense. It's not a big deal. Stay within
the system. Keep playing defense. It's not a big deal. My teammates believed
in me. I didn't pick up a third one after that.  
  
GARY BLAIR: If it would have been any other team we were playing, she'd have
been brought to the bench. I have to trust my bench. But when you're playing
Notre Dame, it could have been over in the first quarter, and she comes and
sits by me, and that's why we trust her.  
  
Q. Chennedy, when you guys were coming off the court, I saw you take all
your teammates in and embrace them, telling them to keep their heads up. Is
that your evolution as a leader? Why did you do that?  
CHENNEDY CARTER: I'm really proud of them. We're a group of sophomores going
against seniors, potential draft picks. I was so proud of the way we fought
tonight. We fought for four quarters, and we left it all out there on the
court.  
  
Some of them were disappointed, but I was proud of my teammates. We competed.
We're young and we're growing, and I just told them, hey, we're going to be
better next year. We'll be back, and we'll make a statement again.  
  
Q. Ciera, they had a lot of points in the paint tonight. Are they more
athletic than some of the front lines you've seen in the SEC? What kind of
challenges did they present?  
CIERA JOHNSON: Their transition is very good, and also they were able to
spread the floor because they can pretty much all shoot it, all the guards can
pretty much shoot, so they're able to spread the floor, break you down. And
then the plays they run, they run so many screens, and it's just hard to
defend. They're a very good offensive team, and they have some good sets and
some good plays that they run.  
  
Q. Kayla and Chennedy, could you talk about 24, only 10 points at half
but came alive in the second half with 24? Did she do anything different or
how were you having a tough time controlling her in the second half?  
KAYLA WELLS: I felt like it started in transition. She got a few easy buckets,
and that got her going. So she came out and she was feeling it and she was
hitting shots. We were trying to guard her the best way we can, and she just
continued to hit shots.  
  
CHENNEDY CARTER: She made a lot of good shots. She's a pretty good player.
Arike is older, so she's kind of been in some similar situations, so good job
to her.  
  
Q. Chennedy, where is your range? Where does it stop as far as hitting a
three or where you're going to shoot a three from?  
CHENNEDY CARTER: I don't really know. I'm in the gym a lot, and I really like
working on shooting kind of like Steph Curry, so that's where it comes from.
I'm really confident in my jump shot. But if I had to pick a spot, I would say
that the hash mark where the coaches are at, I probably can shoot from there.  
  
Q. Coach touched on you played your best game of the year tonight.
Looking at the journey, where was the turning point? What was the maturity to
get to this point?  
CHENNEDY CARTER: Our maturity, I would say it just came from the hard work and
hard practices and just preparation. We're a team that knows good we are and
how good we can be. I feel like we stay within our system and stay together.  
  
These are my sisters, and we are go through everything off the court, on the
court, but when it's time to play, we lock in and we play together. And that's
where our maturity comes in, and games like this prepare us to take on better
challenges. So I would say games and coaching.  
  
CIERA JOHNSON: Obviously our maturity has grown over the year. Considering we
had a loss to Lamar, a lot of people probably thought we couldn't make it to
the Sweet 16 let alone maybe even make the tournament.  
  
So I think that through each game, each game we're continuing to play with
each other more, getting a feel for the game and understanding. We're becoming
smarter, we're becoming better and we're getting older. We have to credit that
to the coaches, as well, but also to us playing as a team and just sticking
together.  
  
Q. Could you see how Chennedy could get in people's heads? Have you seen
that sort of happen over the course of the year?  
GARY BLAIR: I've seen it happen for two straight years. The last game we
played last year against Notre Dame, correct me if I'm wrong, did she have 37
whacks in that game? 31. So I guess I coached her up this one.  
  
The ability to score off of the bounce, I mean, nobody does it better than
her, okay? It was hard getting -- they were walling up, getting her thing, and
she missed a couple of the drives, and she didn't get any reputation calls,
okay. That we didn't get. We had to earn everything we got in there. And it
was a well-called ball game. But she averages about nine free throws a ball
game, and that's when the jump shot goes down and they're making her shoot a
25-footer, I want her to drive the ball. She couldn't drive it so much in the
first half because she already had two fouls, and so sometimes she tries to
make the home run call.  
  
But folks, there's nobody in the game like her doing what she can. She plays
the point and the 2 guard. How about this: She's not even in the top 5 in the
WBCA for point guards this year. She didn't even make the list. How's that?
Unbelievable.  
  
But I'm proud of her. But she is very good with her teammates. That's the
hardest thing. Last year when she was a freshman, it was hard to embrace a
freshman as your best player if you had a veteran team, okay. It would have
been like a stud freshman coming to Notre Dame and taking over for Arike and
Shepard and Turner and all that. It would have been very difficult for Muffet.
It was very difficult for me last year to coach that.  
  
But they love her now. We love her. She loves us. She's very good.  
  
Q. Gary, in that three-minute span in the fourth quarter, it went from
tied to seven-point, what do you feel the difference was in that part?  
GARY BLAIR: The percentage shots. This is the first team, correct me, that has
shot over 50 percent on us all year. Who are you going to stop? The only one
we stopped was Mabrey, and Mabrey wasn't at 100 percent health-wise, but we
were doing a pretty good job. Guess who was guarding Mabrey a lot of the time?
It was Chennedy, okay. And then she gets switched off on Arike, and that's a
nightmare for any of us because Arike is that good.  
  
But the role, the transition baskets, I think they hit four points in a row
and I had to use another time-out, I thought that was the key right there. We
just couldn't stop them from scoring.  
  
Q. Chennedy scored 35, but she needed 34 shots to get there. Was that
just the athleticism and the length of Notre Dame, kind of the game plan --  
GARY BLAIR: That's what a scorer has to do. That's what Kobe Bryant had to do
all his life. He could go 7 for 24 and the Lakers would win. Michael Jordan
had a lot of those games, too. Throw the stats out the window because we were
getting some of the boards and put-backs and everything what she was creating.
She was triple-teamed in there a lot, as well.  
  
So stats, throw out the window. The ability to create your shot and put a team
on your shoulders and be able to handle a miss, there's a lot of kids that
can't handle a miss. She can handle a miss as well as anybody and step back
up, think about the next shot she's going to make. 17 boards, that's the
difference in the ball game.  
  
But here's another thing that you never see in a women's basketball game:
Seven turnovers for us, nine for them. That's damned good basketball. That's
what people are going to tune in to watch in the women's game. That's what
we've got to get to. Great games like that, was well played and well-coached,
and I have a very, very good staff that was working with me, and you look down
at her staff, and her staff is as veteran as ours, even probably even more
veteran.  
  
Q. When you look back over the season now, were there one or two games,
what were the moments when this team grew up to where you could play your best
game tonight?  
GARY BLAIR: Well, we grew up sort of by accident when we lost our second
leading scorer in Carter-Riverside game. Nobody saw, and then all of a sudden
we were playing Oregon State, it was played so late over in Maui, we went out
there and controlled the whole game. And I looked back at my assistants and
said: Maybe we're better than what we thought.  
  
You lose that player and you put a junior college in, you move Chennedy to the
2, who hadn't played it in a year and a half, that's when we grew up. We just
said, what the heck. People didn't expect much. Our goal this year was to
simply get to the NCAA Tournament for the 14th year in a row. That will not be
our goal next year.  
  
We can play with the big girls. We just showed it. And Notre Dame did not play
bad, they played damned good. We played almost damned good (chuckles).  
  
Appreciate the coverage. Write, build our game up. We need y'all as much as
y'all need us. And hopefully all of you are here because you want to be here.
You weren't assigned to this and you had to cover it. You're here because you
want to be in the women's game or covering it. That's what we need. There's a
lot of great stories that are out there. Y'all have fun.

_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: Our team is very excited to be in Chicago, and just what a
beautiful facility. We're thrilled to be playing here, looking forward to our
game tomorrow, and want to thank everyone from DePaul that has worked hard to
make this a great regional. We're really looking forward to our game.  
  
Q. Tara, it's very unusual to have a double-digit seed make it as far as
Missouri State, but what have you noticed about them, the reason behind the
success?  
TARA VANDERVEER: We don't really pay any attention to seeds, and they're a
very accomplished team. A lot of things stand out about their team. First of
all, they probably play more people than any other team, so you've got --
you've got to really study in terms of their personnel. They play a really fun
style of basketball. They move the ball really well offensively, they work
hard at the defensive end.  
  
I don't think they're a complicated team. I mean that in a good way. They
really have an inside game, they have an outside game. They rebound very, very
well. I think it's just something that's going to be a great challenge for our
team, and we're going to have to work very hard.  
  
Q. You've been through a lot of these Sweet 16 scenarios. You've faced a
lot of mid-majors along the way. What is it about a mid-major at this point in
the tournament that makes them dangerous in some ways?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I don't think -- I guess I'm not a label person. I'm not
going to label them a mid-major or a double-digit -- they're a great
basketball team. They're in the Sweet 16 for a reason. You know, they have an
excellent system that they run. Their players play extremely hard. They're
very talented. You know, it's everything that you need to be doing.  
  
So again, we will have our work cut out for us. We're going to have to defend
well, we're going to have to rebound well, and we're going to have to execute
offensively well. I think that they might have more people here than we will.  
  
Q. Tara, when you look at this Regional, three of the four teams here
have won National Championships, two Hall of Fame coaches, another with 700
wins. Is this Regional more loaded than normal, or is this kind of par for the
course?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, when I saw the bracket -- honestly, now every
Regional is pretty loaded. Like you said, this is a really tough bracket that
we're in, and we've had to work really hard so far just beating the teams that
we've beaten to get here.  
  
Looking forward, looking at the three teams that are here besides ourselves,
very accomplished teams, have a lot of tradition.  
  
Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but Missouri State used to be Southwest Missouri
State.  
  
Q. Right.  
TARA VANDERVEER: So we go back to playing in the NCAA Tournament in 1992 with
them. So every team here has a great tradition, has outstanding players. Just
everything that make for a very exciting Regional.  
  
Q. I know you're a huge advocate for female representation in college
athletes and in head coaching positions, but across women's college basketball
there seems to be a lack of diversity in those head coaching roles. What do
you think needs to change in order for that to happen?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Excellent question. I think whether it's women's basketball,
coaching college athletics, let's look at who's playing the sport and help
through a mentoring and develop a pipeline for young women to get into college
coaching, let's say.  
  
One of the things -- I think we could talk about it, but one of the things,
I'm working with the Women's Sports Foundation to create a fund that would
provide for hopefully 10 -- and not just in basketball, but hopefully there
will be at least five in basketball -- internships for young women that maybe
play professionally or play in college and want to go into coaching. Through
the WBCA there's the So You Want to Be a Coach program, or they call it the
"So" program. So there are programs in place, whether it's the NCAA, the
Women's Sports Foundation, but I hope that other head coaches that feel the
importance of mentoring and developing women maybe would contribute to the
Women's Sports Foundation fund and let people know about the opportunities
that are out there so that future players and former players can become future
coaches.  
  
Q. Is there anything over the last few days you've wanted your girls to
improve upon after your first weekend in the tournament? What have you been
focusing on?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, I hope -- I'm always on them, and for the women on our
team, I would just say that probably just to -- in our BYU game, I think that
we kind of didn't play 40 minutes, whether it's taking care of the ball,
taking good shots. We're not just saying, Wow, we're here, we're just going to
keep playing. We're always looking at ways to improve. And specifically
getting ready for Missouri State, I think you really have to do it all. You
have to play really locked-in defense. You'd better rebound. You'd better play
transition defense. You've got to take care of the ball against their traps
and their defense.  
  
You know, without -- I mean, without specific game plan things, it's always
trying to up your game, always trying to improve shot selection, always trying
to improve -- our free-throw percentage was abysmal, so that might be one
place to start. But I have a list.  
  
Q. Alanna, who are the players on this team that you guys feel are
dangerous, on the Missouri State side?  
ALANNA SMITH: I think what Missouri State does really well is that they play a
lot of people, which can be difficult to guard because you have to know
tendencies of eight-plus people. But we know that we're particularly aware of
No. 1 and No. 22 and their shooting ability and their ability to shoot the
ball off the dribble, too. But I think for us it's knowing tendencies of all
players that get court time, yeah.  
  
Q. Kiana, is there something magical about making it to the Sweet 16,
and you guys seem to do it year in and year out? Tell us what makes this year
different.  
KIANA WILLIAMS: We just get along really well. We love playing with each
other. Our seniors, they've been great leaders, so just playing hard for them.
We do not want to stop playing with them. So yeah, we get along really well.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I think what Kiana said is really important. We have
really good chemistry. And I think every time we've been -- this is the fourth
time I've been to the Sweet 16, and every time it's really special. Every
other team who's not here wants to be here, and I think it's really important
to acknowledge that and acknowledge that we're one of 16 teams that are still
playing, still practicing.  
  
So yeah, I think every time you're able to make the Sweet 16, it's special.  
  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: Yeah, I'd agree with both of them. I'd just say that we
just feel that we have something special with this team, and when you have
that, you never want to stop playing with each other. We're going to do
everything that we can to make sure that Alanna's last game is a win.  
  
Q. You guys have obviously all made the Sweet 16 each year, but DiJonai,
do you remember your first experience with the Sweet 16? For your opponents,
every one of them has never played in a venue like this. What do you remember
about your first Sweet 16 experience, and how has that kind of gotten you
ready for these moments?  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: I'd say, I mean, absolutely I do remember it. That was an
incredible team, also, and I think just being in the moment, because you know
that you'll never have that same moment with that same group of people ever
again, and so to just cherish every second that you had, or have, together.  
  
And I think it's just staying calm. There's a lot of obviously lights and
cameras, and there could be a lot of pressure, but just remembering that it's
still the same ball, the same basket, and reminding yourself that you know how
to play basketball, you've played 30 some games, so it's nothing different.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
CHICAGO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+CHICAGO)

  

## March 29, 2019

  

### [Muffet McGraw](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14071)

### [Jessica Shepard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32622)

### [Brianna Turner](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28843)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
Q. Years since you've played Chennedy Carter. What growth do you see
from her, and do you maybe guard her a different way or the same way?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I don't think there is a way to guard her. She is almost
unstoppable. She's had a great year. She's played well in the first two rounds
of the NCAA Tournament. She had, I thought, a fantastic season with them
losing some other players around her. I didn't think they would do as well as
they did. I think they really overachieved. I think Gary has done a really
good job to get them back to this spot.  
  
Yeah, we don't have an answer. We've tried a lot of different things at
practice; honestly, none of them really looked good.  
  
I think her game has improved, and the fact that she gave up the ball to allow
the three-point shot to win the game against Marquette, I think it was
Washington, and I think that shows, I think, tremendous maturity in her game.
I think that last year she probably would have shot that.  
  
Q. You mentioned last weekend that Marina is somebody that thrives on
practice reps. Has she been able to go full throttle this week? And if you
could give an update on everybody else, if they're all healthy and
available.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I wouldn't say she was 100 percent this week. She's able
to get a lot of shots up, but as far as up and down, not quite as much as we
would like.  
  
Q. Playing in Chicago, so close, how much of a home court or home field
advantage do you feel that is?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I mean, it's not like playing in the Purcell Pavilion, where we
would have packed it. It's great. We've got at least eight buses coming up,
plus the fans that are already in Chicago. We do hope it's a very pro-Irish
crowd.  
  
Q. Coach, could you talk about -- you scored 92 and 91 points in the
first two rounds of the tournament, but I thought the defense might have been
just as impressive, and it seems like the maturity of this team has more to do
with just the offense, but the defense was fantastic.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, I've been pleased with the defense generally. I think in
the last two games, we've done some good things. I think we are growing as a
defensive team. I think we're understanding the importance of it. We've worked
pretty hard on it in practice, and hopefully we will continue to improve.  
  
Q. How different is it this year going through the tournament as the
defending champion? And is there an extra burden that comes with that? Is
there just a different approach to it all? Or is there maybe more calmness
knowing that you've won it all and the players have been there?  
MUFFET McGRAW: I think it was a lot more fun last year. Only looking back, of
course, going through it was not fun. You know what, I think it has been
different this year with the target on our back. I think we did shoot
ourselves in the foot a couple of times throughout the season to not be sure
we were going to come out with a No. 1 seed at the end. I think we definitely
earned our way to play close to home, and I was really proud of that.  
  
But it is a little different, I think, when people expect you to win. Last
year no one really expected us to do much with the six players we were
playing.  
  
I think for the team, it's business as usual. I think probably I feel it a
little more than they do. But there definitely is a great sense of confidence
knowing we've been here before, we've won these types of games before, and we
certainly are capable of doing it again.  
  
Q. It's not often that you get rematches in the Regional semifinals, but
is there any difference compared to last year from Texas A &M, especially from
a scouting standpoint?  
MUFFET McGRAW: You know, I think the focus of our scout has been on Carter. So
it's pretty similar to what it was last year. I think we're expecting a lot of
similar things from them.  
  
Q. I wonder if we could get your comments about Holly let go. I you know
you played Tennessee, and just your thoughts on that.  
MUFFET McGRAW: I was very disappointed. I love Holly. I think that what she's
given to Tennessee for as many years as she's been there, she's a class act.
She does things the right way. She does things with integrity. She's
represented their program extremely well for the past 38 years, and I think
the legacy that Pat brought to Tennessee I hope will continue with another
woman at the helm.  
  
Q. Just wanted to ask about Texas A &M's defense. They have some good
numbers on that side of the court, obviously, as well.  
MUFFET McGRAW: Yeah, yeah, they do. They do a lot of different things. They
play a match-up, they have some zone, they have some man. They mix it up
really well, so it's going to be, I think, a challenge for us just to come out
and figure out exactly how we want to attack them.  
  
Q. Brianna, can you talk about Chennedy Carter, A &M guard? You've faced
a lot of great guards in the ACC; does she remind you of any guards you've
played?  
BRIANNA TURNER: She's definitely an elite scorer, guard. Maybe somewhat
reminds me of like Asia Durr. She can get to the basket. She can hit the
three. She really gets their team going. So we know there's going to be a lot
of offense run through her tomorrow.  
  
Q. Jessica, this game is just a few miles down the road from you guys'
home campus. How much different is playing a big time game virtually at home,
how much of a difference does that make?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think we have the best fans in the country, and we know
they're going to travel wherever we are, so just to be close enough that they
can just kind of drive down the road, it'll definitely be nice to see a lot of
green tomorrow.  
  
Q. For each of you, I know it's wonderful if everybody can be at full
health all the time, but Marina said today that she doesn't feel full
throttle. How important is she to what you guys run?  
BRIANNA TURNER: She's a significant part to our team offensively and
defensively, how she can stretch the floor out for us. When she's outside
shooting her shot, me and Jess know we're going to be open inside because the
other team have to get out for her.  
  
But she's a tremendous part of our team, whether it's helping the
underclassmen, leading us on defense, leading us in the locker room. We always
need her there for us.  
  
JESSICA SHEPARD: Obviously Marina is a leader, being a senior, and I think she
brings a lot of energy for us. And obviously, like Bri said, she's a great
basketball player. But I know that she's going to do whatever it takes for the
team to win, and you can always count on Marina.  
  
Q. Jessica, what challenges do Johnson and Jones bring to you, two
inside players from A &M?  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think we know Texas A&M is a good team all around. We know
that it's going to be a game that comes down to possessions. So obviously
they're two great post players, and it'll just be important that we come out
and execute the game plan.  
  
Q. Ladies, could you talk about the evolution of your relationship on
the floor, keeping in mind last year Brianna was with the team, but when they
would play -- you came in from Nebraska last year, so you never had a chance
to play together last year, and yet the evolution of your relationship on the
court has been fantastic, and I think most of the assists that each one of you
have gone to the other player inside. It's become a pretty nice bond.  
JESSICA SHEPARD: I think obviously Bri is a great player, and it's fun just to
watch her play. You can kind the throw the all go get it. I think as the
season has gone on, we've just gotten a lot more comfortable playing with each
other, just knowing where to pass the ball, when to pass the ball, and it's
been a lot of fun.  
  
BRIANNA TURNER: Yeah, I think it comes a lot from practicing over the past
like six, seven, eight months, and Coach emphasizes it a lot in practice, so
it's something we're always looking for in the games, as well.

## March 29, 2019

  

### [Kellie Harper](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30789)

### [Brice Calip](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37108)

### [Danielle Gitzen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37110)

  
_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, we're excited to be here. There's no doubt. I've had a
lot of folks send me messages and say, Enjoy the moment, and you just don't
have to worry about that because we are going to do it. We're going to enjoy
every part of this. We're going to come over here and we're going to compete
and we're going to play hard and let what happens happen, and just enjoy this
ride.  
  
Q. Coach, as you look at Stanford, what kind of challenges do they
present your team with, and what worries you most?  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, Stanford is really good, first of all. Their size, their
ability to pass, read the defense, cut, see the floor, rebound. And then just
their length defensively. I think all that can give you problems. I mean, just
watching them. They're a fun team to watch. I would assume that translates
into not a fun team to play. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Do you feel like you guys have the same confidence you guys have been
able to have the last few games?  
KELLIE HARPER: You know, when we go out there on the court, I think we'll find
out where our confidence level is. But we've done nothing different, so I
would have no reason to believe our team would step out on the court with a
different mindset and a different attitude. We've just been playing with a lot
of confidence, like I said earlier, enjoying the moment, enjoying playing
basketball together, and hopefully that's where we'll be.  
  
Q. You've talked about how the locker room was how you guys -- the
locker room after the Gonzaga game you just had the feeling that your team was
going to turn it around. Have you thought back to that when you guys were 1
and 7 and how special that locker room was after that?  
KELLIE HARPER: I think where we're at now has given me opportunity to reflect
back on the season, period, and we have talked a lot about that Gonzaga game
being a turning point for us. The locker room after the game, it wasn't mad,
it wasn't sad, but it was just a determined group of young women that knew
they could do it. And I think that's when we really turned the corner and made
a strong push.  
  
It gave us a lot of confidence. I don't know that I've ever been a part of a
loss that gave us so much confidence in my coaching career, so that was
something really special and unique.  
  
But yeah, you know, we've reflected back on the season quite a bit here
recently.  
  
Q. Just wanted to talk about these last three weeks, what have they
meant to you and the program as you represent Missouri State and something
that you've set out to do when you got this job some years ago?  
KELLIE HARPER: The last three weeks have been nothing short of amazing. It's
been so much fun. It's been very gratifying. It's been an opportunity for us
to just be proud, you know, be proud of what we've been able to do at Missouri
State.  
  
I think probably more than anything, I have enjoyed watching our team and
watching our players just go through all these moments, and to see them with
the biggest smiles on their faces and just loving life and loving each other
and loving basketball. It's just been very rewarding as a coach to see all of
their hard work and all of their beliefs pay off in a big way.  
  
Q. I'm sorry about the awkwardness of this next question, but I'm sure
you knew this was coming. What has the University of Tennessee meant to your
development and what does it mean to be mentioned in connection with that
opening?  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, the first part of that, being a former player for the
University of Tennessee is something very special. Having the opportunities
that I had at Tennessee were amazing and loved all my time there. Obviously
having the opportunity to play for Pat Summitt was incredibly special, very
unique, and I'm one of a really small special group that had an opportunity to
do that.  
  
You know, I know every year there's going to be speculation. This is the world
we live. This time every year people start talking about job changes, and
names get thrown out there. But the way I've looked at this, this moment right
now, I just don't think my team deserves that. They have done something so
special, and there's so much excitement about our program, that's where I want
to keep the attention.  
  
Q. You get those moments before every game with your kids that you guys
are just standing out there. How much does it mean to you to spend those
moments with them and just to have -- and your whole family, just being able
to do all this together?  
KELLIE HARPER: You know, it's really special to be able to share this with our
family. Kiley is not quite big enough yet, but Jackson is, and he feels like
these players are his sisters. He really does. They're having impactful
moments on his life, and I'm so happy that we have the kind of players we
have, the character that they have, that he gets to be around those type
people.  
  
You know, for me before big games, he's there. It just brings some normalcy to
life, you know, in the crazy world that we live in. And it really puts things
in perspective for you.  
  
But I have loved, loved sharing all these moments with our children and with
Jon and my mom. It's just been a very close, close group.  
  
Q. When you talk to people or when you talk to the girls, they're always
talking the family culture, the family culture about your team and what you've
been able to do. How much have you kind of -- how much have you noticed that?
How hard was it to build a family culture around a program?  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, I think a lot of teams feel like it's a family. I think
close teams feel that way. We're very unique in that my husband is on staff,
so building a family atmosphere is probably not as hard for us since we're
already married and we work together. All we have to do is sprinkle in the
kids on the back of the bus and it's a family affair, you know.  
  
It's really unique, but I think it's been good for our team to be able to see
us in a different light, you know, to -- and then it's been great for our
family for sure.  
  
Q. The message recently has been that your best is good enough. Does
that message get tougher for them to believe as every opponent is higher
ranked and bigger and better?  
KELLIE HARPER: Well, you know, this is just a unique group. This is a special
group. They're going to go out and give it their best, and that's all we're
asking. And that is good enough. It really is.  
  
I think that you're right, that's been our message, and I don't think there's
any reason for us to change our message now.  
  
Q. Danielle, can you just kind of talk about the family atmosphere
around the team, just being around them all the time?  
DANIELLE GITZEN: Yeah, I think it's kind of inevitable just because we are
basically around each other 24/7, but having a family atmosphere is definitely
an amazing feeling. When I stepped foot on the Missouri State campus, I
instantly felt like I have known these girls my whole life. So that was a huge
reason I went to Missouri State.  
  
So from the coaches to every one of my teammates it's like a family. We get to
be around Jackson and Kiley, so that's definitely really nice. And then, I
don't know, we can like bicker every once in a while, but at the end of the
day we love each other and we know we have each other's backs, so it's
definitely a good feeling to have.  
  
Q. You've been here for four years, so you've been here four out of
Jackson's five years. How much have you seen him grow since being here?  
DANIELLE GITZEN: Yeah, when I first came down to Missouri State on one of my
visits, I remember I was sitting in the back of Kellie and Jon's car, and he
was a baby. He was just staring at me, giving me like the stink face. I was
like, What is going on? This kid is like not even one year old and he already
doesn't like me.  
  
But now he's definitely grown up, and it's just fun being around him and
seeing him as he's getting older and learning. And yeah, it's fun to watch him
grow up.  
  
Q. Brice, Kellie has talked a couple times about the locker room after
the Gonzaga game and how she just walked in there and felt like you guys were
ready to turn things around. What do you remember from that locker room, and
can you just kind of put us in there?  
BRICE CALIP: I just remember that it was such a close game, and we personally
thought we lost the game on our own mistakes. They played very well, played
their game, as well, and I just think everybody knew at that moment that we
have something good here. We can achieve so many things after postseason, and
here we are.  
  
Q. Brice, you're kind of the hoops junkie on the team. How do you get
over playing a name team now as opposed to some of the Valley schools you've
been playing?  
BRICE CALIP: I think it's a huge accomplishment for our program, and just
knowing that we're playing the best of the best at this point, and just
knowing we're not going to change our game plan and they're going to come at
us hard because they've been here, and we're going to come right back at them.  
  
Q. Alexa, why is it you've been able to step up your game in the
postseason now?  
ALEXA WILLARD: I just think it's really just having trust in my teammates and
in my coaches. They've always told me even when I'm not playing good that they
have my back and to keep shooting, and I just think a lot of that comes from
knowing that if they have confidence in me, then I should, too, and I think we
just all kind of rely on each other.  
  
Q. As the saying goes, Sweet 16 and never been dancing on this floor.
How does that work with the psyche being the Cinderella team?  
ALEXA WILLARD: I'd say just -- I mean, I think we're just going to go out
here, and I know it's a big -- it's a really big goal for us to be in the
Sweet 16, but I think at the end of the day, we're just going out there and
having fun. We're treating it like we're going dancing. We don't really care
about whoever we're playing, we're just going to focus on ourselves and just
to make sure at the end of the day we're going to be proud of what we did out
there and just be proud of ourselves.  
  
DANIELLE GITZEN: Yeah, I mean, personally I wouldn't mind having nice glass
slippers. I think Brice might want a glass Jordan. But other than that, kind
of like what Alexa said, people can say what they want, media can say what
they want, but we're kind of just focused on ourselves and what we can do,
what we can bring to the court, and just playing Lady Bear basketball.  
  
BRICE CALIP: Also repeating that, yeah, a Jordan would be nice. But just
knowing that we made it here, just proving everyone wrong one game at a time,
that's how we're taking it. Whether we get to the next round or not, we're
just going to play our game, play hard and just be focused.  
  
Q. What are Kellie's strengths as a coach, and how much has her guidance
helped you guys in this run to this point?  
ALEXA WILLARD: I'd say one of her strengths is that she always has us really
prepared. I think I can walk out there confident knowing that I know all I
need to know about the team we're playing, and just she -- everybody on the
staff complements each other nicely. And also I think she always has
confidence, and I think we feed off that, knowing that if she's confident, we
should be confident, too.  
  
DANIELLE GITZEN: Going along with what Alexa said, I think our coaching staff
does a nice job complementing each other, and their preparation is great for
us, and they all this confidence in what we can do and our abilities.  
  
I think it's also nice having Kellie who played at such a high level, she's
been in our shoes, and so we kind of can take that and use that to, I guess,
our advantage. And if we have questions, if we need advice, she kind of -- she
can help us out in that aspect and give us -- she knows the perspective of
like a student-athlete, and so that's definitely a strength I think she has,
as well.  
  
BRICE CALIP: Everyone on our coaching staff has either played or coached in
the NCAA Tournament, so I think that's a big advantage for us. And for them to
give us their knowledge that they know on both perspectives, on coaching and
playing, so I think that's really good for us and will give us some momentum.  
  
Q. For any of you guys, have you kind of embraced that Cinderella
role?  
DANIELLE GITZEN: I mean, yeah, I guess. Growing up, I mean, I watched March
Madness, NCAA Tournament, and I'd say I always root for the underdog. I think
it's fun to root for the underdog. But I mean, yeah, it's kind of fun. It's
fun to go in and, yes, we believe in ourselves and we believe that we can win
and we can do it, but then showing other people like, hey, watch out for
Missouri State because they can hang with the best. It's definitely fun
surprising people.  
  
ALEXA WILLARD: Yeah, I just have to piggyback off of what she said. I think
it's cool for us to go in there with a chip on our shoulder like we know what
we're made of and it's time to show other people, too.  
  
BRICE CALIP: Honestly this whole thing hasn't even really hit me yet. It will
tomorrow definitely, but I just think -- I mean, we're no underdog. We've
played the best of the best in non-conference, have lost by a few points, so I
think we belong here.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
CHICAGO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+CHICAGO)

  

## March 29, 2019

### [Kayla Wells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36634)

_Chicago, Illinois_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Blair, we'll go ahead and start with an opening
statement, please.  
  
GARY BLAIR: First, it's good to be back in Chicago. Got a lot of friends here,
a lot of good memories here, and Gibsons last night was as good as it always
is. But we're just glad to still be playing.  
  
The four teams that are here, we all have histories with each other. It could
start back with Tara in '98 when I was at Arkansas, and that was when a 16
beat a 1. And then we went ahead and beat Harvard to go ahead and win that
first two rounds, and then we won the next two rounds and got to the Final
Four, a Cinderella, and who did we have to see? Kellie Harper, who's the coach
on the best Tennessee team that they've ever had, by far, the best team, with
the "Three Meeks" and Kellie Harper. It's like saying, who was the 5 player on
the Chicago Bulls team? I can't remember, I just remember everybody else, and
that's who it was. But I remember the Meeks.  
  
Muffet, we had a great National Championship game, 2011, and I'm sure Stanford
thinks they should have won it that year, Baylor thinks they should have won
it that year, and Notre Dame thinks they should have won it that year. So all
three teams that we might possibly face here I have so much respect for.  
  
What Kellie has been able to do as a young coach going into the game and
making about three stops along the way, I think she's on her way to being the
next Muffet or the next Pat or the next somebody that's in the higher
echelons. They're going to have a hard time keeping her at Missouri State
because I think she's that good.  
  
So my team is happy to be here. We're as healthy as we've always been, except
I've still got Jackson out with a shoulder, my best defensive guard off the
bench, and she's been out for about five weeks now. She will not play this
weekend, and of course Aaliyah Wilson, who did the ACL in Maui.  
  
Other than that, we're healthy. We've been productive this year, and I think
we've overcome adversity and good play and bad play as well as any team I've
ever coached.  
  
Are we as good as last year? Not as far as talent, but as far as result, yes.
Is Notre Dame as good as they were last year? Yes, and they're better. They're
better than they were last year.  
  
So I'm excited to have that opportunity. We had it in 2011, but we were not
Cinderella then. We were a top 10 team the whole year, and we beat the best
team in the country, Baylor. Well, in that little run we faced five straight
Hall of Fame coaches: Vivian Stringer first, Andy Landers second, Kim Mulkey
third, Tara VanDerveer, and then Muffet. I'm as proud of that as winning those
ballgames, going against people that I respect in the profession. And each
year there's something new to face, and I've faced Muffet twice since that
2011, and she beat me twice in two pretty close ballgames.  
  
All we want is one more opportunity. But Notre Dame is a better basketball
team than they were last year when they won the National Championship.  
  
Questions?  
  
Q. Coach, Chennedy had 30-point game last game against Marquette, but
one thing that stood out was not even her shooting but her passing for the
game-winning shot. How does that show your versatility?  
GARY BLAIR: Her versatility, plus the nine rebounds she got in the ballgame.
That's what's making her a complete player. Her defense was outstanding in
that ballgame. We didn't talk about defense last year with her. That wasn't
very pretty. But defense, when she's hooked up and playing it well, and Coach
Starkey's system is very good. Her passing ability, she enjoys the pass as
much as the score.  
  
Being in Chicago, y'all should understand what a good pass is, when Michael
Jordan passed it to Steve Kerr and hit the shot. Great players will do that.
Players with an eye in their forehead would have shot the ball themselves, but
she trusted our little point guard who had only had 11 threes the whole year,
but she was two out of three in that particular ball game. She trusted her,
and it worked out. So give both of them a lot of credit.  
  
Q. Gary, you when you look at Notre Dame lost to North Carolina in
Miami, were there any common denominators in those games that helped the fact
that Notre Dame last those games?  
GARY BLAIR: They were both on the road. The road is an equalizer. It doesn't
matter who you're playing. Things happen on the road. That's all you've got to
do is look at sometimes the betting lines in the NBA games, and you say, my
God, how can that be right? They're on the road.  
  
Miami is a very good ballclub. North Carolina has been a pretty good ballclub
in the past, and at certain times this year, but Miami is a very good
ballclub.  
  
Sometimes you think your team is ready, and all of a sudden you face somebody
and the other team gets some momentum going, and that's why you try to stop
that, particularly in the NCAA Tournament. There's not as many upsets in the
NCAA Tournament as there used to be. I think both on the men's side and the
women's side.  
  
Now, there's always -- I think there's four in the Sweet 16 here on the
women's side that were upsets, and I don't think you're going to see much
more. Those top seven or eight teams that are on the women's side, they've
done it all year long. And the coaches are too good and the tradition is too
good. You're really going to have to have your A game if you're going to be
able to upset one of those top seven.  
  
We're glad to be here. It's going to be a good tournament, and you've got four
possible winners, not just one here.  
  
Q. Chennedy, you had a 30-point game the other night against Marquette.
Obviously the one play that stood out was that pass late in the game for the
game winner. Gary was talking about how your versatility has been on another
level and how your defense has improved. Talk to me about how that's been the
case this season.  
CHENNEDY CARTER: The pass or defense?  
  
Q. Defense, sorry.  
CHENNEDY CARTER: It's just one of the things I'm starting to take pride in.
Coach Starkey emphasizes a lot of things on defense, and I really just try to
set the tone for my team, and they just get out there and try and guard the
best player and get stops.  
  
Q. Chennedy, just what does it mean to get another crack at Notre
Dame?  
CHENNEDY CARTER: It means a lot. Bittersweet end to last year. Didn't really
accomplish the things we wanted to. But for us all to get another chance, and
me to really get out there and be with my teammates, I'm really excited. Notre
Dame is a great team filled with a bunch of great guards, so I'm ready to test
my game, and I'm sure my teammates are ready to play, as well.  
  
Q. Kind of along those lines, is there kind of an extra chip on your
shoulder from last year and just getting the chance to knock off the team that
beat you?  
CHENNEDY CARTER: For me?  
  
Q. Yeah, for all three.  
CHENNEDY CARTER: No, not necessarily. I see the growth in our team, and I'm
just really ready to play. I don't feel like it's a revenge game, I don't feel
like it's anything like that. It's me competing to get to the Elite Eight. And
Notre Dame is in our way, and the biggest thing for me is to make sure our
team is ready to go out there and play.  
  
CIERA JOHNSON: I guess just we have nothing to lose in this situation. There's
really no pressure on us because no one expects us to do anything, so we're
just -- it's another game for us, and we're playing a very great Notre Dame
team, so we've just got to come out, play hard and play together, and we'll be
all right.  
  
KAYLA WELLS: Just to piggyback on what Ciera just said, just the same thing.
We just need to go out there, just play hard and play together and follow our
game plan.  
  
Q. A couple days ago football coach Jimbo Fisher gave you guys a
motivational speech. What were some of the things you were able to take away
from that going into the game tomorrow?  
CHENNEDY CARTER: The biggest thing I took away was just to be tough. When
you're on the road and things are most likely not in your favor, you have to
be tough and you have to have determination and push through tough times.  
  
I know when we play Notre Dame, we'll face a lot of adversity. There will be
runs. They'll go up, we'll go up. It'll probably come down to the last minute
of the game. And he just said you have to have grit, determination and push-
through. That's the biggest thing I took away from that.  
  
CIERA JOHNSON: I took away he said do your job. And I think that's the key in
basketball. Everyone needs to know their role and just go out -- Kayla might
be scoring, so the rest of us need to find a way to get her the ball, grab
offensive rebounds. So it's not always about scoring but what's your role on
the team.  
  
KAYLA WELLS: He said that we shouldn't go out there -- we shouldn't play to
win, we should just play, just play hard. Don't worry about winning because in
big games like this, if you worry about winning, that's when you start to
choke, that's when you start to mess up. So we just need to worry about
playing at this point.  
  
Q. Ciera, talk about going against Shepard. Does she remind you of
anyone, and what's going to be the key there?  
CIERA JOHNSON: She's her own player. She's very good. She's very quick.
Offensively she has a nice face-up game. She's very physical. I've been
watching film of her. So she's very good. I think she's her own player in her
own right. I don't think I will be guarding a player like her like I have in
the SEC. But I credit her, she's very good. Very good.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Baylor 85, Iowa 53  
  
THE MODERATOR: Opening statement?  
  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I haven't done it in 19 years and I'm going to pass again.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thought I'd give you a chance, Coach.  
  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Thank you.  
  
Q. Now that you're there going to the Final Four, just your immediate
thoughts after the game is over when you were celebrating?  
KALANI BROWN: I don't know, I was just overwhelmed, excited, just happy. We
were just hugging each other. I wasn't thinking about anything, honestly.  
  
CHLOE JACKSON: I just felt extremely blessed. It was a surreal feeling. Just a
lot of excitement.  
  
Q. Just how much motivation was there going up inside against Megan
Gustafson, and just tell me about your defensive effort, I think about 31
percent from the field they shot, and y'all rebounded them by a lot, also.  
LAUREN COX: It was a team effort. Kalani obviously started on her and I was
playing on her some, too. We just tried to limit her touches and do whatever
she could. I mean, she's a good player. She's going to get her points, and we
just couldn't let that second and third player go off for them.  
  
KALANI BROWN: Piggybacking off what she said, Megan is real crafty with the
ball. Very talented player.  
  
We just took turns on her, you know, you guard her for a possession and I'll
guard her for a possession, but she's a great player.  
  
Q. Another really great game for you, if it hadn't been or Saturday,
this would have been your highest-scoring game. Did you expect a weekend like
this coming, and was this anything different that happened or did things just
click?  
DIDI RICHARDS: It's not something you expect, just something that kind of
comes, I guess. But without my teammates I would not be able to do what I do,
because without the -- without the attention they get in the inside, I
wouldn't be so wide open under.  
  
Q. They hit seven three-points the other day. They are a pretty good
three-point shooting team. Talk about y'all's defense and how you were able to
stay out there on them?  
DIDI RICHARDS: You know, we're kind of known for our defense, I would say, so
we didn't do anything different. We just stayed outside and guarded them like
we normally guard because most teams shoot threes on us, so it's something
we're used to, I would say.  
  
CHLOE JACKSON: Yeah, piggybacking off of her, we just stuck to our defenses --
defensive play, and just played the same defense we always do. Yeah, we played
against a lot of three-point shooting teams before, so it was nothing that we
hadn't seen.  
  
Q. You did a whole lot of things well in both games, and therefore, were
the most outstanding player. Just your thoughts and were you especially
active, did you feel like in the last two games?  
LAUREN COX: I think I was pretty active, but I mean, I think I've been doing a
little bit of everything throughout the season, and I mean, it could have been
any one of us, MVP, and it's just a blessing and I'm just excited.  
  
Q. For any player that wants it, you guys have won all four games in
this tournament by 25 points each, average margin of victory, 38 points. What
are you learning about yourselves with all those blowouts?  
LAUREN COX: We're just learning that we're determined to make our Final goal,
which we did, to make it to Tampa, and now win a National Championship. I
think it says a lot about our defense and the way that we score the ball.
We're getting up and we're not letting people get back into the game.  
  
KALANI BROWN: Also that we have a lot of weapons, you know, not just coming
from the paint but on the perimeter.  
  
Didi shocked the world, so you know, and the depth of the bench, as well.  
  
CHLOE JACKSON: I agree with LC, yeah.  
  
Q. This was it for you. You have two more to go, maybe one or two more
to go. Did you ever doubt you would enjoy this moment and was there
frustration along the way? Does it make it more sweet that you get there
now?  
KALANI BROWN: Definitely frustration along the way, but it's all paid off for
now. Finally check out the Final Four off my checklist.  
  
Q. Kind of the same question I asked Kalani and Chloe, but how excited
are you for those seniors to be going to the Final Four? You've been talking
about it for a while now?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Certainly, you start with seniors. I am so happy for those
seniors. I am so happy for those players, and I'm happy for Baylor University.
I'm happy for Baylor University. Plaster that on the front page of every
national newspaper. It doesn't get any more positive than this.  
  
Q. As you're winning this game, the game is finishing, were there any
thoughts to some of the players that came before them that maybe didn't make
it?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Absolutely. What you want for every kid you coach, when they
come there, they want to come to win championships. They want to come to win
Big 12 championships, and we've won 20 of those.  
  
But some of those great players missed out on a chance to go to at least one,
and for that, as a coach, you always think about them. But I will always tell
you this: They are a part of this. I think to that first group I coached in
the very first NCAA Tournament, we were in Cameron indoor (ph) but we got
there. We took a program that had won seven games prior to us getting there
and we went to the NCAA Tournament. They are a part of every bit of this.
That's what makes this special is because even though they physically may not
have been able to get there themselves, truly, we're all a part of the
program. They are all a part of it.  
  
Q. Given the margin of victory y'all have enjoyed in every game so far
this tournament, how do you go about preparing the team for a situation where
they might have a little closer score a little late in the game in a more
high-leverage situation?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: First of all, you go against each other. I've got the No. 1
recruiting class in the country sitting over there not getting as many minutes
as probably they would at other schools, so there's nothing greater than to
watch them go every day against Kalani and Cox and the battles that are fought
in that practice.  
  
I think practice prepares you for the games. If you're your practices can be
harder than games, then we're doing something right, and they get after it.
They are as competitive against each other, but then when we go play games,
they are pulling for each other. Our practices are intense.  
  
The second thing I want to give credit to is our Dream Team. You have a bunch
of guys at Baylor that volunteer and go through the entire NCAA certification
process and they come out there and they help us prepare. This is for those
guys, as well.  
  
Q. That defense prevailed again tonight. Is that the core of your team,
or was it tonight?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I liked your article and I agree with you. Texas Tech again
get after you, too, defensively.  
  
It has to be, Chad, because we don't know that we're going to score this many
points every night. What we do know is we can defend you and we're going to
give everything we have on the defensive end of the floor. That's the way I
was taught and that's the way I believe, and all these high-octane offenses
now, nobody wants to believe post game is effective any more; I do.  
  
But I also go back to old school basketball, is that -- think about it. Nobody
likes to be guarded for 40 minutes. It's work. It's hard. And that's why you
look at a kid like Didi Richards, who is our defensive stopper, and what she
sacrifices on the offensive end, you're seeing her be a big contributor for
us.  
  
So let me say this about Iowa -- I want to say Iowa State because they are in
our league. But what a great year Iowa had. What a great player Gustafson is.
Just classy. Their comments were classy all the last two days. They had a
tremendous year.  
  
And I've been in that locker room on the losing end, so my heart goes out to
them, as well.  
  
Any more questions?  
  
Q. You said Didi has done this before, but she has not scored this many
points before. Is it a matter of her being more aggressive or what clicked
with her?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, transition for one thing. Offensive rebounding the
second thing, and thirdly, she and those post players just have to going on
right now that they find her.  
  
Sometimes Cox and those guys will look for her too much because if you watch
film on us, people tend to not guard her. They think she's the least offensive
threat that we have, so instead of being a liability on the offensive end, we
have helped her figure out how to be effective and not be a liability and not
take her man and go double on the post as much as they were earlier in the
season.  
  
Q. I love your orange.  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Thank you.  
  
Q. The talk going in about was about the battle in the post. You scored
25 more points in the paint. Do you feel like you sent a message tonight?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I don't know that there's any message. This is who we are.
Y'all just haven't seen us play in person. This is our basketball team. I have
two of the greatest post players in the country, and they are so unselfish and
wanted it to play together, and there's no message to be sent. I have said
from day one, it's all about championships, and when I can recruit kids and
parents who still believe in team first, and not stats, and we -- you know,
those kids don't care. Kalani just wanted to get to a Final Four. You know,
it's a joy to coach and be around kids and parents who honestly just want
their kids to experience what it's all about and it's about championships,
Final Fours and those types of things.  
  
Lauren Cox, Most Outstanding Player. If you would have asked me, I couldn't
take just one, usually I can pick just one Lauren Cox was the No. 1 player in
the country coming out of high school -- Notre Dame and more. And the thing
that is so impressive about Lauren Cox is we had like four or five post
players that she had to come in and play with as a freshman. But it didn't
scare her. It didn't scare her. I mean, we had Nina Davis, KK, Kalani was
there, the list goes on. And that kid's self-confidence was the most
impressive thing to me. It's like, "That doesn't scare me, Coach, my time will
come and I will work until you have to play me."  
  
The second thing about Lauren Cox is, at her size, she can honestly play any
position on that floor. If I got in foul trouble and had no guard to bring it
up the floor, I would look at her and say, you go get the ball. She can do it.
She can defend any position on that floor. And she's got a little oomph in
her. She's going to guard you and get you. It's funny because the freshmen
post players will watch and I'll be down there watching her and if someone
hits Lauren hard and she thinks it was a cheap shot or the referee made a bad
call, she will go, oh, who are we going to get in the other end. That's the
competitor in that child.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
GREENSBORO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+GREENSBORO)

  

## April 1, 2019

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Tania Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36943)

### [Megan Gustafson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32141)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Baylor 85, Iowa 53  
  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Baylor was just obviously too much for us today. I told the
team that I'm not going to define our season by the last 40 minutes. I don't
think we played our best game. Did Baylor have something to do with it?
Absolutely. But I just wish that we could have shown a little bit more of Iowa
Basketball.  
  
But I'm not going to -- I'm going to try not to remember this game. To me, I'm
going to remember cutting down the Nets with these guys after winning a Big
Ten Championship. I'm going to remember Tania's results coming back. I'm going
to remember Hannah Stewart's journey. I'm going to remember getting the
opportunity to coach one of the best basketball players in America in Megan,
and that's what I'm going to remember about this season. I'm going to remember
the relationships and just the -- the great memories with these young ladies.  
  
So I'm very, very fortunate and very blessed to coach them (tearing up).  
  
Q. They kept you off of the offensive glass and they kept you without a
rebound in the second half. What did they do to bother you on the boards
tonight?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, they were just throwing, you know, extra people at me,
and they knew ahead of time that I was a pretty good rebounder and they had a
little bit of size advantage, and so yeah, they were just throwing extra
bodies at me, yeah. Is.  
  
Q. How tough was it to get the ball inside with those big bodies in
there?  
TANIA DAVIS: Personally, for me, it wasn't really that tough. I felt like I
got the ball in there pretty easily. It was just after that, just, you know,
making decisions on our part whether we speed cut, things like that.  
  
But I don't think that their pressure bothered me at all when it came to
getting the ball inside.  
  
Q. What legacy do you think this class leaves behind? What are your
memories from the four years?  
TANIA DAVIS: For me personally, I felt like the legacy that we left is
completely different depending on who you're talking about.  
  
Obviously Megan, coming in as a freshman, and you know, turning out, the type
of player that she is, first team All-American and being the all-time leading
scorer, rebounder, in Iowa history.  
  
Then you look at me, and I'm thrown and dealt a really bad hand, and had to
overcome injury after injury; and to be able to fight back and make Big Ten
Honorable Mention and to do things that I wasn't supposed to do and be in the
position and be in the Elite 8, places I wasn't supposed to be.  
  
And then you look at Hannah Stewart, not playing her freshman year and to be a
starter and keep playing for us.  
  
I feel like our legacy just completely different, but at the same time I feel
like we're all just great people. We're great individuals off the court and I
feel like that's the legacy we'd rather leave, as opposed to, you know, the
players that we have.  
  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, definitely what Tania said. We've all three had
different journeys. Tania is one of the toughest warriors I know to be able to
battle back from three injuries, with the shoulder and two back-to-back ACLs.
Tonight she got her thousandth point, so that's amazing (tearing up).  
  
Hannah, if I had to go to battle with anyone else -- she's going to do great
things when she's done, and I just try to do my job here in Iowa and just
trying to work hard every single day (sobbing).  
  
God has just blessed me with an amazing ability to play basketball, and I'm
just so, so pleased and thankful that the University of Iowa chose me and I
chose to play for them.  
  
Q. Just how good is this Baylor team?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, you know, I looked at their numbers and obviously
watched them on film and I thought their defense was good. I didn't realize it
was that good, until you're out there playing against them, how good their
defense is.  
  
I mean, I hope they win it all. I hope they go on and win it all, definitely.
But again, I thought they were a very good team today, as well, and I just
wish we would have played our best game and we didn't, but again, I know that
part of that has to do with Baylor.  
  
Q. This is the farthest Iowa has gone under you. Obviously you lose a
lot. How do you sustain this now?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Well, it all begins with recruiting. It all begins with
getting the talent in. You know, I think the culture is there. I think people
want to play with the type of women that we have on our team.  
  
So I think, you know, as long as we continue to pass that culture down and
keep it, but it really comes down to getting the athletes in, as well. Culture
is one thing, but you have to have talent to go with it.  
  
Q. This is kind of not about the game itself, but you have an all-female
coaching staff, and there aren't that many that have that. Is that important
to you to be coaching a lot of women? How intentional is that, and is that
something you plan to continue?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: It's very intentional. It's something I'm really proud of.
I think that young women need to have female role models to look up to and to
see leaders in action that are women. I'm not saying that men can't be role
models, but we all know that when you have somebody that looks like you, it's
a little bit easier.  
  
I'm very intentional about that, and I'm very proud of the fact that we have
an all-female staff.  
  
Q. You had about a seven-and-a-half-minute stretch there in that second
quarter where you didn't make any field goals, made some from the free throw;
how critical is that stretch with a chance to kind of stay in the game?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, there were several of those, I felt like, where we
just had the long droughts. You know, I thought that Megan did her part; I
said coming into this game that we needed everybody to contribute, and
unfortunately we didn't get a lot of contribution from other people.  
  
You know, again, I know they gave me all. I know that they worked as hard as
they could. I know that they believed and came in here wanting it, but today,
we just didn't get the job done. It would have been nice to be able to hit
some threes and be able to knock some of those down, but again, I think Baylor
did a really good job of getting out there and taking that pass out away from
us.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Obviously you and Megan are Lisa Leslie Award finalists. A lot's
going to be made of that matchup. Is it over hyped or is it important as all
the hype is going to make it out to be?  
KALANI BROWN: I think it's a little of both to be honest. It's just going to
be two great post players playing a game.  
  
Q. Chloe, your first time this deep in the tournament. What's the
experience like and how does it feel to be this close to your first Final
Four?  
CHLOE JACKSON: It feels great. It's a blessing to be here, and just trying to
go out and play the hardest we can, and hopefully we get to a final four,
which will be amazing.  
  
Q. I think the first time I heard you mention Tampa specifically this
season was during the Big 12 Championship celebration. Now that you're one
game away, what's the mood of the team like?  
DIDI RICHARDS: I think we're excited and ready to go there. So the quicker we
get there, the better. Get the game started and get the win and get to Tampa.  
  
Q. They have another pretty good post player inside or another good
inside player. Can you talk about the matchup and could you be on Gustafson,
as well?  
LAUREN COX: Yeah, I think it's going to take both of us to stop her. She's a
good post player. They have a good duo inside with Stewart and her. They run
kind of some of the same stuff we do with the lob plays and kind of like our
main offense look, we call it Baylor, but just like that high-low passing. So
I think it will be a good matchup.  
  
Q. What's it like the day before the long wait? Is that the hardest
part? Waiting throughout the day and then tomorrow, and how do you handle the
downtime?  
KALANI BROWN: Yeah, waiting is the hardest part because you're so anxious to
get out there and you're so anxious to play. But you know, we just do what we
normally do in a normal routine. It's best not to change anything.  
  
CHLOE JACKSON: I would say I'm pretty relaxed. Just kind of rest your legs all
day. Just get mentally prepared. Never think too hard on it. Just kind of wait
around for game time.  
  
Q. Can you talk about some of the challenges you anticipate going up
against Megan?  
KALANI BROWN: Well, with my lack of mobility, maybe her trying to get around
me will be the biggest issue. I'm just going to try to move my feet and stay
with her. I mean, we're both lefties. We'll see.  
  
Q. I remember one time during the game, Kim said something to you about
be aggressive. Do you need to come out and maybe try to come out firing it, I
guess?  
JUICY LANDRUM: Definitely, I think I definitely do need to come out and be
more aggressive. But when she pulled me to the sideline and told me to be more
aggressive, that's my motivation from her.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the style of play you expect from Iowa that maybe
different from what you saw yesterday?  
LAUREN COX: I think they are going to shoot a lot more threes than South
Carolina did. South Carolina is quicker than they are and they like to get out
in transition. Not to say that Iowa won't get out in transition, but I think
they will try shoot more threes and establish their post presence early.  
  
KALANI BROWN: They are going to try to get to their high-low game. I know
their posts are a vital asset to their offense, so I don't think they are
going to try and change anything as far as that goes.  
  
Q. You've mentioned how unfiltered Coach Mulkey is it and you obviously
sometimes are, as well. Can you try to explain the team and how they fight and
play for her because of how she fights and plays for you?  
DIDI RICHARDS: I kind of feel like if you have a coach that you know that has
your back, you're going to have her back no matter what, and I feel like our
team, and our chemistry is something that, you know, is shown because of how
much we have each other's back, I guess.  
  
Q. Didi obviously went off big-time yesterday. Just curious which one of
y'all is going to go off big tomorrow, who's feeling it? Whichever thinks
you're going to have a hot hand.  
JUICY LANDRUM: All five of us.  
  
KALANI BROWN: We're all big-time, come on.  
  
DIDI RICHARDS: We all are.  
  
(All five players chiming in simultaneously)  
  
KALANI BROWN: I said everybody. I said all five have a hot hand.  
  
LAUREN COX: I think that's what sets us apart from some people you is never
know who is going to go off. Didi, people play off of her because they don't
think she has an offensive game. She proved that last night. She had 25
points, a new career-high. So it can be any one of us.  
  
Q. I don't believe you've fouled out this year. How big is that to keep
you guys on the floor, and how much of that plays into the freshmen being able
to spell y'all some?  
KALANI BROWN: It does play a key role. We just have to play smart. Keep our
hands straight up and not foul. You know, with our size, we can alter a lot of
shots, so us being on the floor is very important.  
  
LAUREN COX: I agree with Kalani, and like you said, the freshmen can come in
and relieve us when they get tired. They don't miss a beat when they come in.  
  
Q. I'm sure there will be a lot made of the Kalani / Megan Gustafson
matchup, both being Lisa Leslie Award finalists. Is that over-hyped or is that
a pretty critical part of the game tomorrow?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I don't know why it's over-hyped or even a discussion. She's
a national Player of the Year. We've got our hands full.  
  
Q. Just the matchup itself and style of play from Iowa, what do you see
from them?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I see that everything they do offensively goes through
Gustafson, and she is a tremendous player. And if you try to go down there and
double her or help, she has perimeter players that shoot the 3-ball that you
can't leave them open. While she's the best player in the country according to
ESPN, she isn't doing it by herself. She has plenty of help around her.  
  
Q. You just mentioned there their perimeter players. Is there a matchup
in particular outside of paint that you are keying on or that you really want
to emphasize winning that battle defensively?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: No. They are too good. Too balanced to focus on one
particular player. I think it's the same way with Gustafson. You know,
everybody talks about her but that team is not a one-person show. And they all
play well together. They complement each other well. So there's not just one,
if-you-stop-this-one-you're-going-to-win-the-ballgame. They are too good.  
  
Q. Played Iowa in the Sweet 16 four years ago and handled them pretty
easily. Is this a better team you're facing tomorrow?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Now, I can't remember yesterday. Now, how are you going to
get me to remember four years ago? I can't remember that. I can't remember my
team from four years ago.  
  
Q. Kalani seemed tongue-in-cheek when she talks about her lack of
mobility. How has she improved in that over the years?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, tell me who you're with -- where are you from?  
  
Q. Excuse me?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Identify yourself.  
  
Q. David Newton. ESPN.com.  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, David, you wrote that she plays small at times, I
think. So she hasn't shrunk. She's still 6-7. I don't know what you mean by
mobility. She's not a perimeter player. Gustafson is not a perimeter player.
Kalani had to guard Anigwe who averaged a double-double for Cal who was on
pace to have tons of double-doubles. That kid's pretty athletic. Kalani
guarded her. So I'm not sure where this mobility problem people keep bringing
up comes from.  
  
Foul-line-to-foul-line are where basketball games are won, and Kalani Brown at
her size can run foul-line-to-foul-line in my opinion as well as any big girl
in the game.  
  
So I don't know about mobility. Maybe, you know, my idea of not being very
mobile is different than your description of it, but I don't -- I don't see
where that kid has a mobility problem. She shoots the perimeter shot as well
as any big girl I've coached. She doesn't have to do it much, but she can
shoot the perimeter shot. So she's not limited to just go plop on the board
and wait for an offensive board and put-back.  
  
I don't know. I've read that. I'm sure she's read that. Maybe that comes from
her freshman year or something when we played Oregon State and she had to go
way out and guard three-point shooters where they had post players that shot
the three. Maybe that's where that's coming from, I don't know.  
  
All I know is the kid's a special player and she has her hands full against
what is y'all's opinion, the best player in the country, and she's pretty
good. She averages a lot of points, a lot of rebounds. I just don't want
Kalani to have nightmares all night.  
  
Q. I remember at one point during the game, I don't remember if you
pulled her to the side or if you actually just said it to her when she was out
there, but you said something to Juicy about being aggressive. Do you need her
to like maybe come out firing or be more aggressive with her shot?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: No. Juicy's coming into this regional, Juicy is our leading
scorer. I need Juicy just to be Juicy. Sometimes Juicy gets a little passive
and quiet; instead of shooting the ball, she'll pass it, or instead of getting
up in somebody defensively, sometimes she'll ball watch. That's all.  
  
You know, she's been really, really tremendous for us this year.  
  
Q. Do you have any gauge on your team's attitude and mood today on the
cusp of such a big game tomorrow night?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Breakfast, I thought our morning devotion -- today's Sunday
and we always do a morning devotion, was the same. I thought the film room was
the same. You know, they are just happy kids. They are happy people. They just
talk, chatty. Watch the film. Listen to the scouting report. I didn't -- I
just -- same old bunch.  
  
Q. I think this is your eighth trip to the Elite 8 in the last ten
years. Iowa hasn't been to this level since '93. Is that an advantage?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: No. No. I'm not going to pass or shoot. Those kids have to
go out there on the floor and they have to do it, and it's an exciting time
for all those kids on both teams, and it should be.  
  
Q. Coach, is there any point in the tournament where you're watching
other games and trying to figure out if you can take something from any other
team and implement it into your game plan?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Not really. Each team has its own identity. To change
something this late date, I don't think would be wise. You might see maybe a
tendency of a team you're going to play that you may not have recognized on
film that they are now doing and you might want to take that away defensively,
or you might see a quick hitter or an in-bounds or something.  
  
But pretty much everybody's identities are established at this point. I have
always believed that if you try to change late in the game, you're making a
team do something that is not who they are.  
  
So I don't -- when I watch film of other teams, I don't sit there and go,
gosh, we need to change and do that.  
  
So no.  
  
Q. When you have a late game the next day, because you played early
yesterday, and then you don't play till late tomorrow. Is this day hard, or
how do you keep it routine when you have such a long day just to wait?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I don't think this day is hard. Tomorrow may be harder
because you're waiting and waiting and waiting, but I don't think today is
hard. Today is needed to rest your bodies, to do some more film work.  
  
Tomorrow, just sitting around, waiting all day, could be a little bit more
difficult.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Megan, going up against a couple pretty good bigs tomorrow. How much
have you seen them on film this year? Is there one thing in particular that
sticks out to you about how good they can be?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, to be honest, I'm not super familiar with them just
because they aren't in our conference and during our season, we're focused on
our opponents in conference play and stuff. But obviously we've heard of them.
They have a great couple post players, and I would just say their level of
physicality. They have a couple inches on me and Hannah, so we've just got to
be ready for that physical play.  
  
Q. When you first found out you were going to be in Baylor's regional,
what you were thinking and how much y'all were looking forward to the
challenge or was it a different mindset?  
HANNAH STEWART: Yeah, when the bracket came out, we were mostly focused on
Mercer and just taking it one game at a time. I don't know how much we even
noticed that we were in Baylor's bracket.  
  
We're really excited about it. I think we match up well against them. We know
they are obviously the overall No. 1 seed, but I'm really happy that we're in
their bracket, and I think it's going to be a challenge but I think we're all
ready for it.  
  
Q. You guys did a really great job yesterday sort of messing with their
passing lanes and disrupting their offense, in particular, you swiped that one
just outside the arc and just burned to the other end of the court. What have
you seen from Baylor that you think you might be able to attack, as far as
their perimeter play defensively and messing with their flow like you did
yesterday?  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: Yeah, they definitely have a great group of guards that we're
going to have to try to disrupt offensively. All we can do is try to make
their life as hard as possible, so it's all about trying to bring that
defensive intensity, and we're going to try to bring that again tomorrow
night.  
  
Q. Can you compare Baylor with anyone else that you've already played
this year? Have you thought about that -- Megan, you can answer that. I see
you nodding.  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I see a little bit of similarities, thinking about Nebraska
or Maryland. I think they have got a couple good bigs inside, both of those
teams we played against but at the same time they have some shooters and some
really good drivers, so I see some similarities, for sure.  
  
TANIA DAVIS: For guards, you can compare it to a Maryland or a Rutgers. They
are in your (indiscernible) defensively, so we're going to have to be strong
with the ball. Like I said, we played Maryland and we played Rutgers, so we
feel like we have -- we're pretty much prepared for it.  
  
Q. For all of you, or whoever wants to take it, but Greensboro is not
that far from Raleigh. There was a lot of talk about N.C. State maybe having a
built-in home-court advantage, but your fans were loud yesterday. What does it
mean to have that support in getting this far, and for people to have come so
far to support you and cheer for you?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: You know, we love our Hawk fans. They are some of the best
fans in the country. I believe that 100 percent. I'm not surprised that they
traveled to be honest. You know, other people might be surprised, but you
know, our fans are so passionate about us, and we're so thankful that we have
these fans. They are loud.  
  
You know, a lot of my family members are there. They are very loud. I know
that a lot of our -- my teammates families are there, too, so it's just really
special to have so many fans behind us.  
  
HANNAH STEWART: It's awesome to see our friends and family. We all have lots
of friends and family here, but there are some people that we've never met
that are walking around our hotel and telling us "Go Hawks" and that kind of
thing, which shows us how awesome and loyal our fan base is. We're so thankful
for them.  
  
Q. How tough is it sitting and waiting for a 6 o'clock game tomorrow?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, I mean, obviously it would be nice to just play right
now. I'd do it right now.  
  
But at the same time, it's nice to give our bodies a little rest, and you
know, especially because we're playing two games in three days, and so I think
the rest is important, but at the same time, I would like to play right now.  
  
TANIA DAVIS: I've been saying it all tournament. The one-day prep, I think
it's been beneficial for us. It allows us to stay locked in and mission-
focused and doesn't allow us to deviate or think about other things.  
  
So I feel like the one-day prep is always good for us. It allows us to go over
our scout a little bit more and clean up the little details that we need to.  
  
KATHLEEN DOYLE: I mean, it's definitely a hard to wait for the game. You're
just so excited to play, and yeah, it's just quite the build-up, but it's
always exciting when we finally get to go out there and play.  
  
MAKENZIE MEYER: Yeah, like the others have said, we're all just really excited
to get back out on the court, but it is really beneficial for our bodies to
get some time to rest and recover, and we're just looking forward to the
opportunity.  
  
HANNAH STEWART: Yeah, we're ready for that game. We're excited to play, but
we're in the Elite 8 and we're happy about that and excited about that and
we're kind of soaking that all in, too.  
  
So yeah, we're looking ahead to Baylor and going to play that game, really
excited. But we're also enjoying the moments we have together right now here
in Greensboro.  
  
Q. How do you counter their heighth advantage and size? What strengths
do you feel could be to your advantage?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, obviously they have a couple inches on us and we just
have to be ready for that. They are going to have a really good physical
level, and we have to use our own physical strengths. Especially we've got to
focus on our footwork, too, inside, especially if we're going to use ball
fakes, or whatever it is. Footwork is going to be important.  
  
HANNAH STEWART: Yeah, they are really tall. They are really big. But I think
Megan and I have a lot of chemistry, as I'm sure they do, but I think if we
make the right reads off each other like we've been doing all year, we'll be
all right.  
  
Q. You touched on it, Iowa being in the Elite 8 is already a pretty good
accomplishment. That being said what would a win against Baylor mean to this
program?  
HANNAH STEWART: Yeah, I think it would just be awesome to keep putting the
University of Iowa on the map and showing people who we are and what we can
do.  
  
Utmost respect for Baylor. They are an awesome, great team, but it would be
really cool to knock off the overall 1-seed. We've all got our sights on it
and we're all focused on that game and ready to do that but we're just going
to go out there and play basketball the best that we know how and hopefully
come out with the win.  
  
Yeah, it would obviously mean a lot. We want to keep going and we want to keep
playing and we want to get this team and our coaches to the Final Four.  
  
COACH LISA BLUDER: We're thrilled to be playing in April. Obviously we know
Baylor is the heavy favorite, but hey, it's April Fool's Day tomorrow, right.
We're just going to go after it and do our best.  
  
Again, we know we have things stacked against us, but it only takes once. It
only takes once, and maybe that once will be tomorrow. I know my team won't
back down to anybody. We know and respect Baylor. But we're ready to play.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the matchups between your squad and the Baylor
Lady Bears?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I think everybody likes the inside matchup. I think
that's what people are probably referring to the most.  
  
You know, not very many times do teams have two bigs anymore. It's kind of
unusual. It's hard sometimes to have one good big on a team, and I think both
of these teams have two good bigs.  
  
So I think we're both kind of unique in that situation. Certainly Lauren and
Kalani are terrific post players. You know, I think I've got two terrific post
players. I think it's going to be a great matchup. We have to keep them off
the boards. They do a great job of rebounding.  
  
I just -- you know, they have a little bit more height than we do. We're not
going to grow between now and tomorrow, so we're going to go to battle with
what we have.  
  
Q. Some of the Baylor players, when they were asked who they thought was
the most underrated player on their team, they said Didi Richards because
she's such a good defender. Who on your team do you think would draw that
assignment in terms of having to face Didi as a defender?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Who is going to defend Didi?  
  
Oh -- who are they going to have Didi defend.  
  
Well, if Kim wants to share her scouting report, I'd be glad to look at that.
You know, I have no idea. I mean, I'm not going to ever assume what another
coach is going to do or anything like that. I don't think that would be very
wise.  
  
But you know, there's three choices. I would imagine she's either going to be
guarding Makenzie or Kathleen. I mean, I don't have any idea what she plans to
do.  
  
Q. Who do you think is the most underrated player on your team?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I think they are all terrific. So really, they all --
because they are all unique and they all bring something different.  
  
Yeah, Megan scores the most points, but I'm not taking away anything that any
one of the other players do. They all have their role.  
  
I really don't like comparing players. I have three children, and I don't tell
you which one of my children are the most valuable. I think they are all
valuable, and I think it's the same thing with my team.  
  
Q. Already making it though this point is pretty good for you, but
getting past Baylor would mean even more. How much are you telling your
players to not just be satisfied with where you are now, and to keep going
after it and beat Baylor?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I don't have to talk about that with them. I mean,
it's every kid's dream to play in the Final Four, right. I mean, we are 40
minutes away from every kid's dream. If you're a basketball player, you want
to play in the Final Four.  
  
I don't have to worry about them being hungry at this point.  
  
Q. I think you might have addressed this in the very first press
conference, but some of us weren't here. Can you tell us a little, what makes
Megan so special?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, you know, statistically, those are obvious. Anybody
can look at a stat sheet and see that.  
  
But what makes Megan so special is, you know, her desire to work to be the
best that she can be. Her work ethic is second to none. She's not just the
first person in the gym and the last person in the gym. It's what she does
when she's in the gym. You know, I've seen a lot of kids come into the gym
early, and they don't get half the workout of what she does in about three to
five minutes.  
  
It's what she does with her minutes that she's in the gym, too. She's always
in a 100 percent gear. I've never known a player that doesn't take possessions
off, sometime. She never takes a possession off. It will be the day before a
game, and we'll be going against our gray squad and she's diving on the floor
for a loose ball. I mean, she just does not take possessions off.  
  
When you have that type of mentality, it allows you to go hard in games all
the time, even when you're up, even when you're tired, even when you're down,
when you're fresh, it doesn't matter. She's just trained herself to go that
speed all the time.  
  
And then she's just an exceptional teammate. She's kind. She gives credit to
her teammates. She's humble. She's an All-American with absolutely no ego. I
don't want people to get that confused with confidence because she's
confident, but she doesn't have an ego. She doesn't have to prove it to
anybody. She knows how good she is, and she doesn't have to say it. She
believes it and her teammates believe it.  
  
She's just a great teammate, too. And she's a great student, double business
major.  
  
Q. What about Megan allows her to be successful against taller players
like she's going to face tomorrow night?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: You know, I mean, she hasn't gone against that many players
that are 6-7. I mean, that's a real challenge, and we know that.  
  
I think what allows her to be successful is she does run the floor well. She's
got great footwork. She's got wonderful hands.  
  
Her shot is very, very quick. She doesn't -- she's got some great ball fakes
and up-and-unders and things like that that she can try to get you off the
ground with. She's got a nice hook-shot. Hook-shots are really hard to defend
because you're standing away from the defender. I think that she's found ways
to shoot over bigger people because she does it almost all the time -- now,
not 6-7, but almost all year, she's the undersized post.  
  
Q. You showed tremendous toughness yesterday; that toughness factor,
that's probably going to be a huge part tomorrow, as well.  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I think you're right. I think you have to be physically and
mentally strong to play against a team as good as Baylor. I mean, what we had
yesterday, North Carolina State made their run coming out of halftime. We
called a time-out and we just talk about momentum shifts, and there's always
shifts of momentum during a game.  
  
When you have the one riding for yourself, ride it as long as you can. And
understanding that it is a momentum shift; let's stop it. Let's not panic but
let's stop it. But yeah, I think with Baylor you do have to be mentally and
physically strong.  
  
Q. As you said, most people are kind of focusing on the matchups down
low, but your perimeter players did an incredible job yesterday of disrupting
N.C. State's offense early in possessions and limiting them in transition. How
do you see them replicating or changing what they were doing versus Baylor who
have a little bit of a different makeup personnel-wise?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: You know, we're not going to -- we can't reinvent the wheel
in 24 hours. I mean, we're not going to change our style. We're not going to
change up what we do.  
  
We have to do, you know, what we've been working on since June. You alter
little things for every team, but you certainly are not going to change what,
you know, your style of play or your personnel or anything like that.  
  
So you know, yeah, we'd like to get out. I mean, geez, Juicy is shooting the
ball extremely well. Chloe, just a tremendous athlete. Didi is a great
defensively player, and a tremendous rebounder.  
  
So it's knowing personally at this point in my opinion and I think our team is
really smart and they do a lot of those things really well.  
  
Q. So yesterday, your team shot from over 54 percent from the floor, and
Baylor in over 30 games hasn't let an opponent shoot over 50. What's your plan
to move the offense tomorrow and keep it rolling?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, everybody talks about Baylor's offense inside and
everything. Their defense is remarkable. I mean, what they are holding people
to, I mean, that's absolutely incredible. Again we are not going to change
anything. We have to do what we do and do it best.  
  
You saw it yesterday. We have to have other people step up. It can't just be
our inside players, and I thought yesterday we had good balance. And so I
think we're going to have to really rely on that balance tomorrow because they
do such a great job defensively, as well.  
  
Q. You kind of talked about Baylor's other three. In a game where so
much of the talk is about the inside, how important is to maybe not let one of
the other players beat you, like Didi Richards scoring 25?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, I think you're right. It would be a bad thing if you
contain those big players and then all of a sudden one of their guards just
lights it up on you that hasn't really done that all year long.  
  
But you kind of have to play odds, too. You know, I think coaches are kind of
statisticians and you look at percentages and you play percentages, and I
think you have to, especially against a team as good as Baylor. You're not
going to play everybody the same, because you have to put your defense where
they have done the best offensively.  
  
And so you hope that doesn't happen but it certainly could, and you know, I'm
hoping a couple of my players have that kind of output offensively, as well.  
  
Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
GREENSBORO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+GREENSBORO)

  

## March 30, 2019

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

### [Tyasha Harris](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33304)

### [Alexis Jennings](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34741)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Baylor 93, South Carolina 68  
  
COACH DAWN STALEY: I'm super proud of our team for playing as hard as they did
for 40 minutes. Obviously we didn't execute what we needed to execute, and
that was because of, you know, the challenge that Baylor posed for our team.
But proud of their effort. Proud of being able to sit here and participate in
the second weekend of the NCAA Tournament. We look forward to a brighter
future.  
  
Q. Alexis, can you talk about the inside matchup, and I guess with
Kalani and Lauren, how difficult that is containing them?  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: It was pretty difficult, you know, we're giving up a lot of
height advantage with them, but I feel like we did the best that we could.
Yeah, that's pretty much it.  
  
Q. With all the things about Baylor that you have to defend, when Didi
Richards has a night like she had tonight, does it make it that much harder to
contain them?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Yeah, their guards are solid. Obviously, if given the
opportunity, you know, they take advantage of the opportunities that they
have. I thought we just got our defense off-balance a little bit, especially
when we took some shots and it allowed Didi to get out and get some transition
buckets that were uncontested.  
  
Q. You obviously know what a National Championship team looks like. What
does Baylor look like to you right now?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Baylor has all the key ingredients to be a national
champion. They have size, they have athleticism. They have an ability to beat
you at a lot of difference places. You definitely have to game plan for them
and you have to adjust to their style of play.  
  
You know, their load; we had post players that were, you know, not as big, but
as imposing, and that led us to a National Championship, although they didn't
play in the same game. Just the day-to-day beat-down that we imposed on other
teams was a great thing to experience, and not so much when you're on the
other side of it.  
  
Q. Y'all had dug a big hole and got back to within 14, 15, and then I
think Baylor reeled off -- were you feeling like you were back in it at that
point? You had gotten it back down to 15, 16 points?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: I thought we had some momentum, and then we -- I think we
missed a free throw that could have got us down to 15.  
  
Here's the bottom line that we didn't really harp on as a staff, and you don't
want to put that much pressure on your young team in that only maybe three
players have experience being in the Sweet 16.  
  
Actually being in the Sweet 16, three or four players, and the roles that some
of the ones that didn't -- wasn't a part of those Sweet 16s, and those Elite
8s and those Final Fours, this is their first time to ask them to perform at a
high level against a National Championship contender team, you know, was a bit
much. But we didn't want to mention that, but when you actually have to
decompress and look at it, it's hard for them to have to be able to do that at
this level.  
  
So I'm pretty encouraged by the returning players and pretty encouraged by
some of the future players coming into our program that we'll have enough
experience if we're able to get back to this level of basketball.  
  
Q. Looking back on this season with all of the newness that you
mentioned so much, what are some of the other buzzwords that will describe
this season once you wrap everything up?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: I think we achieved the potential of this team. I don't
think we lacked the potential. I thought getting to the second weekend of this
tournament would be, you know, a real goal for us. I didn't say that out loud,
obviously, but I thought it was a real goal, attainable goal, to reach for.  
  
Obviously we wanted to end it somewhere else, like Tampa, but we just didn't
have enough. When you look at, you know, what was on our roster, you look at
the inexperience of players who had to make an impact for us consistently, the
depth of our rosters, the injuries at the beginning of the season, it was just
hard to build that chemistry.  
  
Once we got healthy, I thought we could get to this game; and if we got to
this game, we had to play almost perfect basketball to advance.  
  
Q. And also, you will have some experienced players, some seniors like
Cooper and Harrigan and Harris next year. Are those automatically your leaders
next year?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: They make their debut today, right now. This is it; this is
it for them. They are seniors, and they have one more year to perform for us;
so they are auditioning for who is going to be the leader of our team in this
next year.  
  
Q. Can you speak to your rivalry with Kim, two great point guards now
leading two great programs?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Well, the rivalry is lopsided. We're 0-2.  
  
But I think Kim's done a great job at making a huge transition, and I know
she's been doing this for a very long time, from being a great point guard to
a great coach, a National Championship coach.  
  
You know, I think we give hope to some other, current players, and other
former players; that it can get done, as far as being successful in the
coaching ranks, and impacting young people's lives on a daily basis is
something that I guess we have been impacted by the coaches and the mentors
that have been in our lives at a young age; that it allows us to have some
success, while returning a favor to some young people.  
  
Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
GREENSBORO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+GREENSBORO)

  

## March 30, 2019

  

### [Kim Mulkey](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=13704)

### [Lauren Cox](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33249)

### [Didi Richards](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37077)

### [Kalani Brown](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30449)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Baylor 93, South Carolina 68  
  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I don't have an opening statement, so we can go straight to
the kids. How's that.  
  
Q. Didi, you scored a lot of those on back-door cuts. Was that a
specific game plan or something that happened?  
DIDI RICHARDS: That's something that's going to happen if they to continue to
double-team our posts. I'm just thankful that they are able to find me back-
side.  
  
Q. What's it like putting up a quiet 18-and-10 while Lauren and Didi
were going bonkers?  
KALANI BROWN: It was great. I was scoring, but I was also passing and able to
find my teammates, and when everybody's scoring, I'm happy. If I can take a
silent 18-and-10, that's fine.  
  
Q. How important was it to get up on them and not let them hang
around?  
LAUREN COX: It was important just because they are capable of just going on
some runs, because they are really quick in transition. They can knock down
some threes like they did late.  
  
So just to get up like that and keep that lead was pretty important for us.  
  
Q. Going up against Megan Gustafson, Player of the Year, what are your
thoughts going into that matchup?  
KALANI BROWN: I've played against a lot of great post players so she will be
another one that's going to challenge me. We're both lefties, and kind of
seeing her play, we're kind of alike. That should be interesting. I'm excited
to play.  
  
Q. You had a sweet behind-the-back pass to Didi. Talk about that play
and just seeing her points escalate today.  
DIDI RICHARDS: I was really upset about that pass, by the way, if anybody
wanted to know.  
  
KALANI BROWN: Oh, please. You were open.  
  
She was open, okay. It was a little flashy, I ain't going to lie. I might have
did that on purpose.  
  
But, I don't know, I was able to find Didi a lot, and it was just working, so
I was trying to get it there. I was trying to be fancy, but you know, she
caught it, scored it, made me look good. It's all about making your teammate
look good, so thank you, Didi.  
  
Q. How are you handling the pressure in terms of getting to the Final
Four?  
DIDI RICHARDS: I wouldn't say pressure, unless it's on pressure on our
ourselves. I wouldn't say we feel pressure from everybody else. I would just
say we play our game. We go out there and we're just being ourselves. We're
just happy to get to, the Elite 8 at least, and make it to the Final Four
eventually.  
  
Q. They cut it to 16 there in the third quarter and they scored a lot of
points in that third quarter, but you guys responded, I think Kalani hit a
bucket and then you hit a couple layups. How important is it when they are on
that run for you guys to respond?  
DIDI RICHARDS: The game of basketball is a game full of runs. We really just
need to learn -- well, we handled it well because we didn't get into ourselves
when we they went on that run.  
  
I think we handled it well by looking at each other and just calming down. You
know, if you look at your teammate, and like Lauren is like, "Didi, you got
it. Calm down."  
  
Or Kalani is like, "Didi, we got this." Am I'm like, Okay, and I feel all
right and I just pass the message on to Juicy or Chloe. So I think we really
have each other and like a little hook-circle, a tight little circle.  
  
Q. I know it's part of the offense, but was that a game plan going in to
use Didi that much or did that just happen?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: That's happened all year. I think they just read each other.
They watch -- particularly Didi, because people don't think he's going to be
an offensive threat, so she reads what her defender does, and then she knows
where to cut and when to cut and they just have that connection. That's from
playing a lot of games together.  
  
So no, it wasn't like we just went in and said you're going to this, this --
she's been doing that all year.  
  
Q. Another game plan question. You guys threw it over the top of their
defense a lot in pushing the ball in transition. Is that something that you
saw that you could do against them?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Yes. You try to prepare for everything, and I read a lot of
things and try to figure out what it is that we may see that we didn't see
last time, and I think Coach Staley was trying to say that fast versus big. So
we're pretty fast, too. We're not just a bunch of slugs running the floor with
two big girls.  
  
Those kids can get up and down the floor and our guards are going to push it
and we're going to wait a step or two for them to run foul line to foul line.
So I was just looking at that. You know, our transition buckets were like
25-9, and so we're going to run. We're not walking the ball up the floor. I
thought that was big.  
  
I thought the second thing they might try to do is shoot more threes because
we have seen that against us this year. If we could hold them or limit them to
a few number of threes, because that's not really their game. Their game is to
drive.  
  
Well, we know when you drive, what you're going to see. There's going to be
two bigs waiting for you and we needed to help the helper. We got beat on that
two or three times; that, we did go over, and didn't do a very good job.  
  
But I thought we ran with them. We got the transition buckets and we didn't
allow them to get a lot of transition buckets or threes.  
  
Q. They made a run in the third quarter and got it to 16, and you guys
responded. How important was it for you to not let them not keep cutting into
that lead?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: They got to the foul line and we were hacking and trying to
block shots. They got into the paint and they were dribble-penetrating and
trying to make some exciting things happen for themselves.  
  
And then they started pressing us a little bit more with a little bit more
force, or should I say energy, in the third quarter. You're down 26, so you
gamble and you just try to make things happen.  
  
And there were times we didn't handle it well, but then we would score. I
thought we did fine. I wish that, you know, I could have given Chloe, not
anybody else, but Chloe a little bit more of a breather, but Chloe, this is as
far as she's ever been in the playoffs and that's what I told her. I told her,
"I know you're tired but you're fixing to get to play in an Elite 8 game, can
you go a few more minutes?"  
  
And she said, "Yeah, Coach, I got this."  
  
Q. Is that when you were head-to-head with her? Is that what you told
her at that point?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: That was some of what I told her but I can't remember other
things. But yes, she was tired. She was hurting. On the defensive end, she
couldn't even close out one time on a three-point shooter because she knew as
soon as they scored, she was going to have to get ready to break a press, and
usually Juicy can relieve her a little bit but I took Juicy out early. She had
gotten stripped there one time.  
  
But I thought inside, one-on-one, it's been a long time since we've seen one-
on-one coverage on the post. Yes, Didi scored a lot on it, but when we were
cutting and scoring, they got out of it, so we were able to isolate Kalani a
lot and Cox down there.  
  
I thought Cox was so valuable to us in the middle of the press. Sometimes she
thinks she's a guard and you have to tell her, pick your dribble up, they are
coming from behind; give the ball to a point guard, but she'll take off, and
like I told you, she can play any position on the score. She was scoring at
the end of the press.  
  
Q. And then same question I asked Lauren. How important was it to kind
of throw a haymaker and get up 20 on them and not let them hang around?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, I don't know if we just throw a haymaker. It's hard.
Listen, we're on a roll and that's what it takes in the playoffs. You need to
get on a roll, you need to stay healthy and have a little bit of luck.  
  
These kids are focused. These kids, I mean, they have never wavered in how
they approach a basketball game. They are funny. They are talented. Elite 8
Monday.  
  
Q. Certainly there's lots on your mind preparing for this game, but can
you reflect at all, having two women coach former point guards at this level,
having very, very solid programs?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Was Bluder a point guard? Oh, sorry, you're talking about
today's game?  
  
Look, I'm not in her league. That child -- I call her a child because I
coached when she was playing. I was at Louisiana Tech. Dawn Staley, she's a
competitor. I watched her when she won her National Championship. I watched
her interview and in her moment of just pure enjoyment and excitement, she was
still challenging her players.  
  
I particularly remember Cuevas-Moore, she wanted to transfer out and all those
people in New York were trying to get her to leave, and she had basically won
the National Championship for them and I just told her, "Don't ever change who
you are. That's what makes you great."  
  
She's got a great recruiting class coming in, and Dawn Staley is just a
tremendous, tremendous ambassador for the sport. She was a great player for
Debbie Ryan at Virginia, and she's doing great things at South Carolina.  
  
Thank you.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Iowa 79, North Carolina State 61  
  
COACH WES MOORE: First, you have to give Iowa a lot of credit. They played a
great game. Very well-coached. Very fundamental. And you know, Gustafson,
obviously, awesome player and then felt like the rest of the team really had a
great game around her.  
  
So when they are hitting threes and she does what she does on the block, it's
a tough matchup. I thought we made a great run. I was very disappointed in the
first half. I don't know exactly what happened; that really didn't look like
our team. But second half, we made a nice run and then we came down about four
or five times in a row and had some decent looks, and the ball just didn't go
in. I thought that was our chance to really put some pressure on them and
maybe get over the top but wasn't meant to be. Again, Iowa was a better team
today.  
  
Q. For DD and Kiara, for this being your last game what did this game
mean to you and what does it mean to wrap up your career here at N.C. State?  
KIARA LESLIE: I have to thank Coach for allowing me to come here and finish
out my college career. I think that we didn't play the way we wanted to today,
but they played hard for us. I personally take some of the blame for us
starting off a little bit slow but I'm thankful for the way that we finished
this year.  
  
DD ROGERS: Yes, like Kiara said, I'm very happy with how our year went this
year. I wish the outcome of this game would have been different, but I
wouldn't rather have, you know, done it beside the people that I did it with.  
  
Q. Guarding a player like Megan, she's so physical and does so much in
the post, as a true freshman, what did you learn playing against a player like
that who is a senior who has done so much and plays with such a physical style
of basketball?  
ELISSA CUNANE: I think she kept her composure very well on the court, and she
just scored a lot around the basket, but she also had the outside shot. So I
think just her style of play, and she was directing her players and leadership
on the court is something I can learn from.  
  
Q. The saying goes, leave something in better shape than when you got
it. Do you feel you've done that with this program in your four years in.  
DD ROGERS: Well, I do believe the program has gone up since I've been here,
not necessarily in I wouldn't say talent or players on the team. I think we've
been capable to do it. People just stepped up and wanted to go as far as they
could this year and we made it happen.  
  
Q. Kiara, you guys as a team this year had to go through a lot of
adversity, the four injuries, but it's still a Sweet 16 trip. What did you
learn and how have you guys grown true all that?  
KIARA LESLIE: We just stuck together and played for one another each and every
night. I think that's what helped us get this far and throughout the season.  
  
Q. Thank you for an amazing season for the ACC. Can you speak to your
success in recruiting the State of North Carolina?  
COACH WES MOORE: Yeah, we've been very blessed in that regard. I think, you
know, we had four of our five starters were from North Carolina, and we're
proud of that. I think those kids, maybe it means a little more to them.  
  
But also, there's a lot of talent in the state. There's a lot of very good
coaches that refine that talent for us, we're very blessed. Obviously those
three ladies are all North Carolina products. Couldn't be prouder of the whole
team.  
  
I was really disappointed in the first half or if we were nervous or just
what, but we weren't ourselves. There's been very few times I have been
disappointed, especially with all they have been through. I told them in the
locker room, there's times before a game -- I probably shouldn't say this --
there's times before a game, introductions or whatever, I'm almost moved to
tears because as good of players they are just as good of people.  
  
Q. You mentioned, your down 13 to start the third quarter and you had a
12-6 run. Was that a product of adjustments you made at halftime, or just
shots going in the third quarter that didn't go in the first half?  
COACH WES MOORE: At this time of year you really struggle with, do you go with
what you've done all year or do you try some new things. Obviously we started
the game in our normal defense and we just felt like we couldn't match up very
well on the block, and Elissa was getting in foul trouble and so we decided to
try to get in front and we had spent quite a bit of time trying to deny the
high post and pressure the ball. If you're going to front, you have got to
have pressure on the ball and make it tough for them to pass, and we didn't do
a good job of that.  
  
But I agree, I thought we did turn them over a few times doing that; that
maybe took them a minute to adjust. I thought we turned them over, made the
run. And then like I said, it just seems like there was about five possessions
where we had a couple of wide open threes, we missed a layup, and, you know,
you just think if we hit a few of those shots, it puts a little pressure on
Iowa and gets the crowd into it a little bit.  
  
I would have liked to have seen what we could have done, but that happens and
you've got to give them credit. They shot the heck out of it from three, and
that's what you've got to hope doesn't happen when you're playing them because
you're going to have to give something up. You've got to pick your poison, and
they made us pay.  
  
Q. Your thoughts on this season as a whole, and where the program's
going.  
COACH WES MOORE: Yeah, I think the whole body of work, you have to be really
proud of these players and all they have been through. They could have -- you
know, they could have really hung their heads and got down four different
occasions, when you had some key players go out, and they didn't.  
  
You know, maybe they mourned a little bit for a day or two but they bounced
right back and kept coming. I'm proud of that. As far as our program goes, and
what's what we owe a lot to these seniors, we had our best recruiting class
this past year coming in in the fall. I think ESPN ranked it Top-10, and now
back-to-back Sweet 16s, we're getting in homes that we weren't able to get in
a few years ago. We're excited about where we're headed and we owe that to the
players up here.  
  
Hopefully we can build on what they have helped happen here.  
  
Q. Elissa had a great game today, double-double, really seemed to be
really composed going up against the Player of the Year.  
COACH WES MOORE: Yeah.  
  
Q. What did you think about her performance and her growth this year?  
COACH WES MOORE: Yeah, you know, again, you know, it was a physical game, so
she didn't probably finish as many as she would have liked around the bucket,
but what an awesome future she has ahead of her, and hopefully this is an
experience that will help her down the road.  
  
You know, again, another one that's just an unbelievable person, and we're
excited. Always got a smile on her face. We're excited about having her around
and hopefully we can do like Iowa's done, build something special around a
special player.  
  
Q. You obviously are really proud of everything you've built here and
excited about the future, so have you committed to coming back to N.C. State
next year?  
COACH WES MOORE: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm very blessed to be at N.C. State.
Again, I like where we're headed.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
GREENSBORO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+GREENSBORO)

  

## March 30, 2019

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

### [Hannah Stewart](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33244)

### [Megan Gustafson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32141)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Iowa 79, North Carolina State 61  
  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I'm extremely happy for my team. They have worked so hard.
They kept believing. They were positive. It's been a magical year, and we
don't want to see it end.  
  
Today, they worked so hard out there. Very, very proud of them. We shot the
ball well, 24 assists again. That's kind of our game. We shot the ball well
from everywhere but I thought our defense was pretty good, as well. Megan
today tied the NCAA record for double-doubles in a season with 33, which is
impressive.  
  
But I want to thank our fans, too. They traveled 913 miles to come watch us
play. I know there's a lot watching at home, but 913 miles, that's dedication
and we're appreciative of that.  
  
Q. Megan, it was fun for us to watch the matchup of the centers. What
was it like out there with Cunane?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: It was definitely a really good battle. You know, she's a
really great center, and she has got a great career ahead of her. We were both
working hard down there.  
  
Whenever I saw her along with another teammate doubling it, I was able to hit
my guards and they were able to hit after that, so after that I was able to
get a little bit open inside and I have to credit my teammates for hitting
those shots.  
  
Q. For both of you. Can you talk about the benefit and kind of luxury of
having such a veteran team and all the seniors in your starting lineup. You
looked in sync out there, all of you. Is it as in sync as it looks?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, it's crucial to have those leaders and veteran players
that have been in these kind of situations. We had that postseason run at the
Big Ten Championship. And just getting that experience is so important,
especially when there's games like this where we're battling for our careers,
and it's important to have that calm presence, that experience on the court.  
  
HANNAH STEWART: Yeah, we just know each other. You know, we know what each of
the guards's strengths are and I think the guards know us really well and we
know each other really well. I know where Megan wants the ball on the high-
low, and I know even if I don't hit her there, she's going to catch it most of
the time.  
  
So yeah, I think just having that experience together is a huge advantage.  
  
Q. If you do face off against Kalani and Cox, what are your thoughts
about that matchup?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, I think everyone in the country would look forward to
that matchup, especially because they have got a couple of great post players
and Hannah have been working extremely hard over the course of our fours year.
We're just going to go into it, doesn't matter who we play. We're going to
play our hearts out, that's for sure.  
  
Q. They cut it to five in the middle of the third quarter; how important
was it to get your lead back to double-digits?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: It was really important. They were closing in. They had a
little bit of a run, but I think it was Lexi who hit a really big three in the
corner and that gave us momentum.  
  
You know, we love being able to just share the ball and get a great shot
instead of a good shot and that's what we did. You know, honestly we just love
playing with each other. We feed off each other's energy and I think that's
what kept us going.  
  
Q. For both of you. When that run kind of got started for N.C. State
they were getting out in transition it seemed like a lot faster and sort of
you guys really limited them on that up until that point. Was there an
adjustment that you made to stop them or was it just sort of an, all right,
everybody get together, we are not putting the effort in, they are getting it
leaking out on breaks now. Like how did you guys sort of stop that flow,
because it looked like they were on the brink and then you shut it down.  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, so at that point we knew that they were going on a
little bit of a run and exactly what you said. We needed to just get back to
defensively; they were running on us a little bit and they were kind of doing
what we do.  
  
So we kind of recognized that and we kind of came together as a team
collectively and just thought we need to bring our intensity back and
thankfully we were able to do that.  
  
HANNAH STEWART: Yeah, when that happens, a lot of times we just come together
as a team. We know basketball is a game of runs. We know that, you know, N.C.
State is going to try their hardest to fight back just like any team will, and
when there was a time-out after that happened, we're like, okay, they had
their run and now it's time for us to go back to work again. A lot of their
fastbreaks were from our turnovers, so we just tried to cut those down, too.  
  
Q. I'll ask you the same question I asked Megan. It was fun for to us
watch the matchup of these centers. What was it like from your seat on the
bench?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, when you have two post that is good going at each
other, you know, it's a battle down there and it's fun to watch.  
  
I think we were fortunate we were able to pick up a couple fouls on her and it
put her on the bench for a little bit. She played 32 minutes instead of 38
minutes, which is to our benefit. And also, when you pick up those fouls, it
makes you a little bit more timid.  
  
I think that, you know, Megan said it the best. She's going to be a great
player. There's no doubt, she's one of the best coming up in the country as
far as posts.  
  
Q. Going off that, same question I had, too. If you do, in fact, go
forward and it is Kalani and Lauren that you're facing tomorrow, what are your
thoughts on that? Does that -- obviously that would be a big story, be really
exciting I think for a lot of people.  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah, it would be exciting. Obviously Baylor is a
tremendous team and that's a big part of their game, like it's a big part of
our game, so I think it would be a really fun matchup to see. Who knows what's
going to happen out there right now, but no matter what it is, I know that
Hannah and Megan are going to be stepping up for the challenge.  
  
Q. The program's headed back to its first Elite 8 since '93, and this is
sort of -- especially making the Sweet 16 a couple of years back, how much are
you aware of sort of the fact that you're building something that's kind of
returning this program to what it was under Vivian Stringer, and does that
play a role or have like a meaning for you that you've taken them back to
someplace that they had not been since she left?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: You know, that's the goal, right, is you always want to
take your program as high as you can and make it as good as you can, and this
certainly was a step for us.  
  
You know, we had not as a coaching staff been to an Elite 8, so it was really
important to us, and it was important to our players. We also, I think it's
the first team that's ever had 29 wins in a season since that year, as well.
At one point in that year, they also went to the Final Four.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Excited to be in the Sweet 16, and looking forward to
playing Baylor tomorrow.  
  
Q. I asked Kim about it, if your team takes on your personality. Can you
see that in Kim's team, as well, and does your team take on your
personality?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Does my team take on -- probably not. They are a lot looser
than I am, or have ever been, as a player.  
  
Kim's team, I think at times they take on her personality, but I think we're
so far removed from this generation, you know, that you only see bits and
pieces of it. They can only -- they only can take so much of the old school
mentality because they are themselves. For us coaches, we have to figure out
ways in which to get them to play more like us a lot more often.  
  
Q. Obviously your team has changed a lot since you faced Baylor earlier
in the season. What can you take from that game into this game to kind of help
get over the hump?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: I mean, you just have to take the experience of playing
someone as big as they are. I think their length and their girth it's a real
thing. Sometimes when you're watching them on film, they don't look as big as
they do when you actually have to play against them.  
  
I feel like we're a lot more healthy than we were at that stage of the game.
We didn't talk about our players who were, you know, trying to get back closer
to 100 percent, but we were not 100 percent by any means. So we are more --
we've played all season long, probably ever since December, we've been more
healthy than not.  
  
So we're looking forward to having a healthy roster and you know, seeing where
we stack up and where we improved from a couple of months ago.  
  
Q. As you prepare for this rematch with Baylor, and you look at them,
study the video, do they look the same, or are they playing better than they
were when they played you in December?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: I think they are playing better. Obviously she knows what
she wants. Their playbook isn't huge. They are just very calculated and
efficient with what they want and they force you to stop them doing the things
that they want to do.  
  
I think we're better; I think we're a better basketball team at this stage of
the game. I don't think we will, you know, have the same game plan, because
the game plan back in December was we started out in the zone because we just
didn't feel like we could, you know, matchup with them with the -- that
current health of our basketball team. We're healthy so we're going to fly
around and play the way we've been playing over the past few weeks.  
  
Q. When Baylor beat you earlier, putting your record at 4-4, you went on
to win 13 of 14. I know you got healthy, but have you improved in some areas
of play, and can you talk about that a little bit?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Yeah, I think just the first few games of the season, I
think people fail to realize that we had probably a third of our team that
were new, you know, new: Three freshmen, one grad transfer, one grad transfer
in Te'a Cooper, and we just tried to instill some chemistry in what we're
doing and that's actually more than a third of our theme and they had to play
an integral role in our success. We had a couple of new starters who were just
trying to figure out how to play more minutes, and play a bigger role for our
basketball team.  
  
So I think the chemistry is much better. I think our players understand how we
need to play and what they need to do in order for us to be successful, so I
think that's the reason why we went on, you know, such a run, and we got
healthy.  
  
Q. Is there anything interest your run two years ago -- I know you were
a favorite then, a No. 1 seed then. Is there anything you draw on from then,
either as being a 4-seed playing a 1-seed or just surviving and advancing?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: You know, at this stage much the game, it is, you know, no
matter what the number is besides your name, you have to play. You have to
game plan and you have to play because anything, anything can happen at this
stage of the game. So you know, we're just going to play. We're going to fly
around out there and let the chips fall where they may.  
  
But there is a huge difference in being the No. 1 seed and being a No. 4 seed
as far as it's just different. We were a 5-seed at one point, I believe, in
2012 -- yes, 5-seed? 2012, so first time being a 4-seed, and having to play
the No. 1 team in the country.  
  
So that's the biggest difference. You know, you don't usually see the No. 1
team for us until a lot later on. We'll be challenged in that way. I'd rather
play the big ones up front. If you can knock them down, then everything seems
to be a little easier, not a lot easier, but a little easier.  
  
Q. The other day, you sent out a message on Twitter thanking Holly for
what she had done at Tennessee. Why did you want to send that message, and
what are your thoughts on her legacy?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: I mean, Holly is a good friend of mine. I've been in this
league for a long time. She's one that's been real. She says what she has to
say. I just think that sometimes we lose sight of the contributions that
people give to their respective universities and programs, and also just our
game in general, and, you know, she is probably the last part of Coach
Summitt's legacy.  
  
If you really look at her record, I know they have had some games that have
slipped away over the past few years, but if you look at her overall record,
two Elite 8s, she's won two or three SEC titles. I mean, I just feel like
someone in our game, you have to respect what she's done for it. And I'm not
-- you know, I'm not an administrator at Tennessee. I'm just someone who has
been around women's basketball for a long time and I know success when I see
it and certainly her resumé, you can match up against the very best of our
game as far as coaches.  
  
Q. You had mentioned changing up defensively from the previous matchup
with Baylor, but obviously their strength is kind of that front line and seems
like not only as you mentioned, being healthier but just the development of
some of the younger players. You guys have a Swiss Army knife of combinations
of bigs you can kind of throw at them. Have you seen some different ways just
looking at the film and looking at the development of your team down the
stretch here to attack them and maybe just throw some stuff at them they
didn't see last time?  
COACH DAWN STALEY: Yeah, we're a team in which I think our players both the
bigs and our -- and our perimeter players, they have a better understanding of
how we need to play. I they are locked into our game plan. I do feel like we
can do some things to get good shots.  
  
Obviously if you take away the first quarter, you know, I think the game is,
you know, pretty much not even, but you know, five-point discrepancy. So we've
got to look at, you know what went right in that particular game and build on
that.  
  
But you know, I'm excited. You know, a lot of people, I mean, we have no
pressure. The pressure -- and I know all coaches come up here and say the
psychological thing, but we really don't have any pressure. They are the No. 1
team in the country. They have played extremely well all season long.  
  
We're just trying to get it into a situation where we keep it close and put
them in situations they very rarely have been familiar with this particular
season. They are a tremendously good basketball team that have it going on
both inside and outside. I mean, you know, we talk about their front line, but
their guards are players who have anchored them some nights.  
  
So they are well versed all the way around, but you know, we're going to play.
We're going to give it our best shot and see where that lands us.  
  
Q. How do you guys, for either of you guys, how do you think you guys
are a different team now than perhaps at the beginning of the year when you
played Baylor?  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: I would just say, you know, we're more confident and
everybody is coming into their roles. They understand their roles now, and you
know, we have an emphasis of competing now, and that's been the main focus
for, you know, most of the tournament right now. You know, we're just coming
into our own. Our chemistry is flowing. Everybody understands, and when
everybody is on the same page, I feel like we can be unstoppable.  
  
TYASHA HARRIS: Just to piggyback off what she said, we're just finally yelling
together and we know what we like to do for each other. We had to overcome
injuries early on this season, too, and I think everybody's back fully
healthy. It's going to be an exciting game.  
  
Q. In the first go-around with Baylor, you guys had some difficulty with
that front line. What have you discussed as, I mean, without giving away
company secrets or whatever, but what have y'all discussed in terms of like,
okay, we're healthier and some of the younger bigs have more experience now;
have you looked at things you can do differently?  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: Yeah, I think our emphasis is just to be physical with them.
You know, it's going to be a very physical game and we feel like as long as we
go out there and compete, you know, like you said, everybody is healthy now. I
feel like we're in a better position to give them our best shot.  
  
Q. Asked Coach the same thing, when Baylor beat you earlier, you were
4-4 and then you won 13 of the next 14. What's the big reason for that,
besides just saying -- being healthy?  
TYASHA HARRIS: Can you repeat it?  
  
Q. What's the difference from the start of the season and the last 14
games when you were on a roll.  
TYASHA HARRIS: Just to reflect on what we just said, just yelling. We
emphasize a lot off the court just being around each other a lot, and having a
lot of team activities just to get to know each other deeper.  
  
I think on a deeper level, just knowing each other deeper, we trust each other
more and we have more confidence going on to the court. I feel like people
knew that we had each other back and we had a bigger purpose, not just
basketball. Just having a sisterhood of all things and I think that helped us
as the season went on.  
  
Q. Did Baylor do anything to surprise you in that first meeting?  
TYASHA HARRIS: I don't think they did anything to surprise us, really. I think
it was just more of us just not being ready and just not -- not having a full
team there yet, but I don't think nothing really surprised us. No.  
  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: I would just say the same thing she said. I mean, nothing
surprised us. They are a very good Baylor team, and I mean, I would just base
it solely off of us not being completely healthy. You know, when everyone's
not healthy, we're not able to play to our strengths necessarily, you know.  
  
Q. Alexis, you guys play a lot of players, Baylor has potential to play
a lot of players. How will depth shape the game tomorrow?  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: I think depth will be a very key component to the game. You
know, just the fact that we have more players who can come in and come out and
exchange. You know, maybe we'll be able to play a lot of people. We know they
are going to be ready, so I think that's just good.  
  
We've been playing a lot of people throughout the entire season, so they won't
shy away from this moment because this is a big moment and I feel like
everybody is prepared for it.  
  
Q. In the first meeting, you guys said you were going to be physical and
pack the paint. Juicy hit a three really early in that, like ten, 15 seconds
in and they had some success from the perimeter. Did that make you kind of
change the way you were playing or how big a factor was that in that big first
quarter, because it was pretty even, second, third and fourth quarter.  
TYASHA HARRIS: Yeah, we talk a lot about like the front court and I think
their backcourt is just as important.  
  
So this matchup now, we are focusing on both sides. We know their guards can
contribute just as much as their post play. It's just getting the other people
who don't really score that much to score more.  
  
ALEXIS JENNINGS: Just to piggyback off of Ty, allowing ourselves to put
complete and total pressure out there, we understand that everybody out there
is going to be a threat. I just feel like our pressure needs somebody similar
to Belmont and the Florida State game, as well. As long as we apply a lot of
pressure, I feel like we can be able to disrupt them.  
  
TYASHA HARRIS: And like you said, putting four quarters together.

_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Q. South Carolina looks like the deepest team you'll have played in a
little bit and they also have the experience of winning the National
Championship two years ago. How do those things factor in as you start to game
plan for them?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, we certainly see how many minutes kids play. That's
one of the things you look at when scouting a team. You know, each coach knows
what they have to do. I don't play that many players. If I play that many
players, we're way ahead or we're way behind. But it's effective.  
  
They are very good. They are not the same team that won the National
Championship two years ago, with the exception of I think Cuevas-Moore and
Harrigan, so we're very much aware of it. I can't tell you any more as to why
they play that many players, but it works for them.  
  
Q. You beat them by 25 back in December as you prepare for this rematch.
How have they changed?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Were you at that game? Don't answer it. I know you weren't.
I was looking for you.  
  
Q. I was honest another assignment.  
COACH KIM MULKEY: But it couldn't have been more important than them. I'm
pulling for women's basketball, man.  
  
We did play them obviously. They're a different team now. We're a different
team now. Some players that didn't play much in that game are now huge factors
for them. You know about their guard play and how quick they are and how many
players that they play. They like to push it and get up-and-down the floor.  
  
The difference probably in that game and probably what you'll see tomorrow is
they started out in a zone defense, I'm assuming because of our bigs, they
stayed in it and we jumped in on that really quick. Our guards hit a lot of
perimeter shots, and then they got out of the zone.  
  
I don't anticipate that happening because how effective our guards were
against them in December but also our guards are pretty good.  
  
While we have Cox and Kalani inside, we are not too shabby at other positions,
either.  
  
Q. Because of how much they have change, how much do you look at what
happened that night?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: You don't. You don't. You look at the most current games
that you can, and what's that we look at is a lot of the SEC games and how
they defended Mississippi State with their big. Go to the most current stuff
you can find, and you flush that. We flushed that game after it was over
because it was a good matchup as far as going on the road to see what we were
made of and what our strengths and weaknesses were but it was flushed quickly
because you have to prepare for the next opponent.  
  
Q. You've been to these regionals and Final Fours as a player, assistant
and head coach. Does it change at all for you over the years?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: A lot changes. More television coverage. More media. You
never get tired of it. Your competitive juices continue to flow, and what
you're most excited for as you grow older as a coach is you're excited for
those young ladies in the locker room because it's exciting for those freshmen
who have never been to the NCAA playoffs. It's exciting for anybody on your
staff that's never been.  
  
For me, it just keeps your juices flowing and you -- you're more experienced,
obviously, but we're going to have fun with it.  
  
Q. What do you take from the 2013 Sweet 16 loss? Similar situation to
this one where you were heavily favored and came in, I think on a long winning
streak, as well.  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I knew that you would ask me about that 2012 National
Championship, but you want to focus on the negative, right? All right.  
  
Are you talking about the Louisville loss? You can't compare South Carolina to
Louisville. Those teams are totally different. I just think it was a game,
looking back on it, that was incredibly physical; that we had not ever seen
before, and we're pretty physical ourselves. A lot of three-point shots taken
and a lot of three-point shots made, and we made just a great effort to get
back in the game and had a shot there at the end and missed it.  
  
But that's why it's called March Madness, there are no guarantees. We played
these guys in December and guarantees us nothing. If you think we're walking
around with our chests poked out and our heads really big and licking our
chops, you don't know a lot about me and my personality.  
  
We have a respectful fear of everybody we play, and that's the way I approach
coaching. If we were playing a team that had not won a game all year, I'm
going to do the same thing in that locker room, the same kind of scouting
report, because that's how I coach. I just have a respectful fear of the next
opponent.  
  
Q. You have experience in the Big 12 playing teams twice a year. I was
just wondering, do you notice a big difference between playing teams the first
time, the second time? Is it much harder to win that second time?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Sometimes it is. It depends on if you go on the road first
or you're playing at home second.  
  
I think that I can't speak for other coaches, but I probably think they agree
with me. Guys, when you're playing in-conference, we know everything about
each other. You can't even breathe. They know our calls. You have to change
your calls from each time you play them. They know the strengths, weaknesses,
take this away.  
  
I believe the NCAA Tournament is a breath of fresh air when you get out of the
conference. I've always believed that because you're seeing, although we're
playing South Carolina, you're still seeing a new opponent and I can't imagine
when you get to the NCAA playoff that it's any harder than conference,
particularly if you have good coaches and good teams in your conference that
are just going to beat each other up and know everything about each other.  
  
Q. This coliseum has such a rich history. What is it like for your team
to be here and playing at the groans borrow coliseum?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: It's my first time to ever be in Greensboro. We keep up with
the ACC, both men and women and we appreciate that they have a home base. This
is where they play every year. We don't have that in the Big 12. It alternates
every few years to a different site. So that tells me that it's much
appreciated by the fans and that there's great fan support, and I'm excited to
be here because I know with my accurate accept, somebody in North Carolina is
going to be more southern than me (winking).  
  
Q. I've heard other coaches talking about your team taking on your
personality. Do you see that with Dawn, too, with the South Carolina team?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: I think not just Dawn, but I think your team, everybody's
team takes on their coach's personality. That's just human nature, and I would
think, yes.  
  
You know, Dawn -- I'm going to date myself here, but Dawn, I go back to when
she was at Virginia playing for Debbie Ryan and I was an assistant at
Louisiana Tech and trying to figure out how to guard her and Tammy Reiss and
those guards.  
  
Dawn coaches the way she played. I coach the way I played, and we both played
for outstanding coaches and I would think, yeah, her team should. She's got a
resumé that's unbelievable. I'd want to emulate success.  
  
Q. You've obviously had the pleasure of coaching a heck of a lot of
great players and a lot of great bigs over the years, but this front line
y'all have this year is just about the most formidable thing I've ever seen.
How do they stack up in terms of your experience historically?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, it's like comparing your children; you can't. You have
to remember, I coached Griner, and with Griner were two 6-3s and 6-4s, and
that team went 40-0. So you don't care them. I think that with Kalani at 6-7
and then you have Cox at 6-4 and then you bring in two freshmen posts at 6-2
and 6-3 that are really different ballplayers, they are more athletic and run
the floor, while Kalani and Cox, you think are back to the basket post
players, they are really not. They can face up and shoot it. Their size is
just bigger.  
  
They work so well together, because a lot of it is, they pass to each other
well. I tease them all the time, our guards sometimes can't get the ball to
our bigs when they are open, but get the ball in another post player's hands
and she seems to be able to find it. Now, I don't know if that's the length
being able to see over the defense or if it's the post players taking care of
each other.  
  
They just work together well. They read each other well. They are friends.
They like each other. Those kids, they are special. But I can't compare them
to others in the past because I have been blessed to really coach some great
post play.  
  
Q. You're the No. 1 overall seed but not the favorite to win the
tournament. Do you feel you're being overlooked?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Oh, no. Somebody had to get that No. 1 overall seed
(winking) we'll take it. (Laughter).  
  
Q. Juicy said one of the things you told her after that freshman year
is, "Your defense has to get better if you're going to play for me." How have
you seen her improve from that send of the floor?  
COACH KIM MULKEY: Well, she's probably not the only player I've told that to.
Your freshman year is your most difficult year of your basketball career. It's
the most difficult year of your life, whether you're an athlete or not. You're
leaving home for the first time most of them, your comfort zone is gone. They
are all great players. They all have been dominant players in high school and
they have really only had to probably play one end of the floor throughout
their career.  
  
When you get to this level and you want to play at the elite of the elite,
you've got to play both ends of the floor. The only way they learn that is
experience it. I'll go back to Juicy fouled out at Kansas State her freshman
year. Played nine minutes and she fouled out.  
  
So that right there taught her more than anything I could tell her. She was
embarrassed. She got ragged on for months. But the cute story with that is
some of them that were ragging her fouled out their freshman year in less than
nine minutes, so it's lessons they learn from each other, and it usually
happens on the court, not from what I tell them.  
  
Q. For Kalani and Lauren. When you played USC in December, what things
impressed you most about them, and even though you won pretty easily, tell me
why you expect to face a tougher challenge from them tomorrow?  
KALANI BROWN: Even with the large margin of victory, they never gave up. They
were relentless, even late in the game, they hit some threes and tried to get
the momentum going for themselves. Their transition defense, I mean,
transition game, period, really like impressed me.  
  
LAUREN COX: Everybody is playing their best basketball right now. It's win and
advance; if you lose, you go home. So everybody is going to give you your best
shot, and it's going to be a completely different game.  
  
Like Kalani said, their transition game is really good. They are really quick.
So we're going to have to get back on transition defense.  
  
Q. Chloe, can you talk about facing their guards and what you expect to
see from them?  
CHLOE JACKSON: Like they said, their transition game is good. They are quick.
They are going to get out and run with us. And they are going to be aggressive
on the ball on defense, so I just expect them to be physical, quick.  
  
Q. Playing South Carolina as a member of LSU for as many years as you
did and then coming here, how much has that team changed out A'ja Wilson?  
KALANI BROWN: I think they are more dependent on their guards than they were
with A'ja. With A'ja she was a force to be reckoned with down in the post, but
they are definitely more dependent on their guard play, I would say.  
  
Q. Obviously your first matchup was pretty one-sided in your favor, but
practice leading up to this one, how have you made adjustments tactically or
kind of thought about, you know, what do we need to do different, if anything;
how might they attack us differently or how can we attack them differently
versus the last time-out?  
CHLOE JACKSON: I think they started the game out in the zone, and I don't
think that was really their -- like their go-to defense that they wanted to
play, so I feel like they are going to play us in a man. That's kind of what
they are more used to.  
  
I expect that, and then I just expect them to push it and get up -- get up a
lot of threes. I think they are going to want to shoot a lot of threes and
hopefully make them.  
  
LAUREN COX: I think they are going to throw a lot of different lineups at us.
They had some players who are playing more minutes now that didn't play
against us like Cuevas-Moore and their other post player, Harrigan, is that
her name? Yeah.  
  
KALANI BROWN: I think they are going to try to be more physical, especially
with us in the paint, but it's nothing we haven't seen before, and like I
said, their transition game has definitely improved.  
  
Q. Going deeper into the NCAA Tournament, sometimes that senior
leadership can mean a lot more to a team. How much more responsibility are you
placing on your shoulders as you go even farther?  
KALANI BROWN: You know, us three up here are pretty much the captains of the
team. So, you know, we know we've been on this level before, and just trying
to get our young ones, showing them what to do in the right way. But we've had
a few good practices leading up to this point, and I think everybody is
focused and, I think they really made my job and their jobs a lot easier.  
  
Q. Like you said, the three of you are the captains and get a lot of
attention. What player on your team do you think that people might be
surprised by in this round of the tournament? Who should people be on the
lookout for that might not be the headliner?  
KALANI BROWN: I would say Didi Richards. A lot of people don't give her
recognition but her defense is outstanding, and I think she's overlooked a
lot.  
  
LAUREN COX: I agree with Kalani about Didi, and then Moon and NaLyssa coming
off the bench, they kind of come in and give us a spark. Moon can hit some
outside shots. She plays really good defense and NaLyssa can get inside and
make some moves and get us some offensive rebounds.  
  
CHLOE JACKSON: Yeah, I agree with LC. All of those girls, Didi, Moon and
NaLyssa. NaLyssa is a comes in and she rebounds. She's definitely come in big
lately with a lot of rebounds, put-backs, and Didi she cuts the baskets well
and she defends for us really well. And Moon, she did a great job against
South Carolina last time, so I expect the same out of her this time.  
  
Q. So Kalani, you've been here for four years. You've gone through these
games more than anyone else. What do you think is different about your team
this year and what can bring you all the way?  
KALANI BROWN: I think that we have a lot of depth. We can throw any lineup out
there and not miss a beat. You know, this lime last year, we didn't have that
much depth, and you know, at that point we were pretty much exhausted.  
  
So everybody's focused. Everybody's looking for one goal, and I think that's
-- I can't say that the whole team, the entire team, like every single person
was focused as we are now.  
  
Q. More on that depth. You really haven't had to play the entire game
all season long. I guess a two-part question. Are you prepared for that, and
were there games in the past where you wanted to tell Coach, you wanted to
stay in the games longer?  
KALANI BROWN: I am prepared for that, I would say. I've kept myself in shape
doing extra for the games I got maybe like ten to 12 minutes, because there
have been games like that.  
  
But stay in the game longer, for what? Give the young ones a chance to learn.  
  
Q. You guys are 33-1, but y'all have at least been tested and y'all have
been pushed in several games. How much does that help at this time of the
year, that you've been in some of those tight games that you had to pull
out?  
LAUREN COX: It's been good for us. Especially for the young ones to kind of
see that. I mean, we've played in some tough ones the years before but playing
many some of those especially close to the tournament, it helps us pull
through and have the experience for when we do have one of those games.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
GREENSBORO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+GREENSBORO)

  

## March 29, 2019

  

### [Wes Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=26514)

### [DD Rogers](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36637)

### [Kiara Leslie](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35190)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
COACH WES MOORE: Obviously we're very excited about being here. Very proud of
what this team has been able to accomplish, and you know, again, it's great to
be in Greensboro. The Greensboro Sports Committee does such an awesome job of
putting these events together, and the volunteers, we appreciate all the work
they put into it.  
  
Like I said we're excited about being here. We know we have a big challenge
ahead of us. Iowa is a very well-coached and very talented team. We'll have
our hands full, but again, we're glad to have another opportunity to continue
our season.  
  
Q. After the win against Connecticut the other night, talking to DD
about playing, her career might send and you said you'd prefer for us to keep
it light. So what's light look around the N.C. State locker room and
program?  
COACH WES MOORE: I think right now, you know, we're feeling pretty good. I
guess what I'm saying is, don't really want to talk about the end. Because you
know, again, these kids, obviously DD has been here four years and has put a
lot into our program, so I want to keep it light. Let's enjoy is it and go out
and play like we have all year and treat it like any other game.  
  
Q. Wanted to ask about the matchup with Megan Gustafson, what problems
she presents and what you've seen on tape from her?  
COACH WES MOORE: You're talking about a young lady who is averaging 28 points
a game and shooting 70 percent from the field, so you start there. That's a
great challenge.  
  
We've obviously had a couple of days to prepare, but you know, there's no
stopping her. It's just a matter of hoping you can slow her down a little bit,
but obviously she's got a lot of great players around her, as well.  
  
If it was just her, you know, you could put about four people around here and
get it done, but they have got a lot of players that can step up and hit
shots. You know, they have got three young ladies shooting the three pretty
well in their starting lineup, and Stewart is doing a great job. Her field
goal percentage is very high, as well, at the 4-position.  
  
So they have got a lot of weapons, but you've got to start with Gustafson for
sure.  
  
Q. The 70 percent shooting, that's a staggering number.  
COACH WES MOORE: Yeah.  
  
Q. That's got to be more than just getting shots close to the basket.
What does she well around the rim or in that area?  
COACH WES MOORE: Well, she has good basketball IQ. She knows how to get seals
and work angles. Very strong. Has a variety of ways she can score the ball.
Her teammates do an excellent job of putting the ball where she can go get it
and score it.  
  
But definitely, she's got a nice stroke outside. She hasn't shot from the
three a lot. I think she could. Her shot looks good. She's more around the
high post area, but again, it's mostly inside and just it's funny, you watch
some film on her and they understand, to get off that left block, that's her
area and let's get her the ball.  
  
Yeah, just, again, a great player.  
  
Q. You've beaten preseason projections every year you've been in
Raleigh, and this year you guys were projected fourth, lost Ealey before the
season even started and somehow through the mess of injuries, you still beat
it and finished third in the conference. At the certain point, the next man up
cliché doesn't cover what y'all have been able to do.  
COACH WES MOORE: Like I said, I couldn't be prouder of them. You know, I've
told everyone before -- this is a close-knit group. We really strive on
getting young ladies that are good people and consequently, they really care
about each other. They are close. They spend a lot of time together.  
  
So when you have an injury, it's not just the physical pain that the person
involved endures; it's the whole team emotionally as friends have to
experience, as well, and to go through that four times in one season is really
tough. Three of those obviously were in games.  
  
You try the first basket back, I think every saw them, a little bit down, and
you fought through that practice, and then the next one, you just say, hey,
you know, our expectations haven't changed. We've got to get back to work and
we've got to do what we do. I'm proud, Kai Crutchfield has done an
unbelievable job. Elissa Cunane, a local product here. She was already making
contributions, but I think with the injury of Erika Cassell, she knew: "Now I
have to do even more."  
  
And then just the whole team. You don't replace some of those great players
with just one person. It's a team effort, and everyone's had to do a little
more and maybe do something that they haven't been expected to do in the past,
and they just found a way to get it done. Like I said, it's an amazing group
of young ladies and I'm excited for them.  
  
Q. You just mentioned Kai. Obviously she's a local Raleigh product. Can
you talk about her emergence the last couple games?  
COACH WES MOORE: Last ten games, I think she's 10-of-14 from the three-point
line. You know, she's sometimes a little bit quiet or whatever. I'm on her all
the time about being a little more aggressive, because Kai is blessed. I mean,
she's a good athlete. She's got a great basketball body.  
  
You know, I think there's still more -- I always think there's more in the
tank, you know, on every one of them. I'm on her sometimes, but the way she
stepped up -- and to be honest, she did this a year ago to get to the Sweet 16
when we beat Maryland. She hit some big shots in that game, as well. Hopefully
she likes this stage.  
  
Yeah, we're excited about, for her -- and you mentioned local product. Of
course Kayla Ealey was injured, but Raleigh kid. And then Kai and then Kiara
Leslie. Of course DD from Charlotte. KJ from the metropolis of Jamesville,
North Carolina. We've got a bunch of North Carolina kids on this roster and I
think it means a little more to them to represent N.C. State.  
  
Q. What advantage is that for y'all?  
COACH WES MOORE: I think having played over here before, and obviously, just
playing over here a couple of weeks ago or a few weeks ago, gives you a little
bit of a comfort zone maybe. We are expecting to see a lot of red out there
hopefully. So I think that makes a big difference.  
  
Our crowds at Reynolds, they have been very vocal, very loud and I think
that's been an advantage for us playing at home and we are hoping that we can
kind of carry that over here, but I think Greensboro has always been very
supportive of women's basketball in general. I hope everybody will come out
and it will be a great crowd, great energy, and I think your kids play better
in that atmosphere.  
  
Q. Has this group been loose the last couple weeks? Are they having fun
and enjoying the ride so far?  
COACH WES MOORE: I think so. Sometimes in practice, you know, I'm always
focused and on task, so to speak. But I think this week, I think we've enjoyed
it. Like I said, I'm proud of them. I'm excited about this opportunity. And so
we've had Ray good time with -- you know, we came over yesterday, and had a
good meal last night, and just being around them, I think everybody's loose
and feel good about where we are and how we're playing, and -- and hopefully,
kind of savor the moment.  
  
Q. It's not random or happenstance that N.C. State is second in the
country in fewest fouls, but going back to last year's Sweet 16 game against
Mississippi State when the foul trouble hit early second quarter, their big
player took over, and the game was almost done at that stage.  
With that established, have you had any other conversations with Elissa
about defending the post of Gustafson this week, and what kind of moves does
Gustafson possess that you want to make sure that doesn't attract or doesn't
draw fouls from Elissa tomorrow?  
  
COACH WES MOORE: Yeah, that's a big challenge, no doubt. We're going to have
to -- she's going to be a point of emphasis. I don't think that's any secret.
You're going to try to provide a lot of help there. So hopefully we don't
leave Elissa on an island too much where she's the only person between her and
the rim.  
  
But yeah, it's definitely something you worry about, because she is a very
physical player. She's going to attack, you know, the defensive player and try
to get seals, and unfortunately sometimes when that happens, they call the
fouls on the defense.  
  
But she's just going to have to be smart and we're going to have to be smart
about mixing up the defense maybe, and giving her a lot of help so that it's
not quite as easy to get her one-on-one.  
  
Appreciate it. Thank y'all for being here.  
  
Q. For both of y'all. I just wanted to ask, you guys obviously have
suffered quite a few injuries this season, but somehow, you know, still beat
your preseason projections. Still finished third in the conference. It's just
been unbelievable watching this team just keep reloading and keep kind of
changing to fit the new personnel as they come in.  
What has that been like for y'all as far as adjusting to different people
and changing your games, and how has things in the locker room kind of helped
that process along?  
  
KIARA LESLIE: I think that just we knew once we started losing the players
that we all had to come together and contribute a little bit more in different
areas. I think that we have all done well, especially the freshmen, Elissa and
Kai, playing major roles and coming in and starting late in the season, and I
think they did a really good job of that.  
  
DD ROGERS: Yeah, I'd agree with Kiara. I think it's just a matter of people
stepping up in the roles that we lost, and I think that everyone needed to,
did a very good job of doing so.  
  
Q. DD had a long conversations about this in the locker room, so I'll
ask your opinion. Is this team loose? Who is the person keeping you guys
laughing in the locker room away from the court?  
KIARA LESLIE: Well, I would say Grace Hunter used to do that, now, it's hard
to say. I mean, we all joke around when we want to, but no one was as really a
big goofball as much as she was.  
  
Q. After the adversity you suffered at the start of your college career,
how much more does a season like this mean?  
KIARA LESLIE: It means a lot. Coming from where I came from, not a lot of
people know my entire story. So just conquering and every coming what I've
been through has been a blessing. This senior year has been going great, but
we're not finished yet.  
  
Q. Several questions. In your time at Maryland, the year after the final
four, your freshman year, your sophomore year, you played Iowa a couple times
the regular season. Gustafson was a freshman then. I know your roles were
different then but do you have any recollections of her as she moved from the
bench to a starter, and did you have any visions that she would become the
player that she is today?  
KIARA LESLIE: Over the years, she definitely has improved a lot. I didn't know
she was going to be this great in her senior year and we were going to be
facing her. It's definitely going to be a great challenge. I think we're up
for it and we'll see how it turns out tomorrow morning.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how Kai has stepped up the last two or three games
for you guys?  
DD ROGERS: I think Kai has done a great job. She shot really well in the last
couple of games. I think she shot well in the ACC Tournament, as well. She's
just, you know, accepting the role that she's in and doing all that she can to
help the team, and it's definitely showing.  
  
Q. You're likely to be matched up against Stewart a lot tomorrow in N.C.
State's man offense, man defense. What have you seen from her as far as her
skills as they pertain to you?  
DD ROGERS: She's really good 15 feet and in, so I just need to get to her from
there, yeah.  
  
Q. Obviously Iowa runs a lot of man-to-man defense, 2-3 zones,
triangles-and-two that we've seen in the tournament so far. How much of the
emphasis in practice these last few days has been on the zone offense, on the
junk offense, if they throw those at you tomorrow?  
KIARA LESLIE: We've definitely seen a lot of this throughout ACC play. So I
think Coach prepared us way back then. I think that we're going to run through
a little bit of that today to freshen up, but I think that we have some things
for all the defenses that they might throw at us.  
  
DD ROGERS: Yeah, what Kiara said (laughing).  
  
Q. Last year, the same level, the same part of the tournament, you faced
a team with a very dominant center. What lessons can you take from the
Mississippi State game into this game tomorrow?  
KIARA LESLIE: They are both similar and different in many ways. They both have
a dominant post player that we need to try to take away, and they also have
outside threats, as well. I think that Coach has definitely prepared us for
what we might see tomorrow, and we have to work together to get this win.  
  
DD ROGERS: Yeah, like Kiara said, they run most of their offenses through
their post player, but we can't just rely strictly on trying to shut her down
completely, because like she said, they can easily kick it out and have
shooters outside the perimeter.  
  
Q. The overtime game against Virginia Tech earlier this season seemed
like a moment for this team in terms of being able to take a good couple
punches and come back and really persevere and gut out a win. I was wondering
if that felt like kind of a turning point to y'all, and if not, can you point
to a game where you really felt like everything was clicking?  
KIARA LESLIE: Definitely that game was tough. We went into overtime. But I
think that the way we pushed through overtime and the way the game ended
showed our toughness, and that we are capable of competing against a lot of
people.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
GREENSBORO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+GREENSBORO)

  

## March 29, 2019

  

### [Megan Gustafson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32141)

### [Makenzie Meyer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34740)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
Q. Could you describe what the season has been like for y'all?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: The season has been incredible, to be able to play with some
of my best friends and keep this going, it feels like a once-in-a-lifetime
opportunity right now and keep it going as long as we can.  
  
It's been so much fun being on a team with selfless players who care more
about winning than each other, and you know, it shows in our play. We know
we're all about the assists and sharing the ball and that's really what Iowa
Basketball is all about right now.  
  
MAKENZIE MEYER: I'd just say it's been such a magical season, and we've
accomplished so much on the court, and I think what's been most special about
this season is how well we get along together off the court.  
  
It's just been such a fun year with this group of girls, and like Megan said,
we're such an unselfish team and that's the way basketball should be played
and we've really enjoyed it.  
  
Q. Where have you improved the most as a player from your freshman year
to your senior year.  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I think just being more of a leader from my freshman year
until now. I grew up in a small town and was kind of quiet coming in and
taking everything in, and now I've really been able to develop into a leader
and I think that's the area I've improved in the most.  
  
Obviously basketball, too. I've developed over the years, thanks to my coaches
and my team, always trying to push me to be the best player I can be.  
  
Q. Obviously you have an opponent coming up, but Baylor, No. 1, been on
an incredible streak. Is this their tournament to lose, and what's the
pressure on them in this tournament?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, Baylor is a great really great team and they have some
really great post players and really great guards. We're focusing on N.C.
State right now, and that's our sole focus right now; and if we keep going,
maybe we'll run into them, maybe we won't.  
  
But honestly, I think it's anyone's game this year. There's been so many teams
that have proven themselves again and again. It's a really exciting time for
women's basketball, that's for sure.  
  
Q. Who was your favorite sports hero growing up and why?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: A couple summers ago, I started to watch Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
videos of his hook shot just so I could emulate that. That's something I tried
to work watching his videos, he's pretty great at that shot and I wanted to
work on that, so I would say him.  
  
Q. Did you ever get a chance to meet him?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: End of my junior year he came to speak at my university at an
auditorium. I got to meet him, it was really cool.  
  
Q. Do you have a special memory from that?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: After he spoke at the lecture, they had like a dining room
reception and we were as a team invited and he spoke to us, and then we were
able to shake his hand, take a picture. I didn't have a long conversations or
anything like that but it was cool. I was able to get a picture.  
  
Q. Curious about the matchup with N.C. State. What do they do that
concerns you? Where do you see some of the key match-ups?  
MAKENZIE MEYER: Well, they shoot the three-point shot really, really well.
They have a couple really good shooters from the outside and obviously they
have a really good inside game, too.  
  
So they really are a dual threat team and they can take it to the hoop. We are
just going to have to play a very solid game defensively.  
  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: I'd have to agree. They are pretty well balanced. They have a
great post player and they have some great guards, so we are just going to
have to be ready defensively.  
  
Q. A lot of players follow others who are really good at their positions
to compare. When did you first know about Cunane?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Obviously probably this tournament, getting the scout on
them. I've heard some great things about her and I'm not too familiar with
N.C. State because they are not really in our conference but again she's
probably going to be a really great center. She already is, and so you know,
I'm going to have to be ready defensively, that's for sure?  
  
Q. Talk about the scout on Cunane far as it applies to you and your
teammate and as you see her as an 18-year-old, do you feel like you're almost
looking into a mirror? I know your styles are a little bit different, but how
much of you do you see in her reflecting back three years?  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, she has really great hands, being able to get the ball.
Her teammates are feeding her really well inside, and she has great finish
which is always really important in a post players.  
  
I do see some similarities in myself when I was younger, and again they do a
really nice job of feeding her. She's a hard worker inside and defensively I'm
going to have a tall task, as well as my teammates are, too.  
  
Q. As far as out of conference play, you guys certainly did not have a
cakewalk of a schedule this season. Was there a particular moment before you
hit conference play when you said, all right, we went toe-to-toe with, you
know, a Notre Dame or whosoever be it. Was there a moment before you got into
conference play when you said, you know what, we can hang with anybody; we've
got that this year.  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Yeah, I think for me personally, thinking about that West
Virginia game when we played in the Bahamas, we were down 24 points and we
came back and we won. It was honestly one of the best games I've ever been
able to play in and at that point we knew that we're a gritty team. We're
resilient. We can face anything that was thrown at us, so I think that was
probably a turning point for me.  
  
MAKENZIE MEYER: Yeah, the first thing that came to my mind was the West
Virginia game as well. I think we knew all along this was going to be a
special season. We have a lot of players coming back from last season and
really have a chip on our shoulder from the first round loss last year. We're
excited to be making strides in the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. N.C. State generally plays a lot of man-to-man and generally puts
Leslie on the strongest perimeter shooter with a decent amount of size. If
Leslie is on to you, if you've been watching the scout over the last few days,
can you talk about that? What's your game plan going in one-on-one against
her.  
MAKENZIE MEYER: I think we are going to try to stick with our same game plan
that we have all season. We really play a team game so I don't really imagine
myself going one-on-one too much. I'm going to try to take it to the hoop.
I've been shooting well from the outside, so I'm just going to keep looking to
attack the basket or draw fouls or dish it out to my teammates. Just stick
with the game plan that we have all season.  
  
Q. You have played a myriad of different defenses, man, triangle two,
other zone defenses. Based on what you've seen from N.C. State so far and the
success you've had with all those defenses in the tournament so far, what are
you most comfortable and what do you think works best against them?  
MAKENZIE MEYER: Like you said, we've seen a variety of different defenses and
I can't really think of any particular defense that has slowed us down too
much. We've done a really good job in practice of trying to emulate a variety
of different defenses.  
  
So I mean, I guess we're thinking N.C. State is going to come out in man-to-
man defense. That's what they have been doing all year. We're preparing for
that but we're ready for anything to be thrown at us.  
  
I don't know, we've been practicing a couple different defenses, but we're
going to throw a couple different things out and see what works best for us.  
  
MEGAN GUSTAFSON: Can't give away all the secrets.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
GREENSBORO](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+GREENSBORO)

  

## March 29, 2019

  

### [Lisa Bluder](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16868)

  
_Greensboro, North Carolina_  
  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Like everybody else, we're thrilled to still be playing but
we certainly would still like to be playing in April just like everybody else.
You know, this is just a great opportunity for our players, but we're not
satisfied right now. We're still hungry.  
  
We're excited to be able to play North Carolina State. We know that they
obviously have the home-court advantage here, playing here numerous times in
the tournament, and only being a few miles away from their campus.  
  
But at the same time, our team has just had such great energy all year. The
energy that they need is just within our circle and we're excited to have the
opportunity to come here and showcase our team in the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. For people here in town who haven't seen your team play, there's
going to be a lot of curiosity about Megan. What can fans expect to see from
her?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I could write a book right now. It's hard to put into just
a few sentences. Megan is just a tremendous player, as far as you can look at
her statistics and see that she leads the United States in five different
statistical categories, including points per game, field goal percentage.
She's a double-double machine. She not only scores but she rebounds for us.
She finishes up the defense with an unbelievable job on the defensive glass.  
  
But I think what makes Megan so special is not just her basketball statistics.
I think that's really a disservice to her to just look at her statistics and
say that's what she is as a player. She's so much more than that. She is a
teammate; one of the best teammates, one of the hardest workers I've ever been
around. She's a great leader and academic student. She's a double business
major at the University of Iowa in finance and marketing. She's a community
role model for us. There's boys and girls around the State of Iowa that look
up to her and emulate her. She's an unbelievable role model.  
  
I don't like to just talk about her basketball abilities, although that could
fill up complete newspaper herself, but it's what she is as a person that
makes Megan special.  
  
Q. You're back in the Sweet 16 and won the conference tourney in many,
many years. Has this season felt special and different to you?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Yeah I think you have to have a special team or you're not
here, we're in the Sweet 16, Top-4 percent of the teams in the United States
are here right now. I think every Sweet 16 team is special and ours certainly
is.  
  
I think that this team not only has the talent but they have the camaraderie
to go with it and the unselfish play, we're one of the top teams in the
country in assists and this team knows how to distribute the ball and they are
very unselfish. That's the different element is not only are they talented and
we have an All-American on this team -- you know, I don't like to say -- Megan
has a great supporting cast, and I think you don't get here without that.  
  
You can have an All-American on your team, but you don't get this far unless
there's a great supporting cast around her. But I think what makes this team
special, it's their love for each other. It's that they believe that they are
a family and they will do anything for each other, and I think that's what
makes the difference.  
  
Q. You've had a chance to look at N.C. State. What concerns you about
them? What do they do that could be a problem?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: You know, I think they are so good at spot-up 3s. I mean,
38 percent of their shots are 3s. They shoot the 3 ball very well.  
  
I think that Cunane is a great match-up with Megan. She has more heighth than
Megan. Obviously Megan has a little more experience, but I see her as just one
of the next up-and-coming great posts in America, so I think that that's going
to be a terrific matchup.  
  
I think Leslie is a great player that can score in a variety of ways and I
think those kids are so hard to defend when you have to worry about not only
their three-point shot but their ability to beat you off the bounce. Her pull-
up jumper at 15 is beautiful. Those type of things.  
  
But they are all good players. Crutchfield and the way she's shooting the 3
right now, are you kidding, 70 percent in the last five games. That's
unbelievable numbers. There's a lot of things that certain me about them.  
  
Q. Hate to keep harping on Megan, but the 70 percent shooting
percentage, that's staggeringly good. It has to be more than just being close
to the basket. How do you explain that kind of shooting percentage?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: Practice. I mean, the kid just practices and practices.
Works hard.  
  
You know, there are some kids that kind of have a false confidence at this
time of year. You know, they have kind of pulled the wool over people's eyes,
but she's earned her confidence. I mean, she's been in the gym from day one
that she walked on our campus. She's been one of the hardest workers we've
ever had, so she gets her confidence through a lot of hard work, and it's
there. It's there.  
  
Q. I saw Megan was ranked as the No. 12 recruit in the nation. Can you
imagine 11 better than her, and what was her recruiting story like?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: She was 90th, if I remember right. She just made the
Top-100 or something like that -- 12th in her position.  
  
You know, we found Megan around her sophomore year in high school and was
putting up unbelievable numbers at Wisconsin in the state tournament, and then
we were able to get her to our campus for our elite camp following her
sophomore year and that's when we knew how special she was when we actually
had the chance to work with her on the court. It was then that we offered her
a scholarship. She visited some other schools obviously but committed to us
relatively early. I think the end of her junior year is when she committed to
us.  
  
Q. Beyond talking about Gustafson, let's talk about some other players
and some match-ups, because Wes is worried about certain matchups and I'm sure
you're concerned others. What are some of the matchups that you want to see;
that you would like to see; that you are concerned about seeing?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: I think every single matchup you look at on paper is really
good. I mean, I think point guard to point guard, I think you look at every
single one of those match-ups and they are all intriguing. They are all
interesting.  
  
I think that you look at Rogers and what -- how explosive she is as an athlete
in what she does, I think that's a great match-up with Hannah Stewart. I think
every one of these match-ups -- it's kind of ironic, both of our teams are not
very deep.  
  
So I think the whole -- you know, I could go down every single one of them. I
think all the matchups are very unique and interesting.  
  
Q. Following up on the post players, what do you see -- do you see
anything in Cunane that you saw when Gustafson was 16, 17, 18 years old and
what types of defenses has she seen that the Big Ten has thrown at her over
the four years?  
COACH LISA BLUDER: For Cunane, I think she's got better body balance than
Megan had when she was a freshman. Megan came in never really lifting weights
or having that kind of background; so the weight development that she did, the
strength development that she did, she just became a better athlete.  
  
But I think Cunane, she's a good athlete now. I think she runs the court well
now. I think her -- she seals extremely well. I mean, her teammate -- just
like our team with Megan, I think does a great job of feeding her. I think
they do a great job on seals.  
  
I definitely think she is definitely one of the best up-and-coming best
centers in America. I really believe that. I think we're going to see a lot
about her in the future.  
  
Q. Any defenses you've seen --  
COACH LISA BLUDER: You name it, we've seen it. Everybody's tried all kinds of
stuff. You know, has it worked? I don't know. She's shooting 70 percent,
averaging 28 points. I don't think a whole lot has worked, but we've seen
everything.

_Portland, Oregon_  
  
Oregon-88, Mississippi State-84  
  
THE MODERATOR: With us now, Mississippi State.  
  
Coach, congratulations on a great season and a hard-fought game, very
entertaining contest. We'll begin with your opening statement.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: First of all, just congratulations to Oregon. I thought they
were really special today. They're going to go on a journey that they haven't
been on before. We've been on it a couple times. It's going to be a really
special week for them.  
  
For us, man, I just can't be prouder of my team today. You talk about
competitive, tough. I just thought my team just fought tooth and nail today in
a really hostile environment. Credit to the community, for the people that
came out supporting women's basketball. A great crowd out there today. It's
great for our game.  
  
I just thought my team was just phenomenal. I mean, I couldn't be prouder of
them for how hard they played, how hard they fought against a really good
team. I've watched a ton of film. I've not seen them make that many threes in
a while. They made shots today. You got to take your hat off to them. When you
make shots in a big game like that, you got to tip your hat to them.  
  
For us, really thankful for Anriel and Jordan, who transferred to us. Could
have gone anywhere. Believed in our program. Wanted to be a part of it.
Trusted us. Their families entrusted us with them. Of course, Jazz and T have
been with us, along with Zion, all four years. Jazzmun 13 assists, no
turnovers today, 13 points. It's what she's doing now. I mean, she has just
continued to develop and develop and develop. I've never seen a point guard in
four years develop as much as she has.  
  
Of course, Teaira, I can say the same thing about her. I told her when I
walked in there, four years ago up in Connecticut, we got beat in the Sweet
16. That's the last time we've ever come in from a post-season and not be
headed to the Final Four. That was not a good day.  
  
But I walked in that day, Teaira McCowan might have been the only one that
competed that day when we got beat by UConn. To see her growth and development
over the past four years, even into today, I mean, you can see it. I see it.
Man, she's going to be an unbelievable pro and have a tremendous career. I'm
just so proud of her.  
  
She made this whole team, these two, all four of them, they've impacted my
life in an unbelievable way. Made me a better coach, husband, better father.
I'm just so thankful for them.  
  
When Jordan came to us, just how humble she was. She was a McDonald's All-
American coming out of high school. She just wanted to be somewhere, she said,
I just want to be part of a team and a family. Nothing about minutes. Nothing
about starting. Just want to be part of a family.  
  
Anriel, very similar. But wanted to win championships. Coach, I've never won a
championship. I want to win championships. I want you to develop my game, help
get me to where I want to go to.  
  
For us, my staff, that team in there is hurting. I am just really proud of
them. I told them, they've impacted a community and a university unlike
anything I've ever seen. We could all go through life and not have the
opportunity nor the impact that these kids have had on a place like
Mississippi State. It is a very special place. The impact that these kids have
had, like I said, it's unlike anything I've seen.  
  
We'll move on. Again, congratulations to Kelly and his staff and that team. We
know what that feels like. We'll go back to work.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up at this time to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jazz and Jordan, when they were packing things in on T and Anriel,
y'all had to hit some shots. How did you feel like you were able to get things
going offensively especially when they went on that spurt?  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: We just knew they were going to sag on T. Whenever I got an
open look, I took it. Coach told me, Whenever you get the open look, take it,
so I did.  
  
JORDAN DANBERRY: Same as what Jazz said. We just knew we had to knock down
those shots, play through Teaira, just make 'em.  
  
Q. Teaira, you've lost in the last game of the season twice. How does
this feeling compare to the times you lost in those games?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: A loss is a loss, you know. It doesn't feel good. But I'm
proud of my team, my coaching staff we got this far. We had a great season.
Nothing to hang our heads on. Yeah, it hurts, but we'll be okay.  
  
Q. Anriel, I was wondering if you could give an oversight the difference
between the game earlier this year and then the game tonight. Did Oregon do
anything differently than what they did in that first game? How did you guys
have to adjust?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: I believe that the first game they hurt us a lot on the pick'n
roll. I think that we adjusted, we did good. We defended the pick'n roll much
better this time. They found another option, which were the open shooters, and
they were knocking down shots.  
  
Q. Jazzmun and Anriel, can you talk a little bit about the challenges of
guarding Sabrina man-to-man.  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: She's a great player. We did all we could. I mean, she's good,
so... Hats off to her.  
  
ANRIEL HOWARD: What Jazz said.  
  
Q. Teaira and Anriel, coach talked about this a little bit. When you
think back to this game, how much are you going to remember the challenge of
having to come to Oregon, trying to beat the Ducks on their second home
turf?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: I mean, it's not easy. We lost both times. But I do think that
we played harder the second time. The first time was on their court. They had
that advantage. But this time they still had a lot of their fans here.  
  
Teaira.  
  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Like coach said, they shot the ball great. They had great ball
movement. Whenever we took away one thing, they were kicking out to shooters.
They weren't recovering. That was the challenge. We didn't guard the line.  
  
Q. Anriel, you've talked multiple times about wanting to come to
Mississippi State to win a national championship. Obviously you fall a little
short of that goal. Overall, what are your feelings on what you were able to
accomplish this year?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: (Tearing up.)  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's come back to that.  
  
Q. Teaira, how are you feeling after that collision at the end of the
third quarter? Holding your rib maybe.  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: It hurt a little bit. I went down. She fell. I fell on her
knee. I got hit in the ribs. I'll be okay.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Just going back to Anriel. I've been doing this 34 years y'all.
Every day, smile. Every day, motor is 120%. Every day, competing. What she
brought to our program... Could have gone anywhere in the country.  
  
She's a great kid. Her mom, her family have done an unbelievable job with her.
Just an unbelievable competitor. She's not done playing, trust me.  
  
What she brings, the energy and the effort she brings, y'all, I promise y'all
never seen anything like it on a consistent basis every day. Again, she came
to a place where she was a great rebounder. She came to a place that had the
best rebounder in the country, who has the best rebounder in the history of
the NCAA tournament. That's the confidence that this kid has. That's the giver
that she is. She knew that number may suffer, that's not about me. Let me see
if I can help her with those numbers and see if we can win a championship
together.  
  
That's what needs to be said about Anriel Howard. She is a tremendous young
lady and an unbelievable competitor. I mean, motor is off the chart.  
  
ANRIEL HOWARD: I think I can try to answer now. Thank you.  
  
Everything that coach said is all accurate. I came here to win championships.
I got two. It's a wonderful feeling. I never had a championship in basketball,
not at any level.  
  
Just to be able to get a feeling of that with these group of girls and this
coaching staff and the community and the fans, all of that, is something that
is undescribable. It's definitely a blessing. I'm just really grateful for the
opportunity that the coaches gave me and the girls for welcoming me and the
community, like I said. It's just been awesome.  
  
I just want to say thank you to everybody. So thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you so much. Congratulations on a very impressive
season.  
  
We will continue with questions for Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. You said yesterday you're a big note-taker. Looked like you were
taking some notes. What jumped out to you on the stat sheet as you're trying
to immediately process the game?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah, I mean, 13 out of 26 from the three-point line. You turn
those into twos, you know, you win the game. We were trying. We made notes at
halftime. They made eight, I think, at half. We knocked that down to five in
the second half.  
  
First thing that jumps off is 13 assists, no turnovers in an Elite 8 game. I'm
never getting off my soapbox about that kid. What an injustice to have an
award and she's not one of the top five in the country. That's a joke.  
  
They shot it really well. I don't know that I've ever been in a game where we
turned it over six times and we didn't win. I've never had that happen in 34
years in coaching. But we only forced them into eight.  
  
I got six kids that shot 47% or better. But, you know, at the end of the day,
y'all, it's on me because we got to guard better. Obviously I didn't have them
in the right position to do that. I pride myself on being a pretty good
defensive coach. I gave up 88 points tonight. You're not supposed to win
those, quite frankly.  
  
I'm disappointed in myself that it didn't happen for us. I'll go back, I'll
watch the film, and I'll get better. I'll learn. But these kids, they did
everything they could do. I mean, I couldn't be prouder of them. They fought
their guts out today in a really difficult arena against a really good team,
so...  
  
No particular stat other than my point guard had 13 and zero. I don't think
I've ever had that either.  
  
Q. I'm not trying to get you in trouble with this question, but the game
seemed to be called differently in the third quarter. Was that something you
felt? Do you think you guys struggled to adjust to that?  
VIC SCHAEFER: There's a one-word answer here, I'm just trying to figure out if
it's yes or no. Can we draw a poll, see what everybody thinks?  
  
I don't know. Obviously it was one quarter. In the fourth quarter, we had four
fouls before we got into the bonus with 50-some seconds left.  
  
I don't know. I'm all into the game, so at that moment I'm just trying to
coach my kids. That was part of my notes, in our first game, we got into a
little bit of a foul situation with them. That was part of my message today. I
read them part of my notes going into the game. One of them was, Hey, got to
play harder defensively, got to do a better job in help, and we got to clean
it up, we got to be clean.  
  
I'm going to be clean, and I'm done.  
  
Q. We can talk all we want about home-court advantage, but we're not on
the floor making decisions. Was there anything you can remember about the game
that you feel might have gone a different way if this were a true neutral
site?  
VIC SCHAEFER: You know, I just think -- I know where our game is, to answer
your question. I get it. It was a great environment. Our kids, we've been in
that environment a bunch. We played on the road in the Southeastern
Conference. I just thought a great environment. I was proud to be a coach in
that game today, be a part of an industry, women's basketball.  
  
Here is the thing. We probably could have played it somewhere else and been on
a completely neutral floor and played in front of a thousand people. Do we
want that or do we want to play in that environment today?  
  
You know what, I liked playing out there today. I think my kids liked playing
out there today. It was a great environment. You know what, I have no clue
what the outcome would have been playing in front of a thousand. But I know
what it was today. And again, I'm aware of that. That's my responsibility, I'm
the head coach.  
  
My kids fought their guts out. I could not be prouder of a team to play the
way they played today.  
  
Q. When you have an opponent that's knocking down threes at the rate
that Oregon was, what were some things you tried defensively to stop that?  
VIC SCHAEFER: We talked about it at halftime. We got to chase them off the
line. So you start chasing them off the line, now you take your help out of
there on the roll, on the pick'n roll stuff.  
  
So, again, I think Sabrina made some really tough shots tonight. Obviously
she's a heck of a player. But I thought she made some really tough shots at
the shot clock. That's what great players do. They're going to make shots when
your team needs it. I thought she was really, really hard to guard.  
  
I'm just telling you, we got two pretty good defensive players, by the way, at
Mississippi State. They guard. They did a heck of a job, did the best they
could. Sometimes you got to pat them on the back and move to the other end,
say, Hey, great shot. I think that's where you were today.  
  
That kid made some great shots today. When they make shots like that, y'all,
and we were very similar to that way last year with our four shooters around
the perimeter, T inside, we were hard to guard. They're hard to guard when you
do that.  
  
Again, I watched I can't tell you how many films. They've been a little bit --
haven't shot it as well lately, up until today.  
  
Q. The way they passed the ball, the way they space, you were pretty
hard on yourself about the way you defended them, but they're pretty
difficult.  
VIC SCHAEFER: No, they are. Again, I think for us, I know y'all haven't seen
us a lot up here, but we really pride ourselves on ball pressure, denying one
pass away, not letting somebody run their pretty offense, making one-handed
passes, things like that.  
  
I don't think that we did that a lot today. But they're really good, you're
right. They're really good. When you're involved in pick'n roll all night
long, I mean, you really got to do a good job. It's not just the two people.
When we work on pick'n roll defense, it's not a two-man game. You got three
people in help. That's what people don't get.  
  
I go to clinics, they're talking about pick'n roll, you want to jam them, you
want to ice them, you want to edge. When I work on pick'n roll defense, I'm
working on my help, too. It's not just two people. You got to have a third
person locked in and running help, locked in on that roll and locked in on
your shooter.  
  
Again, give them credit. They're really good at what they do. They made shots.
We contested a bunch of 'em. Some of 'em not so much, but we were high end on
a lot of 'em. Sabrina made a couple of them, I don't know how she got it off.
They ain't touching anything, so you pat them on the back, move to the other
end because they made a tough shot.  
  
Q. In the second half, Oregon was virtually triple-teaming Teaira.
That's brutal for anybody. Having said that, do you think you got the ball to
her? Did you find enough ways to get the ball to her in the second half?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah, I mean, we scored 84 points. If I'd have known that coming
into tonight, I'd have said, I'll take it. I think our offense was adequate
tonight. We just didn't guard. That's what I walk out of here -- again as a
defensive coach, I'll kick myself still I'm standing back up here a year from
now.  
  
T got some good looks. She got 10 shots off. She was seven out of eight at the
free-throw line. When you're doubled and tripled and they're laying on you,
where you can't literally move, and when you do, it could possibly be an
offensive foul, that's difficult. Then you got to play through her. That's
where the kid has grown and matured so much. We play through her a lot.  
  
She had two assists tonight. Just did a good job. We missed some shots where
she passed it to us first half. I think we got it to her quite a bit. She
finished a lot. Again, you're right, it's hard down there when you got a
campfire built around you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you so much. Congratulations on a great season.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Appreciate everybody being here today. Again, praise the Lord
and go Dogs.

_Portland, Oregon_  
  
Oregon-88, Mississippi State-84  
  
THE MODERATOR: University of Oregon, your Portland regional champion.  
  
Coach, congratulations. We'll begin with your opening statement.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, thank you. I first want to say congratulations to
Mississippi State. They have been great champions. Obviously today gave us
everything we could handle.  
  
Coach Schaefer I think is one of my very favorite coaches. He's humble. He's
very gracious. He's a heck of a coach. I think he might be the best coach in
our game.  
  
I think what's hopefully not lost in this, this was a great showcase for
women's basketball today. I thought the crowd was amazing. The people here at
Portland did such an awesome job with the entire tournament. That was as well-
played a basketball game as I think you're going to find anywhere. I thought
that is about as good as women's basketball can get.  
  
Really proud, though, of our poise and our confidence and how we played down
the stretch. You look at the numbers. Only eight turnovers against that kind
of pressure. Our shooting percentage was high. I can't believe we actually
out-rebounded them. The Ducks really earned this.  
  
Proud of all three of these All-Americans who played like All-Americans today.
Just happy for our fans and our university.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sabrina, obviously you were awesome. We know what to expect from
Ruthy also. Satou was next level tonight. She said openly she wanted
Mississippi State. She was frustrated she didn't play well against them in
December. You're a leader. Did you pull her aside and give her any kind of pep
talk before the game?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I always do. I try to talk to her, what she needs to improve
on, what she is great at. She knows. We a have a great relationship.  
  
Rebound, her will to win. Tonight it showed. She wasn't happy with her
previous game. She came out really wanting to win. That's what it took for all
of us, not necessarily just Satou.  
  
Yeah, definitely one of the best guards I've ever played with.  
  
Q. Sabrina, obviously you get a lot of national attention. So does the
team. One of the best players ever, really prominent voice for ESPN, Rebecca
Lobo after the game, went on Twitter, one word: Sabrina. What does that mean
to you?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I hope she's talking about me (laughter).  
  
But it's awesome. I mean, her support for our program, for us as individuals
is great. I'm happy that she's out there voicing her opinion. Like coach said,
this was one of the absolute best games we ever played in, that I think
women's basketball has been a part of.  
  
Honored for her to have tweeted that out. I might respond to it and ask her if
she was talking about me (smiling).  
  
Q. Ruthy and Satou, for the second half, Teaira went from 12 and 10 at
halftime, seven and five in the second. What did you try to do to contain her
from offensive rebounding and trying to contain her, take her off her game
offensively?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, I think we just kept it up. We knew what we needed to do
to defend her, being physical, pushing her out. We had great guards around us
getting rebounding, tipped balls.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: Yeah, just coming out of the halftime, we knew she will take
those great shots. She will beast up. I don't know, like, Ruthy did a great
job. We all all around did a great job of helping her, pushing her outside,
then getting those rebounds.  
  
Q. Sabrina and Ruthy, you said afterwards to Brooke on the court that
this feeling was better than you could even imagine. You have been so close.
Last year after Notre Dame beat you, did you watch the Final Four? Was it
harder to watch knowing you were right there? Do you think that fueled you?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I was there, Ruthy was there, as well, for some awards
that we picked up. I think that experience, there were positives and negatives
to being there and watching the teams get escorted by the police and watching
the teams get ready to play when your season was over.  
  
We brought that experience back, portrayed them to the team, just told them
that, Guys, we can do this, we're right there, we have the tools and ability
to get there. I think having that experience, it has definitely helped us and
propelled us to this level.  
  
But these past two years when we've made it this far, and we lost in this
position, it didn't feel like this. This had a total different feeling to it.
I think we were so confident in our ability and our coaches' abilities to get
us ready in this position. We were all excited last night. I think that
feeling showed today on the court.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: I remember going and watching the Final Four. I want our team to
be here next year. Throughout the season, we've been getting better and
better, knocking on the door. This game, we have to make it this time. We were
confident. I'm super excited.  
  
Q. To all three, in an intense environment like this, kind of a home
crowd, are you able at any time during the ballgame to look around and say,
Dang, this is fun? Did you ratchet it up to max the whole time?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I had fun when the guards made the threes, when the fans are
saying, Go Ducks, I was having fun the whole time.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: That was the last thing Coach Graves said to us before we
went out there today. He said, Have fun. He left it at that. We wouldn't take
this moment for granted. Regardless what the outcome was, we wanted to have
fun together and continue to have fun, so we did.  
  
The crowd was great when we went on our runs. The floor was shaking. I got
goosebumps a few times hearing them, how loud they are, supporting us. We're
definitely not taking that for granted.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: The first time I basically looked up into the crowd was after
the game. I was like, Oh, my God. I'm kind of like more in the zone. I just
hear it when Sab hit that big three in the end. It was just crazy how loud it
was. Thank you to everyone that came out. It was amazing.  
  
Q. Ruthy and Satou, you had some emotional moments in the second half
where you came up with some huge defensive plays, and your emotional level was
high all night. Having the crowd be that supportive, does that help you when
you're trying to reach or stay in that emotional state?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, for me it definitely helps. Hearing them, not wanting to
let them down, I wanted to go quiet during those hustle plays, that gets the
crowd riled up, gets our team riled up. I think it was really fun.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: This is what we're playing for, right? All these people
watching, all these little girls or little boys watching up on us. We're a big
inspiration for them. Just knowing that everyone has our back and is cheering
us on, is traveling all the way, some people were coming from California. It's
just amazing to see.  
  
Just knowing this is firing us up, knowing that we have to bring our own
emotions into the game, it makes it easier.  
  
Q. Satou, was this kind of what you envisioned in terms of getting
another chance to play Mississippi State? What were you trying to do
differently coming into this game from the first matchup?  
SATOU SABALLY: I was just trying to be more focused. I did not want to do,
like, silly mistakes. I wasn't, like, concentrating on getting scores or
everything, I was just really concentrating on focusing on my controllables,
getting those rebounds, trying to help Ruthy on Teaira, boxing out Howard.
Just knowing that everything is, like, unpressured, I tried to take pressure
off me.  
  
Obviously knowing that I wanted to be aggressive in the game, just doing my
own thing. That's what I did.  
  
Q. What do you think you proved with this particular win? What do you
hope it says to your upcoming opponents in the Final Four?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Well, I think we just proved that we can do it. I think we
proved Oregon is an elite team, that we have great players, a great
atmosphere. Hopefully we can go a few more steps further.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, I think we proved to ourselves. We're not really
trying to prove to the people that did or did not believe in us. We proved to
ourselves if we put our minds to it and we put our hearts to it, we can
accomplish anything.  
  
All I got to say is we're not done yet. We're not going to be -- of course,
we're going to be happy, but we're not going to be pleased with how far we've
gotten. I think that's one of the reasons we didn't necessarily set one goal
before the season. I know we got a lot of critiques for that. Our goals are
farther than one game, a Final Four, something that you can really pinpoint. I
think our goals are things that we can control, and everything else will take
care of itself.  
  
I'm excited to get to Tampa and continue playing with this team.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you get the ball with a buck-19 to go. Ruthy sets a screen
for you. Walk me through that three.  
SABRINA IONESCU: That was going in regardless. No other way to say it. I
wanted to finish this game off the right way. We've come so far. We played so
hard that entire game. I knew it was my time to hit a big-time shot. Ruthy set
a great screen, the spacing was great. I think that just shows we've been
learning from the games we've been playing in.  
  
At that moment in time, I didn't want it to go to overtime. I didn't want to
give them any more opportunities to score. I was also pretty tired. Let me hit
this and walk off to the Final Four.  
  
THE MODERATOR: That's the time we have for our student-athletes.
Congratulations. Thank you, ladies. Best of luck in Tampa.  
  
We'll open it up to questions for Coach Graves.  
  
Q. Maite's shot was also a dagger. Was that off a design play or part of
the offense? Any adjustments you made in the second half?  
KELLY GRAVES: I think the one thing we did in the second half, we went more
four out. We wanted to put Teaira in 50 ball screens. We started to rescreen a
lot. We started to what we call step-up screens so that our kids could take
the baseline a little bit more.  
  
I thought we did a really good job, Maite especially, as well as Sabrina. They
were our two primary ball handlers, of keeping the dribble alive. From time to
time we just pick up the dribble too quick. They kept it alive. Seemed like we
got a lot of open shooters.  
  
I think we may have tired Teaira out a little bit. That's tough to go through
those ball screens once, but then to have to do it again was difficult. So
that was the main thing we did the second half.  
  
Q. And Maite?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, listen, Maite is an unheralded superstar. She is. She's
fine with kind of being in the background. But she is certainly a capable
basketball player. I think she showed it all tonight. That was a great game.
We only had eight turnovers against one of the better defensive teams,
pressure defensive teams in the country. That's getting it done.  
  
When she's asked to make big plays, she does it. You look at her history. We
owe a lot to her. She's the one that got this whole thing started.  
  
Q. The constant pressure, normally you would assume it would be Sabrina
or Maite to break the press. Seemed like everybody contributed to being able
to break the press and get into your offense.  
KELLY GRAVES: You're right. That's what has to be done in a game like this,
against an opponent like this. It is everybody. But the lion's share of that
work did fall on our two primary ball handlers. Satou at times was the third
one.  
  
Listen, I thought we played about as well as we could have played tonight. I
mean, you look at the numbers, again the poise with which we played the entire
game. Phenomenal.  
  
Q. All week when you were asked about the location, you said the team
had earned the right to play here by having a great regular season. How much
of a factor do you think the environment was in this afternoon's final
result?  
KELLY GRAVES: I thought it was incredible. It's a smart crowd. They know when
to kind of cheer and get loud and kind of exhort the team on. There were a few
plays tonight when sound had feel. I mean, you could feel it down there on the
court.  
  
We didn't win because of the crowd. We won because we really executed well. It
was certainly a help, there's no question about that. I'm glad that we got to
do this in front of them, truly, because they've been along for the whole
ride. They aren't just jumping on now. They've been with us all year.  
  
Q. Your kids seem to have a lot of fun in general, not just this game,
but shootaround, loose. You seem to give them a lot of freedom. I'm sure part
of that is Sabrina being smart. Was that a conscious thing going into this
year, that you were going to make sure they had fun?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, you know me. You've known me for a while. I'm a fun guy
(laughter).  
  
I think everybody, whatever they do, I think they perform better when they
like what they do and they like who they're doing it with. I think it's just
human nature.  
  
It's worked for this group. It might not work with other teams. But with this
group, it does. Those are the kind of players we recruit. It's our MO each and
every day. It's not just in our games. Like you said, it's in our
shootarounds. The ESPN crew that was working the game said we're as loose as
any team they've ever worked for or worked with.  
  
Yeah, but I trust them. I had 'calmness' on my wrist today. That's what I try
to do. I told them the root of being calm is trusting. I trust my team. I
trust them to do the right things. I don't need to get up and micromanage
every possession. They know, they're smart, who is supposed to be taking shots
and when, who are the play-makers when the game's on the line.  
  
Yeah, I think it all just kind of works together. I'm glad that they were
rewarded with a trip to the Final Four.  
  
Q. You did a real nice job at the end on their post player. Their other
players were knocking down midrange shots. You had to concede that. How
concerned were you that you do everything right defensively and still lose the
game?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, when you come up with a game plan, you devise what you
want to do. You say, what our thought process was, are they going to make 25
of those twos? Ultimately are they going to make enough? We said no.  
  
Obviously once they made four or five in a row, we had to play them a little
bit tighter. But I think everybody goes in with what they want to do. That was
one of our, you know, strategies. In the end it worked. But you're right, they
made a bunch of them. In the end, not enough.  
  
Q. Lydia had some pretty clutch screens in the first half. What kind of
role did she bring to today's game?  
KELLY GRAVES: I thought Lydia was great. I don't know what her plus-minus was.
I can't read without my glasses now. I thought she did a good job when she was
in. The offense during that stretch had kind of gotten a little mojo. We
started to move a little bit.  
  
I think with Ruthy sometimes we're so intent on trying to get it in to her.
But Lydia doesn't demand that. Again, we're always comfortable when she's in
the game. She may not give us a ton of minutes, but they're important minutes,
and they were tonight.  
  
Q. In the space of five years, you're in the Final Four. Sort of a
variation of what I asked the players, what do you think that proves about
your program and what does it mean for women's basketball more broadly that
you can take a team to being a championship contender so quickly?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, it takes great players. It truly does. We started from
scratch, so to speak. There were great kids in the program, really good
players. We weren't quite the championship level yet.  
  
I give my staff a ton of credit. They worked their butts off. We had a plan.
We stuck to it, recruited really well. You know, Oregon has a lot to sell.
It's an amazing university. The athletic department is tremendous. Our
relationship with Nike is second to none. It's just kind of a fun place to be.  
  
I think our student-athletes are the real ambassadors. When young women come
on campus, they see what it's like, we talk family. A lot of people profess,
hey, their culture is about family. Well, they see it and they believe it
because it's there.  
  
Just took the right number of kids, a couple of good breaks along the way. But
it's been a really fun journey. Hopefully that's not done. But we've taken
that next step. Gosh, darn, we've been in this position a couple times, in a
losing press conference. It's really nice to make that next step. Who knows
what happens from here.  
  
Q. The second half shift to virtually triple-teaming Teaira, and also
isolating her on the offensive glass, what was the thought process in that?
The shot that I asked Sabrina about at the end, what was the play run on that
play?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, if you come to our practices, you see how we drill pick'n
roll, all the reads that they get off that each and every day. That was a
simple one. If they go under that screen, she's going to be there to make that
shot.  
  
I don't think anybody who knows our program or know Sabrina Ionescu thought
that wasn't going to go in. That's kind of who she is.  
  
Our plan the whole night, I thought we did a better job of it in the second
half, was to put McCowan in as many pick'n rolls as possible. Then they
started switching in the second half. We were able then -- with Satou, they
would switch Howard onto Ruthy, then Teaira had to take Satou. We started ball
screening with Satou. She was able to pick and pop.  
  
We spread the floor much better in the second half. I think that was the key.  
  
Listen, we were trying to keep Teaira down the whole night on the offensive
glass. It's difficult to do. She's such an amazing player. That's why I voted
for her for an All-American. That's a no-brainer. When you game plan for
Mississippi State, she's the first, second and third thing you look at and try
to figure out.  
  
I just credit our kids. I thought they played really hard in the second half.
Wasn't anything tactically that we did different. I think they played hard and
tough. We always say the toughest team wins, and I thought we were the
toughest team.  
  
I'm going to test how many texts a phone can get (laughter).  
  
Q. Where are you at?  
KELLY GRAVES: Let's take a peek.  
  
THE MODERATOR: 310.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: I'll get to you. May not be tonight, but we have that bus ride
home so I'll have some time (smiling).  
  
Q. We talked to you after Friday's game. 63 points, shot-making at a
minimum. What's the biggest difference when you're shooting the ball as well
as you did today especially with 29 points in the fourth quarter?  
KELLY GRAVES: Today the key was we got some really good looks. They were
practice shots. I thought part of that was our guards were able to penetrate
into the paint, deep along the baseline. Those passes out, those are the kind
of catches and shots that you get in practice.  
  
We've been the best three-point shooting team in the country all season long.
I knew four for 20 the other night was an aberration. We don't need to pump
our players up, you can do it this time. We didn't make a mention of it at
all, that, hey, we're going to do better. Tonight we shot 13 of 26 from the
three. That's getting it done.  
  
That's because we had great spacing tonight and our guards made plays. Our
kids again had confidence and poise and stepped up and made them.  
  
Q. Is there a game you've coached in that you remember the level of play
on both sides being this high?  
KELLY GRAVES: No. No. I think of maybe the UCLA game we had last year that
went overtime or double overtime. It was on ESPN. But, no, this was as good a
game as I've been a part of. I thought both teams played really well. Both
teams played well enough to win the game. We just made a few extra plays down
the stretch.  
  
Kind of reminded me of that Virginia game last night against Purdue. Two
really good teams. They were making shots. It was like a heavyweight fight. We
just kept getting back up off the canvas and battling some more.  
  
I thought it was well played. Total turnovers, 14 for the whole game. 37
assists, 14 turnovers -- 39 assists, not very many fouls, both field goal
percentages were good. Just a well-played basketball game. I thought it was
great. Great showcase.  
  
Q. Sabrina is so good, we all know that, but she can be good quietly. Do
you ever look at the stat sheet, Whoa, she almost had a triple-double again?
Are you surprised or aware all the time?  
KELLY GRAVES: I'm never amazed at anything she does. After three years,
anything she does, you just expect the incredible.  
  
I thought tonight she was purposely kind of let things happen early in the
game. She didn't do much until almost near the first media timeout. I remember
that in the timeout we talked about we got to get Sabrina the ball, we got to
get her involved. Then we did.  
  
But she knows. She knows she can't do it all by herself. That's where she has
grown the most as a player. I look at the Notre Dame game last year, this very
same game, she just tried to put too much on her shoulders. I always believe
in her, so I kind of allow it to happen. But I think this year she's really,
really matured in that area.  
  
Q. What does it mean to make this run with your two seniors?  
KELLY GRAVES: Oh, you know, I owe so much to Oti Gildon and Maite Cazorla.
They were the two that really took a chance on us. We didn't have much to sell
at the time other than a beautiful arena and a good-looking coach (smiling).
Bad joke and not true obviously.  
  
But they took a chance on us. They have been just tremendous leaders. Oti gets
underlooked, undervalued, perhaps, by maybe people who watch us play or just
follow the team kind of at a distance. But those who knows us, her teammates,
she is the rock. She has been the rock for four years. We owe a lot to her.  
  
Same with Maite. I was really glad that Maite stepped up tonight on this
biggest stage because she's going to be a long time pro and long time Olympian
for Spain. We're going to see her playing for many, many years.  
  
I love those two. Again, they've been not just great leaders for our team, but
in our athletic department and university.  
  
Q. You talk about how satisfying an effort and performance this was from
your team in the biggest game of the year. A lot was made of the matchup with
McCowan down low. You each scored 30 points in the paint in the end and you
out-rebound Mississippi State. How satisfying is that?  
KELLY GRAVES: Very satisfying. If you would have told me those were going to
be the numbers, I would have said we have a good chance to win. I'm just proud
of the team. They fought. They fought tonight.  
  
Q. Are you going to wear a suit at the Final Four?  
KELLY GRAVES: No, no (smiling). You know how this all started? This actually
came from Nike. I kind of had an idea. As soon as I said, Hey, I'm thinking of
doing this, the Nike representative for women's basketball said, Oh, my gosh,
Kelly, we've wanted a staff to do this. They really like to showcase their
shoes, all that kind of stuff.  
  
I know, I know you probably want me to.  
  
Q. I just wondered.  
KELLY GRAVES: No, no, I think we're going to go with what's been working. This
is kind of who we are. I think people, they wouldn't recognize us if we came
out in a jacket and tie, yeah.  
  
Thank you very much.  
  
THE MODERATOR: 400 text messages waiting. One more question.  
  
Q. In your introductory press conference 2014, you complimented Stanford
for raising the bar on the West Coast and your goal was to overtake them. What
do you feel needs to be done to achieve that mark?  
KELLY GRAVES: We haven't overtaken them yet. They're still the standard by
which we're all judged.  
  
I just thought we wanted to elevate West Coast basketball, Pac-12 basketball,
for a long time. I was looking at it from a distance in the WCC, Stanford and
everybody else. The everybody else were good, but they weren't at that level.  
  
Just look in the last few years, Oregon State has been to a Final Four, Cal
went in 2013, Washington went to a Final Four, Stanford has been to a few, now
we have. That's five Pac-12 programs in the last six or seven years that have
now been to Final Fours. I think that's showing that, yes, the conference is
being elevated, no question about it.  
  
But I think Coach VanDerveer is one of the best coaches in the country, runs
an amazing program. I would love, I would love to run a program like she does.
That's been our goal.  
  
Thank you.

_Portland, Oregon_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are here with the starting five from Mississippi State.  
  
We'll go ahead and open it up for questions at this time.  
  
Q. Teaira, that game against Oregon the last time you played was one of
the few times this season that you haven't had a double-double. You were in
foul trouble. What else went wrong there?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Just didn't execute the game plan that the coaches gave us.
Just one of those nights, you know. Can't have them, but we did.  
  
Q. Jordan, having played Oregon in the state of Oregon, seeing them this
season, how much does that help you guys get prepared for this game?  
JORDAN DANBERRY: You know, completely different team than last time we played
them. We've played in Oregon before against, you know, their crowd, they have
a big crowd, big fan base because we're right here in this state.  
  
I guess, I don't know, I won't have it no other way really. I want to play
here in front of they fan base again and come out with a win.  
  
Q. Jordan, you fouled out of that first game against Oregon earlier this
year. Given what Sabrina Ionescu can do, if that's your assignment, how
important is it for you to stay on the floor and stay engaged in this game
tomorrow?  
JORDAN DANBERRY: I think it's important. I mean, she's a great player. She's
an All-American. Stay out of foul trouble this time in the game so I can be
out there to help my teammates. I got great teammates around me that play help
defense as well. I think we'll be all right, we'll collectively guard her.  
  
Q. Jordan, you said this is a completely different team. What exactly is
different entering this game with Oregon?  
JORDAN DANBERRY: Just our mindset, our defense. That was in non-conference.
We've played a lot more games together, got a lot more chemistry on the
defensive end as well as the offensive end.  
  
We're just a different team as far as our talents, what we can do.  
  
Q. Anriel, last time around you dropped 30 against Oregon. How did you
find success against them? Can you also speak about the physicality of that
game. 50 combined free throws from both teams in that game.  
ANRIEL HOWARD: I just believe that my teammates, they found me in the open
areas, open spots. Jazz did really good finding me. Even Teaira, when she
doubled off her, I just tried to find the soft spot. Everybody played a role
in just finding me in the open areas. I was able to knock down shots.  
  
But last game, last time we played them, it was very physical. We expect the
same thing. We're used to it. We're in the SEC. That comes every night. We'll
be ready.  
  
Q. Teaira, Kelly Graves, Oregon's head coach, compared you to Mt. Hood,
an 11,000-foot-tall volcano here in Oregon. I'm sure you've been compared to a
lot of things. Is that the craziest thing? What do you think about that?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: That is crazy, but I don't know. No comment. I don't know.
It's crazy (smiling).  
  
Q. Teaira, how do you prepare for a matchup with Ruthy Hebard after what
happened in Eugene in December?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I prepare normally. I just know I have to be better for my
teammates, I have to be focused, dialed in. I can't, you know, just do what I
did last game. I went back and looked at it. I wasn't, you know, doing what I
normally do. I wasn't the normal T. I know this time I'll be better, my team
will be better. We'll be fine.  
  
Q. Teaira, they played some sort of strange combination defense last
time. How much did that impact the way you played? Was it just a bad game on
your part?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: It was just a bad game on my part, I would say. But their
defense is pretty swarming. They threw everything at me. I didn't react as
quick as I would normally. So, I mean, I just have to be prepared for whatever
they're going to throw at me.  
  
Q. Andy, you only played five minutes in that first game against Oregon.
Your role has expanded. What do you think you can provide in that expanded
role this time around?  
ANDRA ESPINOZA-HUNTER: Just be good help side, knock down shots when I'm open.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much for your time. Good luck tomorrow.  
  
Mississippi State head coach Vic Schaefer. We will go ahead and open it up for
questions.  
  
Q. What role does having played Oregon already in the state of Oregon
play in helping you guys get ready for this game?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Sure, I think -- I don't think there's any question that it
helps you. I think our kids, they understand they're going to walk into an
arena tomorrow night and it's going to be green, a lot of people hollering
against you, not many hollering for you.  
  
But we're going to have a few people here. So, I mean, that happens in our
league a lot. We've played at some great places, some great venues with pro
crowds that are against you. I think that's what this team has handled a great
deal.  
  
We've played them now three straight years. Kelly's done a tremendous job.
Have so much respect for him and his staff and the team. We've had some real
great games with each other. I appreciated him playing us home and home. He
came to us last year, we returned this year. Both games were high-scoring,
really knock-down, drag-outs in my mind.  
  
Q. When you played them in Eugene this year, they really hurt you on the
pick'n roll.  
VIC SCHAEFER: You've been watching film (smiling).  
  
Q. At this point in the season, how do you make adjustments while still
staying true to who you are?  
VIC SCHAEFER: You don't think I'm going to come out and play 2-3 zone tomorrow
night (laughter)?  
  
Q. How do you straddle the line making sure your kids are confident, we
can win with how we've won all year?  
VIC SCHAEFER: That's a great point. Darrell Royal used to say, You go with
what brung you.  
  
We're a lot better team today than we were three months ago. So is Oregon.
We've gone through some ways to deal with them a little bit. We have Plan B
and Plan C in place in case we have to go to that.  
  
At the same time I think they're going to be who they are. We're going to be
who we are. We'll go from there. But when we played them earlier in the year,
I mean, you just couldn't help off anybody. They did a tremendous job of
spreading you out. If you helped off somebody, you lost ball pressure, they're
going to find who's open.  
  
So for us, you know -- for them, it doesn't change. They still got the same
personnel. Hopefully we're a little better defensively. I thought we were
really good last night against a really good team. Thought we were really good
in the first half at Clemson, against Clemson, so...  
  
We've had so many new players at that point in December, trying to figure our
way, figure it out. Now we've got a different team than that team. No Chloe,
and Andy is playing a lot. We're different a little bit. Hopefully in a good
way.  
  
Q. Last time out Sabrina scored 29 points, 17 for 17 from the free-throw
line. How do you prevent her from getting to the line so often?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Stop fouling her. I think that's the big thing. That's an All-
American in so many different ways. You just can't put her on the free-throw
line. Down the stretch, we made some really poor decisions that put her on the
line. Hopefully we're smarter today than we were three months ago. We'll make
better decisions.  
  
She's like an 89% free-throw shooter, I think something like that. You just
can't put her on the line. When the game's on the line, she wants to be in
that moment. That's what makes her great. We got to be better. We got to make
better decisions, not put her on the line.  
  
Q. In that game against Oregon, Teaira was not on her game. She got into
foul trouble early. Eventually you pulled her and sat her on the bench for
most of the fourth quarter. Did y'all have a conversation that kind of changed
things for her after that game? What was it that's allowed her to be so
effective even if things aren't going her way, kept out of the paint? How has
she been able to maintain her composure and get back into her kind of
basketball?  
VIC SCHAEFER: The answer is yes, we had a conversation, but that's probably
not the only one since then. She was a bull in a china cabinet the night we
got beat by Missouri at home. I just mentioned this in the locker room to
someone else, the media. Most seniors halfway through their senior years think
they know it all and are not very coachable. Teaira, after that Valentine's
Day game, we had another conversation, her and Johnnie sat and watched film.
She realized she's got to do things a little different.  
  
Give the kid credit, she changed, she grew. She altered some things where
she's got to play better. Again, I think that's why she's such a great player
and going to just be tremendous at the next level because she is still
coachable.  
  
So, you know, that night was certainly a frustrating night for all of us, for
her. She's a lot like her coach: she's an emotional kid, plays with a lot of
passion. I have a real appreciation for somebody like that.  
  
Q. Did Oregon play T a lot like the team did last night, like Arizona
State did, play the post that way, sagging, beating up on her?  
VIC SCHAEFER: You didn't see the game?  
  
Q. I came home from a football game that night, turned it on...  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah, so it was physical down there, for sure, yeah. You guys
got to find another topic, you're trying to get me in trouble (laughter).  
  
Q. They were playing a combination defense a lot of the time on her. How
much was that a factor and how much was her not having a good game?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Again, I think they did a great job. They mixed up their
defenses, played some box-and-one, that 3-2 zone they like to play that's big
and wide, played some man and 2-3.  
  
You have to have your whole offensive package ready to go. Your point guard
really has to be cognizant of what they're doing. That's what makes them --
again, Kelly has done a great job with them because they are multidimensional
offensively as well as defensively. They're a load, a handful to deal with.  
  
When you play somebody like that, you better be ready. We know we're playing a
championship team. They won the Pac-12. They're really good. They're good for
a reason. They're smart, they're heady, tough, well-coached. We're going to
have to beat them in front of their own people tomorrow night.  
  
They're a heck of a basketball team. They got great players. May have the best
multi-skilled player in the game. I mean, if she was a baseball player, used
call her a five-tool player. I figured it out, I think she's an eight-tool
player in women's basketball. She scores at all three levels. She rebounds.
She assists. She's your hustle player. She's smart. You can throw classy and
elegance in on top of it. I mean, that's how good that kid is.  
  
When you're going against a team like that and a player like that, you really
have to play your best game. We didn't play our best game that night. So we
learned from it. Hopefully we'll be better tomorrow night.  
  
Q. I have to ask you about Teaira. She looks like she's in really good
shape right now. Has she even lost weight since December? Do you think she's
in better shape now?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I don't know that she's lost it since December. I think her
frame changed pretty quick once she got to Starkville.  
  
Look, the kid gets madder than heck at me if I yank her out of a game. She
don't like to come out. She's averaged I think 31, 32 minutes on the year.
Here in the last five games, she's averaging maybe 36, 37.  
  
Again, here we go, over the course of the year, she's averaging 30. But in the
last five, she's averaging 34.4. In our conference, she averaged almost 32.
She's in great shape. I give Marci, our strength and conditioning coach, a lot
of credit. But I give T a lot of credit. Not a lot of big kids like her drag
two and three people up and down the floor every night all night, and stay in
the shape and conditioning.  
  
Again, y'all saw last night. It's like that every night for that kid. You just
get pounded on and beat on all game long. The kid can take no more shots. She
can't have any more. My trainer has to do the job with heat and ice. When you
think about the course of her career, it's been hard. It's hard for her down
there.  
  
Q. Maybe doesn't always translate this literally, but is preparing for
moments like this part of why you're willing to go on the road and play a team
like Oregon?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Absolutely. I think, yeah, that's exactly why you do it. We went
to Texas and played. We went to Virginia and played. We came out here to
Oregon and played. I'm probably missing one somewhere.  
  
This is why you do it. Again, our teams, my teams have always continued to get
better in late February and March. We pride ourselves on being a tough,
physical, aggressive basketball team. That doesn't say anything about your
skill set. But if somebody describes you as a tough, physical, aggressive
basketball player, you'd like that. Doesn't say anything about your jump shot.  
  
Same thing is true probably about anybody's football team or baseball team.
Doesn't say anything about your Friday night starter that throws 95. If your
baseball team is a tough, physical, aggressive baseball team you'd probably
like that as a coach.  
  
For me as a coach, it's what we've always hung our hat on. Overtime games,
whenever it gets tough, that's when it just gets about right for us.  
  
Q. Is that the scouting report next to you? That's a lot of paper. Do
you make the team read the entire thing, too?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, no. These are my notes. Again, we've played them three
straight years, so... These are notes.  
  
Q. Just Oregon notes?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yes, this is just Oregon. That's old, this is new. So, yeah, I
have this. I don't throw stuff away. I go back and look at what worked in
Hawaii three years ago, whenever else we've played them.  
  
For me, I've always been a note-taker. Doesn't mean I was a good student in
college, by the way, but I am a note-taker. I have this on all of our
opponents.  
  
This one is about average. Only played them three times (smiling).  
  
Q. Obviously you are familiar with them. Do they remind you of anyone in
the SEC? Any team that's like them? Any player like Sabrina?  
VIC SCHAEFER: As a team, no. No one spreads you out like they do and shoots it
like they do. Maybe an Arkansas as far as just spread you out and try to shoot
it. But their five player is a little bit better.  
  
Maybe Missouri as far as, you know, having that player like her. But from a
competitive standpoint, a competitor, that's probably as close as comparison
as we're going to probably find. That's not saying no one else has one. It's
just from a similar standpoint of being able to score at all three levels,
seeing the floor, makes the great decisions, passer, rebounder, plays with
heart and passion, all those things.  
  
I think that's probably a good comparison.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach Schaefer, thank you very much for your time. Best of luck
tomorrow.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: All right. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

_Portland, Oregon_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have with us the five starters from the University of
Oregon. Ladies, thank you for being here.  
  
We'll go ahead and open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Ruthy, obviously you played a great game against McCowan in the first
meeting. What are the challenges of repeating that, countering whatever
adjustments?  
RUTHY HEBARD: She's a great player. I'm going to have to try again to get low,
be strong, physical, depend on my teammates a lot. Hopefully that works out
tomorrow. I know we're going to give it our all.  
  
Q. Satou, you said last night that you wanted Mississippi State again
because you hadn't played well against them. I'm guessing you watched the
film. What do you think you did wrong that game or what can you do better this
game?  
SATOU SABALLY: I mean, I just wasn't that dialed in offensively. I did a
couple of mistakes. But, I mean, on the other hand my team really stepped up
and our bench had a huge game. Oti played a huge game. Everyone can have a bad
day, and that was my bad day.  
  
Just coming out and being a good player.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you're not going to answer the question I want to ask about
leaving early, so this is what I'm going to ask you instead. When you were
becoming a top player, when you were in high school developing into this
awesome prospect, I'm sure you saw, paid attention to all the guys who were
becoming top prospects, doing one-and-done, going pro. You seem to be a pretty
big advocate of the game. When you were younger, did you think: Why aren't the
opportunities available for women to leave early? Why isn't that enticing to
them? Is that something you want for the game?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, looking back on it, back then I don't think I ever
thought about that because I didn't think I was ever going to be in this
position. Now going through it, learning more about the game, I do think there
should be equal opportunity for both men and women regardless of the pay gap
between the two sports.  
  
I mean, I am still learning things now. I didn't know I was even eligible to
leave until I saw it on social media. I had absolutely no idea that I was even
going to be given that opportunity besides a few months ago.  
  
I think that should be talked about more. I think girls at a younger age
should definitely be given that knowledge because they could take, you know,
different steps going through high school and going through college in their
basketball careers and in school.  
  
Q. Sabrina and Ruthy, before the season we talked about how you had the
photo of the Tampa skyline in the locker room, your feelings about that before
the season. Now that you're at this stage again, have the opportunity to get
there, right or wrong, a lot of people are going to judge the success or
failure of this season based on reaching that point. Now that you're at this
stage, what is the feeling heading into this that you can reach that goal?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, ultimately it's just another game for us. It's just
another opportunity for us to continue to get better, to continue to grow as a
team, individually, collectively. At the end of the day it's just another
basketball game.  
  
Ultimately we are trying to win this game, and we are trying to get further
than we have these last couple years, at least with this core group. I think
that's what's going to separate us as a more mature and veteran group. I think
we want to get better, we want to do more than we have in the past.  
  
I think coming into this year we had Tampa written all over our locker room,
that was our ultimate goal because that is ultimately what is going to set us
apart.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: I'm excited. Hopefully we make it to Tampa. We have one more
task beforehand, and hopefully we're all up to the task.  
  
Q. Sabrina, what do you remember from the first game with Mississippi
State as far as McCowan-Ruthy matchup? How important do you see that being to
tomorrow's game?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, it's going to be huge. That's their key player.
That's their best player. That's one of the best players in the country. She
didn't have her best game against us at our place. Credit to Ruthy and to our
team. We know that tomorrow she's not going to let that happen again,
especially with a Final Four on the line. We're going to have to be able to
learn and adjust and play better than we did down at our place.  
  
Q. Ruthy, you talked about the challenge of defending McCowan. At the
other end, putting her in ball screens, what opportunities did that create for
you and your guards?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Putting her in a bunch of ball screens, we knew we would get a
lot of shots off. Having our guards go off, turn the corner, getting dump-
offs. Taylor played a great game. I remember that. That's going to help
tomorrow, as well.  
  
Q. Maite, the challenge between your game last night and the game
tomorrow, how dramatically different defensively of a challenge are these two
games?  
MAITE CAZORLA: I mean, we're going to have to be dialed in defensively. All
five have to rebound. That's what it's going to come to.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I think there's a good argument to be made that Maite is the
most underrated player in the Pac-12. She does so much for you guys. Your best
perimeter defender. What I really wondered was, you have a lot of success
because you have a high basketball IQ, so does she. What is it like to play
with another guard who is so smart?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, it's awesome. We don't have to communicate a lot to
understand what we're trying to accomplish on the court. We just feed off of
each other. I just have to look at her, she looks at me, we know where we're
going to go, what needs to be done.  
  
I give a lot of credit for everything I've done, for everything this team has
accomplished just because of the fact that she doesn't get recognized a lot
because of how many stars we have on this team. She's just as important as
everyone else. She's been here when this team wasn't very good. She's still
here when the team is at its best.  
  
Her composure, her basketball IQ, her ability to contribute when she steps on
the court is something we definitely don't take for granted.  
  
Q. What was it like last year in the tournament not being able to help
your teammates, having to watch? What does it mean now to have the opportunity
to help them take the next step?  
ERIN BOLEY: Yeah, it was really hard last year. It was a really exciting year.
Obviously they were playing Notre Dame in the Elite 8. It was tough to have to
sit out.  
  
I was already really excited to be able to play, to be able to come in and
help. To be at this point now is awesome. I'm going to do whatever I can to
help this team make it one step further than we did last year.  
  
Q. Erin, why did you guys struggle so much from three? Was that South
Dakota State's defense or were you off? Is it almost a must that you hit some
threes to open up the offense against Mississippi State, considering who is in
the paint?  
ERIN BOLEY: I think our shooting has a lot to do with us. We're confident
going into the next game as a team. But there's a lot of different parts to
our offense. We have always five different people on the floor that can do
different things.  
  
I don't think it's a make or break for us. But we're moving on from that last
game and forgetting about it. We're going to be confident going into the next
one.  
  
Q. Sabrina, Taylor is such a huge impact in the first game. She found
you on an assist. You found her in a pretty big basket in the third quarter.
How big a role can she have? She was suited up but didn't play last night. How
big an impact can she have?  
SABRINA IONESCU: The sky is the limit for her. She knows that. Just her will
to win, do whatever it takes for our team to succeed is what she's going to do
night in, night out, regardless if it's scoring none and giving up the ball to
us in order for us to score, or defending and chasing off those screens. She's
going to do whatever we need her to do.  
  
If she plays tomorrow, great. If she doesn't, great. I think we're right where
we want to be, and everyone is going to have to step up a little more in order
to take what she's not able to give us.  
  
Q. Sabrina, what opportunities did you see putting McCowan in ball
screens, creating that first matchup?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, the floor opened up. She's such a big inside
presence. When you bring her towards the outside, that whole paint opens up.
That's going to give bigger guards like Erin and Satou the ability to go in on
their smaller guards. It's going to give us the ability for driving lanes.
It's going to give Ruthy the ability to roll down and be unguarded in that
pick'n roll. We can come off, look for the shot, have her chase us around on
the outside, which hopefully over a 40-minute game is going to tire her out.  
  
Just continuing to find weaknesses that we can pinpoint and use against them
is what we're going to do. That's not going to be the only thing that's going
to work for us tomorrow. Just watching film, we didn't play our best game over
at our place, we still ended up with a win. I think we have to learn from that
and not settle for what we accomplished at our place, continue to grow.  
  
There's going to be a lot of areas where we need to pinpoint how to win, not
just in the McCowan ball screen.  
  
Q. Ruthy and Satou, Mississippi State is very, very physical. It's
really hard to simulate that when you're getting ready for them. Especially
when you played them in December, how did you guys get ready for that? Did you
have to guard Coach Graves in the paint to practice?  
RUTHY HEBARD: He actually did jump in. We practiced it a lot, Coach Graves
just banging us up a little bit. We played against ourselves and Lydia, all
banging against each other. It was good. I mean, she's super physical. That's
going to be the main point of the game.  
  
Yeah, we banged up on each other a bit. Coach isn't the best.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Coach is soft, though.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: We also had great practice players. They push us every day in
our practices. Just going against the guys, they get hyped up, just going
against men I feel like who have that kind of power helps a lot in our
practices.  
  
Yeah, if not, we'll just have to buckle up a little bit.  
  
Q. Obviously a lot of the focus is on Teaira. Are there other
Mississippi State players who aren't Teaira that you are focusing on in your
film study?  
SABRINA IONESCU: One through eight that they play. Anriel Howard is one of the
best forewomen in the country. They've been to two national championship
games. They've been in this position numerous times. You can never win just
with one person. That team is just so tightly knit, that coach coaches them so
well, they're prepared.  
  
They've been in this moment. They've been further than this moment. It takes a
team in order for them to win. The pieces she has around her makes her excel
at a really high level.  
  
We're going to have to take care of all their players, not just her, although
she is one of the focus points that we have.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you so much. Best of luck tomorrow.  
  
We're with Oregon head coach Kelly Graves. Any opening statement you'd like to
make or...  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Let's go to work.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys have a lot of tournament experience, your third
time in the Elite 8. What are the challenges of playing a team that's been to
the national championship the last two years, and their goal is to take it one
step further from that?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, I think that's been their saying right from the start:
Unfinished business. We know we're going to get a very experienced team, but a
determined team. They've had their eye to this. They've been here before.
They've won twice in this game. We have yet to do that.  
  
We want to break through that ceiling. We don't want to be just an Elite 8
program, we want to be a Final Four and perhaps a national championship
program.  
  
Yeah, until you do it for the first time, you don't really have that
blueprint. They've done it, so... Now we want to make sure that's us this
time.  
  
Q. You had some success with a combination defense against Mississippi
State last time. What made that defense work? Is it the kind of thing you can
try out two times in a row?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, you wonder who has the advantage, the team that can adjust
to how they were played last time or the one that had the success.  
  
I don't know. I don't know the answer to that question. I know we're going to
have to try everything. That's the main thing. I think they're one of the best
offensive teams in the country. I don't think you can just do one thing
because Coach Schaefer is too smart. They will adjust to that.  
  
I think, like against most really good teams, you just have to mix things up,
give them different looks. Obviously you start with Teaira inside. She is an
incredible player, a movable force, so to speak. You look at Mt. Hood out
there in the distance, you could put her right next to it because they're the
two tallest things in this area right now.  
  
I'm telling you, she's incredible. But she has others around her. It's funny,
they lost four seniors last year, really good seniors. I looked at their
starting lineup again, they have another four seniors in it. They've reloaded.
They've done it with a great system, great athleticism, great coaching, lots
of talent.  
  
Q. You've coached two transcendent point guards, first Courtney and now
Sabrina. How do great players make you a better coach? Did you learn anything
in coaching Courtney that has helped you bring out the best in Sabrina?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, they've both inspired me to be a better coach. I feel like
I have to be prepared, I have to give my best each and every day because I
know they always did. I have to live up to their standard.  
  
Yeah, I mean, I've been fortunate, really, two of the best college point
guards ever. I see some similarities in the two. I think what sets those two
apart from all the others that I've coached, and a lot that I've seen play, is
their competitiveness, their determination each and every day.  
  
We talked last night about Sabrina diving into the scorer's table, the
opposing team's bench, that's how they play every day. That's what Courtney
always brought. She was the first one in the gym. I know it's cliché, the last
one to leave, but it's the case. Those are the kind that do it.  
  
The time they put in when you're not watching... I know who is going in that
gym. We get printouts of who is in and out of the gym with their cards. I've
been truly blessed to be able to coach two players like that.  
  
Does that answer your question? Is there a follow-up?  
  
Q. I did wonder if they were similar.  
KELLY GRAVES: I think the vision, if you had to look at just one thing that
they do, is their vision. They see things. They know players are open before
that player knows they're open. They understand angles in passing. I think
those are the two things that have set those two apart from any of the players
that I've coached.  
  
Q. Your thoughts watching film on State, whether it be when they played
in Eugene, moving forward, how improved McCowan is from that game to this
point? That was really the only game she seemed flustered with what y'all were
doing defensively. She's been defended similarly, handled it better. What have
you seen from her since that day?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I think that's what's made her so strong. I just think
she's been consistent all year long. Against us, it wasn't her best night.
Credit our defense. I thought we played really well that night, especially
Ruthy and Lydia. They did the yeoman's share of work on them, on her that
night.  
  
No, I mean, she is what she is. I think the way they play, I really credit
Vic. He's created the perfect style to fit her. If you help on penetration,
they just lob it to her, it's a layup. If you don't help on the penetration,
then the guards make the layups. It's a difficult thing to game plan for. What
are you going to try and take away, a layup from a guard or McCowan? The truth
is, she just doesn't miss many.  
  
So, yeah, we're going to employ some of the same things we did last time. We
have worked on and will work on some new things. We just got to keep it a
little bit fresh because, like I said, they're just too smart and she's too
good of a player, who has help, by the way. She has help. It's not a one-
person show.  
  
Q. I asked Ruthy, you talked about how physical Mississippi State is,
kind of hard to simulate that in practice. So in December, what did you do to
get ready for that? Did you have to play against Coach Graves? Sabrina said
you wanted to be Teaira McCowan but you're really soft.  
KELLY GRAVES: True. I'd much rather stand out and shoot threes. I'm more Boris
Diaw than Teaira McCowan.  
  
Q. Your idea of her scouting report of you, if it was accurate. You
agree?  
KELLY GRAVES: I was always a three-point shooter. By the way, that never
leaves. That's the last skill that you lose. The most frustrating part about
being a practice player from time to time, and I do have to step in, is I know
what I want to do, but I'm incapable of doing it. Or if I make that move,
they've already beaten me to the spot.  
  
What was the rest of that?  
  
Q. That was it. I wondered your assessment.  
KELLY GRAVES: So they're trash talking, huh? I'll get out there today. I'll
lay my 240 pounds on Ruthy.  
  
Q. The three-point shooting last night, was that what South Dakota State
was doing or was that an off night? Is it going to be critical to open up the
spacing by knocking some of those down?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, I think we're the best three-point shooting team in the
country. So we're not going to have nights like that. Four for 20, I thought
we took good shots, had a lot of open looks, they just didn't go.  
  
We can't have another night like that or we're going to be in big trouble
tomorrow, no doubt. No, I have confidence in our players. I think it was just
one of those things that happened. It happens from time to time. That's why
we've preached all year long, all the years I've been there and coached, that
you got to be able to rely on the defense.  
  
I thought defensively we were really, really strong last night. So, you know,
to know that we were off our shooting game and can still win by double-digits
I think is a good sign.  
  
Q. How important was it for you guys to put McCowan in ball screens as
frequently as you did in the first matchup?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, yeah, that's what we do. We try to spread people out and
make the centers guard us. I mean, that's no secret. I don't know how they'll
adjust, but we were fortunate to get some really good looks at the rim last
time. I don't think they're going to allow us to do that this time. We have to
be ready to adjust to whatever they do.  
  
Yeah, I mean, that's no secret. That's how we play. We want to spread the
floor and make centers defend us in the pick'n roll. I don't think I've given
anything away (smiling).  
  
Q. You've coached a lot of good players, you've been coaching a long
time. I know we've still got some time left, not talking about Sabrina leaving
early yet. Did you ever think, especially when you first got into coaching,
we'd ever be having this conversation even -- a lot of chatter about her and
Jackie at Notre Dame going early. Is it weird to you we're even having this
conversation in women's basketball or is it a good thing, a step toward
equality?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I think it's a good thing, no question about it. I mean,
obviously we want her to stick around. I think it's great. In the bigger
picture, I believe all of these young people, men and women, should be able to
make that choice right out of high school. If I look at my son, who is a math
whiz, if Microsoft came to him and said, We would love for you to come work
for us, we'll pay you three million a year, whatever that salary is, but you
can't go to college, you're going to be a pro, we would encourage him to go. I
don't know why it's any different with athletes.  
  
I think that's great. That's the way our system operates. So good on her, good
on Jackie if that's what they decide. Being a college student-athlete is
special. It's a lot of fun. I think what they're experiencing, both of them,
just to use two examples, I think it's incredible. They've got to be enjoying
this ride.  
  
Q. This is more of a season-long question. It seems like UConn is
usually sort of the center of the women's college basketball universe. You
have been getting more national attention maybe than any other program besides
them. A new thing over the past year or so. What has the adjustment to that
been like for you? How has it impacted your team?  
KELLY GRAVES: That's a really good question.  
  
First of all, I think it's deserved. This is a fun group. They play good
basketball, they're unselfish. When you watch them, they play with lots of
joy. They have fun doing what they're doing.  
  
I don't think it's changed us at all. Sabrina is just as humble as she always
is. But you look every week, there's a new national article, video feature on
her. I don't think it's really changed her at all. Same with the others. I
think they're very humble kids. You just saw them all. I don't know if Erin
said much. Did Erin say much? Okay, Ruthy probably had a big old smile, happy-
go-lucky.  
  
Satou is more kind of thoughtful. Sabrina, as polished a student-athlete as
you're every going to see in front of a microphone. They're really good kids.
Maite probably didn't say much, right? That's how she plays. She is a
superstar who has a chance to play in the WNBA, but she's very happy playing
kind of a secondary role in terms of who is getting the attention.  
  
I'm just really blessed to have really nice young women who play their hearts
-- they play for each other, they play really, really hard. I'm proud of them.
Love each and every one of them.  
  
Again, I don't know if that answers your question or not. Sorry about that.  
  
Q. You said last night that you guys have been open from the beginning
about we want to play in Portland, the players were talking earlier before you
came in here about they want to go to Tampa. A lot of coaches shy away from
that. We're just focused on the next game, whatever. Why did you make that
decision to be bold and honest with them from the get-go about these are our
goals, it's okay for us to say them out loud?  
KELLY GRAVES: We didn't really do it that way I think until recently. If
that's what they were saying, I'm glad. I think for the most part we've talked
about just the next game, the next game, the next game.  
  
But c'mon, we'd all rather be playing close to home. I don't think there was
any doubt about that. That's no secret.  
  
But we had to earn that right. We had to win the Pac-12 championship outright.
We did. To me that's the toughest.  
  
Good, I'm glad. Like I said at the start, we don't want to be an Elite 8
program. We've done this now three times in a row. We want to take that next
step. I think we've worked hard enough to earn that right to do it. Now we
just got to go do it. This is a great circumstance for us. We're in a great
position to make that happen.  
  
We know Mississippi State is an amazing team, they are. They want it just as
bad, have worked just as hard to earn that right.  
  
Q. You talked about the players, but you didn't mention, has the
increased attention gone to your head?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, yeah (laughter). I don't have much of an ego really, so
no. They're not coming to see me. If you're coming to look at this, this body
of mine, we're in big trouble.  
  
But they have handled I think that pressure better than they could have. It's
really funny. It's like traveling with rock stars, seriously. The shout-outs
they get on Twitter from big-time pros, LeBron, everybody else. Kobe comes to
our game. They call us two days before we're playing at USC. Kobe's assistant,
he's bringing his daughter, her friends, Duck fans. They want to meet the team
after the game.  
  
You go to play at Washington, Sue Bird is across from our bench. Our governor
has come to a couple of our games, our senator Ron Wyden came down during
furlough, the federal employees could come for free. He took advantage of it,
brought a whole group down from Salem.  
  
If you look at the nine Pac-12 teams that we played, the road games, their
average attendance was 2700 on the year. When we played them, it was 5200. It
almost doubled. A, we're getting a lot of Duck fans that travel. B, there are
a lot of people interested in this group. There's some star power there. We
play a fun style. We've gotten a lot of the national attention. I think
they're kind of used to this. It's not a big deal.  
  
But I love what they've created. You walked into that place last night. This
was incredible. We're not at home. This isn't a home game. But we've got a lot
of fans that have traveled, that are interested in this group.  
  
I think it's great. It's great for women's basketball. I truly would love to
see Portland host a Final Four. We have two of the best fan bases right here
in the country in Oregon State and Oregon. We had a third NCAA tournament team
at Portland State. I think we're showing that we can support something like
that here.  
  
The Final Four hasn't been on the West Coast in a while. I think it's time for
it to come back.  
  
Q. You haven't shied away from the expectations of this team all season.
Before the season you had the picture of the Tampa skyline in the locker room,
that being the goal. For a lot of casual fans success or failure will be
whether or not you reach that. What do you say to those that that's the
mindset heading into tomorrow? How do you define success of this team this
season?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, we've never said Tampa or bust or anything like that. What
people want to say, they're going to say. We have talked most of the year
really in terms of just the next game, the next game, the next game. I think
we've compartmentalized that pretty well. I think maybe some are starting to
say a little bit more.  
  
That's always been our focus. If things don't go well tomorrow, then I'm not
going to look upon that as a failure of a season. We've won another Pac-12
championship. We put ourselves into a position to do it.  
  
The other day I was watching the men's tournament on our off day, there are
some really good teams in that Sweet 16 who were going home. The fact that
we've gotten this far three years in a row, I mean, it's hard. It is not easy
to do.  
  
We started this thing five years ago and have really made a quick climb. It
just doesn't happen in women's basketball very often. It doesn't happen in
power conferences very often, to go from really the bottom to now back-to-back
Pac-12 championships.  
  
No, I'm not going to play that game. We're going to go out, give it our best
tomorrow. I hope we win. We're going to play hard enough to win. If we do,
we're going to be really happy. We'll be humble but we'll be happy. If we
don't, we're going to be sad. We're not going to look back and say, This was a
failure.  
  
We only really care about what we think of ourselves. I don't really worry
about what others say, how they want to judge us. That's up to them. But I'm
proud of this group. I hope we can go further because I think they've worked
hard for it. This is something that they've wanted.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: See you guys.

_Portland, Oregon_  
  
Mississippi State-76, Arizona State-53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arizona State. Coach, we'll begin first with
your opening statement about tonight's game.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Sure, thank you.  
  
Well, it didn't go the way we wanted it to. Obviously we didn't quite execute
our game plan. Really proud of this team and everything they accomplished this
year. Really appreciate everybody here in Portland. You guys have done a great
job hosting. Appreciate everybody with the NCAA championship. It's always a
first-class experience.  
  
Also I just want to say an apology to Mississippi State. One of our players
did -- obviously a very physical game. One of our players did say something at
the end of the game that upset another one of their players. That's not who we
are. That's not what we ever do. We always shake hands. We're always very
respectful and classy.  
  
She feels really bad. I just wanted to say that. If there's any representative
on their team, you can pass it on, but I'll text Vic.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions to the student-athletes.  
  
Q. You were in foul trouble all night right from the start. What was
going on there trying to fight with McCowan generally that got you guys in
that much foul trouble?  
KIANNA IBIS: Yeah, it was really a battle down there today. It was a very
physical team. We just tried to match their physicality. We weren't
disciplined today, and that really showed.  
  
Q. Courtney, when it comes to the legacy of this senior class, what do
you think that will be looking back?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: I'm really proud of our senior class this year for stepping
up and leading our team and working hard. Hopefully that just paves the way
for the next group of seniors to come in next year and keep it going.  
  
Q. Reili, can you describe what this group of seniors has meant to you
personally?  
REILI RICHARDSON: Yeah, they're awesome. I loved playing with them. They did a
lot for our team. They're just paving the way for the future.  
  
Q. Kianna, maybe you can talk about the physical aspect of the game. A
lot of muscling going on inside. Had you faced a physical opponent like that
before? How did the game plan play out especially with having to contain a
physical presence like McCowan inside?  
KIANNA IBIS: I wouldn't say we've played a team as physical as them. I think
that's why they're going on to the Elite 8. I feel like they're going to go
far in this tournament.  
  
Yeah, we didn't execute the game plan because we weren't supposed to let them
get second shots. We weren't supposed to foul. Yeah, we just didn't match the
physicality. Like I said before, we weren't disciplined today.  
  
Q. Kianna, what do you think the senior legacy will be?  
KIANNA IBIS: I just want the team just to remember, like, how hard we worked
on and off the court, just who we were on and off the court, how we stood up
to Charli's standards and her culture, how we treated people, how we played
basketball, everything beyond that.  
  
Q. Reili, turnovers were an issue, too. Was it hard with as much effort
was being put in to try to contain McCowan, to match up with everybody else?
What about the quickness of their guards?  
REILI RICHARDSON: I think their pressure bothered us a little bit. We threw
passes that weren't there. We just forced it. We didn't do our game plan, so
that was ultimately it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you and congratulations on a great season, ladies.  
  
We will continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. It seemed like for a while you were keeping McCowan kind of under
control. Some of the other people were hurting you. Just eventually the fouls
mounted up to more than what has happened to you all year long.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, you know, obviously we were going to say make
other people beat us. A lot of the fouls were on the lane drive and we were
late. We were silly. Kianna, it wasn't on McCowan, kind of silly. We were not
a shot-blocking team. We probably had 10 fouls trying to block their shots.  
  
We just got away from things. I think the moment. I mean, we've been in this
situation so many times with teams this good. You know they're going to get a
step on you. They're just that good. You just have to be disciplined and don't
foul them, just run it right back at them.  
  
We just didn't do that. Honestly, watching all the film on Mississippi State,
it's just a total -- like I don't know how you decide who you call a foul on.
That's how I got my technical. You call a foul every time. I didn't think I
should get a technical for saying that. I didn't get warned either.  
  
Obviously we lost out on that whole battle of two people shoving each other.
But we fouled. We did. We didn't execute our game plan. I mean, we wanted to
make the guards beat us. I thought down the stretch we were kind of giving
them a little bit of everything. Then we kind of wanted to pick up our
pressure. So we didn't do that.  
  
But, you know, I think at the end of the day, I mean, we were doing a good job
of holding them. We didn't need to hit shots. We knew we needed to have a good
offensive game tonight. We got good shots I thought for the most part.
Courtney is an amazing shooter. Kianna's foul trouble, that really, really
hurt us. And that's on her. It was on her. It was silly fouls. I saw what they
called, didn't disagree with it, which is too bad. Incredible player like
that, it would have been nice to have her out there for more than 16 minutes
or whatever it was.  
  
But we needed other people to step up offensively. We just didn't quite get
shots to fall. I think if we would have had our clean looks fall, we would
have been right there. We were saying, they haven't lost close games this
year. Last year they had a lot of close games. They were good in them. This
year they haven't. Hang around, we know we're good in close games.  
  
We got away from things. Credit Mississippi State. Vic, with his four seniors,
coming up short two years in a row, they're a hungry, hard-working, talented
team. All the credit to them in terms of taking it to us today.  
  
Q. You played in a really good conference. Is that the best team you
played this year? Do you think they can win a national championship?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, I think it's wide open. I think it's hard to say
they're the best team. On any given day, Oregon, Stanford -- I mean, McCowan
kind of changes things a little bit. Then again, it depends on who you have to
match up. It depends on if those other kids hit some shots.  
  
I mean, we played Baylor. I think Baylor has a chance to win the national
championship. Played Louisville. Depending on how things go for them... That's
kind of a great thing about this year. I think for college women's basketball,
I mean, there's probably seven or eight teams really that could win this
national championship this year.  
  
Q. Obviously the question has been going around. What do you think the
legacy of this senior class will be?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I think they articulated it really well. They work hard.
They're great people. They live to the standards of our program on and off the
court, and we have very high standards. Very high standards that they are
getting As and Bs. They're great citizens, they're doing their community
service. They're just doing work, making great decisions with their life.  
  
Our four seniors do that impeccably. So I was really happy for them to at
least get this far in the tournament. I mean, obviously didn't play well
enough to advance. But they have done an amazing job showing our younger
players what it means to be a Sun Devil.  
  
Q. I think you were down by nine going into the fourth quarter. Did you
think at that point even with the foul trouble, whatnot, you still might be
able to get back into it?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, we felt good. We did. Obviously three possessions,
we were like just get the shots falling. Kianna, just keep her out there. They
didn't really feel like they could guard her.  
  
They just started overloading and going inside. I'll have to look at the tape.
I don't know. I mean, you know, both people are shoving on each other. It was
just foul, foul, foul, foul, foul. We were supposed to be sitting on her. I
called a timeout early. This is what they're doing, adjust.  
  
I don't know. We just weren't adjusting the way we normally do, so... But,
yeah, we thought we were right there. We can cover nine points pretty quick.
But, you know, I mean, that's the difference with a team. Again, they haven't
had a lot of close games for a reason. They know how to in the fourth quarter
put the foot on the jugular. Holmes hits a jumper. Daring to shoot, hit shots.
We needed that not to happen. We needed a little luck of the Irish or
something.  
  
Q. If it's Oregon against Mississippi State in the final, how do you
think those two teams match up?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Great question. They've already played. I watched that
game now twice. I watched it again last night. I mean, you know, Oregon does
have Hebard who can really match up pretty well with McCowan. Like, I don't
think we have someone that's quite that grippy. So I think they have that. I
think Oregon, you know, I mean, you want me to make my prediction?  
  
Q. Yeah.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I'll make it. You know I don't care. I mean, Oregon's
got the shooting. If Oregon brings their A game, I mean, they have everybody
on the floor, one through four, can just, you know, drain threes all game
long. I think their zone, the way they play defense, is the style you want to
play against Mississippi State.  
  
Sometimes if Oregon is playing a great shooting team, they can get themselves
in trouble. But a team like that that just wants their paint touches, lane
line layups, that plays into Oregon's hands.  
  
It will be a great game. I thought the first time around Oregon handled the
pressure really well. But, you know, McCowan got in foul trouble. But I'd give
the edge to Oregon. They're both great rebounding teams. Oregon has the best
backcourt in the country, in my opinion. They're going to take care of the
ball. They're going to get their shooters the shots that they need.  
  
Sorry, Vic (smiling). Back the Pac.  
  
Q. What was the problem with Reili?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Reili was nine to two. It was more our bench that had
untimely turnovers. The problem is Mississippi State. We actually normally
played that style. We adjusted our style this year. We'll get back, be a lot
more athletic next year and aggressive with our defense.  
  
One bad pass here or there, live turnover layup. We only had 16, which, I
mean, is still more than we normally have. I think we only average like 13 a
game. You can't have the live turnovers that give them the run- outs.  
  
We talked about it. I mean, one day of practice. We really don't have anybody
in our conference that plays Mississippi State style. UCLA a little bit. I
mean, I told them, You played against this style, this is us, the whole pre-
season. We needed to take a little bit better care of the ball. But we didn't
win the battle of possessions on either front.  
  
We take better care of the ball, we do a little bit better on the boards, we
got an exciting game at the end, ladies and gentlemen. I'm playing a deep
rotation. We kind of took turns a little bit and that hurt us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Thank you.

_Portland, Oregon_  
  
Mississippi State-76, Arizona State-53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're here with Mississippi State. We'll begin with an opening
statement from coach.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Just so proud of my team. Want to congratulate Arizona State. I
just have so much respect for Charli and her staff, her program. I've had some
real knock-down, drag-outs with them over my career. I love how they play. I
love their toughness and their competitive spirit. Her team embodies her.  
  
We're both very similar. We love our teams to be the way they are. I told my
kids tonight the tougher team was going to win. It was going to be about
toughness and resilience tonight. I thought we were really tough and showed a
lot of resilience. When they would make a run, we answered it.  
  
I'll say this now before anybody asks me. If there's a better point guard in
the country that brings the ball up the floor, handles her team, gets her team
into an offense, guards on the other end, you're welcome to tell me who that
is.  
  
She's number one in the country in assist-to-turnover ratio. She's number one
in the other most important stat, which is the W. Her team is 33-2, with four
new starters, two of which haven't even been in Starkville for eight months.
She was tremendous today. Another seven assists, zero turnover performance.
Again, our team goes as she goes on both ends.  
  
When you think about how you kind of set the tone for a game, if you're a
football coach it's your offensive and defensive line, being physical up
front. Jazz is physical up front. She's physical defensively. She's aggressive
offensively. She sets the tone. She means so much for our team, this year's
team, and our program. I just thought she was spectacular. I thought everybody
behind her played tremendous.  
  
Teaira was Teaira today, especially in the second half. It doesn't take much
when you come in at halftime and see she shot it one time. I'm pretty sure I
wrote down on offense what we needed to do to maybe fix a little bit of what
we were doing.  
  
That's kind of by plan, to be honest with you. But nonetheless, I just thought
our team was really tough and resilient today. I thought our execution was
outstanding. Only seven turnovers, which we wrote on the board, we don't need
to be turning the ball over. Execute. I thought our transition defense was
really good, which is what we were really worried about. That was the number
one concern with them because their posts really get out and run. I thought we
were really good in that aspect, as well.  
  
Their point guard, nine assists, two turnovers, did a heck of a job running
her team. Of course, Ibis, I thought she was really special as she's a heck of
a player.  
  
That's a great team that we beat today. I'm tickled to death that our kids
played the way they did. It took a great effort from us to win that game
tonight. So now we move on and we'll see who we play on Sunday.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. T, the defense really kind of got in on you, two or three players
surrounding you most of the game. How are you able to keep your composure as
that game went on? Constantly getting hit in the back, took some fouls on,
fouled some girls out. How were you able to handle yourself through four
quarters?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I know that I have to keep a cool head a little bit for my
teammates, as well as my coaching staff. I know I can't go out there and do
something crazy and get a technical and be sitting on the bench because that's
not what my team needs.  
  
At some point my teammates are going to knock down shots. They'll start fading
off, from three it will be two, then one-on-one. I just got to play it smart.  
  
Q. Teaira, you passed Sylvia Fowles to become the all-time tournament
leader in rebounding. Is that an accomplishment to you?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Yes, it is. My hard work is paying off. I fight for those
rebounds as well as anyone else. I'm just congratulating myself on just going
in and scoring on every board.  
  
Q. T, every game you play is physical inside. This one seemed like even
maybe more so than normal. Did you feel like it was?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Like you say, every game is physical. I mean, that's a
physical team right there. But the SEC is a physical conference, as well. It
was kind of the same. Physical is physical (smiling).  
  
Q. Jazzmun, can you talk about the atmosphere tonight. Tickets sold over
12,000 here tonight. Talk about the crowd and the atmosphere that you felt
around the arena.  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: Well, our Bulldogs travel, and they made it feel like home. So
I'm grateful for that. We were able to give them something that they wanted to
see.  
  
Q. Jazz, when you hear coach say time and time again that you're the
best point guard in the country probably hands down, what does that mean to
you? When you're out there, do you feel like you're playing like the best
point guard in the country?  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: I mean, I do. I really don't look at numbers. But, I mean,
credit to my teammates. I know he doesn't want me to turn the ball over, and
that's a big thing for him. I come out and focus on not turning the ball over,
giving my teammates the ball at certain times. Just scoring when I need to,
so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much.  
  
We'll take questions at this time for Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. We asked T pretty much every time a game is physical like that, was
this one more physical than others? She always says probably not because every
game is physical. When you're watching on the sideline, you saw that game, do
you feel like that one stacked up as more physical than some of the others you
played this year?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah, I mean, I think it was a physical game. I just think,
again, I love how Charli's teams play. Just like my teams. I think, you know,
it's hard to deal with T one-on-one. You got to bring help from somewhere. A
lot of times there were three people around her tonight.  
  
T has really gotten smart. I give the kid a lot of credit. She's developed
mentally in understanding what she can and can't do, whereas, hey, let's just
say a month and a half ago, she was a bull in a china cabinet that night we
played in Missouri and got beat. She's learned from that night.  
  
Not many seniors in the middle of their senior year humble themselves and go,
You know what, I got to change. She has. So you got to give that kid credit.
So I think for her, you know, it is physical. She's a big girl, and it's hard
to deal with her. So there were times out there early she was down on all
fours, didn't get up right away.  
  
The thing for her, she's had all the shots she can take in her back. She can't
have any more. She's been pushed around, beat on for four years. Our trainer,
Julie, she really has to do a great job with the other stuff, and Julie does.  
  
Again, it's nothing that we're not used to. I think for me, as I told her
tonight, I called her in and I said, Hey, I'm going to coach you until we're
done, you can't get emotionally involved or get in some kind of mouthing with
your opponent. You've got to keep your cool because, again, you get an
unsporting foul, a technical foul, that counts as a personal foul. We just
can't do that.  
  
T knows that. She knows that. But it's a challenge sometimes, you know.  
  
Q. First thing when Charli got in here said she apologized to
Mississippi State. What was that?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think one of her kids and T might have said some things to
each other going through the line. I corrected T as soon as we went in the
locker room. Before I said anything to my team, I called T in, we met. Again,
I'm not mad, I'm just trying to teach her, trying to coach her, just like
Charli is coaching and teaching her kid. That's who we are. We try to run a
classy program.  
  
Those kids, they're in the moment. Those kids are competing against each
other. It's two great kids. You get in the moment, again, my job is to coach
my kids and my team and teach 'em, Hey, you can't go there. You can't.  
  
My message to Teaira and my team is that people -- the real life lesson here
is that people know what your stats say, they know you can play, they know
you're a student-athlete, they got that. People in the real world at the
professional level, whether it's basketball or being in the professional
workplace, they want to know what kind of person you are, what's your
character like.  
  
You don't ever want anybody to question that. Maybe somebody in the arena sees
that, they might get a bad opinion, which isn't true. So we're both -- Charli
and I talked before I came in here. We both agree, we're coaching our kids,
we've already corrected them, and we move on.  
  
Q. Teaira, the rebounding career record in the NCAA tournament, what
does that kind of mean to you?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, I know who Sylvia Fowles was. She probably had never seen
her play. I knew who that kid was, the great player she was in this league,
and the records she holds in this league.  
  
Teaira McCowan just went into some real rare air, not to mention across the
country. I mean, Sylvia was in our conference, but she set the record for all
time in the NCAA tournament. Teaira McCowan just broke that. That's pretty
incredible.  
  
If I'm not mistaken, I think Sylvia was in the Final Four for three or four
straight years, all four. So Sylvia was in there all four years, made it all
the way into the Final Four all four years. So T has done it a little bit
ahead of schedule, so to speak.  
  
I'm just so proud of her. Again, the growth, the maturity of her, the course
of her career at Mississippi State, really special. It's tough. It's hard.
Y'all saw. It's like that most nights in our league, too.  
  
Q. Your bench had to come in in a key spot in the second quarter. Jordan
was having a good first quarter, Andy, too, then T. How did they handle that
moment? For the bench to come in and hold serve, how did you think they
handled that?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I thought they were spectacular. I thought Bre made a big three.
I told Jessika in the timeout, Here is what is going to happen. They're going
to come off of you, double on T, you'll be wide open for that free-throw
jumper. She's been working really hard on that in practice. I said, You're
going to square it up, knock it down. Boy, she did. If you notice, I was
grinning ear to ear. We all were on the bench. Mary even got up and gave me a
fist pump.  
  
Because that's what you do as coaches, you get kids, they develop, you see
them go out there and do something like that, do it with confidence. You see
them have success. I mean, that's what we do as teachers and coaches with
young kids 18 to 22.  
  
I thought those kids were really good. Myah came in right at the end of the
half, let me move Jazz to the two to let me get through to the end of the
quarter. I thought they were recall really good. Anriel was in foul trouble.
Got in foul trouble there late in the third. Jess came in.  
  
I was proud of my bench. Xaria came in, did a good job, missed a couple free
throws, I'd like her to make those, but put herself in a position to be there.
My bench has done that all year. They kept getting better. That's what I love
about them, you know.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, congratulations. We'll see you on Sunday.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: All right. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

_Portland, Oregon_  
  
Oregon-63, South Dakota State-53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have with us South Dakota State. Coach, we'll begin with
your opening statement.  
  
AARON JOHNSTON: Well, congratulations to Oregon. Played well. They just really
defended I thought very well against us. I thought controlled some of the
tempo offensively.  
  
Talked to our team real briefly afterwards about the game, not so much about
the season or that idea, but just about the game. I thought we played hard
enough to win. Did a lot of good things. Held a team that scores an awful lot
of points to 63. If you would have asked me that at the beginning of the day
if that would be a good thing, the answer would be yes.  
  
Rebounded the ball really well. Just great effort throughout the entire game
by our entire group. I just think they defended really well. Made it really
hard for us to get to the basket and score, either transition or halfcourt.
That was tough for us. Just weren't able to get enough offense to really hang
in there.  
  
Proud of the team. Collectively just had a phenomenal season. We had a good
night tonight, but not a great night. We ran into a really good team, so we
needed to be better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Madison, can you describe what it's like defending Sabrina.  
MADISON GUEBERT: She's running off screens. She's coming off handoffs, ball
screens, down screens, all kinds of screens. Yeah, it's tough because she's
always constantly -- she moves so well without the ball. They're always
looking for her.  
  
Yeah, she just is constantly moving so it's tough to defend her.  
  
Q. Macy, you guys put up 75 shot attempts. You can't be upset with that
performance. Are you frustrated those shots weren't falling?  
MACY MILLER: Like AJ said, defensively we did everything right we wanted to.
Offensively it stinks because we struggled today. I wish shots would have
fallen for us, but not tonight.  
  
Q. Myah, how much did their length bother you inside? They're so tall.  
MYAH SELLAND: I think initially we were probably a little passive. They're
long, they're athletic. I think that maybe disrupted some of our shots. Then
maybe took us out of our flow there right away in the game.  
  
As the game went on, I thought we kind of got back into it and were able to
take some shots. They just weren't falling tonight.  
  
Q. Macy and Madison, this is a tough moment, but how proud are you of
the careers you put together, that your final act was getting this team to a
barrier that hadn't been broken before?  
MACY MILLER: Right now, I'll be honest, this really stinks. I'm proud of Madi.
I'm proud of the seniors, what we accomplished. Proud of our teammates. We
made history this year, so there's nothing we can be sad about.  
  
MADISON GUEBERT: It's a tough one tonight, but that doesn't take anything away
from the phenomenal and special season that this team had this year. To make
it to the Sweet 16 and make history like that is something that none of us are
ever going to forget.  
  
I just couldn't be more proud to be a part of a team that is so special. We've
had such a strong community of supporters. Everyone was painting the town blue
back home in Brookings. I know we had a ton of people watching, had tons of
people that traveled out, former players, friends, family. The support we've
received this year has been just absolutely unbelievable. Couldn't be more
proud to be part of this team. Going to miss being out there. But as Macy
said, can't wait to watch where this team continues to go.  
  
Q. Madison, you were familiar with the Ducks. You played each other back
in December. What was the difference between the two games, if there was
one?  
MADISON GUEBERT: Yeah, you know, I just think that both teams were a lot
better since December when we played the first time. Like AJ said, defensively
we were in it right there, and it wasn't a matter that the effort wasn't
there, because it was. We were just kind of out of our rhythm for a little
while offensively. Had a tough shooting night.  
  
But, yeah, we were just a little bit out of rhythm offensively especially.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much for your time.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach Johnston.  
  
Q. What did you see between the first game and this game, how Oregon
attacked you, maybe what they did different defensively?  
AARON JOHNSTON: Well, defensively they were a lot more -- you know, in that
last game in Brookings, it was just a little different, a little more free
flowing. They were mixing between man and zone a little bit. I think we kind
of caught them in some of those transitions. We were able to score. They
really settled in and just played man-to-man defense a lot here and I thought
defended much better.  
  
We got a lot in transition back in Brookings. They got themselves back and got
themselves set. To me that was just the big difference. Their defense ramped
up from where it was back in Brookings.  
  
I thought we defended well. I mean, we're playing against some really
phenomenal players. So to think you're just going to lock somebody down,
that's not going to happen. But we just couldn't generate enough offense. I
thought their length, somebody asked about that, that was a big factor in the
game. They challenged shots at the rim, contested shots at the rim.  
  
We had some good ones, but they also forced us to take some tough ones,
especially in the second quarter, we got out of sync, scrambling the rest of
the way trying to play catch-up.  
  
Q. What do you think this season will mean for your program going
forward, what these seniors did in getting past that Sweet 16 barrier?  
AARON JOHNSTON: I mean, it's a great opportunity to really grow in a special
way as a team. They've set a new bar that we'll try to aspire to every single
year. Everybody goes through that process. I can remember, I'm trying to think
now, probably the fourth time we've played Oregon, it was several years before
we played them, they've come a long way in a short period of time. They've
broken some barriers and set some new standards for their program.  
  
Everybody goes through this as you're trying to move forward. Really
disappointed that the season came to an end, that we say good-bye to three
phenomenal seniors. But there's no doubt, everybody that comes from this point
on has a new standard, a new target.  
  
If we can do that a lot, that would be a really good thing. We've done that a
lot. As a program, I feel really good about where things stand, I feel really
good about this team. A bunch of great people. Played really hard today. Just
love how hard they played. Just didn't work for us on the offensive side.  
  
Q. Talk about your team's resiliency. You mentioned the fight they had.
Talk about how important that was.  
AARON JOHNSTON: Yeah, you know, we got down. We got down in the first second
round, too. We made pushes. We got down in this one. I thought we hung in
there. They did make a big push in that third. We found a way to kind of
finish, get it back, so it was still a game.  
  
Still to their credit, I thought they controlled a lot of the tempo, a lot of
the things that went on. They just play at a great pace all the time.
Sometimes it's fast, sometimes it's methodical, trying to get a certain
matchup. Our team has really competed all year. I wasn't surprised to see them
play that hard here today.  
  
Great people do that. Both teams I'm sure have great people, but we certainly
do, I know that.  
  
Q. Officially neutral site game, but did it feel like a road game with
all the green in the stands?  
AARON JOHNSTON: Well, yeah, of course. I mean, they had a great crowd.
Somebody asked me that yesterday. I think that's great. I think that's where
you want to be at this point in the season. You want it to matter, not just to
the two teams on the floor, but you want it to matter to everybody in the
stands. And they had a great crowd.  
  
We had a great crowd. But we had a lot of people from Brookings come to this
game. We had a handful of past players, a couple of them I think came to the
game today. Asked where they're staying. They said the airport, we're flying
out tomorrow morning. I thought, Do you need money for a room? Can we help you
out here?  
  
We had a lot of people come. It mattered to both fan bases. One fan base was a
couple hours away so they could drive. Both fan bases really support women's
basketball, that's great to see for everybody.  
  
Q. As you said, you were able to contain Oregon to a degree, you kept it
relatively close for most of the game. What do you think the teams going
forward in the tournament will be able to learn from your performance that
will help them?  
AARON JOHNSTON: I mean, that's hard. Everybody plays a different style. We
kept it close, but they were really efficient offensively. They were still
very good. So there's still some ground to make up.  
  
But every team is just so different. I think for us, we played pretty
physical. I think that's a good thing. Game was physical I thought both ways.
But they're just hard to stop. Like I said, they have such great tempo and
great purpose about what they're trying to get done. They have so many key
players that can make plays.  
  
Having played them twice this year, they're awfully good, for sure.  
  
Thank you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much, coach.

_Portland, Oregon_  
  
Oregon-63, South Dakota State-53  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Oregon. Coach, we'll begin with your opening
statement.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, first want to congratulate South Dakota State on a great
tournament, a great season. We saw them in December. We saw them again
tonight. I don't want to play them again. They play so hard. They're so well-
coached. Those players just know how to play. Gave us everything that they
could tonight.  
  
I was really proud of our team. I thought once we established a little bit of
dominance there, we just kind of played to hang on. That was unfortunate. We
certainly didn't shoot it very well tonight. But I thought defensively we were
on point. I thought we played really hard, played to the scout.  
  
I was really proud of these three. The three All-Americans are supposed to
step up in these kind of games. They did. I think all three of you had double-
doubles of some sort. That's nice to see, when you're not playing your best,
your best players got to step up.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Sabrina, the other night after you had a triple-double you talked
about it a little bit on Instagram. You didn't get there tonight. You were
super close. Could you give us a little background? Do you feel like even with
how accomplished you have been individually, you hear from some male haters,
none of whom have any athletic talent anyway?  
SABRINA IONESCU: That was nice. I mean, yeah, even after that post, I got
about 2,000 to 3,000 comments. More than half of them were bashing me or my
team. I did it in a joking manner. I read it, but I don't take it to heart.  
  
I mean, I was just trying to advocate for what I believe in, what I think all
women should believe in. Now I'm starting to see it more on Twitter. People
are kind of starting to post about it. It was nice to see some former Oregon
players, some former NBA, WNBA players responding to that post and
appreciating it.  
  
Q. You didn't shoot particularly well from outside three-point range. Do
you think the background in the bigger arena had anything to do with that?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, it could have. I mean, we're just so comfortable
shooting at our home court. But we're going to have to adjust and hit those
shots on Sunday. We're given another opportunity.  
  
I think we did well for the fact that we didn't shoot the ball very well. We
got the ball inside. We were still efficient regardless of our shooting
percentage. But we're definitely going to have to adjust and do that Sunday.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: I feel like we all have to get used to those kind of gyms,
especially where we want to go. Getting all the misses out today was actually
a good thing. The good thing about our team is we are not defined by shooting
threes, we're defined by getting the ball inside, having really strong players
that can do everything.  
  
Q. Satou, you were pretty ecstatic after that game. What was going
through your mind right as the game was wrapping up, you get back in the
locker room? What was going on with all those emotions you were showing?  
SATOU SABALLY: I was just so excited for our team. We've been working so hard
all through season, even before in the off-season and summer. I'm just really
proud of each player in our team. We deserve this. We know where we want to
be.  
  
Just being able to close the game like that, having a great game, except like
maybe our shooting, but we finished it like champions. That's what we want to
be.  
  
Yeah, I was just super excited. I was just screaming around, hugging everyone,
just being the energizer I'm trying to be.  
  
Q. Ruthy, I want to know why you got rid of your braids. Is it a
superstition thing?  
RUTHY HEBARD: No. No. Coach was actually like, When we beat Mississippi State,
you wore your natural hair. Here we go, let's do this. Let's get there. Just
trying to switch it up.  
  
Q. Sabrina, did Ruthy and Satou hog too many rebounds tonight?  
SABRINA IONESCU: No, not enough. I hold them to a super high standard. She
should be getting every single rebound. It was a little difficult because of
how many threes they shot, those rebounds were a little bit long. That's what
we have to do every game in order to take our team to another level.  
  
Q. What do you think about being matched up with Mississippi State again
when the bracket came out? I know it's one game at a time, but players look
ahead. Did you want another game with them?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, it didn't really matter to us. Super excited to be
able to play that team again. Their offensive efficiency is great. So is ours.
I think it will be a great matchup on a neutral court.  
  
I think we're excited. They're one of the top teams in the country. I think
it's going to show how much we've grown from the last time we played them and
what we need to work on. There is pros and cons to playing a team for the
second time. But I think we're so used to that with the Pac-12, we'll be able
to grow on our weaknesses.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: I mean, I'm personally excited because I had a really bad game
the last time we played them. I'm really fired up. I wanted Mississippi State.
I know that they're a really great matchup. They were in the Final Four last
year. They're just going to make us better.  
  
Q. Sabrina, third year in a row that y'all are in the Elite 8. How long
have you been thinking about this opportunity? What are your emotions now that
you're here?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, we've been thinking about this opportunity since our
last loss last year to Notre Dame. This is what we work for, this is what we
dream of. Now it's time to make our dreams a reality. We're going to come out
tomorrow -- Sunday, we're going to come out Sunday dialed in, ready to go and
not let this opportunity slip away because it is a great one.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. We will see you on Sunday.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Go Ducks.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up to questions for Coach Graves.  
  
Q. It looked like you were in man most of the time. Other games you've
done a lot of switching. What was your thinking behind that? How big a key do
you think that was?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, we always start in man every game. We make the adjustments
if we're not doing so well. But I thought we were on point defensively right
from the start tonight. So we played 40 minutes of man-to-man defense.  
  
The one thing that concerns you about South Dakota State is their ability to
beat you three at a time. I thought by playing man, we cut down on their
opportunities. They didn't have as many good looks out there. They shot almost
as poorly as we did. That was an ice cold shooting game for both teams from
downtown.  
  
Q. Looking at the stat sheet, the one thing that stands out to me is you
were out-rebounded, 20 offensive rebounds. Probably don't want that on Sunday,
do you?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, probably not. They were wearing blue. I thought it was
UCLA there for a while, the way they rebounded against us.  
  
I thought we got out-worked on the boards. We got pushed under too many times,
and they seemed to get all the long rebounds.  
  
We've been a pretty good rebounding team most of the year. I won't be too
concerned with that other than we better do a better job because Anriel Howard
and Teaira McCowan, they get a lot of them.  
  
Q. You've already played Mississippi State, you have a scouting report
on them. I would assume they're going to change their defense because you
killed them with the pick and roll in December. How much can you change in 36
hours?  
KELLY GRAVES: We'll use a little bit of what we used last time. I think both
teams are a little bit different now. I know Chloe Bibby is not with them. She
was when we played them the first time. She's an outstanding outside shooter.
So they're playing Espinoza a little bit more.  
  
Yeah, I mean, we're not going to change at this point too much. We have one
practice tomorrow. We won't even have a shootaround on Sunday. We've got to
get this in pretty quickly. I think in these back-to-back games you kind of
stay true to your character.  
  
I think the first game of the week you have a chance to put new things in if
you want to. No, it's going to come down I think Sunday to who just plays
harder and is tougher. Ultimately somebody is going to have to make some plays
to win the game. It's going to be a really, really good game against two very
good teams. Offensively we've been two of the top three scoring teams in the
country all year, two of the most efficient.  
  
The game will probably be decided at the defensive end.  
  
Q. What goes through your mind when you see Sabrina flying at the scores
tables and benches?  
KELLY GRAVES: I love it. That's the only way we know her. That's how she
plays. You know what, if it was a drill in the first third of practice, she'd
be doing the same thing. I mean, that's just kind of who she is. That's how
she's wired. That's why she's as great as she is.  
  
No worries. She won't change. We don't want her to change.  
  
Q. Talk about Satou, the energy she played with in the first half
especially. Seemed like she was out there to energize people.  
KELLY GRAVES: She was. I thought her first half was one of the better halves
of the season. Both ends of the floor she was a factor to block shots,
rebounding well, changed some of their shots as well. Just was really
aggressive offensively. When she plays like that, that gives us a whole
different dynamic. It's not just a Ruthy and a Sabrina show. She can bring
something that no one else can to us.  
  
If we can get the rest of our shooters to, you know, kind of get their rhythm
and hit something, then we become pretty tough to guard. But she is that X
factor, no doubt about it.  
  
Q. There was so much buildup about this opportunity to play in Portland.
Did it feel like it took the team a little bit to settle into that? Did it
feel like a home game but maybe not quite like a home game?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, we felt like we were at home. I mean, the crowd was loud.
They were really engaged. I think we put them to sleep in the fourth quarter.
But, yeah, we had eyes toward Portland right from the beginning. I'm not going
to lie about that. We wanted to play well enough. We knew we had to earn it.
They weren't just going to give it to us. By winning the Pac-12 regular season
championship, we earned the right to come here. Like I said, it was in the
back of our minds. Now I'm glad we're here.  
  
It's an advantage. The reality is Mississippi State has played in a lot of
very tough venues in the SEC. They've already played at our place. They're
used to this kind of an atmosphere. I don't think it will affect them at all.
That's a pretty seasoned basketball team with one of the best coaches if not
the best coach in college basketball right now in Vic.  
  
Q. You talked about how it wasn't a great offensive game, but you really
got Ruthy going in the second half. Was that deliberate or just sort of the
way the game presented itself?  
KELLY GRAVES: A little bit of both. We knew going in they just didn't have
much of an answer there. Especially if they were switching in the pick'n roll,
which they did, we were able to get to it early and often. She even left a few
out there on the court tonight that's almost automatic for her.  
  
I think that's always our first priority, when we game plan, how can we get
her the basketball. Then what happens, you make the other team adjust, are
they going to send help, if they send help, then we're the best by percentage,
we've been the best three-point shooting team in the country all year long.
Four of 20 tonight may hurt that a little bit.  
  
That's kind of how it all starts. So you look at the two games we lost in the
Pac-12 this year, we didn't have Ruthy for the most part. That hurt.  
  
Q. You talked about the three. Erin was held scoreless. How disappointed
was she? Did she stalk to you after the game? Did you talk to her about her
evening?  
KELLY GRAVES: Oh, I haven't yet. I mean, I think as a shooter, you have to
have a short memory. You just got to get back out. The one thing with Erin is
if she makes one, she's going to make five, and they're going to come quick.
She needs to see the ball go through the basket. We ran a couple sets for her,
got her some good looks. It's one of those nights it happens. Every shooter
has been there before. You saw the young man that plays for Virginia, he was
like one for 18, then finally hit a couple. That was the difference against
our men last night.  
  
Well, we hope that Erin is just saving them for Sunday.  
  
Q. Charli said after the Mississippi State game she doesn't think
there's anyone in the Pac-12 that's like Mississippi State. Do you agree with
that or do they remind you of anyone?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, they're athletic like UCLA. We've seen that. I think
that's the beauty of being in the Pac-12, we see a little bit of everything.
But, no, nobody has a center that is like Teaira. She's just one of a kind.
Man, I'm telling you, she is so, so good. The pressure they put on you
defensively is really unlike anything we see in the Pac-12. Arizona State is a
good example. But they don't really pick you up full court and try and turn
you, disrupt your tempo like Mississippi State.  
  
But we played them before. That gives us a little bit of experience there. And
nobody has one-liners like Vic Schaefer. He's really the best in the game. He
truly is.  
  
Q. Was there any thought toward playing Taylor tonight?  
KELLY GRAVES: There was a thought, yes. To be honest with you, I wish maybe
I'd gotten her in at the end just to have her feet on the court before we play
Mississippi State.  
  
But when you're injured, I think any chance you get to just get a little bit
more rest I think is a good thing. But we're hoping that she's available on
Sunday because she gives us a huge lift and is a player that we don't have. We
don't have anybody that plays like her. We need her and we've missed her, so
fingers crossed. We'll see.  
  
It's late. Let's go to bed. Can we do that?  
  
THE MODERATOR: I like that plan, coach.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: You can go to bed. I got to watch film.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
PORTLAND](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+PORTLAND)

  

## March 28, 2019

  

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30388)

  
_Portland, Oregon_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arizona State head coach Charli Turner Thorne.  
  
Coach, congratulations for making it this far. Open it up for your opening
statement.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Sure.  
  
Well, we're obviously very excited to be here, but I guess I would just say
we're not surprised. I mean, we definitely have had a great season. We have a
team that's played toe-to-toe with the best teams in the country consistently
from November till March really.  
  
I'm proud of this team. The exciting thing for us this year is that we do have
all these games under our belt. We played Mississippi State last year, so a
lot of familiarity with what it takes.  
  
For us, it's going to take a lot more efficiency on both sides of the ball
from our first two games, but we're capable of doing that.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions.  
  
Q. You were talking the other day about trying to find a championship
offense to match your championship defense. Talk more about what that would
look like if your team can reach that championship offense.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, I mean, I guess in general terms, it would just be
getting the best shot every time down, just shooting -- kind of what I just
alluded to, efficiency. At times in games we get the shots we want, we just
don't quite knock them down.  
  
We just need to get the shots that we want, which against Mississippi State,
they're a very stingy defense. For the most part we have five scorers on the
floor at all times.  
  
I talked about this a little bit after the Miami game, not trying, with
Courtney and Kianna and Robbi, we got to get your shots. Letting it happen.
Obviously Jamie can score. Sophia, whoever else is in the game, Reili gets an
open look, everybody is ready to step up and score. We're going to need that.
We're going to need everybody to be kind of taking turns.  
  
I mean, I kind of joked, if Kianna wants to go for 30, that's great. But
realistically we need our bench to step up again. We need to have a real
balanced attack. That's as much as I'm going to say (smiling).  
  
Q. A lot of Pac-12 teams still alive in this tournament. What do you
think that says about where the conference is? How pleased are you to see
that?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Very pleased. Again, not surprised at all. I think a lot
of our conference coaches have felt, because we play tough schedules in the
pre-season, top to bottom, we have been the most dominant conference in the
country all year long. I think that's just playing out right now. I'm not
surprised at all.  
  
Super happy for our conference. It's going to be fun to see how everything
plays out, how well our five Sweet 16 teams do the rest of the way.  
  
Q. How has Kianna been able to elevate her game over the last couple of
years? She's grown year after year, seems to be doing outstanding this
season.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Absolutely. Thank you.  
  
You know, just by hard work really. This season, last year all-conference
player, stepped up for us. Kind of had a great game, then would kind of have a
quiet game, have a great game. Going into her senior year, we said, Hey,
that's not going to cut it this year. Every game we need you locked in, being
your honey badger self, looking to score.  
  
She got in with our assistant, offensive work, watched film. I feel like she
just really was more like a pro this year in terms of her approach of, Okay,
how am I going to score, keeping up on her individual workouts.  
  
She's just very limited, I want to say. She had that horrible knee injury her
senior year in high school, so the reason -- she isn't this role player that
developed, she was a star when we signed her. It took us about a year and a
half to get her fully healthy and able to manage that knee. That's what we've
done I think really well. Diana, my trainer, have done that really well.  
  
She is kind of limited with practice and stuff, yet she still works so hard to
make sure she's prepared on both sides of the ball.  
  
She's a great defensive player. She led our team in steals, plays both sides
of the ball.  
  
Q. Arizona State did surprise some people by showing up in the Sweet 16.
I'm going to cram all my questions in here. Why do you think the Sun Devils
are underestimated? Can you tell us a little bit about how the team grew this
year, in what ways? How are you able to get the most out of your players,
which you seem to do every single year?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Wow, okay. I don't know. I think if you're preparing to
play us, you don't underestimate us. I think maybe around the country if
you're not paying attention, maybe you do.  
  
I appreciate that. I think this team has grown. We had high expectations
coming in. We had a good pre-season, right there knocking off a couple top-
five teams. We have experience, we have depth. All returners back with some
great freshmen.  
  
But probably, you know, just a little more inconsistent than we wanted to be
in the Pac-12. Welcome to the Pac-12 (laughter). Have your A game every single
week, it's just brutal. I think just like everybody, slowed by people not
fully healthy, stuff like that, through different stretches.  
  
I don't credit myself. I credit this team for being where they're at right
now. They're totally selfless. They have not made it about me the entire year.
I think that allows you to get better, allows you to pull together. When
you're shooting 30-some percent, end up in the Sweet 16 somehow, some way,
because you're tough and gritty, you got a pretty good defense.  
  
Q. In the tournament so far, is there any moment that really stands out
to you as showing this is what my team can do, in the games so far? This is
all clicking, what I want to see going forward?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, I think in the Miami game obviously just the final
two defensive stops were huge. But also just the bench scoring. Iris, not
known for her three-point shooting, just drains a three, get a tip-in. Jamie
comes in off the bench in the fourth quarter, hits a couple threes. Not so
much one moment, but just sort of I think that really characterizes our team,
timely scoring from next woman up.  
  
We've been at our best when we play that way. Then always just having
confidence that we can get a stop.  
  
Q. The Cancun game, you were talking about how Howard has filled in the
role for Vivians. How do you see Mississippi State compared to the team you
faced a year or so ago?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: I think McCowan is better. She has just continued to
grow and get better and better as a player. Give her and Vic a lot of credit,
their coaching staff, mainly obviously McCowan.  
  
Howard, she's a little different from Vivians, but she's playing that same
role. I mean, she's All-American, three-level scorer. She might be a little
more dynamic rebounder, to be honest.  
  
Again, they've continued to grow the players in their program, much like we
do. You think, Oh, they graduated this player. Uh-oh, that next players just
steps in. They're every bit as good every single year. I think we both have
programs like that. They've done that very well.  
  
They're very similar. They're pressing, pressuring, running dribble-drive,
running their sets for their specific scorers at any given point. I don't
know, because I'll probably know after we play them, I thought they had the
veterans, Williams, Schaeffer in the backcourt, but I'm watching them, they
got four seniors out there, so they still have great veterans that are doing
all those same things, playing tenacious, pressure defense.  
  
They're just really good at knowing who they are. They know who they are. They
know what their role is. They play it really well. Each person knows how
they're supposed to score. They look for each other, they take turns doing
that role very, very well.  
  
We thought UCLA and Oregon rebound well, but, whew. I mean, I think all those
teams are in that category where it's like, Okay, wow, it's going to be a team
rebounding effort, for sure.  
  
Q. The idea of a super regional concept of everyone going to Las Vegas.
They're going to have a big crowd here, over 11,000. What do you think of the
super regional idea, now having been to Vegas for the Pac-12 tournament?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah. I talked to Debbie Antonelli at length about that
because she originated -- I think it really started with her. I think
everybody in this room knows who Debbie is.  
  
I love the idea. I absolutely love the idea. I think it would be amazing for
our game to build equity in Vegas, a place that's a destination, where a lot
of people want to go, have all those teams there, bringing their fans, having
a place where maybe you could even recruit people within the community,
surrounding areas that like women's basketball.  
  
I absolutely love it. I mean, I've been doing this 30 years in Division I
college coaching. We keep moving backwards. We can't play on neutral sites,
we're not filling the stands. I don't know. I'll go on record, I don't care,
I'm old, doesn't matter.  
  
No, I mean, that would sell out. That would be unbelievable. I mean, the
turnout, it's just kind of to me a no-brainer. Now that legislation has
changed in terms of the NCAA bylaws with gambling. I really hope that we're
looking at it because I think it would be unbelievable for our game and for
the NCAA tournament.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your time. Best of luck tomorrow
against Mississippi State.  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Thank you.

## March 28, 2019

  

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

  
_Portland, Oregon_  
  
THE MODERATOR: First up is Mississippi State and head coach Vic Schaefer.  
  
Welcome to Portland, and your opening statement, please.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: We're excited to be here. Just awfully proud of my team, as I've
said many times. This is a special group. Much has been documented and said
about our group this year. Four new starters, losing a starter in the middle
of January, two new kids to our starting lineup that haven't been here nine
months. Really proud of where they are.  
  
We're excited to be here. These young ladies have certainly accomplished a lot
to date. We know we have a big task in front of us here. Just so impressed
with Arizona State, their team. Again, know them well. I've played them
several times throughout my career. We played them a year ago in the islands,
had a knock-down, drag-out with them.  
  
It was a tremendous basketball game. We were fortunate to win that one. Just
extremely impressed with their team, Ibis and Ekmark have been tremendous for
them. You can't take your eyes off of the rest of them. Ryan is another guard
out there that can really shoot it. I'm really impressed with their point
guard play, how hard they rebound it, run the floor.  
  
We're going to really have to play well. We've had a lot of time to look at
them and study them. I think our kids are excited, but they certainly have a
great understanding of what's coming. You have to really take your hat off to
them, they went and won on somebody else's floor second round, beat a higher
seed. They're playing extremely well. Obviously, they're no stranger to the
West Coast.  
  
Our trip was good yesterday. Took us four and a half hours to get here. I'm
not sure there's any further place we could have had to go travel to from
Starkville to play in the NCAA tournament. We're excited to be here. Look
forward to the challenge.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. You referred to the game in Cancun. ASU has essentially the same team
back. Back to that game, what did you learn about ASU from that game?  
VIC SCHAEFER: They, like -- their five has started 60 games together in a row.
She has a heck of a team. Their chemistry, you can tell watching them play,
it's really good.  
  
That always concerns you when you play a team like that that's played together
for so long. Their chemistry is good, they have a feel for each other, they
know where each other is going to be. They know in certain situations maybe
when something is taken away, they know what the counter is. It's an
instinctual thing.  
  
I think back to that game in the islands, it was like every other game I
played against Charli's teams. They're tough, physical, aggressive, they
rebound at an incredibly high level. Execution, I mean, you talk about an
offensive team now that will just out-execute you. They're very impressive on
that end of the floor, in my mind.  
  
Defensively we're going to have to really be solid for a long time. Lots of
teams will quick shoot you, take the first available. This team is going to
get the shot they want at the time they want it.  
  
Thinking back to that game we played a year ago, unlike any of the others.
They're just a tough, physical, aggressive basketball team, and well-coached,
obviously.  
  
Q. Speaking on the chemistry piece, where do you feel like your team is
in that regards? At this point in the year, you felt like Anriel and Teaira
were starting to mesh well together. Your whole unit, what you're bringing off
the bench, how well are they playing together?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think it's getting better and better. I walked out of our
defensive practice this morning at Portland State feeling like that may be the
best 30 minutes of practice we've had in a long time. It was because of our
chemistry, communication, things like that.  
  
It's getting better, to answer your question. That's the thing with this team,
we've got so many new moving parts that it just takes a while. Especially on
the defensive end, that's the piece that really is late usually coming. I'm
hopeful that we'll continue to work and get better.  
  
I do think we're getting better, though.  
  
Q. Probably prematurely I'll ask you about coming to Portland at the
selection show, now that you're here, what are you expecting the fan turnout
to be like?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Just like anywhere we travel. I think Bulldogs from all over,
within driving distance, will be here. This team, our program, has become a
real identity for Mississippi State. I'm very proud of that.  
  
Our kids really relish that. They embrace it. They understand the
responsibility that comes with it. So I expect us to have a great crowd here,
to be honest with you. We've had a lot of fans everywhere we've been. When we
were out here in December, we had a lot of fans at the Washington game.  
  
I would expect us to have a good turnout out here.  
  
Q. Obviously you guys have had some pretty commanding victories in the
tournament so far. Have there been any moments when you felt like your team
was truly challenged just in the games that have happened to this point?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Oh, sure. I mean, Clemson's really good. If you're just talking
about the NCAA tournament, Clemson was really good. We had one little stretch
there in that first quarter where we were able to separate ourselves. We
played really good defensively in the first half. That's the first team that
comes to mind.  
  
If you want to go back even into the SEC tournament, all those games, to me
we're down I think five or six to Tennessee in the first round. Missouri was a
knock-down, drag-out. Arkansas. All those games were at some point we had to
really play well to separate ourselves.  
  
I think you have to give our kids a little credit in that we were able to do
that, find another level, then at the same time we know that every game, we've
got to play well, people are coming for us.  
  
The thing with this team is we've led from the front all year. They were
picked first. It is so hard to lead from there. It's so easy when you're
picked fourth to finish third, second or first. It takes the pressure off. But
when they pick you first, that is a challenge for any team, I don't care if
you're talking about professional or college. To be able to do that I think is
really special. It says a lot about our kids.  
  
That being said, we've certainly been challenged all throughout the year. I
think any of the games you see where we may have won with a little bit of a
cushion just I think speaks to maybe one run during a game where you were able
to get away.  
  
We played Tennessee in the regular season, and it was tied late in the third
quarter before we separated ourselves and ended up winning that game. Every
game comes down to a run usually.  
  
Q. What is the matchup like for T in this game in the paint?  
VIC SCHAEFER: She's going to go against a couple kids that really play hard.
They're going to defend her at a really high energy level. They're going to be
physical with her. They're able to match her physical capabilities. You might
look at them and go, They're not 6'7", they might not seem as big. Trust me,
they are physically capable of handling her. We've seen it before. They're
going to really try to do that, use their quickness and athleticism, which
they have.  
  
It's an intriguing matchup, for sure.  
  
Q. On the topic of T, she's played a lot of really good basketball in
her career, a lot of that has come in the NCAA tournament. Aside from just
being physically imposing, what is it about T that has allowed her to do
that?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, when you get to this time of year, your go-to players
really have to perform. You have to give her credit for her focus. I call it,
as you know, her interest level. Seems like this time of year she really gets
interested and really gets focused. She's been that way now for about a month,
ever since the Valentine's Day massacre, as I call it, when we got beat by
Missouri at home. She has really locked in.  
  
I think she learned in this game, she learned something. That says a lot about
her. I know Johnnie spent some time with her watching film, Coach Harris. She
realized some things she just can't do.  
  
But for this time of year, you're absolutely right, starting back to her
sophomore year, I'll even go back to her freshman year, she was about the only
one that we had on the team that didn't look scared at Connecticut when we got
beat in the Sweet 16 up there.  
  
She's a competitor. She understands the importance of this time of year.
Nobody did it better last year. I mean, she averaged 20-something rebounds a
game in the NCAA tournament. That's crazy against the competition that we
played against.  
  
Q. You have a common opponent in Oregon. Is there anything you've
learned particularly because you played Oregon, studying ASU games against
Oregon?  
VIC SCHAEFER: When I watched that game, I was strictly looking at Arizona
State. I certainly wouldn't want to tip my hat on anything that I learned from
them other than you learn in watching those two teams play how competitive
both of them are. Obviously Arizona State had a chance to win both games.
That's very impressive from my standpoint.  
  
Obviously playing Oregon, I've played them now three straight years, have a
great deal of respect for Kelly and his program and those players, know how
good they are. To see Arizona State compete with them, play them down to the
last possession really in both games, is quite impressive.  
  
Coach Turner Thorne and her team, they have our undivided attention. We know
how good they are. She is a tremendous coach, her staff is tremendous, her
players are tremendous, we understand what's in front of us. We're going to
have to play awfully well tomorrow night.  
  
Q. When Chloe went down, obviously Andra had to come in and step up.
Seems like it's been a seamless transition, now she's performing here in the
NCAA tournament. How confident are you in her if she needs to step up? If her
number is called, how confident are you that she can be the one to get it
done?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Well, I'm very confident. I'm confident in all of our team. I
think 1 through 10 on our bench has played some big minutes for us throughout
the course of the season.  
  
Andra has played and had some big games for us. I think what she's doing right
now, people realize in a scouting report is you better not lose her. She's
very similar in that regard to Blair. You better not lose her, she'll make you
pay. She's shooting the ball at a very high level. She allows you to stretch
the floor a little bit and create spacing for your other players.  
  
I think it's really important in our offense that she's able to do that.
Defensively she's gotten better. She tries on that end. That's all I can ask.
I just want to see kids try. I want to see them make an effort to try to
defend. And she tries. Again, at the end of the day, that's all I expect from
any of our players.  
  
A lot of confidence in Andy. She's got a lot of confidence in herself. She's a
very confident player. That goes a long way with your student-athletes. If
they're confident, if they're walking with a little bit of an edge or a chip
on their shoulder, they usually tend to be able to back it up. We make sure
that they can.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Best of luck tomorrow against
Arizona State.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Thanks for your time. Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
PORTLAND](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+PORTLAND)

  

## March 28, 2019

  

### [Aaron Johnston](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23579)

  
_Portland, Oregon_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have South Dakota State Aaron Johnston.  
  
We'll have you start with your opening statement, please.  
  
AARON JOHNSTON: Well, appreciate it. It's been a whirlwind couple of days from
one side of the country to the other, with a quick laundry stop I think for
most of us to get regrouped.  
  
But we're really pleased, excited, fortunate, all those good words to be here.
Played really well out in New York against two very good teams. I thought our
senior group in particular was outstanding and did a good job of helping us
through some tough games.  
  
Been a really good year for us. We're really proud of what we've accomplished,
excited to be here and try to keep things going.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions.  
  
Q. Kind of a coincidence that Kelly scheduled a trip to your place, you
happen to face him here. Obviously you knew they were pretty good when they
came to town, but what has it been like having to face them again in the Sweet
16?  
AARON JOHNSTON: Yeah, it's certainly a neutral site, but they're going to have
a pretty heavy Oregon Duck population here. We come back to Oregon next year
to play, so yeah, three times in less than 12 months against the Ducks. That's
a tall task for us.  
  
Known Kelly for a while. Played him when he was at Gonzaga. Always done great
things. This team they have right now is on a really, really good path,
certainly one of the elite teams in the country, not just in this region, but
one of the elite teams in the country.  
  
It was fun to have them in Brookings. We played well in that game, not quite
well enough. Their offensive firepower was a little too much for us in that
game. We'll have to try to find ways to slow them down. It was a great
experience for us. Playing teams like that throughout the last several years
has I think really helped us get to this point and feel like we at least can
put some things together to have a good plan going into this.  
  
Q. Not that you needed a confidence boost, but those two games in
Syracuse, what did it do for your team and program going into this round of
16? Do you see a little extra pep in the players?  
AARON JOHNSTON: Well, I think so. We've been to the tournament a lot, so
obviously first time into this part of the tournament. We've been to the
tournament a lot. I felt like the team was really comfortable going out there.
Knew what to expect, have an idea of all the extras that go into it.  
  
I think the difference in that first, second round, both of those games
compared to some of our previous times in the tournament, we made plays at
critical times. Last year we lose an overtime game to Villanova. Could have
gone either way with a couple of baskets or stops.  
  
I think the Quinnipiac game, we had it under control, they made a run. We made
just a couple of plays there late to pull away.  
  
Syracuse, that game was back and forth, had us down double-digits in the first
half, second quarter. We had a good lead going into the fourth. Right away
they got control again. But we made a good push at the end.  
  
I think the difference between this year and past years, we're just making
plays at the right time. A lot of that goes to our seniors as a group. Syd
Palmer, obviously Macy and Madi have huge roles that they play. They were a
big part of both of those games.  
  
Comparing where we are now to past years, just that confidence to make those
big shots in big moments. I think that's what tournament games come down to.  
  
It was fun to see our team respond really well in those games.  
  
Q. You mentioned cross-country trip, laundry stop. They've only had to
drive a hundred miles up the road. Talk a little bit about the disadvantage of
your travel schedule. They're talking about a crowd of 11 to 12 thousand. How
do you feel about that? How do you think your players will respond in that
kind of atmosphere?  
AARON JOHNSTON: As far as them playing close to home, they've earned the right
to do that. That's a great thing. The way our tournament is set up aspires to
be able to do that. We have no problems with that at all. That's how it is for
every team in the tournament. They've had the kind of year that gives them
that right or that chance. I think that's a great thing.  
  
As far as the crowd for tomorrow, we're excited about that. It will be a big
crowd. We play in front of a lot of big crowds, nothing that large, but quite
a few big crowds. I know people in this area would follow that Oregon-Oregon
State rivalry closely. That's a heated thing. We have some of those rivalries
back home where it matters, where women's basketball really matters on that
stage on that day. People follow those things closely and passionately.  
  
We feel like we'll be on the other side of that in that game. That's a good
thing, though, too. We want to be in an event where it is followed. You don't
want to get to this point and play in a half-filled arena. So we're excited
about that. I think that will be a good thing for both teams.  
  
Q. A lot has changed since December 12th when you last met them. How has
your team grown since then?  
AARON JOHNSTON: You go back and watch that film, after four or five minutes of
watching it, we're not even the same team. Then after watching them, I thought
they're not the same team either. They're better than they were on that day.
Both teams have really grown, kind of figured out how they're going to play in
tough moments, how they're going to try to stop certain offenses, defenses. I
think both teams have really changed and grown.  
  
The key players are still the key players. You have to try to control them,
slow them down. They'll have to do that with us.  
  
For us in particular, Madi and Macy were both very good in that game. People
would expect that. Since then, I think Myah has grown as a player. Tylee Irwin
has grown as a player. So has Tagyn Larson. Other three starters for us,
watching them in November and December compared to where they are in March,
just a huge difference in their confidence level.  
  
Paiton Burckhard was a freshman then, trying to figure things out, playing
against a top team in the country. Now she looks a lot more comfortable and
settled.  
  
I'd say the biggest thing for us is how players have developed since then,
particularly that group outside of our senior class. I think they've really
come a long way and they're a big part of why we've gone this far.  
  
Q. Can you expand a little bit with Paiton. She's nine of ten from the
field in two games as a freshman in the NCAA tournament. More than
impressive.  
AARON JOHNSTON: Yeah, she has been in a ton of big games in high school. I
know it's a whole different stage, I'm not comparing. She's used to pressure,
she's used to expectations. She just seems to play with such poise and
calmness.  
  
You mentioned her field goal percentage. She made shots. She doesn't take
shots she's not supposed to or tough ones. She takes the ones that are great
shots and she makes them. She also had some really good passes in both of
those games, key passes. One of the threes that Madi hit in the Syracuse game
came from Paiton. It was a tough zone, tough angle, tough pass. Calmly put it
on the money and Madi obviously made the three.  
  
She's defending a position where sometimes she's a little undersized, she
plays a five for us. She's rebounding really well, handling that part of it.
Her composure has been exceptional.  
  
If you get to know Paiton, you would expect that because she's such a
levelheaded, calm, comfortable person away from basketball, I think that
really translates on the court.  
  
Yeah, she played as well as anybody in those minutes she gave us in New York.
It was a big part of why we got it done.  
  
Q. Did you try to recruit Kianna Ibis? What do you remember about her at
all when she was living in South Dakota?  
AARON JOHNSTON: Yeah, we did. She would have been moved down to Nebraska when
she really got into it and going. She was a really good player. We absolutely
did. Yeah, we would have loved to see her in yellow and blue.  
  
She's had a great career at Arizona State. She's a big part of what makes that
team go. Her versatility is exceptional. She can be inside, outside. Left hand
is tough for people to sit on.  
  
Yeah, no, we were really aware of her, family ties to South Dakota for sure.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much. Good luck tomorrow against Oregon.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
PORTLAND](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+PORTLAND)

  

## March 28, 2019

  

### [Anriel Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30842)

### [Teaira McCowan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30397)

### [Jazzmun Holmes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36617)

  
_Portland, Oregon_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Mississippi State with us. First of all, welcome to Portland,
ladies. Anriel, start by talking about being here at this point in the NCAA
tournament.  
  
ANRIEL HOWARD: All right. Well, we're very honored to be here. I think we're
deserving of it if we keep pushing. We have big goals, big plans for what we
want to do. It's one game at a time, one game at a time. I think if we just
stay focused, we can get the job done.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Teaira, what do you think about Arizona State's post defense, how
they were able to perform well against Miami, what you're expecting out of
them?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I'm expecting them to guard me very toughly. It's going to be
a physical game down there. I'm just keeping an open mind to that.  
  
Q. Jazzmun, what do you remember about the Arizona State game, playing
against them last year?  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: I remember their post players getting out and running in
transition. They had some really good guards that could shoot it and stretch
it. I mean, overall their team was really aggressive. I mean, we have to be
ready for that, yeah.  
  
Q. Anriel, I know when we talked a little bit about this a few weeks
ago, the chemistry piece, where do you feel like it is with this team now that
you're in post-season and you've been able to play almost 35 games now? Where
do you feel you guys are as a whole unit?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: I feel like we've improved tremendously just from the beginning
to now. I think we're understanding the personnels on the team a lot better.
Jazz will know who is spotting up where. Just little things like that, I think
we all know that with each other now. That helps us just offensively and
defensively. I think our chemistry has definitely improved a lot.  
  
That's all just about trust. I think now that we're understanding that, we're
trusting each other.  
  
Q. Anriel, what is it like being in this setting with Mississippi State
as opposed to what you're accustomed to with Texas A &M?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: It's great. I'm grateful for the opportunity. This is something
I've always wanted. I mean, I want to win. I know that with these group of
girls and coaches, we can get it done.  
  
I look at it in a different stance now just because, even though I've been
here, I just know it's a different team, different expectations, different
standards. I'm just grateful to be a part of it.  
  
Q. Jazz, you just broke Morgan's record for assists in a single season.
What does that mean to you as somebody that came up behind her, worked behind
her, learned from her, to get a chance to break a record like that?  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: I didn't know until I looked on social media (smiling). I
mean, I'm honored. It's a credit to my teammates, making shots. I wouldn't get
the assists if they didn't make shots. Just a credit to them. Going to keep
pushing to break another record, so...  
  
Q. Jazz, I was talking to Andy, coach even mentioned it, too, about how
she spreads the floor. Especially after Chloe went down, you needed a player
like that. How much easier does it make your job as a point guard when you
know if a possession is going badly, you always have that option to kick it
out and she can knock down a shot?  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: Just like last year, we had Blair on the wing. I would find
her in certain spots. Andy is the same way. She can knock it down. When she's
hot, she's hot.  
  
Just being able to have her on the wing being able to knock down shots is good
for our team, and we need that, so...  
  
Q. T, coach said you kind of flipped a switch following the Valentine's
Day loss. Do you feel that was a turning point for you and you became kind of
more focused at that point?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Uhm, I guess you could say that. I wasn't too dialed in. For
some reason, that game, it just wasn't going for me. From that point forward,
I just had to be more focused and tell myself I had to be ready going into
each and every game from that point on.  
  
Q. Jazzmun, this question was asked of Coach Schaefer. Talking about you
look at the results, it may not look like your team was challenged necessarily
because you have been playing so well. Talk about a time during the post-
season where you or as a team felt challenged on the floor.  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: When we went to South Carolina, I felt like we were challenged
that game. We were down I believe seven or nine at halftime. So I think coach
got ticked up. After that we were fired up. We got stops. I think we came in
to Teaira a couple times, she made plays for us. Anriel made plays for us. I
think we were challenged during that game and we came out victorious, so...  
  
Q. T, there was another time that coach talked about the UConn game a
few years back when you lost by however much it was. He said of all the
players on the court, you might have been the one that never seemed scared,
always seemed confident. Is that sort of the mentality you have every single
game? There's been games where teams might have gotten to you and everything,
but is that the type of confidence that allows you to play the way you've
played so far in the tournament?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I would say so. I mean, I respect all my opponents. At the
same time it's like, Okay, you're another team. You're trying to beat me as
well as I'm trying to beat you. Going into the game, okay, get past the name
on the front of jersey as well as on the back. Just go out there and play
basketball. Got to make plays, get stops. People are going to go on a run.
That doesn't frighten me.  
  
At the end, I trust my team, know we're going to go out there and accomplish
the mission.  
  
Q. Teaira and Jazz, you played in the ASU game last year in Cancun.
They're known for their defense. What makes them as good as they are on
defense?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: They're a swarming team. They get up, they pressure you, they
play their zone. They're going to leave one in, so who can guard out on the
wing. We have to be dialed in on offense, know where we're supposed to be,
know what gaps to attack when we're playing them.  
  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: They get out and deny. I think we have to attack pressure with
pressure, like coach always says. I think that's what makes them good on
defense, they think it out, deny, pressure the ball.  
  
Q. Anriel, you said to me a couple weeks ago, coach has said the same
thing, you feel like you've changed tremendously as a basketball player since
you came to Mississippi State. How much of an influence Teaira has had on
that, the way you have worked with each other in the post, also what we just
talked about, what have you learned about mentality and being confident from
Teaira?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: I think that me as a basketball player, I think Teaira and I
compete every day, if that's on the boards, we're on different teams, got to
go against her. I think that she makes me a better competitor, which is really
good.  
  
When I am going against her, I have to find ways to maybe score or get her,
anything. It's helping me with my game overall. I think the competitive part
is the strongest factor, I believe.  
  
What was your second question, again, I'm sorry? I didn't remember.  
  
Q. You pretty much answered. How she's affected you, sort of made you
the better player that you said you are.  
ANRIEL HOWARD: Just the competitiveness, I think that really helps me. Even
just helping me be a leader on this team because I'm new, was trying to learn
the ropes. I'm finally understanding. She's guided me, as well as Jazz.
They've both helped me in that aspect.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you for your time. We wish you the best of luck
against Arizona State tomorrow.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
PORTLAND](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+PORTLAND)

  

## March 28, 2019

  

### [Ruthy Hebard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33290)

### [Sabrina Ionescu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32677)

### [Satou Sabally](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34731)

  
_Portland, Oregon_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We have our student-athletes from Oregon, University of Oregon.  
  
We'll go ahead and open it up for questions at this time.  
  
Q. Sabrina, five PAC-12 teams are in the Sweet 16. Talk about the
strength of the conference overall and how playing in such a strong league as
the PAC-12 has helped prepare yourselves to get to this point in the season.  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, I think it's awesome that there's five PAC-12 teams
that are representing the PAC-12 playing in this tournament. We know that they
are capable of doing that. We play those teams every weekend. They give us a
game, we give them a game every weekend. I think that speaks volumes about the
competition we face and how it prepares us for March.  
  
They're coming in night in, night out trying to beat us. They give us their
best shot. I think that only makes us better.  
  
Q. For all three, you played so many games all year long, how much are
you enjoying this particular point in the season where every game means so
much?  
RUTHY HEBARD: It's so exciting to play. We know any given night could be our
last night. We say we only have one game left guaranteed. Coming out, playing
our hardest, making memories with our teammates is what we are focusing on.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think that's what ultimately makes us better, knowing that
you don't have another opportunity, you don't have another chance to come out
tomorrow and try more, try harder. I think that's what makes us better. That's
what gives us edge, just being able to come out with that mentality and
mindset that you have to come out every game, play your A game or someone's
going to beat you. You don't really have a lot of chances to make that up.  
  
I know from my standpoint and from our team, that's what we're really focused
on, just giving 100% in every aspect of the game.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: Yeah, just adding onto that, just knowing what we've been doing
all through the whole season, working since, I don't know, September when
everyone was coming back. We knew where we wanted to be. We're finally here.
We just want to keep going.  
  
Q. Sabrina, this is another trip to an extended level of post-season
play. Talk about the confidence or comfort that you have knowing this whole
bracket, you've seen them already. Does that give you a little extra
confidence being comfortable with who you play?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I mean, I honestly think that's crazy that we've
played, I mean, all these teams before already. But I don't necessarily think
it's giving us confidence. I just think it's giving us familiarity knowing
that we were able to go down there and compete against South Dakota at their
place.  
  
So now watching film, we're watching film on us, the mistakes we made, the
positives that came out of that game. I think that just gives us a little more
confidence in knowing what we need to do better, what we didn't do as well.  
  
But, yeah, I do think that's a little funny we have played all these teams
before. I don't know if that's ever happened before.  
  
Q. Ruthy, about South Dakota State, how have you grown since that game
in December since it was a back-and-forth battle especially?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, since that game I think we've grown in a lot of areas. Our
defense has gotten better, our offense has became more efficient. It's going
to be fun to be able to play South Dakota State again and see all the changes
we can make and how well we do.  
  
Q. For all three of you, can you remember and describe what the
atmosphere was like in Brookings for that game when you played them before,
how you expect it to be different tomorrow.  
SATOU SABALLY: I mean, we're going to have a home atmosphere here, so this is
basically going to be a home game with a lot of Duck fans cheering us on. Over
there, I mean, it was tough to have a really tough crowd. It was a tough game.
I mean, it's always good to play at home. We see it as an advantage.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, they had an awesome turnout, a lot of people came out
to watch that matchup between us at their place. They were loud, they were
amped up. Hopefully they'll get a turnout as well of people following them. I
think it's awesome they've been able to get to a Sweet 16. They're a well-
coached group, hard-working players.  
  
I think we're going to have hopefully a decent amount of fans here supporting
us this weekend. I think we'll definitely use that to our advantage.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, when we played there, they had a great crowd, atmosphere.
I've seen some South Dakota State fans walking around Portland already. It's
going to be fun to see them and have our home crowd here, as well.  
  
Q. Satou, looking at that last game you played against South Dakota
State, a bit of a track meet. Looking at the matchup, it seems like it favors
getting out and running. Is that something you feel this is favorable for the
offense that you like to run, like to play?  
SATOU SABALLY: I mean, last game was a close game. We had a lot of transition
points given up. But we've done a better job in our defense in the rest of the
season.  
  
I mean, yeah, we play best when we're loose, when we're efficient, when we're
just like running in transition, passing the ball, sharing the ball. We're not
going to change a lot. I guess we're at a really good spot right now this time
of the season.  
  
Q. Sabrina, obviously you have a lot of media attention this week
because of the triple-double. You mentioned you might have sort of missed that
last basket on purpose. I was wondering why it was important for you to get
that triple-double and what you sort of saw from the massive response?  
SABRINA IONESCU: It wasn't very important for me to get that triple-double, to
be honest. I mean, I didn't really miss it on purpose. I had shot it and
realized that I knew where the ball was going, so I followed it.  
  
But, yeah, I mean, it didn't really matter. We were winning that game, that's
all that really mattered. I was just going to end up breaking my own record,
so I could do that any time.  
  
Q. Sabrina, a couple years ago this was your team in the Sweet 16 for
the first time, all new. Coach mentioned I think UConn said they didn't know
it was supposed to be hard. Do you kind of get that similar feeling from South
Dakota State, even though this is their first time, that's kind of an
advantage for them, that they don't know any better at this point?  
SABRINA IONESCU: For sure. I remember that feeling like it was yesterday,
coming in and not knowing what you're supposed to do, not knowing that you
have media, not knowing any of the things we do know now. I definitely think
they could use that to their advantage, enjoying where they are, enjoying the
atmosphere, enjoy being in the moment, having fun with each other, playing,
not really worrying about all the outside pressures that are going to follow
them. I definitely think they can use that as an advantage.  
  
I think also now that this core group of us Ducks have been in this position,
I think we know what to expect. We know how hard and difficult it's going to
be to get to a Final Four, to get to a national championship. So I think that
hunger is inside of us.  
  
Q. Sabrina, could you describe Coach Kelly's unique coaching style, the
relationship with his staff, how that has impacted you both on and off the
court?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, I mean, I think one word is just trust. They give us a
lot of freedom and they trust us not only on the court but off the court. They
treat us as regular people. I think that trust we have with them as coaches
shows on the court.  
  
He asks us what plays we want to run. He asks us how we feel in this position,
what we want to do. I think that just gives us the freedom to grow as
basketball players and be able to be in those positions and not necessarily
rely on a coach to tell us what to do, what play to run. It's not robotic at
all. He gives us the green light to take whatever shots that are in range,
we're able to take and practice taking.  
  
I think having that trust between a player and a coach is very important. It's
almost family like. I think he's like a father to a lot of us. Just having
someone that we can look up to, talk to anything about, whether it's
basketball or whether it's life, is something that's really important to us.  
  
Q. I know Sabrina addressed the fact that you've already played all the
teams in this regional. Can the other two of you comment on that. Also, is
there a downside to that in that these other teams know you, as well?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, I don't think there's a downside. I think we all played
each other, so we all know some of our tendencies. I think it's going to be
more fun, more exciting to play a team we already played. It's going to help
us grow in some areas. Yeah, I think it's just a good all-around thing.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: Yeah, I mean, I would just say our coaching staff does a great
job in finding our own mistakes, finding the mistakes of our opponents.
They're going to, like, do a great job, have been doing already in preparing
us for the next upcoming game. We know what we have to do. We got to learn
from our own mistakes.  
  
I mean, the other teams are really good teams. If not, they wouldn't be here.
I feel like we're at a really good spot.  
  
Q. Are you planning to get together tonight to watch the men play?  
SABRINA IONESCU: We are, yeah. We're going to get back from practice and have
dinner, then tune in to watch the men's team. We're super excited they're in
the position they're in. Their coaching staff has done a great job, and their
players have done a great job. It's awesome to see how much they've grown from
the beginning of the season to right now. I don't think a lot of people
believed in them, seen this coming.  
  
We're excited to cheer them on like they're excited to cheer us on.  
  
Q. Sabrina, a twin brother, one of the players on South Dakota State has
a twin brother. What has that meant to have the relationship you had with your
brother?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, it's meant everything. I think it's definitely helped
me become the person that I am, the player that I am. Growing up with someone
that, I mean, is my other half literally, but just someone that I can turn to,
someone that makes me smile, that really understands me, that I can come home
to after a tough game, after a tough loss, after a tough win, to talk about
the game with. He's going to be here this weekend and support me through the
ups and downs.  
  
I think that's something special, really can't be replaced.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you so much. Best of luck in the game tomorrow
against South Dakota State.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
PORTLAND](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+PORTLAND)

  

## March 28, 2019

  

### [Madison Guebert](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37103)

### [Tagyn Larson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37104)

### [Macy Miller](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37105)

  
_Portland, Oregon_  
  
THE MODERATOR: Student-athletes from South Dakota State have joined us.
Congratulations on making the regional final round.  
  
We'll open it up for questions.  
  
Q. Macy, since you guys already played Oregon, your coach was saying the
key is going to be to have a better defensive effort. Where does that start?
Is it with Sabrina? Ruthy inside? Where do you need to improve?  
MACY MILLER: Yeah, I say a good team effort. I think back home we were kind of
more one-on-one, didn't have a lot of help defense. We didn't do well inside
the post, help side.  
  
I think this time we just got to rely on our system that we've worked with all
year, good help side defense, closing gaps, especially on Sabrina. She also
helps get the whole team going, so I'd say it's a whole team effort.  
  
Q. Madi, your coach said one of the things that you guys have done
improving-wise since then is you've become more of a team, not necessarily
just you guys that are scoring the points. Do you feel like the younger group
on this team is starting to step up, too?  
MADISON GUEBERT: Yeah, we have a lot of confidence in all our players. We've
had a lot of girls that have been stepping up. It's not really just reliant on
a couple of us scoring or two or three of us scoring.  
  
We've really had a lot of, yeah, especially the younger players stepping up
into bigger roles for us. We've just been trying to instill that confidence in
them to make those big shots because we know that they can. Yeah, they've just
been doing a really awesome job for us making those shots.  
  
Q. For all three, starting with Macy, it's been a whirlwind 72 hours.
You've gone from the Northeast to the Northwest. Talk about the last few days,
how you've been able to refocus at this point.  
MACY MILLER: Yeah, it's been a crazy few days like you stated. You come off
that huge win, you're excited. We fly home at 2 in the morning. We have people
that go to classes. Then the next day we practice in the morning, got to get
ready for Oregon, watch film. Kind of got to refocus there.  
  
We get here, and it's just as exciting. You're in the Sweet 16. But you also
have to focus because we don't want to settle here. We want to keep going. We
have a great team in front of us. So we're looking forward to it.  
  
TAGYN LARSON: I think we're all kind of running on excitement and adrenaline
at this point. But we're so excited to be here, staying focused and locked in
in every practice, every shootaround. We're staying really focused. So, yeah,
it's really good.  
  
MADISON GUEBERT: Just trying to keep that momentum going from where we left
off in Syracuse. Obviously it's been a crazy, crazy few days for us between
traveling back home, then traveling out here.  
  
I think we're just using this excitement and energy kind of as momentum going
forward. Yeah, I think obviously it's very exciting to be here, but we're not
done yet. Just trying to keep that focus as we go forward.  
  
Q. Macy, I'm sure you probably saw Mike playing some NBA gyms. What is
it going to be like to play in one yourself now?  
MACY MILLER: I think it's going to be something special. I was getting super
excited walking in here, LeBron James walking through here.  
  
I'm excited to step out on the court, be able to play in this arena is really
cool. That NBA teams play here, it's exciting.  
  
Q. You get to the Sweet 16, your reward is to play Oregon, in Portland.
They're talking about maybe 12,000 people here. What is your reaction to that?
How excited or fearful is that?  
TAGYN LARSON: Yeah, I think it's an exciting thing. There's going to be a lot
of people there. Even if they're for Portland, it will bring a lot of energy
into the arena. We'll have a lot of Jackrabbit fans here. A lot of fans on the
plane, parents flew out. I think the energy will be great in there.  
  
Q. For all three of you, talking with the Oregon coach, he said a couple
years ago when they first made the Sweet 16, it was all so new to them, but
maybe that was an advantage because they played more loose, free. Do you think
that will be the case, especially for how much this has been built up as a
moment for this program to get to now that you're here?  
MACY MILLER: Yeah, like you said, it's the first time in the Sweet 16. But we
don't want to settle here. We're ready for this game. We just got to play like
we have been all year. Obviously it's a big game, but it could be our last
game as well. You just got to keep playing with that motivation we've had the
whole year.  
  
Q. Macy, is there any different approach than where you were a week ago
playing two teams that you never faced before compared to where you are now?  
MACY MILLER: I wouldn't say it's much different. But like you stated, those
games are a little bit different because you get a day or two to focus on
them, watch film on them, try to get what they're good at.  
  
But we faced this Oregon team before. We know what they're like. We've
obviously both gotten better since we last played them. It's going to be a
really good game. We just have to focus on the things that are our main focus.  
  
Q. Both Coach Graves and Johnston talked about how both teams have
improved and changed from the meeting in December till now. Madison, talk
about, in your eyes, what has changed since South Dakota State's approach and
team play between December and now?  
MADISON GUEBERT: Yeah, I mean, I think we've improved a lot since December,
especially defensively. We're playing more together as a team. We're in help
side a lot better. We're closing gaps a lot better. Guarding the ball one-on-
one a lot better.  
  
Then we're playing a lot more aggressively. I think offensively in the first
time we played Oregon, we were pretty timid and passive, kind of getting into
the basket. I think overall we have a more aggressive mentality.  
  
TAGYN LARSON: Yeah, I think just going off what Madi said. I think coming into
this game, obviously both teams have improved a lot. I think this time around
we're a lot more confident than what we were in December. I think kind of what
Madi said, our defense has improved a lot. I think that will help a lot. We
just have confidence in ourselves, more confidence in each other.  
  
MACY MILLER: Adding onto that, like they said, everyone is doing a great job
stepping up into their role, having confidence. I think since December we've
done a great job finding the open players, really knocking down the shots. A
couple people are there to find the open person.  
  
Q. Madison, Drew is going to be here. Sabrina has a twin brother as
well. What has that relationship meant to you? How do you think he's going to
react? Obviously he didn't get a chance to play in the Division II
tournament.  
MADISON GUEBERT: I think he's excited for me. It's kind of been crazy for him,
winding down his collegiate career. Yeah, I've been in touch with him a little
bit. He's really excited to get out here, especially because he wasn't able to
go to Syracuse.  
  
Yeah, our relationship has meant the world to me, especially since college.
We've gotten so close, not that we weren't before, but I think being twins, we
were never really apart from each other till we got to college. We truly are
each other's biggest fans and number one supporters. To have him here for the
Sweet 16, something that's beyond special to me. I'm so excited that he's
coming.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much for your time. Good luck tomorrow
against Oregon.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
PORTLAND](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+PORTLAND)

  

## March 28, 2019

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

  
_Portland, Oregon_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Oregon head coach Kelly Graves.  
  
Go ahead and give your opening statement.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: I didn't prepare anything. Let's just go with questions. How is
that?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Shortest opening statement we've had all day.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Okay.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll open it up for questions.  
  
Q. How exciting is it to be here in this atmosphere in Oregon?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, we're just glad to be playing. We would have been happy to
play anywhere at this point. But obviously thrilled that we're in Portland,
close to Eugene. Certainly there are a lot of Duck fans here in Portland.  
  
Like I said the other day, any time you can drive to a regional, that's a good
thing. We hope that the fans are going to come out. I hear the ticket sales
are going great. I hope this is a good showcase for all of women's basketball.  
  
Q. You had commented the other day that this was going to be a reunion
for you, that you played South Dakota State before. How is this time, aside
from the circumstances, different from playing last time you played them? How
are you all preparing to face them tomorrow?  
KELLY GRAVES: Brookings isn't quite as big as Portland. Both teams I think are
different in a lot of ways. That seems like such a long time ago, mid
December.  
  
This whole regional is kind of unique for us because we played all three of
the teams that are here, which I don't think happens very often.  
  
The thing about South Dakota State, you can always count on them to be roughly
the same in everything that they do. They're so consistent in their effort, in
their execution, in their team play. Coach Johnston does such a great job.
We've kind of followed the same path. We both got into head coaching about the
same time. I followed his career.  
  
Even though we're both different teams, they're so consistent that I think
what we're going to see is what we've seen forever. I think that's one of the
keys to them, from the day a Jackrabbit steps on campus, they're running the
same things until they leave. That's why they're so good at what they do. They
don't change their system and style of play each and every year. I think
that's what makes them special, very similar to what we do.  
  
Q. Talk a little bit about the bench production, how important Lydia,
Oti, and Morgan, potentially Taylor coming back, have been this post-season?  
KELLY GRAVES: We hope we get Taylor back. That's day-to-day. We haven't
completely ruled it out this weekend, but we'll see. That's going to be a
game-time decision tomorrow.  
  
Lydia, Oti, and Morgan have really given us a lift when we needed it. We've
had a short bench all year, so we've had to rely on them. I think especially
down the stretch, I think in the conference tournament, the last few games
when we were trying to wrap up a regular season championship in the Pac-12,
just those important 12 to 15 minutes a game I think were really key.  
  
In our semifinal win against UCLA, Morgan came up with three big-time threes
that maybe we weren't always counting on. Obviously she's capable of doing
that.  
  
Ruthy has not been 100%, so Lydia has become more important. She's been a
steady force defensively and really good on the boards. Anything she can give
us in the point production is a bonus.  
  
Oti, what do you say about her? One of my favorite student-athletes of all
time. It seems like when it comes to March, she's had big games. If you look
at the last three NCAA tournaments, she always seems to have a couple big-time
games. We hope that continues this weekend.  
  
Q. You mentioned both teams have changed, so the game will be a little
different. The venue will be different, too. What was it like to play in
Brookings? How do you think it will be here in Portland?  
KELLY GRAVES: True story. I took one of my really good Zag teams back to South
Dakota State way back when. We were the best two mid-majors in the country. We
played opening weekend. It was the lead story on ESPN in women's basketball.
They sent Graham Hays there for the weekend. They got us. It was a close game,
went to overtime, but they got us.  
  
I remember at the game I told my assistant coach Jodie Berry, Remind me never
to come here again because they're just so tough. They play well. It's a tough
venue because they get great crowd support, they're really into it, they're
loud, they're right on top of you.  
  
We did it again this year (laughter). After the game, again, a hard-fought,
really well-played game by both teams. 87-79, neither team could stop each
other. I told Jodie the same thing. This time I'll fire her if I ever go back
to South Dakota State.  
  
But I admire Aaron so much, the way he coaches, works with his team. They
really do play basketball the way it's supposed to be played. They share the
ball, they play hard, they space the floor well, they execute at both ends of
the floor. They're all multi-dimensional. They can post up, they can drive,
they can all shoot it.  
  
Back when I was a pretty good player, you played on a rec team, you've seen
them play, maybe up at the Mac Club, they just know how to play, they're tough
as nails. Yeah, this is going to be a heck of a battle tomorrow.  
  
Q. Do you think here with the big crowd that's expected will provide a
different atmosphere? If so, do you see that as a benefit one way or
another?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I don't know. I'm sure that a lot of the folks in South
Dakota traveled out here. I hope they did because this team is worth
following, no doubt about it.  
  
I'm assuming that a lot of the fans are going to be in green and yellow, at
least that's what I hope. I think we'll have a little bit more support. There
was one Duck family that was there, and that was a pretty special deal last
time. I think actually we're linked, Terry could speak more to this, but I
think their arena is named after a Duck alum, correct? So that's kind of cool.
We're linked in a way.  
  
Q. Sustained success the Pac-12 has had now in the post-season, speak to
that a little bit and how maybe it's even reached a higher level this
season.  
KELLY GRAVES: It's a real testament to an awesome league. So five teams in the
Sweet 16. I think we were four or five last year, I know five a couple of
years ago. Yeah, this is something that is continuing to happen.  
  
I just think it goes to show you the way we compete against each other in
league really prepares us for post-season. We have so many different styles
that we have to play against in conference play, and that helps us later on.
It makes us all tougher.  
  
What I really like is I know genuinely we all care about each other's
programs, and we're pulling for each other. I got, the first text I got after
we won our last game was from Coach VanDerveer. She's always championing the
league. That always means a lot.  
  
Q. Your team made the Elite 8 last year, got to this point for the first
time. Nobody from South Dakota State is surprised they're here, but this is a
different experience. What was it like for your group the first time they
played in this regional? How much of an advantage does that give your team now
that you've been here and done it?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, two years ago, so this is our third straight time at least
in the Sweet 16. I know a couple years ago when Sabrina, Ruthy, that group
were freshmen, we made kind of a run as a 10 seed. We didn't know what the
heck we were doing, to be honest with you. We hadn't planned to really win
those games or anything like that.  
  
I think kind of being dumb helped us. The moment wasn't too big because we
didn't really know what to expect. I remember we ultimately got beat by UConn,
and I remember in the press conference before, one of the quotes Gino had was,
These folks don't know this is supposed to be hard, you're not supposed to
come in and start beating people. We didn't know that.  
  
South Dakota State, they've won for so long, maybe they're used to it, but
maybe they haven't gotten --  
  
Q. This is their first time.  
KELLY GRAVES: This is their first time, okay.  
  
They're a veteran group. Maybe the first time in this spot, but not the first
time in this tournament, against big opponents. I think that's what makes
their program special, too. They're not afraid to play anybody. If you look at
their non-conference, it's a who's-who really.  
  
Q. I know you guys suffered some tough losses down the stretch,
obviously in the PAC-12 tournament. What would you say was your biggest
takeaway as a coach? What did you tell them this is what we need to learn from
these losses?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, every loss is tough. First of all. When you win a lot of
them, every loss is tough.  
  
I think the main thing, Ruthy is really important to us. When we didn't have
her for that week and a half stretch, that hurt us. I think that hurt us in
our ultimate loss against Stanford, three games in three nights, we just
didn't have it. Credit to them. They earned it. They deserved to win the game.  
  
I think what we learned, what I told them is, number one, we play in a really
good league. That's going to happen. There's ups and downs throughout the
year. You just got to learn from it, get past it, move on. I think we have. I
thought last weekend we played really well.  
  
I reminded the team after our Stanford loss, I think the two finalists in last
year's NCAA, Mississippi State and Notre Dame, both lost in the Championships
of their respective conference tournaments. I just said, Listen, this isn't
going to define us, March Madness will.  
  
That's what we've really focused on. This team has been really good about
handling pressure, moving on to the next game, win or lose. We've had some big
wins, too, we had to forget. Guess what, we have another really good team in
two days. It's a really veteran group and I think they've handled it well.  
  
Q. You said last weekend that Satou was the player that would separate
you guys from the rest. Why did you say that? Why is she that player?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, I think Ruthy and Sabrina have been so good for so long,
you kind of know what to expect from them each and every game. I think Satou
is still trying to figure it out as a sophomore. She's so unbelievably
talented. You see that on display more times than not.  
  
But she's that one player that's a tough matchup, a 6'4" guard who can shoot
it, put it on the floor, post up. She's really developed into a really good
offensive rebounder and can score that way. She can do it in a variety of
different ways. Becomes a matchup disadvantage for each opponent.  
  
That's why I think I've said that about her. I have a lot of faith in her,
though. She is an amazing, amazing player. Has really I think played well in
the tournament so far.  
  
Q. Charli Turner Thorne said she would be in favor of the super regional
concept in Las Vegas. What are your thoughts on that?  
KELLY GRAVES: Oh, I see the merits of it. I think we've changed our format too
many times I think recently, to be honest with you. I think we need to stick
with one and go with it, try and grow it. I actually like the regionals. Here
is a great example.  
  
I think if you find the right places to put them, not everybody supports
women's basketball, but you have two of the best fan bases here in the country
right here in Oregon, Oregon and Oregon State. I think we were 8th in
attendance and Oregon State is around 12th.  
  
This is the good spot to put it. We're going to put hopefully 11, 12, 13
thousand people or more in here. I actually like that.  
  
I would be open to doing maybe four six-team first and second-round sites,
putting them in winning spots regionally. I think people can plan ahead
saying, Hey, we know the first and second rounds are in these spots, let's
make a vacation out of it, go watch great basketball for four days.  
  
I don't know. It was sure fun playing at home last week in front of a lot of
very raucous Duck fans. I think there's an advantage to that, as well. But you
look at Arizona State as a 5 seed. They would have an argument to host, as
well, but they were right on that line. There's a big difference. They proved,
you know, a good performance is going to win wherever you go, but it's always
nicer I think to play at home.  
  
Sorry, that was a long answer to a very thoughtful question.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Coach, thank you very much for your time. Good luck tomorrow
against South Dakota State.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Thank you.

# [NCAA WOMEN'S REGIONAL SEMIFINALS AND FINALS:
PORTLAND](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=NCAA+WOMEN%27S+REGIONAL+SEMIFINALS+AND+FINALS%3A+PORTLAND)

  

## March 28, 2019

  

### [Sophia Elenga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36623)

### [Kianna Ibis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34725)

### [Courtney Ekmark](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34204)

  
_Portland, Oregon_  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arizona State University players.  
  
We'll open it up for questions at this time.  
  
Q. For all three of you, but Courtney, you touched on it Monday, what
does it mean for you guys to make it to the Sweet 16 for Charli, the impact
she's had on your careers?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Yeah, I mean, it's obviously really great to be here. Really
happy for our team and for our entire coaching staff, especially Charli. She
works so hard. She watches more film than any coach in the country. She always
has us prepared.  
  
I'm just really happy that her hard work has paid off and we're able to get
here for her.  
  
KIANNA IBIS: Like Courtney said, just being able to make it like this far for
her means a lot, especially for our team because we know how hard she works.
We know how hard all the coaches work. Just to be able to make it this far, it
means a lot.  
  
SOPHIA ELENGA: This is really awesome for her, especially because at the
beginning of the season when we were doing summer training, she always been
saying that she believe in us, and she believe we can go as far as we are
today.  
  
Q. You played Mississippi State in Cancun. Now you've studied their
current team, some difference in personnel. What do you remember about the
game in Cancun? What do you see differently about the team they are today?  
KIANNA IBIS: I just remember them being really a great team offensively and
defensively. Definitely they play pressure defense, so it was kind of hard for
us.  
  
I just remember it was a really close game. We knew that it was just a battle
of possessions. That's what it possibly could be tomorrow, as well.  
  
Q. Can you describe how you've grown this year, how Coach Charli is able
to bring you along the way she does? Talk about how she's able to do that.  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Yeah, I think during the season how we've grown is, you know,
early off we played Baylor, played Louisville really close, one-possession
games, came up short. I think that was because we didn't go every possession
the way that we should have. We kind of took a quarter off in each of those
games.  
  
Now one of the biggest things is we play for the entire 40 minutes. If we do
that, we're going to be really hard to beat. Charli has definitely helped us
be able to do that. I think she's been able to do that by being honest in
practice every single day, not to take a possession off in practice. Whatever
happens in practice is what translates to the game.  
  
Charli is definitely motivating us. It's definitely good for our team because
when we're playing for each other, playing for our coaches, we're not playing
for ourselves, and that's when something really special can happen.  
  
Q. Sophia, we've seen throughout this season and especially against
Miami as well, that the depth of this team is so strong. Obviously turned out
with great success. How will the depth have to do in order to be successful
tomorrow?  
SOPHIA ELENGA: Just be ready. I think in the bench, everybody in this team is
ready because Charli is always say that everybody has the opportunity to play,
everybody has to be ready. They cannot have a team where we are playing with
five player or six player, it's everybody.  
  
Going to practice, everybody is getting reps, everybody has the opportunity to
just really work on what she expect from us. I think everybody right now,
especially the leader of the team, are making sure we are all lock in and know
exactly what we need to do.  
  
Q. Sophia, could you describe the confidence level the bench has
concerning you have made it this far.  
SOPHIA ELENGA: We are just really excited. We really do believe that we can go
to the Final Four. We really want to.  
  
I think it's a lot of excitement in the bench. In the bench, you can see the
reaction. We are all so into it. We are really just really into it, really
cheering for each other, making sure that we still have this connectiveness
and everybody is ready to just step up.  
  
Q. Kianna and Sophia, it seems like all season long you're playing
taller people, bigger people, yet this keeps happening, it's going to happen
again tomorrow. What are the key challenges to controlling a player like
McCowan?  
KIANNA IBIS: I definitely see the key challenges would be, you know, because
she's so much taller than us, it would be -- just got to keep a body on her
honestly. Because she can easily play over the top of us, so just being able
to be more aggressive. We just have to be more aggressive than her, and the
whole team honestly.  
  
Yeah, definitely would say staying more aggressive is what we definitely need
to do.  
  
SOPHIA ELENGA: I agree. I agree with Kianna. I think we just really have the
first minute of the game, just set the tone, play really, really physical with
her because I think that's something that can really bother her.  
  
Q. Kianna, not to throw you in the way-back machine, but growing up till
eighth grade in small town South Dakota, how did that help mold you as the
player you are today?  
KIANNA IBIS: I mean, when I lived in Emery, South Dakota, and I played seventh
grade I think because it was a really small town, seventh grade, I could play
on varsity and junior varsity. I would always play against competition that
was always more experienced. I guess I would say that definitely everybody,
because everybody in that town just knew each other, supported each other.  
  
So I would just say all the support from all my friends and family that lived
there, all my coaches that have coached me, helped me into the player I am
today. I would say that really helped into making me the player I am now.  
  
Q. Courtney and Sophia, what makes Kianna a special player?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: I think a lot of things. Definitely her scoring ability has
really helped us this season, putting the ball in the hoop. She does so many
things for us. Especially even if she's not scoring, they're guarding her
tighter, that's opening things up for other people in the team. So definitely
that.  
  
SOPHIA ELENGA: Yes, I agree. Like, she's present in both parts of the court.
This season she has been recognized as an offensive player for the Pac-12 and
also defensive player. She's just everywhere, like rebounding, scoring, in
defense. Everybody can see she's just a complete player and really a key.  
  
As Courtney said, she's a big threat, so everybody is kind of on her. She's
also giving open looks for other player, so...  
  
Q. Courtney, because you won two national championships, what do you
think are the key things when you get to the Sweet 16 to try to win a regional
to get to the Final Four? When you get to that level, what is the separation
that gets you to the Final Four?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Yeah, well, I mean first things first. It's easy to look
ahead and be like, Oh, so close to the Final Four. But I say first of all just
taking it one game at a time, so focusing on the present. Then within the
game, taking it one possession at a time. Then really emptying out.  
  
I'd say the most important thing for us right now to get there is to play
connected and really play together, leave it all on the floor. If we do that,
it's going to be really great.  
  
Q. Kianna, do you have any family back in South Dakota? Do you visit at
all?  
KIANNA IBIS: Oh, yeah. I go back every summer, sometimes I go back to
Christmas. I have an uncle, cousins that live there, my grandpa still lives
there, yeah. I have a lot of people that still live there.  
  
It was actually funny because my freshman year, in the NCAA tournament, our
regional was in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. It was a bummer we didn't get
there, but I knew I had a lot of people coming there. It would have been
awesome if we could have played there.  
  
Q. South Dakota State and South Dakota have been building their national
profile. Do you see recognizable names?  
KIANNA IBIS: Yeah, I definitely played with some players, played against some
players. Yeah, I think it's awesome to be able to -- also like South Dakota
State is here. I know a couple players on that team, as well. I think it's
amazing for them. They have a great program over there. It's great to see them
actually in the Sweet 16.  
  
Q. Who do you remember?  
KIANNA IBIS: Tagyn Larson, I actually played with her. I played on South
Dakota attack team my junior year, yeah, the end of my junior year, sophomore
and junior year, in high school. We played on the same AAU team.  
  
Also Rylie Cascio Jensen. I played her when she was at Bellevue East in Omaha,
Nebraska, or something like that. I played against her.  
  
Q. Kianna, have you ever played against a bigger player than Teaira?  
KIANNA IBIS: At Baylor, we played a 6'7". I think she's the same height, yeah.
She's a pretty big girl. I think we have played against. I mean, it's just
similar. It's not really me, but I know I'll be switched onto her a couple
times. It's mostly NeNe (phonetic). I think she'll really do a great job.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you so much for your time. We wish you the best
of luck tomorrow against Mississippi State.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 7, 2019

  

### [Jody Wynn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34197)

### [Missy Petersen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38086)

### [Amber Melgoza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34706)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
JODY WYNN: It's great to be here. It's great to bring Amber and Missy to the
Pac-12 Networks. We're excited for this upcoming season.  
  
Q. Is it possible to carry momentum over from one season to the next?
The last time that we saw you guys was obviously at the conference tournament,
and you lit the place on fire. That was seven months ago. Can you sort of
rekindle that as you go into this season?  
JODY WYNN: I think that started back in spring workouts. You know, I believe
that the momentum on which we ended the season on a high carried us into our
spring training and our summer training. And so I definitely believe that you
can carry momentum from one season to the next. I think a lot of confidence
was gained. It ignited an incredible work ethic for our players to be able to
taste success again in this upcoming season.  
  
Q. Amber, when did that mentality change for this team?  
AMBER MELGOZA: I think -- our mentality. It definitely is something to know
that after all these games and the wins, and I mean, our loss at the end of
the season -- but it was something that, like you said, gained us confidence,
and that's something that is carrying on from spring workouts to summer and
now to the preseason that is coming up.  
  
Q. Amber, I 've watched you go off and have amazing scoring output,
specifically on the offensive end. Let's talk about your teammates, how they
can help support what you can do. What's the growth you've seen? Who are you
expecting more to step up and be that supporting cast member?  
AMBER MELGOZA: Yes, definitely. This girl right here next to me, Missy
Petersen. She's doing a great job. She's becoming an all-around offensive
player as well as defense. Haley Van Dyke, Mai-Loni, and then our transfer
Rita. I think that's going to be something that -- they're all very good
scoring, they know how to score and they know how to get the ball in the
basket, and I think that's going to help us out definitely.  
  
Q. Missy, for you, that shot was so iconic at the Pac-12 tournament.
Being on campus, being around others, how have you heard that reaction kind of
carry over this summer, and are people still saying 2.3 seconds, that shot?  
MISSY PETERSON: Yeah, I wish I could relive that moment a million times. But I
kind of get to a little bit when I see a lot of friends and a lot of people. A
lot of times it's one of the first things they ask me about: What was going
through your head, how does it feel? My answer is always: I was numb. I was in
shock. It was so much fun.  
  
But yeah, I get it a lot. I talk to a lot of people about it.  
  
But aside from the shot, the whole game was so much fun. You know, the shot
was great, but everything leading up to it and the feeling of proving so many
people wrong and doing something that not a lot of people thought we could do,
that was my favorite part about it.  
  
Q. You proved people wrong in that game. How do you prove them wrong
again this year? And not just one game, but no one picks you to win, but where
you guys show up every day and nobody wants to play you because they know you
guys are capable of that type of game. How do you carry it from one game and
make it a repetitive movement, if you will, during the season?  
AMBER MELGOZA: I definitely think it starts in practice. Practice is where you
practice how you play, and I think that's something we have. You play with
heart in practice. You have a strong mentality. You have confidence in
yourself that can carry on into a game, and I think that's very important to
do.  
  
Also I just feel that we are more -- we have that chemistry bond, and that's
something that's going to carry on, as well.  
  
JODY WYNN: I agree with Amber that it begins every single day. It's not just
something that we turn a light on when the games are on, and all of a sudden
we can out-perform this monstrous opponent that's next to us. I believe it's
every single day. We always talk about effort combined with performance equals
wins. And so it's not always just performance, but you have to have effort,
and that's every possession of every practice. You know, it's easy for young
people to take possessions off -- and we work really, really hard about not
taking those possessions off until there's a water break in practice or a
time-out -- to be able to play through mistakes. Because mistakes are going to
happen, we're going to turn the ball over. But it's the next possession.  
  
Just training ourselves that we're always moving forward, the next possession,
the next opportunity, and not really dwelling on a missed shot or a poor
possession. You know, it starts every single day, and it's nothing like we can
just turn the light switch on. I think we have the know-how. I think we
believe in each other, and now it's demanding of ourselves and being
accountable to each other as teammates and as coaches to give our best every
single possession.  
  
Q. We all know what Amber can do and we 've seen her have some amazing
games last season and the season before, actually. Do you feel like on a
national scale she's underrated? And what do you feel can be done to maybe put
her more on the national scale? She is one of the best.  
JODY WYNN: Yeah, I mean, Amber is extremely talented, as all of you in this
room know. She's pound for pound probably just as strong as any off guard in
the country. Fun fact: She just like deadlifted 341 pounds the other day, so
she's a beast. She's been that way since she was seven years old winning
National Championships, BMX racing. But she is a talented basketball player.
Amber's challenge is to be -- and what she wants to be is to be an overall
complete basketball player on both sides of the floor. And she's been working
really, really hard. She studies game film. She's improving her basketball IQ
and understanding how to score when the ball is not in her hands. I mean, she
believes and we all believe that she can score at any time on any possession,
so it's just taking the high-percentage shots and the right shots for her to
be successful.  
  
And you know what? We don't really get into rankings and where she stands
nationally. Her job is every single day. It's every single practice. We're not
looking at the dessert. Whether she plays after her college days are over or
not, we're looking at every single day with Amber and how she's improving on a
daily basis. Because then at the end of the day, she's going to be able to go
off and do what she chooses to do.  
  
Q. I wanted to go back to talk about the Pac-12 Tournament. Utah had
beaten you pretty handily just 13 days before you turned around and kind of
just took over the tournament. What transformation happened in those 13 days,
and could you tell that there was a shift of any kind?  
JODY WYNN: Let me just tell you, something came over us at the hotel, and all
of a sudden we were just like, a crystal ball -- no.  
  
Honestly, I think one of the best attributes is having a short memory, right,
good or bad. On any given day, anybody can beat anybody, and that's why we
play sport, right?  
  
We remembered that as well as we remembered the Oregon State 32-point loss a
couple weeks prior. But we also believed. A testament to these two ladies here
is last year as they were -- Amber has kind of been a leader, and as Missy was
emerging as a leader in the program -- is they took hold of their opportunity
as a new opportunity, a new season. It was our third season, and we were 0-0
just like everybody else, and we really believed in studying game film and how
we could perform much better collectively as a group and what we needed to do
to secure a victory.  
  
But it starts with the desire and the ladies not wanting the season to end.
It's easy to want your season to end if maybe you're not as successful as you
want to be, but these two -- and they led the rest of the team -- they wanted
to keep playing. They had a desire to keep fighting, and they liked the
underdog role.  
  
Q. Amber, Missy, we always see Jody on the sidelines walking up and
down. If there 's a piece of gum in her mouth, you feel sorry for the piece of
gum. It's that kind of intensity and relentlessness. How much of that do you
guys bring to the floor with you every time the ball gets tipped up?  
MISSY PETERSON: I think one of the reasons our team is scrappy -- we dive on
those balls -- we are the way we are because of her and the staff behind her.
I love playing for that type of energy. You know, I've played for a lot of
different coaches growing up. I've played for the ones who stay seated the
whole game, the ones who are super -- let's stand up, and then I've played for
Jody. She puts her all into everything she coaches.  
  
I think she's probably the funnest coach I've ever played for. She pushes you.
She wants to get everything out of every player, but she has fun. She's going
to fight for you, and she's going to do everything she can to help us win that
game, and I wouldn't trade her for the world.  
  
Q. Coach, have you ever won a pedometer, and how many miles do you walk
during a game?  
JODY WYNN: No, but I think my body should look a little bit better. I feel
short-changed.  
  
No, I can't help it. I tell myself, too, like I'm going to stay seated or I'm
going to be calm. But I tell myself because then I watch and I look like an
idiot, and so -- especially when my shoe comes off.  
  
MISSY PETERSON: I feel worse for the heels than the gum.  
  
JODY WYNN: Honestly, I want to be out there. It's like the kid in me. I'm like
that every day in practice until my body tells me not to move a certain way.
But yeah, if I could slide with them on the floor or --  
  
AMBER MELGOZA: Sometimes she does.  
  
JODY WYNN: Yeah, I have to kick my foot out so the ball can kind of go in. I
don't know, it's just -- I don't know if it'll ever go away. I tell myself
that I need to -- I'm getting older. I need to calm myself down a little bit.
But it's just who I am. I want to fight for them, you know, and I think that
they know that. They fight for us every single day. My goodness, every
practice they're in there running and weight training, and I know I've walked
their shoes and I understand the grind behind the scenes.  
  
And so I just feel like I owe -- that's my way of giving back to them all that
they're giving me and our fans and our university.  
  
Q. Jody, what do you want your team to be known for?  
JODY WYNN: Grit, toughness, camaraderie, connectivity, that we can do anything
together. You know, never quit, pursue the glass ceiling. I think these are
life lessons that they're going to take well into the working world. And if
somebody tells you you're not good enough, you're not pretty enough, you're
not tall enough, you're not smart enough, just keep pounding on that door and
fighting through and believing in yourself so you can then believe in each
other.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 7, 2019

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Kiana Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34751)

### [Dijonai Carrington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35195)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, hello, everyone. We're very excited about our season,
and very happy to have Kiana and DiJonai here. They're going to be leaders of
our young team. We have a very talented group returning, and we have some
exceptional freshmen this year, and I'm really excited about how our team has
been working hard in the preseason. And just I love our team motto of more
than me, and that's what it's going to take. We're going to really have to
improve a lot and stay healthy, and we're going to have a great year.  
  
Q. For the players and for Tara, can you talk about how the freshmen are
sort of integrating into what you guys do, and has it been pretty seamless so
far bringing in the young people?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, one of the things, we've really started early. It
seems like the calendar is -- this is early, and everything has been early.
For some of our players, they've been out. Like DiJonai is just coming back,
Nadia has been out. We have several players out. So the freshmen have gotten a
lot of reps. And I think our upperclassmen have really helped them a lot to
learn things. They take them aside, they show them things. They're helping
them. But some of it is the freshmen are the ones that are out there a lot,
and I think they're doing very well.  
  
KIANA WILLIAMS: I'd agree with what Tara said. Like she said, they're getting
a lot of reps and they catch on to things really fast. I feel like we show
them something once and they get it automatically, which is good.  
  
Q. Obviously this talented freshman class to complement some of the
really good veterans coming back, much is expected, not just of the conference
but on a bigger landscape nationwide. You 're no stranger to that. It's a lot
of pressure on the youngsters. They're hearing it. How is that settling on
their shoulders?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I don't think we are hearing it. I mean, just -- we kind of
-- we're a little bit isolated. We're in that gym and we're working hard. I
mean, that's their expectation. So the pressure is from within. There's never
any pressure from outside at all. Pressure is from within to be the best that
we can be, and we know we have a lot of talent, but we also know we have a lot
of work to do, and we want to really improve a lot.  
  
And one of the things that I guess -- I was talking to someone about this
already today, but we were going down the stretch ranked No. 1, yada-yada-
yada. And you're supposed to do this and get this seed, and then you have a
couple injuries, boom, you're out. I mean, just even look at the Warriors'
situation. We're going to take every day and enjoy every single day, and I'm
going to make every day -- I'm really excited to be here with DiJonai. I know
she won't be sitting in that chair next year. I want to have a great year
coaching her and enjoy every day. Not even buy into that, all the pressure
stuff. We're going to have fun.  
  
Q. Coach, a lot of the coaches have come up here and talked about how
they see this as the Pac-12 having been the deepest since they 've been here.
You've been around the conference for such a long time, four potential top 10
teams in the Pac-12 this year. How does the depth of this league compare in
your eyes?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, you know, I think the Pac-12 and Pac-10 has always been
a great conference. The game changer in my mind has been Pac-12 Networks in
that now -- then people could watch the West Coast basketball. A lot of times
we were playing and no one was watching. And the example I would give you is
that a great player like Tina Thompson was not All-American at USC. So why
didn't that happen? Because people didn't know about her.  
  
Now people know about our teams, and we're getting better players, and I would
agree with you that top to bottom, it is stronger. You know, there might have
been days where we could say, you know, you could pencil in a W against a
certain team. You can't do that anymore.  
  
These young ladies, they're playing against, I think, the best in the country,
and that's very exciting. I didn't let DiJonai answer your question. Did you
want her to comment on that?  
  
Q. If she 's got something to say.  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: Well, like Tara said, I personally don't feel any
pressure. I don't think our team does, either. Kiana, do you feel any
pressure?  
  
KIANA WILLIAMS: Not at all.  
  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: We take it day by day. Obviously we have goals throughout
the season, but we know that none of those are going to happen without us just
focusing on the day at hand, so that's kind of what we've been doing. Each day
in practice just trying to do the best that we can, and if we do that, then
we'll reach all of those expectations that the outside has for us.  
  
TARA VANDERVEER: That was a better answer than mine.  
  
Q. November 15th, you play San Francisco at the new Chase Center, and I
talked to Molly last week and she 's really excited about that game because
you'll be among the first college teams to play in that facility. What do you
think of that, and for the players, are you excited about it, Coach and
players?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I'm very excited. I can't wait to see that building. It's
just a great arena, and it'll be really fun playing against USF. We're very
excited about it. How do you guys feel?  
  
KIANA WILLIAMS: Yeah, I'm excited, as well.  
  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: Very excited. Years ago there would never have been even
an inkling that a women's college basketball team would play in an NBA arena,
and now it's possible, so we're able to see how far we've come. Even though
there's still far to go, I think it's so exciting and an honor to play there.  
  
Q. Coach, I just wanted to get your thoughts on having coached Charmin
Smith, and I see her as a player, now she 's a head coach at Cal. Your
thoughts on her and what she'll bring to the program and any advice you've
given her as she's stepping into this new role?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, we know Charmin does a great imitation of me. Did she
do that? Well, Charmin is an outstanding young lady. Majored in engineering at
Stanford, and just loves basketball. Very intelligent, hard-working, and I
know she'll do a great job.  
  
You know, when I think about being the head coach for the first time at Cal,
to me that's very intimidating. I mean, I was a head coach at Idaho, but she's
right in that spotlight, and I hope that she knows that -- I'll always be a
mentor for her, and as long as they come in second, I'm cheering for them.  
  
But she'll do a great job, and I'm really excited for her.  
  
Q. My question goes along the same lines. You have Charmin as a head
coach at Cal, you 've got the Ogwumike sisters playing and one is in the
media. You've got Roz. You've got a lot of stars --  
TARA VANDERVEER: Where is Roz?  
  
Q. I saw her upstairs, I think. Actually my kids were in your camps. You
have really mentored and meant a lot to a lot of young women. How does that --
is that fulfilling at this point in your career?  
TARA VANDERVEER: You know, I'm really proud of all the people that you
mentioned, and obviously the two up here, too. It's kind of every once in a
while, I'll be like, when I was at basketball camp and Vanessa Nygaard's
daughter was at camp and Kate's daughter was at camp, I'm thinking, wow, I've
been around a while. It's humbling, and again, I'm so proud of Roz or Chiney
or Nneka, Jayne Appel, all the great players that I've had a chance to coach.
I just feel really fortunate and very blessed to be in the situation I'm in.  
  
Q. Fran Belibi is going to bring something to the collegiate women 's
game and to your program obviously with the dunking that she's obviously known
for nationally. How are you going to integrate that, prepare for it, game plan
for it? What do you do with that very special talent that she has that
everybody knows about?  
TARA VANDERVEER: I think it's just going to happen organically. Maybe we'll
have to run like a lob play. Talk to Steve Kerr about some good lob plays that
he runs. But you know, I just want her to not put pressure on herself. Maybe
just do it in warmup and get it over with. But obviously we know she can dunk.
But I don't want her getting hurt doing it, either.  
  
Q. I 've been covering Haley Jones, as long as we're talking about the
freshmen a little bit, she's kind of been one of those players that's been a
positionless player, and that's kind of been her identity. Do you see women's
basketball kind of moving more toward positionless players, and how do you
plan to use her?  
TARA VANDERVEER: Well, Haley is an exceptional young lady, and when you say
positionless basketball, she's 6'1", 6'2", plays the guard, plays every --
she's plays 1, 2, 3, 4 on our team, 5. What's really astounding to me honestly
is how quickly she catches on to everything. At first I thought, well, I don't
want to overload her with stuff, but where should I play her. Should I play
her where we need her most or should I play her where she's best?  
  
Well, she's really good at everything. So we just put her out there and let
her learn kind of on the fly. But she's very intelligent. She's someone that
will add a lot to our team. Just a great passer, great vision, and really fun
to work with.  
  
Really finds Ki, wherever you are, Ki.  
  
Q. Without jumping ahead, you are in a position potentially late in the
season to pass Pat Summit for the all-time wins for women 's basketball. You
probably haven't thought about it, but do you have any thoughts about it if
somebody asks you about it?  
TARA VANDERVEER: It has come up here. It has come up here. It's not something
that I've really thought about. But you know, it just comes back to kind of
what I said before, just enjoy every day. Because here's someone that was
arguably the greatest coach in the history of women's basketball, and she's
not here to enjoy all the things that she helped build. The relationships with
your players are number one. It's not about winning. It's more about just
having -- I want to do a good job for Ki and I want to do a good job -- a
great job for D. It's her last year.  
  
I think that it's very humbling to be in the conversation with Pat. I was
friends with Pat when she was coaching, and just someone very special, but
it's sad to think about. If that happens, then I hope it does just because
that will mean we're being very successful. But it's not something that --
like I'm counting down or anything. I'm just like, let's have a great practice
today, let's get better today, and then if it happens, great.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 7, 2019

  

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30388)

### [Robbi Ryan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34723)

### [Taya Hanson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38095)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: You ready for it? Okay, we've got a tradition for you
newbies in the room.  
  
Okay, so dog days of summer, really hot, two nuns are in their church painting
the inside, and then the air-conditioning breaks. So we'll just say this was
in Arizona, so it's hot. So they keep going because they have to get it done
this day. So they keep painting, and then the one nun is about to pass out.
And she looks at her friend, she says, hey, how about if we just take these
heavy garments off and finish up. The other nun says, well, I don't have
anything on under, and the nun says, I don't, either, but hey, stained glass
windows. Okay, sounds good. So they take them off and much better. They keep
painting and they're getting it done, and all of a sudden there's a knock on
the door. So the one nun goes over and says, who is it. There's a voice that
says, it's the blind guy from down the street. So they look at each other,
okay, open the door. Beat red, turns his head, two boxes of window blinds in
his arms. I'm so sorry, where would you like these.  
  
Okay, so we're going to play like naked nuns this year. We're going to find a
way. We're going to get it done. We're going to go for it.  
  
Super excited, with Robbi Ryan, with Reili Richardson, really going to lead
this team. We have a great senior class, nothing they haven't seen. They've
beat and played against the top competition in the country their entire
career. Taya is a great representative of our underclass -- our freshmen,
sophomores -- athletic, versatile, really going to help us get back to a
faster pace, more aggressive style. Real excited to finish top 15 -- as a team
15th in the nation last year, but we kind of had to adjust things, and we're
excited to get back to a little more aggressive style this year. So thank you.  
  
Q. For the players, what 's your excitement specifically about this
season? What are you looking forward to in terms of what you guys bring to the
floor, team chemistry, that kind of thing?  
TAYA HANSON: I mean, we've got a fun group of girls this year. We're very
unified already and just working together and trying to help each other as
much as we can. And then in practices, we've just been getting after it and
trying to push each other to go as hard as we can. Because in the end, that's
what we'll fall back on is our practice. So Charli has definitely been helping
us get back to our Sun Devil defense so that we can really be aggressive and
be the tougher team this year.  
  
Q. I think most people have been asked what they did in the off-season.
It looks like you guys have been (indiscernible). Are you guys weight lifting
partners or anything? Who 's stronger?  
ROBBI RYAN: No, I lift more weight than her, so we can't lift together.  
  
No, but we've worked really hard this past off-season, in the weight room,
cardio, skill-wise, and I think it's going to show up this season, so I'm
excited.  
  
Q. Charli, with the noticeable absences due to graduation, some big
shoes to fill. Who can be trusted from the veterans coming back to take on an
increased role? Maybe trust isn 't the right word, but given that opportunity,
if you will. And then some of the freshmen who might be able to step in,
catching on quickly, looking like they might be impact kids right away?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Yeah, absolutely. Well, certainly these two here,
particularly -- well, on both sides of the ball. But Reili has had a great
off-season. She's always shot the ball well, but when she gets into the games
and has to do so many other things. But she's fitter, stronger, and so really
excited with how she's looking.  
  
Kiki -- Kiara Russell -- our other senior has continued to be a little bit
plagued, but we get her healthy. And then Jamie Ruden the same thing, instant
offense, right, the microwave. Everybody is like, how is Jamie Ruden doing?
The other coaches in the conference because they know how good she is, and
she's doing really well.  
  
And then just that sophomore class we have, Iris. Jayde Van Hyfte is really
looking good. She had to -- Taya backed up Courtney and Jayde backed up Kiana,
and those were pretty awesome seniors that they learned from and played
behind. So she's really doing well.  
  
And then we have three -- Ja'Tavia, the grad transfer, that was a Godsend for
us with everything that we lost in the post. I mean, she's a great fit for us.
She's a great teammate, and she's really going to help us.  
  
And then our three freshmen, they're dynamic. They're athletic. Little Sara --
we call her little Sara -- very high motor, scoring point guard. And Eboni
Walker, top recruit out of Centennial High School in Vegas. She just fits the
Sun Devil relentless, going to make things happen. And Syd Caldwell, too. She
was slowed a little bit by a knee, but she's get being back into things. Yeah,
we're excited.  
  
And I will say, Eva Rubin is definitely our big 6'5" center who has played
behind some really good post players. She's now a junior, and it's her time to
really step up and help us, so she's worked hard.  
  
Q. I was wondering, just from last year maybe from last year to this
year, an area where you 're hoping to maybe expose some Pac-12 opponents that
you couldn't last year but knowing what you have in terms of personnel this
year that maybe you might try to install?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Two things. Number one, as we've already alluded to, I
think that we're going to be able to take more away. We play in the best
conference in the country hands down, not even close. We're playing against,
therefore, some of the best offensive players in the country. And so I think
we're going to be in a position maybe to guard them a little harder, shut down
some people a little bit more consistently.  
  
And then on the flipside, I've been joking today that we were the best
shooting team in the country in warmups last year. Like we would literally go
and barely missed a shot. I really think we have the potential to take our
great shooters and get our shooting percentage up into 47, 48, 49 percent like
the elite teams in the country. That's our goal. I think we have the ability
to do that. We're working towards that.  
  
Q. How did the signing of Ja 'Tavia Tapley come to be?  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, we were going to look to probably sign a post
player late, and just because we did lose our three post players from last
year in Charnea and Kiana and Sophia Elenga. So we were kind of looking into
junior colleges, and clearly the transfer situation is an option sometimes.
And the grad transfer was really -- we didn't really need anybody to sit a
year. It really kind of just happened. And I will tell you and the people in
this room that know me and know our program know that we don't just take a kid
because they're going to help us on the basketball court. So we really vet
them in terms of who they are as a person, and once we got to know her --
because we didn't at all -- and did our reference checks and did our vetting,
she's just a great teammate and a great person that's been a great addition.  
  
Obviously we're very excited because that's what we needed. We needed a
veteran post to go with the rest of our roster.  
  
Q. She has a different style obviously coming from USC to yours,
different culture, different style, et cetera.  
CHARLI TURNER THORNE: Well, you know, she's learning because she didn't get to
train in the summer, so she's been in here in the fall. But I think -- I mean,
every culture and every program is different. So I think that's been something
that she's really embraced, and then the basketball is basketball. She was one
of the top players in the country coming out of high school, so I think she's
enjoying just our high standards. We have very high standards, and we're about
bringing that every day, and I think she knows she's got one year, and she's
really embracing that.  
  
Q. Taya, all about shooting the three, I know it. Folks have told me
about it. What did you work on to be just a better spot-up shooter from range
this summer?  
TAYA HANSON: My mental game for sure. That was -- one of my biggest focuses in
the off-season was just to really be able to come down, have my feet set, lock
into that rim, and be able to hit the shot like I know I can. I think that was
-- my huge focus this off-season was just all around locking into how I can
improve mentally as a player.  
  
Q. Robbi, what are you doing to help Ja 'Tavia learn the ASU way?  
ROBBI RYAN: Tay, I love her. She's one of my besties. We've gotten along
really well thus far since she's been at ASU, and our culture, like it's in
her already. She needs a little bit of time adjusting, and it's been great
just getting to know her off the court, too. And I think just hanging out with
her has helped her learn our style of play and just who we are, because I
think that really correlates on to the basketball court. Yeah, she's been
great. She just absorbs everything, and she embraces it.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 7, 2019

  

### [Mark Trakh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30760)

### [Stephanie Watts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30374)

### [Kayla Overbeck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34671)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
MARK TRAKH: We're really excited to be here, and we're really excited about
our upcoming year. You know, we've got a lot of new faces. We've got a
freshman class that was ranked highly last year, and we've got a few graduate
transfers, and we're excited about the year.  
  
We've just got to mix our youth and experience together, and I think we've got
some good talent on the floor, and right now our kids are really working hard
in practice, they're coming together, are doing a lot of good things. So we're
very excited about this year and moving forward with our program.  
  
Q. There 's been a lot of change in your program. What do you know for
sure right now about your team?  
MARK TRAKH: I know that they're together. You know, I know that they genuinely
support each other on the floor. We went on a retreat this weekend, and we did
a lot of team bonding things with the kids. Went up to the -- inland from San
Diego, there's a camp there, and just seeing the kids work together on a lot
of our team-bonding drills and seeing them work together when they did the
high ropes courses and seeing the communication and the love they had for one
another. I think that's really going to go a long way.  
  
That's what I'm really excited about, just how together and close-knit this
group is.  
  
Q. How did it feel like Survivor?  
KAYLA OVERBECK: Because we haven't really been out on the trails in a long
time, and it was just -- there's like gnats everywhere. We're trying to do
team bonding and we're trying to go like that (swatting) without slapping each
other. But it was different. It was a lot of fun.  
  
Q. Kayla and Stephanie, what was your favorite activity from the retreat
weekend?  
STEPHANIE WATTS: For me that was probably -- there was one where we were all
in this middle island type of deal, and there was like a square around us, but
it was super hard to balance on the square because it was only probably like
an inch thick. So the goal was for everyone walk across the log and everyone
spread out across the square somewhere, so it was kind of cool like working
with each other to figure out kind of like a puzzle-type deal with our
teammates. It was a lot of fun and really cool to work on that together.  
  
KAYLA OVERBECK: Yeah, that same activity. But also we had this other activity
where it was like a plank of wood on like a seesaw. So the first time you have
to go to either side, you and a partner, as a team, as a whole, and the sides
couldn't touch the ground. And so the first time we did it, we were talking,
communicating like come on, this way, this way. And the second time we had to
do it without talking. So really being able to focus on the people on the
outside, really paying attention to each other and really listening without
actually listening. And so it was a lot of fun to see everyone really getting
involved and getting excited and just really having fun. You know, it was just
a lot of fun.  
  
MARK TRAKH: It was fun watching them do the high ropes courses. Because it was
like 50 feet in the air, and you're harnessed, but we had to talk Stephanie
into doing it because she sat down and said I'm not doing it, there is no way
I'm going up that pole. But she did it. It's really neat when they have --
they had a fear of height, and Stephanie had a fear of heights, and just to
overcome that and get up there and then balance herself on a thin wire 50 feet
in the air, I really enjoyed watching her do that.  
  
STEPHANIE WATTS: He's not going to mention he was my partner that dragged me
up there, so he was my partner doing it, so it was fun. We had a lot of fun,
and we ended up doing well on it, so it was cool.  
  
Q. Stephanie, how has the integration gone for you from UNC to USC,
practicing with some new teammates, some new faces? How did you land? How did
you get from UNC to USC? Help us understand the journey and the decision.  
STEPHANIE WATTS: So originally I looked at a ton of schools when I was
deciding to leave, and I actually knew a player from Charlotte that was on the
USC women's basketball team, Aliyah Mazyck, who had nothing but great things
to say about the program, the coaching, the family atmosphere of the program.
And when I got here for my visit, I felt everything that she was saying. It's
kind of crazy because I feel like I've been here for so much longer than I
have with just the family atmosphere. I kind of forget that I've only been
here for a few months and I'm a grad transfer.  
  
But they just make it seem like -- I feel like I've known Kayla forever. I
feel like I've known Coach Trakh forever, and it's just been an amazing
experience, and they've made this adjustment process so easy. Practice has
been great. Everyone -- although we have a lot of new faces -- has been just
molding together so seamlessly, so I'm glad to be here and glad to be a part
of it.  
  
Q. What are your expectations with all the new faces? A lot will be on
you. How do you feel about that?  
STEPHANIE WATTS: I'm excited. I couldn't be more excited. The team is meshing
together so well. We've put in a lot of great stuff. I couldn't be more
excited to be a part of this and to have that expectations and pressure, we
love it. We love being the underdogs. I think we have a lot more in store than
people think, and we're excited.  
  
MARK TRAKH: She mentioned Aliyah Mazyck. They were childhood friends, and for
those of you who know Aliyah, who I absolutely love, but Aliyah comes into my
office, and she goes, Coach, I've got a graduate transfer for you, and I kind
of looked at her, and she could tell the way I was looking at her. She goes,
no, no, no, Coach, she's not like me, she's a good kid I promise. She's going
to go to class, she's going to do everything she's supposed to. She won't yell
at refs, I promise. For those of you who know Aliyah, you'll understand what
I'm talking about right now.  
  
Q. I asked the Bruins, so I want to ask the Trojans. Talking about
distractions, Los Angeles is a fun place to play. Does your team have a go-to
restaurant, a good to song, go to things? What is it about LA that you guys
have fun playing college ball in that city?  
KAYLA OVERBECK: I would say Hot and Juicy is probably the --  
  
STEPHANIE WATTS: That's the first thing that came to my mind. It's like a
crab, seafood, shrimp, like all that, and they put it in a bag with a bunch of
really good sauces, and ever since I've got here, I love that place. But our
team loves going there. They just went there I think last night, but we missed
it.  
  
KAYLA OVERBECK: I know. But what do we do? There's not really like a favorite
song, either, that we dance to. I feel like everyone will dance to anything.
Even if you don't want to dance, you're going to start moving. Like okay, come
on, let's go. But I think that's the best part about it, too, like everyone is
so willing to just step outside themselves and really just be themselves,
because why not? We're all so new and young, we're not going to be this age
for that much longer, so why not do it, yeah.  
  
Q. Mark, what can we expect from you guys on the floor? What kind of
team will we see?  
MARK TRAKH: You'll see a team that plays hard, that's unified, that's going to
be a system team, that's going to be together like Tammy Blackburn's high
school teams were. Remember that, Tammy, those many years ago?  
  
But we want that culture. You'll see us play hard, you'll see us play
together, and that's what we've really been working on, for all these kids to
really buy in, to be all in on what we need to do this year.  
  
Q. Coach, just a little bit of an extension of that question. How will
you be able to use your size and speed to beat teams that might be coming in
and very tough on paper, but having that balance that maybe you haven 't had
in the first couple of years?  
MARK TRAKH: Well, I'll tell you, first of all, let me say how great it is to
see you again and to let you know, again, what a great inspiration you are to
all our kids and especially to me day in and day out. So keep the fight, we
love you. (Applause.)  
  
Oh, by the way, Tammy was nominated, was a finalist for San Diego woman of the
year, which we're all very proud of, too. Just wanted to give you a shout-out
there.  
  
I just think with our style, I think we've got a 6'5" freshman who's shown
really, really well -- we've never had an athlete that's tall since I've been
there, and kind of we're going to platoon her and Kayla. Kayla gives you that
she can step outside, she can go around you, so it's going to be a good
combination. And I think our guards shoot the ball relatively well, and I
think we've got enough size -- not overwhelming size -- but I think we've got
enough size and strength and skill level that I think we'll be competitive,
and that's what we want to do, we want to compete every night, night in and
night out.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 7, 2019

  

### [Charmin Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=16117)

### [CJ West](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38088)

### [Sara Anastasieksa](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38089)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
CHARMIN SMITH: Excited to be here. Thank you all for joining us. Excited to be
here with CJ and Sara. Excited to see so many faces in the room. This is an
incredible opportunity for us here. We're looking forward to having a great
season. We've got great senior leadership with CJ, Sara, Jaelyn Brown, who's
not here right now. She was scheduled to be here but has concussion-like
symptoms. And then Chen Yue. Those are our four seniors, and a phenomenal
group. I'm happy to be on this journey with them, and looking forward to
answering your questions about this coming season.  
  
Q. Charmin, Head Coach Charmin Smith, have you gotten used to hearing
that yet?  
CHARMIN SMITH: I guess so, yeah. I'm really comfortable. It's not something
that I saw coming. You know, I don't know that any of us anticipated Lindsay
leaving for the NBA, but it feels good to be back, and it feels right.  
  
Q. Charmin, it 's great to see you up there. With all your experience
coaching under Tara VanDerveer and Coach Gottlieb and coaching in the WNBA,
what do you think you're going to channel or what do you think you're going to
channel when you're coaching?  
CHARMIN SMITH: Yeah, that's a good question. I think I've been fortunate
enough to work for and learn from a number of phenomenal coaches. Obviously
Tara has known me the longest, being that she recruited me and I played for
her. Spent some time with Cathy Inglese, just an extraordinary coach and
person. And then Joanne Boyle and Lindsay Gottlieb, and finally in New York
with Katie. I think I've taken something from each of them, and I see it come
out in myself during different moments, depending on what I'm trying to
accomplish, what I'm trying to instill in our team. And so I think it's just
going to be a blend of everything in my past.  
  
Q. Coaching in the WNBA and playing in the WNBA and playing overseas,
what about that do you think you 're going to bring to your coaching
experience and your players there at Cal?  
CHARMIN SMITH: Well, any time you have a chance to really coach at the highest
level, I think it really enhances your skills. And having the opportunity to
work with Tina Charles and Bria Hartley, and Amanda Zahui B., just phenomenal
professionals, and that was a great learning experience for me. And I think it
also showed me that -- just reinforced that I do know how to coach this game.
I have been doing it for a really long time.  
  
Q. Coach, what have these last few months been like for you, going from
Berkeley to the Liberty, back in the East Bay? Been a whirlwind for you?  
CHARMIN SMITH: Yeah, more like a boomerang. I rented out my house. I thought I
was gone. So when I first got back to Berkeley, I was staying with my
neighbors looking outside of their window staring at my house that I own. That
was interesting.  
  
But it's been nonstop, just trying to get ready and do a great job of
recruiting, and then also do a great job of prepping our team for what's to
come with the season. And I'm excited that I'm actually enjoying those
challenges; you know, hard work, fast pace. None of that has ever been
something that I've shied away from, so we're handling it well.  
  
Q. When Charmin was hired, there was so much discussion about this will
be a seamless transition, she 's been part of the program. Now that it's a
couple months -- a few months into it, how smooth has this been and how
special to have her back and running the show with a lot of familiar assistant
coaches, as well?  
SARA ANASTASIEKSA: I think it's been a really good transition. Charmin has
always been that consistent coach that we've had, and she always comes in
ready to work, like knows what we should be doing. And we want to work for her
and all the other coaches, and I think it was probably the best possible thing
that could happen for us because we know Charmin, we love Charmin, we've
always loved her. So for her to come back, it was like incredible, and we
couldn't have thought of anything better.  
  
CJ WEST: Agree.  
  
Q. Do you have anything you want to add?  
CJ WEST: No, same.  
  
Q. Charmin, just wanted to know in what ways are you going to be similar
to Lindsay, and in what ways are your teams going to be different? And then
for the players, how is she similar to Lindsay, and in what ways is Coach
Charmin different from Coach Lindsay?  
CHARMIN SMITH: You know, Lindsay and I coached together for, what, seven years
or so; known each other for about 12 or 13 years. And so there are a lot of
similarities in how we feel about the game of basketball, how we feel about
empowering young women and what our purpose is in this sport, and I think
that's where we are really strongly aligned. And I think that's why we worked
so well together for so long.  
  
In terms of the differences, I don't know. I just know me and what I need as a
head coach and what's going to be important to me. And we've talked about it
as a team, that the number one thing for me -- and it's really come out during
this transition -- is just having people that are willing. Like that's my
word. I want people who are willing. I want people who are willing to work for
the program, work for their teammates. I want people who are willing to commit
to being at Cal, being at the No. 1 public institution in the country, and
people who are willing to compete.  
  
And I think that's what I'm looking for. That's what I'm trying to pull out of
our team consistently every single day, and I think as long as we have those
pieces, we're heading in the right direction.  
  
CJ WEST: I also think to build off what Sara touched on earlier, how
consistent Charmin is and how every day she has a goal for us and we trust in
her and she trusts in us to get done what we're supposed to get done. Yeah.  
  
SARA ANASTASIEKSA: I think the differences between Charmin and Lindsay, just
the personalities are inherently different. So Charmin is very like tough on
us but in a good way, and she's very like attention to detail. That's what
she's really into.  
  
Q. For the players, just wondering, in your senior year just thinking
about what you 're hoping to get personally and also for the team this year. I
know Sara, for example, you haven't played much due to injury, so I'd be
curious to hear about what you hope for out of this campaign.  
SARA ANASTASIEKSA: Yes, injuries really do suck. But it's kind of given me an
outside view of everyone on the court, and being able to tell people, oh, this
is the look that you should be making because I've seen it so many times. And,
yes, it's actually been really hard for me to make those looks, too, because I
feel like that's -- it's a very in-game situation. I haven't had many of them.  
  
But I think I play without fear, and I think I have a very aggressive mindset,
a scorer's mentality. And I think that playing with the team right now, I've
gelled really well and so have -- our freshmen have come in and given
everything we've needed for them to give, so I'm really excited for our team
and I'm ready to show everyone what I can do.  
  
CJ WEST: For me, as well, I think my transition from freshman to sophomore and
sophomore to junior year have been physical. And I think this year it's
probably going to be a lot more mental, especially with the big role I'm
stepping into, seeing as -- all the change that we've gone through. I think
that my mindset has to change to be more aggressive. And my goal is to have
more of a scorer's mentality and to realize that my role is a lot more
impactful than maybe it was in the previous years, and also having a lot more
confidence in myself, as well.  
  
Q. You tweeted out the status with you doing some Muay Thai and said
that if you can 't do it, you won't ask your players to do it or something
like that. First of all, how long have you been doing that? It looked pretty
boss. And for the players, how hard is that to incorporate that into your
workouts? Is it a challenge and do you get beat?  
CHARMIN SMITH: So I've been doing Muay Thai for about four years now, and it's
definitely my passion outside of basketball. I've found a whole new community.
I have new teammates, new family with our Muay Thai minded family and Coach J.
And it's been truly phenomenal and I've learned another level of discipline
and commitment. The technique and the skill that it takes to learn the art of
Muay Thai has definitely made me a better basketball coach.  
  
And the tweet about not asking them to do anything that I'm not willing to do,
I think my experience playing in the WNBA, playing at Stanford and going to
Final Fours, like I hope that they trust in me because I've done it as a
player. I want them to be able to hear me say like this is the way, and not
just because I think so, but because I've actually experienced it.  
  
CJ WEST: I also think that's the main reason why our relationship with Charmin
is so strong is because she understands. She's been through every step that
we've taken thus far. And going back to Muay Thai, it's really hard. We've
done it twice. We've had like two sessions this year and last year, I think.
And it was really fun, but it's really hard, and you have to really be locked
in mentally. But the payoff is amazing. The community that they have built and
how they support each other in the process of learning and how willing you
have to be to learn and open yourself up to new things is really nice, and it
was a really, really good experience.  
  
SARA ANASTASIEKSA: I wasn't able to do the Muay Thai, but it was crazy to see
how when everyone got there, everyone was laughing. And then once it started,
like the most serious faces I've ever seen. Everyone was really into it. You
could tell everyone was gaining that discipline that Charmin always talks
about, and now we'll have a greater understanding of why Charmin coaches the
way she does and the discipline factor in her coaching.  
  
Q. CJ, I 'm curious, as a media studies major what this experience is
like for you, the whole basketball media day?  
CJ WEST: Unfortunately I've actually changed my major since then, so I'm
actually a soc major now. But still, I think with what I want to do career-
wise, having this media -- social media experience is really important for me.
And I think nowadays it's important for everyone in the world that we're in
today. It's still pretty impactful, maybe not if I was a media studies major,
but yeah.  
  
Q. Charmin, much is made of who you 're losing, who you've lost in terms
of your roster spaces. Unbelievable players, starters, both ends of the floor,
et cetera, et cetera. How will you integrate some of the veterans coming back,
asking them to take on an increased role, and also asking some of your
freshmen to be impact players right away?  
CHARMIN SMITH: Yeah, that's a great question. We've talked about it a lot, and
what I've mentioned to them is that everyone in this program is in a new role.
For me as a first-time head coach to every single player who's trying to do
something really that they haven't done before. And what I think comes with
that is an excitement, because now it's your turn, and it's your opportunity.
And I think when people feel like they have opportunity, they're more willing
to work. So we have a group that's just fired up because who's taking
Kristine's minutes, who's taking AT's minutes, who's taking Recee's minutes.  
  
There's a lot of opportunity out there, and I will tell you we have people
that are very capable. You guys have not see Sara play. I've seen her over the
past few years on the guys' team, and when I was the associate head coach, I
coached the practice squad. And so Sara was oftentimes with me, and I'm like,
this kid can go. She can score. She's phenomenal. So I'm excited.  
  
Our freshmen, I just have to start really not even by talking about the
basketball but as people. When you all get to meet Cailyn and Jazzy and E and
Leilani, you're going to be blown away because they're phenomenal people, and
really in my first year as a head coach, I would rather have that. I would
rather have the culture and the character and the personalities and then worry
about the talent. Fortunately enough, they're an extremely talented group, as
well.  
  
We've got great experiences. We don't have as much experience. But again, when
you go back to people who are willing to dive in and do whatever the coach is
asking them to do, whatever their teammate tells them to do, then I think we
have the ability to surprise some people.  
  
Q. As you took this job, now that you 've had a couple months to digest
and everything, what's the one thing you wish somebody would have told you
before you said yes, I'll be the head coach?  
CHARMIN SMITH: You know, I can't really think of anything where I'm just like,
gosh, I wish I would have known. There have been a ton of things that I didn't
know. Like Lindsay and I talk often, and I remember, I called her and said,
did I ever ask you anything like this? Like I had questions coming to me, and
I'm like, just kind of shocked at what people think they should ask, shouldn't
ask. I don't know. There's just a lot of things that I've been like, wow, did
I do that to Lindsay, did she feel that way when I said this, that, and the
other. So we've had those types of funny moments.  
  
But nothing has been extremely overwhelming or make me feel like, oh, shoot, I
wish I would have known. We haven't played a game yet, but it's been all good,
and I'm really excited about the opportunity.  
  
Q. I wanted to know what aspects of your game you most focused on over
the summer, and Charmin, is there any particular aspect of coaching you 've
focused on more as a head coach more than an assistant?  
SARA ANASTASIEKSA: I think over the summer for me, the main goal has been to
stay healthy. I just got healthy right before the summer, so my main goal was
to be able to pretty much get into the role that Charmin needs me to. But also
I do have a scorer's mentality, and I'm focusing on being able to finish with
contact over some great defenders that we have in the Pac-12. So I think
that's been my main focus.  
  
CJ WEST: I'd also say similar to Sara is finishing through contact mostly.
Yeah, just being able to finish through multiple people and be consistent with
that because I feel like that's kind of the main thing that we're going to
need.  
  
CHARMIN SMITH: I think basketball-wise, I've been focusing a lot on special
situations, just in that I'm going to be the one calling the shots, so I want
to make sure that I'm prepared. And so we've added that into, I'd say, almost
every single practice for the last 20 minutes. We're doing special situations.
If we have a foul to give, what type of plays we're calling, who we're looking
to get the ball to, those types of things. I just want to make sure we're all
on the same page and we're all comfortable because this is our first year in
with our defensive terminology, our offense. There's a lot of changes, so I
want us to be as familiar and comfortable as possible in end of game
situations.  
  
And then for me off the court in terms of the coaching responsibilities, what
I've learned is there's always something else coming. There's always some
other thing. So like flipping out in the moment about something that's going
on isn't going to help you, and just really trying to stay even-keeled.
Because you think you have something under control and then someone is going
to walk into your office and say, oh, this happened, and now you've got to be
ready to deal with the next thing as a head coach.  
  
Just trying to make sure that I stay consistent in terms of my personality and
my reactions and don't let anything get me too emotional.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 7, 2019

  

### [Larry Scott](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22739)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
THE MODERATOR (Anne Marie Anderson): Larry, I want to ask the first one. As we
approach tip, conceivably there's four teams in this conference who could be
ranked in the top ten preseason. To what do you ascribe that kind of growth?  
  
LARRY SCOTT: Well, the trajectory of this conference has been a lot of fun to
witness in women's basketball in the 10 years I've been here. And I think this
is the strongest we've certainly been in our modern history. As you say,
certainly at the top. We're going to have teams that are expected to be
competing for Final Fours this year, but the depth of the conference has been
tremendous to see, as well.  
  
I think of Arizona coming through and winning the WNIT at the end of last
season, and I see the legacy of coaches now that we've had. We've had one
coaching change with Charmin Smith joining at Cal. She's about as experienced
of a newcomer as you can imagine, having played at Stanford and coached at
Stanford and Cal. I really feel like the Conference has developed nicely over
time, and I really ascribe it to the commitment of our schools, first and
foremost. They prioritize women's sports and women's basketball in particular
in our league. They've made some great coaching hires.  
  
Our schools have a tradition of excellence. I think, as the video said, 10 of
the last 12 years, we've had teams in the Final Four. The last few years we've
had at least half the league make the NCAA Tournament, so there's a nice
momentum that's built. And I do think that the exposure that women's
basketball has gotten in our league, the collective commitment of our schools
and the league in putting 125 games this year, for example, on the Pac-12
Networks in addition to ESPN's commitment. There's no other conference that
provides that exposure for women's basketball, women's sports generally. I
think there's a bunch of different factors, but this is certainly a golden age
for women's basketball in the Pac-12.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We're all here to learn about the conference and the teams.
This year there's a lot of exciting things, including Stanford's freshman
class. What story lines are you following? Are you a "Beliber?" Fran Belibi,
really exciting. What interests you as you look across the landscape?  
  
LARRY SCOTT: Definitely count me as a "Beliber." I'm on that band wagon.
What's going to be really fun to watch is we've got very elite teams, and
we've made Final Fours 10 of the last 12 years. What I'm looking forward to
this year is seeing if we have a team that's going to make that next step,
which is holding the trophy up at the end of the NCAA Tournament. I'm also
going to be watching to see with the increased depth that we have, can we go
beyond six teams, seven teams in the NCAA Tournament. A lot of that will come
down to how we do non-conference.  
  
So what's really fun for me is just to see the development, top to bottom.
There's a lot of enthusiasm, high expectations really, amongst all of our
schools, and I don't think there's another conference in the country that's
going to have the kind of depth we have and have teams capable of competing
for the National Championship.  
  
THE MODERATOR: There's stars in this league, genuine stars. There have been
going back to the Ogwumike sisters and Kelsey Plum and certainly some big
stars now. Sabrina Ionescu projected at No. 1 pick potentially in the WNBA.
What can the Pac-12 do to kind of leverage that star power to support and
elevate the entire league?  
  
LARRY SCOTT: Well, as you point out, I think momentum is a powerful thing, and
it's showing up in recruiting. I don't know that we've had stronger recruiting
classes than we've witnessed in the last year or two as well, and that's
really fun to see as well. I think these things build upon each other.
Momentum is a very powerful thing, and I sense that in the league at the
moment. Yeah, no reason why I see that not continuing.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Along the same lines, the coaches in this conference have
really delivered consistently. There's some stars there, Oregon State has
sustained excellence through many classes, Tara VanDerveer, a coaching star,
31 wins away from all-time coaching leader. In terms of the strength of the
coaches in the league, what impresses you the most?  
  
LARRY SCOTT: Well, I had a chance to meet with our coaches this morning as
well as the student-athletes, something I like to do on this day, and I look
around that table, and I see some iconic coaches and legends. Look at Tara,
look at Cori Close as examples. And I also notice a lot of former Pac-12
student-athletes, former players themselves. So we've got a really cool group
with a lot of great experience, but also some of the most exciting, most
talented, young, up-and-coming coaches that have deep roots in the league.  
  
Look, that's obviously an essential ingredient. But we are also now getting a
lot of star talent coming to the league, as well, as you mentioned. Obviously
the returning national Player of the Year -- well, it was at another school,
Destiny Slocum was the freshman of the year. So we've got a lot of -- as you
mentioned, the No. 2 recruiting class in the country in the league. I think
that's kind of an X factor that now we're adding on top of the strong base,
some momentum that's built. Now some of the best talent in the country is
coming here.  
  
Look, a lot of these student-athletes that come to Pac-12 schools to play
women's basketball have their sights set on the WNBA, and you look at some of
the stars that have gone from our league, to be, well drafted and have great
success in the WNBA. And I think that's the kind of thing with young people
that reinforces Pac-12 is a great pathway to the WNBA and to fill your
athletic dreams. Of course, we've got some of the best academic schools in the
country, too.  
  
I think that's what student-athletes recognize is the opportunity at the
Pac-12.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Last year, first year for the tournament to be in Vegas. What
kind of feedback did you get?  
  
LARRY SCOTT: It was great feedback. I think our women's basketball community
didn't know exactly what to expect, but it's seen the success that we've had
with men's basketball there. And we're kind of game, and I think everyone left
really, really pleased with how the teams were treated, the environment, the
crowd reaction that we had. Sort of the overall vibe.  
  
This year we are moving to the Mandalay Bay, which is where the Aces play, and
working with MGM that owns that team. We think it'll take the event to another
level in terms of really an embedded fan base that follows and appreciates and
is educated on women's basketball. And we've certainly seen that fans have
enjoyed making the trip and being there.  
  
You know, I think we're so pleased with how it went and the feedback that we
got from our schools that we've thought ahead and actually have some news I'll
announce this morning. We've finalized arrangements to extend another couple
of years our men's basketball and women's basketball tournaments in Las Vegas.
So 2020 -- March 2020 was going to be the last year of our current
arrangements and we're going to be playing the men's and women's basketball
tournament in Las Vegas in '21 and '22 as well. And I think we're joined by
some of our friends back here.  
  
Okay. We've got Pat Christenson from Las Vegas Events here with us today and
George Kliavkoff from MGM, our partners here. Delighted to have you all here.
And anyone who's interested in hearing a little bit more about our plans in
Las Vegas and our partnership, feel free to talk to Pat and George, but we're
really excited about this.  
  
Having a platform of a fabulous end-of-season tournament, well-supported with
a lot of enthusiasm and buzz amongst fans, twinned with great media exposure,
we're in a good place in terms of exposure for the foundations of our women's
basketball program.  
  
THE MODERATOR: George Kliavkoff, my other boss, will tell you that the
Mandalay Bay Events Center is called the House, so it's good to know that
Pac-12 basketball has a home in Vegas for the next couple of years. We can
open it up to some questions from the media now.  
  
Q. This is sort of our first opportunity to talk to you since Governor
Newsom signed the Fair Pay to Play Act. What are your thoughts on that? You
have -- some of your conference teams in California and some aren 't, and
what's the reaction you've gotten from coaches and just around the conference
so far regarding this?  
LARRY SCOTT: Yeah, well, it's early days, as you say, but we've been very
active in communication with our campuses at different levels, including this
morning. Had a chance to talk to our coaches about it, and I think it's going
to take some time for it to digest and people to kind of think it through and
think through the implications. And there's strong feelings all over the place
on this issue, as we've witnessed in the media, and just talking to people.  
  
I think what we've wanted to point out, we think -- we have some real concerns
about the bill, some of which I referred to in a statement last week. But even
since the statement we put out, I think there are at least 10, maybe 12 states
that since then have had senators or other representatives raise their hand
and say, we plan on a similar bill, and in some cases maybe with our own
tweaks to it.  
  
I think I can say as a conference, we've got real concerns about a state-by-
state approach to managing college sports. Schools recruit nationally, compete
for National Championships. There have to be common rules that apply. I don't
think state-by-state legislators deciding how college sports should run is the
way to go, and we're going to be very active in trying to seek a national
response and solution, whether it's through the NCAA or otherwise.  
  
I think the other concern we've got -- while I'm sure the legislators and
Governor Newsom are very well-intended -- those of us that work in college
sports understand a lot of flaws with this bill and the way it's written. I've
seen plenty of people comment on this because people that understand college
sports would immediately understand there's recruiting in college sports, and
there's very aggressive recruiting and a lot of competition for student-
athletes. And I think the concern is that while it may be well-intentioned to
try to provide name, image, and likeness opportunities for that very, very
small handful -- maybe half a percent, 1 percent of our student-athletes go on
to have successful professional careers and maybe have a name, image and
likeness value -- it's pretty clear that there's a market for recruiting
student-athletes.  
  
So the idea that agents would be involved, helping negotiate deals for
student-athletes, our concern is that winds up being payment for recruiting
and trying to get student-athletes to go to a certain school.  
  
The way the bill is written, it wouldn't be very hard to dress it up, and I
don't think that's what's intended. So when I talk about unintended
consequences, that's probably the most obvious, easy to understand example for
people. If it becomes a market for recruiting.  
  
And if that's what happens, which we expect it would, then it wouldn't be
limited. And there's no way to really put guardrails to make sure it would be
for arm's length. And if that happens, there's no doubt money that supports
athletics departments would go to student-athletes to try to recruit them, and
that's resources that would be drained from our athletics departments. And I
signaled a concern that we've got for women's sports and Olympic sports that
are the beneficiaries of athletics departments having resources.  
  
We've got -- most of our schools have 18 or 19 sports or more, some as high as
high 20s and 30s. And if money gets drained, money that's supporting the
athletics department currently starts going directly to student-athletes to
try to get them to go to school at X or Y, our concern is there would be less
resources and sports might get cut as part of that.  
  
Having said that, we've been at the forefront of supporting student-athlete
reform and welfare. We've been proponents for full cost of attendance,
nutrition, healthcare coverage, liberalizing transfer rules, and we'll be very
actively engaged in this discussion with our campuses and nationally to try to
work on a national solution, and something that's much more artfully written
or done that doesn't have all these unintended consequences.  
  
And the other thing I should point out, completely supportive of young people
having the opportunity to -- professional opportunities. So we've been
supporting the NBA and other leagues, allowing student-athletes to go pro
earlier, not have to go to college. We are for choice. And if young people
want to earn money from their name, image, and likeness and get paid to play,
they should have that opportunity. That's called pro sports.  
  
College sports is different. You go to get an education. It's amateur, they're
students. Those are the defining characteristics, and we'd like to see those
lines not get blurred and the interest in college sports become diminished.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 7, 2019

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Destiny Slocum](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32729)

### [Mikayla Pivec](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32690)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
SCOTT RUECK: Hi, everybody. Excited to be back here. There's been a few
comments today how quickly this has come, and it does feel that way. It's
like, I can't believe we're already back here. Excited about the year ahead,
the journey. We have had a sneak preview in August with our trip to Italy,
where this team competed extremely well, came together quickly as a family,
and we just had a phenomenal time. And so the beginning feels like a little
bit of a continuation for us, and so practice is off to a great start.  
  
This is a highly competitive team that I can say didn't end the year last year
maybe quite as satisfied as they would have liked, and are very motivated
going into this year, and that's been a fun group to be around.  
  
Love the people that they are, and there's a lot of talent throughout our
roster, which is necessary in a conference like this one. And so we're looking
at a year with a lot of growth throughout the Pac-12, great coaches
throughout, and so as always, it's going to be a daunting challenge ahead, and
we're excited for the journey.  
  
Q. Scott, can you talk about the European trip? When teams get to do
that, you get to do that once every few years, how much of a slingshot is that
into putting your team together for the season. And also can you speak to Kat
Tudor 's status?  
SCOTT RUECK: Sure, last time we did a foreign tour, which was my first time
four years ago, that year ended in a Final Four, and so we would love a repeat
of that. It is an awesome opportunity in every way. Certainly you get 10
practices that are full practices. You get to incorporate your new players.
And then you get to go overseas and have what I love to refer to as shared
experiences, you know. And for us, it's basically a 10-day retreat where
you're getting to see things that most people never get to see as a group.  
  
The only way it could be a negative is if you had a group that didn't like
each other. I think that could be tough. This group loves each other, and
because of that, those 10 days never got old. We got to play four games.  
  
When we go on our tour, we played against great competition. Some of the pro
teams we played against had Americans on their roster already as they were
preparing for their season, and so competition was good. And so it was just
overall a fantastic experience. I think it does move you ahead when you get
that opportunity.  
  
As for Kat, when we were in Italy and during those practices, she was able to
do a little bit more and a little bit more, and we'd be practicing and we'd
see her over on the side shooting, which was encouraging to see her back to
the thing she loves to do. And then when we were in Italy warming up for
games, you could just see her energy come back. She was herself, competitive,
bouncing around with the joy that she brings every day, funny. And so you
could tell that she's feeling good. And so she is on schedule. I'm not sure
exactly when she's going to be back on the court for us, but everything is
progressing very well with her.  
  
Q. Just want to get your thoughts on starting the season with the WNIT
and kind of like that tournament format. Usually teams have a game or two
before they play a preseason tournament, but you jump right into it.  
SCOTT RUECK: Yeah, fortunately, exhibition games will get us there, but this
is the first time we've played in the WNIT preseason tournament, and I'm
excited for it. This team loves to compete. If there's anything about this
group that I've learned, competition is their passion. If you want to teach
them something, put it in a game format. That's going to get their best,
because they love to compete against each other and against anyone they get
to. So to start it with a tournament, I think it's perfect for this group. We
open with Irvine at home. After that, it gets challenging.  
  
If you look at the teams in this tournament, there's excellent teams
throughout mid-major and Power Five. So great opportunity for us to grow
quickly, find out who we are, and tournaments tend to bring out your best, so
that's what I'm expecting.  
  
Q. Destiny and Mik, a question for each of you. Destiny, what were you
able to kind of learn from last year in your first season in the Pac-12? How
does that translate into areas of improvement that you challenge yourself
with? And Mik, what about your game, as great as it is, would you like to step
up a little bit in order to just carry this club along?  
DESTINY SLOCUM: Yeah, no, to begin, I came here and he told me, he said,
you're not going to experience anything like the Pac, and I was like, okay,
okay. And then once you get your feet under you, and we did begin, it was a
lot. In all truth, it was a lot to take in. It was a lot -- every night is a
battle. Every time you go out there, you're going to find a team that is going
to give you their best, especially against us. So we have to fight back.  
  
I think as we went along throughout the season, I realized how important
efficiency was, and that was my number one thing is just being more efficient,
taking care of the ball, making sure all my teammates were on the right track
at all times. And I think that's one thing that I've challenged myself to do
and get better at throughout the summer, and even in the spring, of just kind
of taking that point guard role, that leadership role of making sure that
everyone is on the same page, that I'm efficient, and someone kind of to look
up to that does stuff right all the time.  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: I think for me, there's a lot of things I can improve on. But
the things this summer that I really focused on was outside shot, being a big
threat coming off screens, and looking for my 3-ball. And then also instead of
maybe ramming through people and using my strength to get open, try to use
more change of pace to create separation from my defender.  
  
Q. Mikayla, it feels like just yesterday you were a freshman, but now
you 're a senior. Talk about the expectations that come with that and just
kind of the feeling of being now an upper classman senior on campus?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: Yeah, I feel the same way. I remember our freshman crew moving
into Tebeau, which was the freshman dorm, and Janessa's mom crying because she
was so sad about her daughter leaving. But I think just kind of the urgency of
understanding this is my last year here with these people and trying to make
the most of it, you kind of have a new fire that this is your last shot at
achieving what you want to do with this group of people and making lasting
memories.  
  
I think cherishing it, but working as hard as I can to help in any way I can
to make this program have a great year.  
  
Q. Scott, your take on the lay of the land conference-wise at some
point, but on this team specifically, in terms of another really solid
recruiting class, what you 've seen from some of the newcomers to complement
some of the kids you have back. And I know you've been asked ad infinitum
about Aquino, but if you could give us an update on her, as well?  
SCOTT RUECK: Andrea has not been cleared yet. That was reported probably a
week ago, I guess, as well. You know, Italy gave us that opportunity to see
our freshmen play, and to see them -- it's such a unique thing because you're
traveling around a new place in a country and you're learning so much, and
you're going from this to that and you don't want to miss a moment. And it's
like, we're going to play a game now. There's no practice, it's show up and
it's play. Even for us that have been around, it's a challenge because there's
no shoot-around. There's no scouting report. It's figure it out as we go,
which is really fun actually.  
  
And so for our freshmen, they're doing the same thing, figure everything out
as you go, and they did an incredible job. Both Kennedy and Taylor, just
picking everything up quickly, adapting, playing through their mistakes, which
I thought was really amazing to watch. They had moments where it was like,
can't get away with that any longer or oh, that doesn't work here. It was just
momentary. It was, okay, on to the next, and then they conquer that.  
  
So these are -- those two in particular, these are blue chip players from
Kansas, from Texas, a McDonald's All American and one that could have been had
she not been hurt the summer before.  
  
Then Jelena Mitrovic is another freshman. Had her knee scoped so she didn't
play in Italy. Not quite practicing yet, but we're hoping for her before too
long, and then we have a walk-on in Noelle Mannen that has done a phenomenal
job fitting in and adapting and becoming part of the family herself so quickly
and doing a great job for us.  
  
The conference is excellent, but you know, four top ten teams to start the
year. I don't know if that's ever happened before. I think it's absolutely
worthy, so it's exciting times for our conference.  
  
Q. Beaver Believers found me on social media yet, you 've got to ask
coach, do I need to book for New Orleans now? How do you manage the
expectations with this team?  
SCOTT RUECK: I love the expectations. That's what we're here for. It's a
familiar area for me. I like that other than the opposite. When you are --
when things are maybe not expected, there's some fun to be had. There's some
joy in proving people wrong. When there are expectations, it's the opposite.
It's, okay, let's prove them right. And then unless you're one, there's still
some people to prove wrong.  
  
With this group, their expectations are extremely high, so this is just
becoming the best team we can be every day. In order to do that, you've got to
have strong leadership. I'm sitting next to two of the best leaders you can
find, and we have a team, to be honest, full of them. This group is dynamic.
They're highly competitive. They've had nothing but success throughout all of
their careers, whether it's a world championship for Jasmine Simmons or state
titles or you name it, and now a lot of success at this level.  
  
So there's been so many great experiences that we can draw from. And so my
goal each year is to turn this thing over to them, and it's to guide and
direct, and to be a resource as our staff -- the best our staff can be.  
  
But I can already feel the ownership out of our team, and the best seasons
that I've been a part of, that's how it's happened. It's come out of the
locker room. And so expectations are high, ability is high, and so that's a
great combination, you know. And then this conference is going to get us
ready. Just like a year ago, I said it before, I said whoever makes the NCAA
Tournament or the postseason -- and look at Arizona -- we're going to be
prepared for the postseason, and that will be the case again for all of our
postseason teams.  
  
Yeah, so I love the expectations.  
  
Q. There 's a culture that has been in place before you got on campus
and it'll be there after you leave. As you integrate yourselves into that
culture, you've got a good idea of what's expected and what works. When you're
in the locker room and there is no coaching staff present with you, so you
don't have to -- it's just you guys. How quickly are the young freshmen or the
transfers understanding what culture means from a player's point of view and
not just from Scott and his staff?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: I'll start this one off. I think initially as a freshman, one
of the drawing cards to Oregon State is being around the team and family
atmosphere is super important. So that's one of the initial reasons why they
wanted to come here. And then for -- because the coaches can't always be
there. So we've been working especially this year on accountability, and how
our teammates may be willing to say uncomfortable things knowing that
something isn't in somebody else's best interest, even though it's not easy to
say. So something we've really talked about this spring, this summer, and
coming into the season that will hopefully make the difference for us.  
  
DESTINY SLOCUM: Yeah, to add on, I think it does pull to the character of
recruits that Scott brings in. We all have a very similar mindset when it
comes in -- it's not even that you have to be introduced to the culture, it's
who you are already. There's not much of like, hey, you can't do that, hey,
you can't act like that. This is how we act. It's a lot of, okay, they kind of
fit in. Just how he said Noelle, she came in right away and fit our culture. I
think just knowing that everyone that you come across on our team is already
going to have that type of culture in them and that same type of mindset, it
makes it a lot easier for us to do things like hold each other accountable and
make sure that every day our locker room is a place that we walk into and our
mindset is to get better, grow as a team, and then continue our family
culture.  
  
Q. What is the story of the walk-on process? You don 't hear that much
at a program so established like yourselves.  
SCOTT RUECK: Well, it's interesting because I typically don't have one. In
this instance, because of Kat's injury largely, we needed someone to practice.
We needed another guard. And so this was a year where we entertained the
thought of adding somebody.  
  
Noelle just seemed to be the perfect one, and it was a friend of a friend who
I knew of her through, and was actually trying to help her find a school. And
then it kind of evolved into would you be interested in helping us? And so it
was a neat process to be a part of, and I knew she'd be a good fit, but I had
no idea that she'd come in and be such a great fit, and then also contribute
so much on the court. She's the type that's extremely cerebral, better than
you think. And I mean, I threw at her to the point one day in practice, for
the first time before our Italy prep -- and so she's playing against Destiny
and holding her own, didn't turn it over once, and it's like, okay. She's been
really remarkable and already has had an impact on us and made us better.  
  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: If you can talk to her, she's hilarious. She's super awesome.  
  
Q. We asked Larry and also Cori Close just a little bit -- maybe this is
something that seems like it affects the men 's game more in terms of players
being compensated for their likeness in California. Given Gavin Newsom's
signing of the bill last week, as a coach who is competing for recruits, can
you imagine in a couple years what it might be like for you competing against
California schools who could have their athletes being compensated for
endorsement deals? I'm sure that you have some thoughts on that.  
SCOTT RUECK: I have thoughts, but they're incomplete thoughts. This is all so
new, to be honest. I have not had -- this was week one of practice. I've not
had time to educate myself on everything within it.  
  
I can tell you this, though. This is one of my first thoughts that I had just
when you're hearing pay to play or whatever that might entail. I have been a
part of this whole thing for 27 years now, college athletics. Most of those
years still were at the Division III level without scholarships. There is so
much power to the purity of that, of sport. Now here at Oregon State, where we
have been able to give scholarships, which lets me sleep easier at night as a
coach, knowing that they'll graduate without debt, gives me peace.  
  
There is so much power to that, it would be scary to me to see that be lost
somehow. Not saying that I know the answers to any of this, but I love what we
do. I love the results that they get from it. I love the cohesive locker room
that we have. There are so many benefits to that experience that I have
watched with my own eyes and their preparation for life beyond what we do that
this classroom -- if this classroom were to be changed in some way that would
impact that negatively, it would make me sad.  
  
All that to say, I don't have the answers. I don't know what the answers are.
It's an overwhelming issue to my brain right now with what I know. I don't
know what the solution could possibly be to make everyone happy. I just know
from my perspective, this is an incredible opportunity for all of us. It's an
incredible process to be a part of in the way that I've been blessed to be all
these years. I don't want that part to change.  
  
Q. Mik, what size 12s are your favorite this season?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: I know I have big feet. My hands and feet kept growing, but I
didn't.  
  
I'd say probably -- there's these Paul Georges that are white and orange that
are just the most comfortable shoe. You may have saw them last spring, but
those are still my favorites, just comfortable. They work for me. Colors are
good, too. Keep an eye out.

_San Francisco, California_  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: It's hard for me to believe this is my fifth year at Utah. I
swear it's like year two, it feels like. So it's exciting. This is our first
-- as a staff, kind of our first team that we recruited everybody, so there's
always kind of an awareness of that. And I think coming off of certainly a
year that ended not the way we thought it would, but definitely a year that
had a lot of positives and firsts and a lot of momentum in the right
direction, we're excited about the year.  
  
I know everyone has sat up here and said the same thing. Everyone is
undefeated and has all their goals and dreams ahead of them. So it's certainly
an exciting time. We're no different in that. I like our group a lot. It feels
like our culture is definitely in place. So now we just got to put it to work
and put our money where our mouth is a little bit this season.  
  
Q. Lynne, what kind of building blocks do you feel like you guys laid
last season to take into this season?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: I think for the first time since Utah has joined the Pac-12 --
I think on the women's basketball side, we had always kind of been on the
outside looking in. And that was something that I was determined to change and
still am determined to change, and I think we kind of got some legitimacy,
some national relevance. We were nationally ranked, and everything has just
kind of improved over the four years.  
  
Our recruiting has improved, our attendance is up 500 percent over the last
four years. Like everything is just getting better. And I think coming off of
last year, it ended not the way we envisioned, but there's so many -- it's so
tempting to not think of it as the year of what could have been, and we have
to switch that and kind of flip the coin and say the year of so many things
that were firsts, and that's the natural progression.  
  
In sports, we're impatient. Coaches are the most guilty of it. Players are,
sportswriters are, fans are. Everybody is impatient. You want it now, and I
think we just have to tap the brakes a little bit and realize that we have
every year gotten better, and this year I intend to build on those blocks and
get better even yet.  
  
Q. You graduate a ton of talent, and you 've got a lot of talent coming
back. Keys to the car go to Dru with Erika gone? Help us understand back court
and front court with noticeable absences but really good folks coming back.  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Yeah, I'm not ready to give the keys to the car out yet, but --
I'm kidding. Yes. I'm kidding.  
  
Yeah, so we did, we graduated Huffy, WNBA draft pick, you don't replace those
-- like I've said all day, it's not a zero sum game where somebody graduates
and you bring in a freshman and they get replaced. But we do have tremendous
freshmen. You don't replace a four-year starter at point guard, Erika Bean
with just one player. I think Dru will -- yes, she will get the keys to the
car and be a tremendous leader, point guard, all those things for us. But
we've got some young guys, too, that are going to be able to play and fill in
those holes, too.  
  
I do like our balance. I think we actually have this word I've heard about
that's called depth. We haven't had that. We actually have it. So I'm excited
about that. But yeah, so I think we did lose Huffy, we did lose Bean, we lost
a couple others, but so did everybody else in this league. Think how many
great seniors graduated and are still playing or whatever. We're no different
in that regard.  
  
Q. (Indiscernible) help us understand how huge that is.  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Yeah, so we're very fortunate to get Daneesha Provo back. Her
situation was little bit unique. She transferred from Clemson after her
freshman year. She was actually our first recruit at Utah, sat out that first
year, and then tore her ACL, I think, the last day in 2018 in December. And
she just had a unique situation where we were able to kind of get a waiver for
another extended clock, so she gets another year. And that will just be a
tremendous boost for us. How many times do you get an All-Conference player,
and she's not cleared to play yet. So we're not sure when she'll be back, but
it'll certainly be before conference play. And when we do get her -- she
averaged 14 points a game last year, just to get that, that will certainly
buoy our offense and defense when she does get back. So huge.  
  
And I think the silver lining of her not being back yet is we're going to be
forced to develop some of the young guys. They're going to get to play, get
their feet wet, and then you add Daneesha, that's a really nice luxury to
have.  
  
Q. What was your biggest takeaway from the program for you, and why did
you want to institute this sort of mindset on your Utes?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Thank you for the questions. For those of you that don't know,
we do this thing called the program. That's their name for it. And they're
kind of a bunch of ex-military guys that come into your program, and they take
over your team for a couple days and they get you -- they do things with your
players that you're unable to do in terms of get them of their comfort zone,
doing kind of military-style training. It's not as crazy as it sounds,
although there's a little bit of craziness to it.  
  
And it really exposes instantly who your leaders are, what things you need to
clean up, toughness -- physical toughness, mental toughness -- discipline, the
ability to listen, and do all the things in the -- they'll say in battle -- in
a game that you need to be able to do. So it's awesome.  
  
I think who I am as a coach, who Utah is as a sports program across the board,
it's kind of that blue collar, we're going to outwork you, which is -- with
them, it kind of resonates the same kind of thing with the program. But great
book, really cool program. We've enjoyed it. They're on year 3. They have no
idea what's coming for year 4. You just wait, Dru.  
  
DRU GYLTEN: I can't wait.  
  
Q. I 'd like to get your ladies' take on -- if you went through the
program, what it was like for you this year. And then also I was hoping you
could talk about Kemery Martin. And you talked about how attendance numbers
are up, what will having a local girl of that talent do to attendance numbers
in the future?  
DRU GYLTEN: Yeah, so we have done it now for three years. Each year brings
something different. Like she said, it kind of exposes you to your weaknesses
but also your strengths. So I feel like, even though it's not necessarily on
the basketball court, I know that we've focused a lot on leadership. So they
push you to be louder, command more from the freshmen, which will eventually
help on the floor. So it's kind of a unique experience to get yourself out of
your comfort zone and challenge yourself mentally and physically in a non-
basketball way.  
  
KIANA MOORE: Yeah, I think our newcomers did a great job, just embracing it
all, and Dru and I, we were kind of the leaders of the program while we were
doing it, and also Mo Corbin or Maurane Corbin. We call her Mo.  
  
But yeah, so we stepped up as leaders, and it really got us out of our comfort
zones when things got tough. Dru and I just kind of stuck our feet in the sand
and kept it moving.  
  
I think -- like I said, I think our newcomers did a great job with embracing
it all and taking all those new lessons, and I think it'll be incorporated
into our season this year.  
  
Q. Can you expand on anything in particular that kind of as a team got
everybody out of their comfort zone, like a certain drill or anything?  
DRU GYLTEN: Well, on our Saturday morning, we woke up pretty early, and Utah
elevation, so we got up and we hiked this -- I'd say a mile-long hike with
50-pound sandbags on our back.  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: They loved it.  
  
DRU GYLTEN: It was so fun. But I think it showed, like I mentioned before, our
strengths, mentally and physically. It's not something that you would choose
to hike up a hill with a 50-pound sandbag on your back, but not one time did
anyone complain, not one time did anyone question anybody, our coaches, the
leaders, the people of the program. I think from our previous years, it showed
that everyone has bought into what our coaches are expecting from us and what
Utah is as a program, the toughness and to buy into what we're trying to do
for this program.  
  
LYNNE ROBERTS: In terms of Kemery Martin, she's the five-star recruit we have
coming in -- or she's here now, as a freshman, and she's special. She's going
to be a great cornerstone of our program. She's incredibly talented. She's one
of those players that just kind of makes the game look easy. She does things
where you're like, wow, that was really hard and you make it look like a yawn
kind of. She's still a freshman, and there's a learning curve and all of that,
but just a tremendous talent that the Pac-12 is going to talk about for a long
time.  
  
And yeah, I do think it'll impact attendance. Since I've been at Utah, this is
our first local recruit. And I'm proud of that, and I'm proud that we're
getting Utah kids, and we're going to continue to recruit the kids that are
going to help us win games in the Pac-12 for sure.  
  
Q. Another freshman that will be able to help you right away, one of the
things you 've been able to do through your tenure at Utah is get freshmen
ready quickly, get them ready to play and not just stem the tide but to give
you something. Besides her, who you just mentioned, who else can we expect big
things from, and I don't mean superhuman stuff but just contributing?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Well, all three of our freshmen are going to contribute a lot.
So we have Kemery Martin mentioned Brynna Maxwell who was the Washington State
Player of the Year, one of the best shooters I've ever been around, just
incredible competitor, great player. She's going to play. And she will shoot
the ball in a way that I don't think we've had yet at Utah. She can keep
defenses on us.  
  
And then we have Lola Pendande who's a 6'4" Spanish kid who is legit. And
she's a big body, lefty, post, can rebound, can score, plays with passion,
big, strong kid. So all three of those guys are going to -- for us to be as
good as I hope we can be and think we will be, those three are going to have
to contribute quite a bit.  
  
Q. What was the recruiting trail like with Maxwell because everybody in
the state of Washington wanted her and the Oregons. You were in a dogfight.
How did that play out?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Yeah, it was a dogfight. But you know, I think this is not a
novel thought, but it really came down to relationships. My assistant, our
assistant, Danny Snelgrove, our recruiting coordinator, she identified Brynna
back in -- our first year at Utah. And we started having her call us every
other week or whatever when she was in ninth grade. So like we were the first
people to send her letters, we were the first people to -- and then she kind
of blew up. But we had already kind of needled our way in there and had our
hooks in her. But it came down to the wire, and it's competitive in the West
Coast, and the Pac-12 is where every great kid wants to play. So all the great
programs -- it was really competitive. Same thing with Kemery. But it came
down to the relationships we started when they were in ninth grade.  
  
Q. What do you think about where the experts are picking you as far as
the Pac-12?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: I don't really care. I think it's fair.  
  
Q. Why do you think it 's fair?  
LYNNE ROBERTS: Because we haven't done much more than that. We finished sixth
last year, which was the highest finish ever. But if there's 12 stories in the
building, I don't want to stop at six and be happy. You know, we've got to
keep climbing. But I don't really think one way or the other. I saw the poll
and just kind of was like, oh, cool, hmm. Onward.  
  
Q. How did you put the end of last year behind you, and how are you
building upon that going forward?  
DRU GYLTEN: Well, I think we can all agree on this, that it definitely wasn't
the way we wanted it to end just because it started off so well. But I think
it kind of came down to our seniors and the fact that they taught us to accept
what happened and learn from it. So definitely that last game against
Washington, we were all very emotional. We wanted so much more than what came
out. But if anything we learned from it.  
  
I think last year's season is kind of like -- like she said, we don't want to
just stop there, we want to do. And we learned from last year, and we've told
the upcoming people that we want more from everyone, and I think that's
something that we've really been striving for in this off-season is just
learning from last year, learning from the last couple months of the season
and really springboarding that into this season.  
  
KIANA MOORE: Yeah, just to touch on what Dru said, we had an exceptional year
last year. I mean, it's not the way we wanted it to end, and we didn't know
when it was going to end, also. And I think our seniors put upon Dru and I
that we are capable of leading this year's team, and I think what we really
took from last year is when adversity hits us, that we're able to strive and
keep going. And I think when adversity -- it's going to hit us this year, and
so I think when it hits us this year that we're going to be able to tell the
freshmen, like it's okay, we're going to get through it.  
  
And I think that's what Dru and I took a lot from from last year was when we
hit adversity, that it'll be okay, we can push through it.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 7, 2019

  

### [JR Payne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32001)

### [Mya Hollingshed](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34732)

### [Quinessa Caylao-Do](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38085)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
JR PAYNE: First, I'd just like to say how excited we are to be here at Pac-12
media day, and we're just thrilled to get the day going. About the University
of Colorado women's basketball team, I'm really excited about where we are
right now, but the cool thing is that I'm really even more excited about who
we are right now. Our team faced a lot of adversity last year and just a ton
of injuries and different things throughout the season, but I think that's
been an incredible motivator for our team throughout the summer.  
  
A large portion of our team spent the entire summer in Boulder training and
really getting ready. So we feel very prepared and truly excited for the
upcoming season.  
  
Q. (Inaudible - question regarding Kennedy Leonard)  
JR PAYNE: She is officially gone, but the good thing is she's officially a
fantastic pro now in Germany.  
  
Q. Let 's talk about life after Kennedy. Obviously you mentioned that
you had to go through a big chunk of last year without her and a lot of your
young kids stepped up. What's the identity of this team when so much of it was
on her shoulders? How do you move forward without her?  
JR PAYNE: Yeah, well, I'm the type of person that is always looking for the
blessing in the storm, so while we wanted Kennedy to be healthy and would have
been a more experienced ballclub with her in the lineup last year, the
blessing is that we had an incredible opportunity for a lot of young players
to step up and play key contributing minutes that simply just wouldn't have
been available without that injury. But there were times throughout last
season due to several injuries that actually these two on stage really carried
us offensively, defensively, from a leadership standpoint. And so the great
thing is that we actually do have a lot of experience even through the
struggle of injuries last season.  
  
Q. Quinessa and Mya, do you take a look at the preseason polls? Being
picked to finish 12th, do you take that as motivation?  
QUINESSA CAYLAO-DO: I think it's exciting. I think it's really motivating for
the team, especially for the younger players and the culture that we have
created. I think it will upset a lot of people, and we're looking forward to
being good this season.  
  
MYA HOLLINGSHED: Going off what she said, I totally agree with that, but also
we're really focus on just making each other better every day, so we're really
not focused on what everybody else is talking about. So we're really just
getting in the gym every day and just working hard to be a better ballclub
every day.  
  
Q. Quinessa, since you 're the only senior on the team, now the de facto
leader, what has it been like taking on that leadership role and what do you
expect from yourself as a leader?  
QUINESSA CAYLAO-DO: I think it's been a good experiences. I think it allows me
to step up. I feel like -- even last year, I was the only person in my class,
so I feel like it's just a good opportunity, especially for me having
experience and being able to help the younger players too, and giving them
knowledge too. And I think just everyone is being able to step up some. I'm
just not the only person that's going to be a leader on the team.  
  
Q. Q, what did you work on this summer to improve your game?  
QUINESSA CAYLAO-DO: For sure the weight room and my outside game. So just
shooting threes and my pull-ups, so just shooting more.  
  
MYA HOLLINGSHED: Everything really, everything -- the part of my game needs to
get better, so weight room, outside, inside, making moves off the bounce,
moving off the ball, everything.  
  
Q. Who 's the strongest player on your team in the weight room?  
MYA HOLLINGSHED: It's between like three people.  
  
JR PAYNE: But before we go there, let's say we have this thing that is a big
deal for us in the weight room. We want everyone on our team to be in the
plate club, the plates meaning the 45s, and you've got to be able to bench
plates. That's a big deal for us, we print T-shirts and all that stuff. When
we first got to Colorado, we might have had two players in the plate club. It
wasn't as big a priority. I think now we only have one or two that are not in
the plate club, so we've actually gotten a lot stronger, but as far as who's
the strongest.  
  
QUINESSA CAYLAO-DO: Annika Jank, she's a freshman, but she came in really
strong. She works out with football players.  
  
MYA HOLLINGSHED: And then Peanut and Kai.  
  
JR PAYNE: We've got a lot of really strong kids.  
  
MYA HOLLINGSHED: There's too many people.  
  
Q. Coach, what excites you most about this team heading into the 2019-20
season?  
JR PAYNE: I'm in love with my team. I mean, we have an incredible group.
That's why I said I'm excited about who we are. We're a group that is very --
like Mya kind of said, really dedicated to each other right now. So we're at a
place where we have great accountability within our team. People are pushing
each other really to be the very best that they can be. We're challenging each
other, and we've just got tremendous energy. And sometimes youth is not a bad
thing. Sometimes youth sort of gives you that youthful energy to keep going
and really try to get better every day.  
  
Q. Coach, what are some of the messages? You mentioned the energy, you
mentioned accountability, you mentioned kids in the weight room, the locker
room. On the floor, what are some of the things that have to change to get you
guys -- it 's muscle memory when you lose, sometimes it's muscle memory when
you win.  
JR PAYNE: Sure.  
  
Q. How do you change some of those close losses? What has to change to
get them into the win column?  
JR PAYNE: Yeah, one thing I'm really going to like about this team is that
we'll have a little bit more spread-out as far as productivity. We need to be
better defensively this year. We really struggled to get stops when we needed
to consistently. So that's an area that, as a group, we're paying a lot of
attention to from the coaching staff.  
  
And then the other thing that's really important that we're continuing to try
to instill and really getting our team to understand is discipline is
unbelievably important for this group. When you've had some real play makers
in Leonard and Robinson, there were times when it kind of is like give the
ball to Lexie and just let her go to work. And she could do that. That was
sort of her makeup. And same with Ken.  
  
But with this group, we have the potential to have a lot of great scoring
options on the floor at different times. But in order to really establish
that, we've got to be disciplined in what we do.  
  
Q. Since you 're studying communications, the Pac-12 media day
experience, what's that like from your perspective, some of the things you
study in class that you may want to apply to real life?  
QUINESSA CAYLAO-DO: It's kind of interesting. It kind of reminds me of like my
public speaking class, and just practicing interviews, so I just took a class
last semester, so it was like professional and calm. So it's just like how do
you answer questions, how do you handshake people? So I feel like it's just
like applying to media day today.  
  
Q. Do you get home very much?  
QUINESSA CAYLAO-DO: Not too often, but my family comes to like all the games.
Like my mom tries to come to every game that I have. I get to see her more
often, so I feel like I am at home.  
  
Q. Tacoma to Boulder is kind of a hard commute. That is impressive. What
is it about having your family close that makes your Boulder experience even
better?  
QUINESSA CAYLAO-DO: I feel like it's really cool, but I think that my
teammates too and the coaches, they really help me feel like they're a family,
too, so it's kind of like I have my second family with me all the time. And
then I talk to my mom all the time and like my little brothers. So especially
when they come, it's just really exciting having them all home.  
  
Q. I 'm just curious, you guys play at the highest elevation of any team
in the Pac-12. Do you actually notice when you play teams that that's a real
advantage for you when other teams come into your building?  
JR PAYNE: Yeah, there's places all throughout the building where it reminds
you that you are at 5,345 feet. It's scripted everywhere. Do you want to speak
to that?  
  
MYA HOLLINGSHED: Yes and no. Like sometimes when we play teams, like they'll
keep up. I'm like, y'all aren't tired yet? Sometimes it hits them. They have
like the little tanks on their benches just in case anybody passes out or they
can't handle the elevation. They have it all set up. We're good on our end,
but it's really cool to see other teams --  
  
QUINESSA CAYLAO-DO: Yeah, I think it's good going to other places, like going
away from us. So if we're in Washington or something, we're at sea level, so I
feel like we breathe a lot easier out there.  
  
MYA HOLLINGSHED: Running for days.  
  
Q. Looking from a national perspective, do you see where Sabrina coming
into this year has kind of become the face of women 's college basketball and
potentially even the face of college basketball with the name recognition for
coming into this season?  
JR PAYNE: Oh, yeah, certainly. Any time you can name an athlete and everybody
knows who you're talking about with just their first name, it's a pretty big
deal. You talk about Kobe, you talk about Sabrina. So I think it's remarkable
to have a woman of that caliber in our conference. And then for us to be able
to play against someone like that, and I love that Sabrina celebrates all of
the other great teams in our league. She's a great ambassador for our sport.  
  
Q. I know you love music. What do you have in your Beatz or your iPhone?
What gets you going before a game or practice?  
MYA HOLLINGSHED: Really everything, but I play it all. We just put it on the
speaker and we just dance to anything. A lot of people don't know, but I like
country music a little bit, so I'll play a little bit of that, but not all the
time. It's just a little dabble.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 7, 2019

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Satou Sabally](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34731)

### [Sabrina Ionescu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32677)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, we're honored to be here, and really excited to have both
Sabrina and Satou with me as well. For some of you, maybe you didn't know, but
Ruthy Hebard is on her way to Dubai with Team USA in a 3-on-3 tournament.  
  
But anyway, you guys were -- I think a lot has been said about this team. All
I know is that we are excited. We've been playing hard and practicing hard,
and we're, I think, ready for whatever this season is going to throw at us.  
  
Q. How long do you feel like it took you to get over the Final Four
loss?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I don't think I'll ever get over it, if you want me to be
honest. Obviously now our attention is elsewhere, and we're not really
focusing too much on the past and we're focusing on the future. But I mean, I
don't think we're ever going to get over that loss, but definitely learning a
lot from that game and what we need to do and what we need to improve on.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: Yeah, I feel like that loss is driving us now to do better this
year and just taking that experience from that loss and those emotions, like
using that more as a motivator rather than being like, oh, we played so bad,
oh, we lost this game, more than, hey, we're going to win this next game.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Honestly, I think I'm a little bit different than our student-
athletes in that as a coach, you're always trying to -- it hurts in the
moment, but we're always turning the page to what's next. And certainly it was
this season, and there's always the recruiting component and everything else
that we're doing.  
  
You know, we had such a great season and really had a chance in that semifinal
game. We just missed some shots that were a little out of character for us.
But we were pretty close, and I think it's made everybody hungry, and it
certainly has me as a coach. It inspired me to work harder in the off-season.  
  
Q. What did you work harder on in the off-season? And what did you need
-- in your estimation you said that game exposed some things we needed to work
on. Sabrina, what are some of those things you needed to work on, and how did
you work harder and what did you do harder in the off-season?  
KELLY GRAVES: I'm walking more steps every day to keep my head clear so I can
coach better.  
  
I think secondly, I've kind of dissected it and looked at why we made the
mistakes that we did, and I think just the fact that we're going to be deeper
this year is going to help. I thought that that just really hurt us last year.
Let's say an injury like Taylor Chavez. Even if she gives Sabrina and Maite
two minutes' rest in each half, maybe we don't finish 1 for 13, we've got a
few more legs. Because the shots we got were really good. I think secondly
I've really turned my attention to the defensive end of the court. And we're
so efficient offensively, by far the most efficient offense in the country and
the best shooting team in the country, but we're only adequate defensively. So
we need to make some better inroads, and I know gaining someone like Minyon
Moore really helps in that regard.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: That's what I was going to say, defensively. I think we've
learned a lot from that game, and us guards have to do better at just keeping
our players in front of us and our posts have to just get more aggressive on
the blocks. So I think on the defensive end, that's where we're going to be
taking huge steps this year.  
  
And then offensively, it wasn't easy with not a lot of depth last year, but I
mean, we have to push through that. And so just this off-season, getting my
shot better and all of us have been shooting the ball really well and working
on different ways to score around the basket and on the perimeter.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: I'll go one step further here. Like I said, we had the best true
shooting percentage in the nation, points per possession, best turnover rate,
on and on and on. But I think our offense is going to be even more dynamic. I
think we're trying to stay ahead of everybody else in that regard. So we want
to play even faster and share the ball even more.  
  
Q. Kelly, as you look ahead at the schedule, what do you see as some of
the more challenging parts? I 'm looking at your schedule between January 25th
and February 24th. You have eight games on the road and two at home. How do
you prepare yourself, and for the athletes, as well, for a stretch like
that?  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, well, good question. That really concerns me, and I don't
know what the answer is. There's only four teams in the conference this year
that play four games in a row on the road during conference play, and we do it
-- and those teams do it once. We have to do it twice, so we have two four-
game conference road trips, and that's going to be difficult to manage, I
think, especially the back-to-back trips to the California schools in February
late in the season.  
  
But we're not going to make excuses. I mean, that's the schedule we got. It's
not ideal, but we're going to make the most of it, and I think if any team can
handle it, it's this group. We have experienced veterans who have been around
the block and won at a high level, and I think that's been one of our
strengths as a program. We don't make excuses, we'll do whatever we have to
do.  
  
But yeah, that's not ideal. And quite frankly, our non-league schedule, we
were as aggressive as any team in the country having to go to UConn, to
Syracuse. We play Louisville and Oklahoma State on neutral sites, and then we
host Kansas State and then South Dakota State, the team we beat in the Sweet
16 this year at home.  
  
So it's aggressive, and then you get into Pac-12 play, it's the best this
league has ever been since I've been coaching in the northwest. I don't think
it's ever been deeper or ever been better at the top.  
  
Q. Sabrina and Kelly, the Play For Pay law from California has been in
the news here the last few weeks. How do you feel like a law, if that ever
comes to fruition, would affect players like you?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, I haven't thought too much about it just because I'm
just so busy with basketball. But I mean, I hope whatever they decide to do, I
hope everything is in the best interest of the student-athletes. And in that
regard, I know it's just been passed in California and a couple other states,
but hopefully we continue to figure out what's going to be best for the
student-athletes.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: I thought she said it perfectly. Same here. I think whatever we
can do to help the student-athlete experience, I think, is important. However,
I am one who believes that there is value in a scholarship. I mean, that is
real money. I remember doing the math one time somewhere, I can't remember
what it was, if you divide the amount of the scholarship -- and that doesn't
include all the perks that you get as a student-athlete - and you divide that
into the total number of hours we're allowed to work our student-athletes out,
they're still making well over $100 an hour to be basketball players. That's
real money, and that's the best part-time job they're ever going to have.  
  
But at the same time, I do see it on the horizon, and I would support that. I
truly do believe that they work really hard, and there's value in sharing some
of that for them.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you 've already accomplished so much and maybe it's
different from when you were a freshman coming in. What's driving you
personally this season?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, just it being my last season and to help this team.
They've given so much to me, and that's ultimately why I came back for my
senior year is because of the people that are around me and that sacrificed so
much for me. So coming back, just super excited to get back with the team and
continue to be the best role model, the best basketball player, the best
person that I can is ultimately what drives me.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you already kind of touched on what I was about to ask you,
but can you talk a little bit more about what went into your decision process?
You could have gone to the WNBA, been a top 3, top 4 pick, maybe the No. 1
pick. Talk about that decision process of coming back for your senior year?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, it wasn't easy just because I had a few hours after my
game to decide what I was going to do. So I just sat down and kind of wrote
down the pros and cons to both decisions and tried to make the best decision
for myself. I mean, I did make the best decision. I'm really happy that I
stayed and didn't really jump into going pro so soon. And so obviously wanting
to play along Satou and some of the great players that we have returning and
obviously some of the new players that we have coming in, and just spending my
last year with our coaching staff and those people that believed in me when I
was in high school is what I wanted.  
  
Q. For both players, what is the difference between being early in your
careers kind of an up-and-coming team and then being a favorite, being
somebody that people talk about for a title or whatever? How does it change
your mentality? How does it change your preparation? Does it change
anything?  
SABRINA IONESCU: For me personally, it doesn't change anything at all. I mean,
every day that I step foot on the practice court, in the gym, I try and be the
best basketball player that I can, regardless of if we're a 10 seed, if we're
a 1 seed, whatever seed we are. Obviously outside expectations are different
on us this year. Seeding is different. All that stuff, all that outside noise
is different.  
  
But for us internally and for our program, I think we all view each other the
same, and our goal is the same. We're going to come in and be the hardest-
working team. I think if we come in with that mindset individually, that helps
us collectively, and we're starting off really strong. Practices have been the
best they've ever been in my three years at Oregon, so I'm excited to see
where we continue to grow.  
  
SATOU SABALLY: Yeah, I'm actually feeling more confident than before because
now I really know what I'm playing for. I've mentioned that earlier on to
Sabrina. Like in my freshman year, I was still trying to figure out what
exactly I was playing for, like especially from coming overseas. I did not
really know what an NCAA Tournament is like. Just experiencing that the first
time was really tough and losing in the Elite 8 was really tough. But now I
really feel confident, okay, I know what this is about, we've been practicing
really hard, and it's been a lot of fun. So yeah, just really motivated.  
  
Q. Coach, quick question for you and for Satou. You mentioned Minyon
Moore. If you can help us understand how quickly she 's picking things up, et
cetera, and when you lose Maite, you lose an awful lot. You had stressed our
best player is Maite, with all due respect to the women up there with you. How
Moore is helping you. And Satou, when your sister goes down again, injury is
already a factor. Are you playing for your sister now more than anything else,
and is it rude of me to ask if perhaps that brings you back next year so you
can at least get -- will that at least be something you think about after this
season so you might get to play one year with her at least?  
SATOU SABALLY: I mean, I'm not trying to think of next year. Obviously I
really want to play with my sister. I know she's going to be back, and I'm
really proud of her for how she's handled the situation because it is really
tough. I don't know a lot of people that have handled the situation that
mature as she has. But yeah, like obviously I'm sad about it, and I'm
definitely playing for her this season.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: Yeah, there's no doubt we're going to miss Maite. She was a rock
for us, four-year starter at the hardest position. What she did is she took a
lot of pressure off Sabrina as a primary ball handler so Sabrina could play
more off the ball and make more happen in the half court. We're going to miss
her, there's no question about it.  
  
But I think Minyon is going to be stellar there. She gives us a whole
different kind of attitude, especially on the defensive end. You know, she
knows what we're about. She's competed against us for three years and she
knows what our program is like. What she has to do is she's got to -- the one
thing I think you can say about the Ducks is we play under control. And she's
got to continue to do that, and she will because she's a very bright young
woman and a very bright player. I think her and Sabrina played club ball
together, so they have a lifelong relationship. And I think that really helps.
I think Minyon really looks up to Sabrina, and I think that's mutual, so you
can see that there's already synergy on the court.  
  
But I'll tell you what, she talks. We spend, I don't know, as coaches,
forever, trying to get our teams to talk, talk, talk on the court. Well, that
comes natural to Minyon. She is a talker, and I think it is becoming
infectious with the rest of the team. She is a great teammate. When Nyara
hurt, the first person that reached out in the group text was Minyon, and she
wasn't even in Eugene yet. You know, that's just kind of who she is, and I
think this gives her a chance to really showcase her game.  
  
We're going to be a very visible team, and I think this is good for her, and I
think she's got a bright pro future, as well.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you mentioned you had just a few hours to make this decision
if you were coming back, going pro. What were those hours like for you? That
's such a big life decision. Did you feel rushed? Were you nervous? What were
those moments like?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, honestly, I procrastinate a lot, so I waited until
like the last 30 minutes to really decide.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: You remember she showed up on campus in June, right?  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, similar to my college decision. And so I was pretty
calm. I mean, obviously when it was crunch time and I had to make a decision,
I started to get a little nervous and anxious and kind of was doubting which
decision was right for me. I was getting a lot of phone calls and texts from
people back home, family asking what I had decided and people kind of wanting
to have their input on my decision.  
  
But I went on a walk -- I was in Tampa and I kind of went on a walk. And my
twin brother had met me, and I just knew -- I was like, there's no way that I
can call him or my team and tell them that I'm going to be leaving. It just
didn't feel right. So at that moment, I just knew that it's meant for me to
stay for my last year. And so I called him and he put me on speaker with his
entire family and could hear them all yelling, and then obviously told my
team, and they were super excited. And it was just like kind of a sigh of
relief after that, and I was just ready to get back to work.  
  
Q. Kelly, I was just wondering if you could elaborate on what you 're
saying about the strength at the top of the conference and also that middle
tier, what kind of gap there might be. Is that changing at all as far as some
of the other teams?  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, yeah, I think 1 through 12, I truly believe that. I think
Arizona was in the 8-9 game last year in our Pac-12 tournament and they win
the postseason WNIT. That's incredible. I think this season it's going to be
that same kind of depth.  
  
You know, I don't think it matters who you're playing where. You'd better
bring it or you're going to be in trouble. Then the teams at the top, I think
we have four teams projected in the top ten. I don't know if that's ever
happened, and it usually doesn't happen with any conference.  
  
So I think that's really, really unique, and we truly have, I think, four --
not only Final Four contenders, but I think contenders for National
Championships. I truly believe we'll be in that discussion, and it's deserved.  
  
I think we'll -- it's going to be -- I don't see anybody going 18-0 in
conference. I think we're going to beat each other up like we always seem to
do, and I think that battle tests us for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
I do know this, that when we get to the NCAA -- and Sabrina has won 10 games
in the NCAA Tournament in her three years at Oregon -- I know we're ready.
We've seen it all in conference play. We've played against the best, and so
what we see in the NCAA sometimes is actually easier than what we're playing
against in conference.  
  
Great coaches -- I mean, I look at Tara. My goodness, she's a Hall of Fame
coach and she has nine McDonald's All-Americans. Nine. That is a loaded
basketball team. I think they are the team -- I think we're getting some of
that attention, but that's a team, Stanford, that you'd better watch out for.
I know we're -- they're going to be tough, two great games for us, both on
national TV, which is, I think, a great showcase, two great programs and a
great conference.  
  
The middle tier, I don't know. You tell me who the middle tier is going to be.
I have no idea. You know, I have no idea. I think anybody could step up there.
We have a lot of new faces in the conference, some great coaches, and so we'll
let it all play out.  
  
Q. What was your reaction when Sabrina was coming back? And what was
going through your mind during that whole thing? It completely changes your
team whether she 's there or whether she's not, and just sharing it with your
family on the speaker phone.  
KELLY GRAVES: Well, when she talked about it, it was my family -- it's our
family. My three sons are like Sabrina's brothers. We -- and I know they
consider Sabrina family. I'd had -- honestly I thought the whole time, I felt
positive about the fact she was going to come back. I think she put a little
pressure on herself and us when she used the term unfinished business. I love
that. I think that's great, and that's what Sabrina is. She's out there. I
mean, she's a humble player, but she's very confident, and I think that was
great.  
  
But we were at home. I had gone home Saturday after we lost on Friday, and a
lot of the players -- most of the team actually stayed in Tampa with their
families. So I did not have contact with Sabrina for more than a day. And so
you just never know who's in her ear and helping her make this decision and
what happens because I wasn't there.  
  
But she really made our day when she had called us beforehand. Even though
right before she had called it kind of broke on Twitter that she was going
pro. Somebody made a false statement, they made an error, and we had seen that
first, and then Sabrina called us and --  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, that was scary.  
  
KELLY GRAVES: I think it was great, and personally, I think it was a great
decision for her. Obviously I told her that I would support and love her, and
she can attest to this, whatever she decides to do. She is always family to
us.  
  
But Sabrina, like she'd said, the unfinished business. But you guys, Sabrina
has a chance to do some things that have never been done in college
basketball, ever, by men's basketball players or women's basketball players.
She's on pace to become a 2,000 points, 1,000 rebounds, 1,000 assists players.
That's never been done, ever. I know she is -- that's not what she's about,
but she has a chance to really be the face of college basketball, and I don't
think just women's basketball. When you say the name Sabrina, casual men's
basketball fans know who you're talking about. Unless there's another Zion
coming down the pike here, and I don't think there is, I think Sabrina really
becomes the face of the college game. And I'm really proud of her because
there is nobody that can handle that better than she can. She handles
everything with grace and poise, and when I travel around with her, you guys,
it's like I'm with a rock star.  
  
And with Satou, too, and with Ruthy and the whole team. We're at the Wooden
awards post-game party, or the post-show party, and there's Kareem and Karl
Malone and Dr. J and Jerry West. And I go up and introduce myself, I'm Kelly
Graves, and they look and whatever. And they say, I'm Sabrina's coach. Coach,
great to meet you, I love Sabrina, I've seen your team play many times.  
  
So I'm now going around saying I'm Sabrina's coach and that's how I get street
cred. But I'm really proud of her and how she's handled everything and there's
not a day that goes by that she probably doesn't get half a dozen requests for
an autograph during the day or a picture or whatever, and I've just never seen
her act anything but love to do it.

_San Francisco, California_  
  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: Well, thank you for being here. I'm thrilled to be here again,
year two. It's again an exciting time to be a part of the Pac-12. And to get
to be a part of a media day that is done just at this kind of level and this
kind of professionalism and a lot of fun, and just it's such a neat experience
to be able to be here and be sharing it with these guys. So thank you for
that.  
  
Again, year two, I think the big thing that I would tell you is the biggest
issue would be I'm glad year one is over. It was -- I think the thing that I
learned the most about -- I knew the league pretty well. I think you can do
that really well. The thing that was the most difficult for us was just
learning your own team in the midst of a season. We went through some things
that I didn't expect from the team a year ago, and that's what happens.  
  
What you don't know, you don't know. And now a year later, I just feel like I
know this group better. We're built a little bit better. We have a little bit
more depth in our program now, and having been the way we want to play and our
system for a year, I think these two are now in a position to really flourish
and be great leaders for us. So excited to be here, excited to be representing
Washington State and excited to be the coach for these two players.  
  
Q. Bobi, do you have your doctorate yet?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: (Shaking head.)  
  
Q. Can you talk about your decision to come back and play another
year?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: Definitely. It wasn't the hardest decision, but looking at
the years back, this team, this school has never been to the NCAA Tournament
for a long time, and this is something I wanted to be part of. I wanted to do
something special with this team and this coaching staff. And I was thinking
-- and I think they as a coaching staff can make me better. And being with
this team together, I think we can build something into something special this
year, so I wanted to be part of it and leave something behind me when I leave,
because I've got one last chance in this.  
  
Q. Bobi, first of all, I love the fact that you have your knee pads on.
That 's amazing. You're ready to ball right now, aren't you?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: I'm ready.  
  
Q. You 've got a 3-on-3 game outside somewhere?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: Yeah.  
  
Q. I see you up here and speaking so well, and you seem so comfortable
and confident. And I think back to when you were a freshman and how shy you
were. From your own perspective, how have you grown as a player, as a person,
just as a confident human?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: I think I've grown so much. I still at times feel really
uncomfortable. It's not my strength talking in public. But it's just something
I have to do, and I think I've grown a lot throughout the years. It's my fifth
year, which is -- yeah, surprising, but yeah, I feel more confident. It's just
-- yeah.  
  
Q. Chanelle, coming off such a great season, kind of dovetailing on some
of the questions that Cindy asked other players before you, what you worked on
this summer. As good as you are, there 's parts of you that seems like it's
just scratching the surface. What are some of the things that aren't so
obvious to us that you have been working on that you know is going to make you
that kind of guard?  
CHANELLE MOLINA: Leadership. My leadership ability and my ability to impact
those around me. I had a meeting with Coach last week talking about being that
leader, being that person that people will run through a wall for. Just like
how I'd run through a wall for Coach. So I want them to respect me.  
  
And just bringing positive energy to practice. I feel like that's so important
because it makes -- especially the freshmen coming in. It makes them
comfortable. Like they don't have to think about getting yelled at in
practice. We were talking about bad cop, good cop. Coach is a bad cop and us
leaders are the good cops, so we'll be encouraging them, like I see you right
back, saying things like that to help boost their confidence?  
  
Q. What did you need to work on?  
CHANELLE MOLINA: Well, as a senior, I feel like I need to be that for my team.
And if I want to take this program to new heights, that's exactly what I need
to do, be in that role.  
  
Q. Coach, I saw some amazing highlights of you before you got inducted
at UT, which was a great honor with your great career. From the players, did
you see the highlights and what did you think about Coach back in the day and
what a baller she was?  
CHANELLE MOLINA: That highlight with her passing, I don't know how you did it,
passing behind your back.  
  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: That was impressive, yeah.  
  
CHANELLE MOLINA: You see things on the court and to be coached by a player
that played like that, that's amazing. I'm glad to be coached by her because I
have so much more to learn, not just as a basketball player but as a person in
general. She knows things about me that no one else does, and I'm excited for
this team, and I'm excited to be coached by them, by Jason, the new coach
who's coming in. I'm super excited, and I'm just going to -- we're going to
play, we're going to give it all we got our senior year and see what happens
from there, but we're going to keep competing.  
  
Q. Coach, with some international flavor coming again for you guys this
year, you kind of -- this program just hangs a hat on that, and you get kids
from abroad that can help you right away. How will they complement the depth
that you have, especially with Bobi coming back in a really strong
backcourt?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: You're right. We obviously had to improve our inside game. We
signed two 6'3", 6'4" players, two players that I think we can really --
they're young. They'll have some mistakes in Bella and Emma, an Australian,
and a player that is from Post Falls, Idaho, but came from Rwanda, Africa.
Again, at least we have the body size, the athleticism, the presence, and two
players that will bang a little and rebound and give us a little bit more
depth in the post.  
  
Bobi gets to move back to more of a natural position as a wing player.
Obviously I think our younger players had great summers and spring and this
fall, and being able to surround -- to be great role players with two players
like this.  
  
So we're just in a better spot, I think, around these two. And I think these
two and how they've committed to becoming better players, better leaders,
better teammates, better competitors, those were things that we put on their
plate a little bit this summer, and they're going to do their part. And I
think they're going to inspire and bring everybody else to another level, and
I think they're going to leave this place a lot better -- they're going to
leave Washington State in a lot better situation than they've ever been
before.  
  
Q. Kamie, I know you said you felt like you knew the league when you got
here, but I 'm curious what you didn't know about the league that you got from
experiencing it, and what a coach needs to coach their team to do to be
competitive in the Pac-12?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: I say this jokingly, but I say I have loved every day of my
job except game day. You know, every game day was a little rough this past
year.  
  
But you know, that's just it. The nature -- you're playing at the highest
level, and it doesn't matter who you're playing in this league, there are
fantastic coaches, established coaches that have their culture built. They've
recruited for years and years. They have depth. They build their program and
their team to be able to play and withstand any kind of system and any kind of
-- they can play physical if they need to. They can stretch it out and be more
finesse and run. You've got all different styles of play in this league.  
  
I think going through it helps. It gives us a better indication of what we
need to do and how we need to prepare and be better prepared as we go into it.
But it was no surprise, and it is no surprise, to walk out and play against
these kinds of coaches and established programs that really will put their
great team on the floor every single night.  
  
You know, we just have to learn to match it. We have to learn to walk into any
environment and be able to compete with the very best, and that's what you're
going to face every night in the Pac-12.  
  
Q. Coach, how do you maintain patience when you know you 're building
your own program and you speak of your culture that you're building with these
great seniors and some of your own veterans coming back? How do you stay
patient, and yet in the same breath, you want nothing more than to have a
great year for these two kids and the other seniors because you know the
window is closing. How do you balance the patience and wanting to, darn it,
get it done right now?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: I'm not very patient, am I? I would have you come speak to my
team. And we talk about that a lot, every single day or many days and when we
start and end practice about the need for all of us to want to bring our best
every single day and have an urgency in practice and in every opportunity that
we have to be better and become better because, like you said, their window is
closing. They need those two freshman posts to be unbelievably good for us to
have any kind of chance this year. So we have to depend on those young players
to really grow up early, and we have to bring them along.  
  
But again, we have to be patient to a degree, but I am not. For these people,
I am not. We want this to be the best year that they've ever had, and we want
to make sure that they become the very best players they can be so that
they're well prepared for what they want to do when they leave our program.  
  
Q. About a month before the season, how would you characterize your team
right now?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: Well, I really feel like we're in a great spot. I can't tell
you -- probably last spring we had a little bit of a situation that really
brought us together, and we had a great summer in training. And like I said, I
think we're built to be more competitive this year, built in the sense of I
think we're going to shoot the ball a little bit better than we did a year
ago. Obviously, we have a great point guard and someone that can really be of
the level and that's a great place to start.  
  
We'll be young in the post, but I think we have more bodies and more fouls and
more answers for the people that we're going to go against, more athleticism
to be able to guard better and rebound better. And you know, again, I think we
just have to learn -- and our system is just further along where we have to
learn how to space the floor so that our play makers can make plays. And I
think Bobi is going to have a lot more room to operate now, being on the
perimeter, and so we've just got to be our best at making sure we get our best
players in the best spots on the floor.  
  
And again, what we were doing a year ago at this time is like -- I tried to
say we were just eating baby food, and now at least we're starting to eat meat
maybe. We're not doing things that we were doing a year ago, and it makes us
be able to get ready for what we're going to face, which is an unbelievably
difficult schedule. But like I said, something that we hope will prepare us
for the Pac-12 and what we might face there.  
  
Q. Is that the reasoning behind the non-conference tournament
scheduling?  
KAMIE ETHRIDGE: I lost my mind a tiny bit in scheduling. You know, we were in
home and homes with some great programs that are close to us, Boise and
Gonzaga and then BYU got on our schedule, so that in and of itself was enough.
We went to the Virgin Islands without knowing the schedule, and so quite
surprised when it was Baylor, South Carolina, and Indiana. I might be on the
beach or on a Jet ski going the other way during the game, I don't know. And,
Miami, we obviously knew what we were getting at Miami.  
  
So it's unbelievably hard, but I'm also -- it's where we want to go, and it's
probably a little bit ambitious. But the bottom line is we need to play those
people, and we need to prepare ourselves for just those types of teams that
we're going to face in the Pac-12. And we'll be obviously very ready for that
kind of competition having played these people. It is what it is this year.
We're going to attack it and be excited to play it and see how we stand and
then be very ready for Pac-12 to start.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 7, 2019

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Michaela Onyenwere](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=37106)

### [Japreece Dean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30409)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
CORI CLOSE: Well, good afternoon -- is it good afternoon, good morning,
something like that.  
  
But just thank you all for being here. We are really excited about this
incredible conference and the chance to tell the stories of the amazing young
women in this conference, so thank you all for your participation and
enthusiasm in growing our game and showcasing these amazing young women.  
  
We are very excited about the upcoming season. We really -- I really love
these young ladies and their passion for the game. Our team is going to be
versatile. We will continue to be up tempo. I love the way we're shooting the
basketball, waiting for them to guard somebody, but a work in progress.  
  
But really like the pieces that we have in place with our basketball team, and
really excited about the Pac-12 season ahead.  
  
Q. Japreece, I remember the video from last year when you knew you were
going to get to come back, and you 're back for your fifth season. What's your
anticipation level for in year?  
JAPREECE DEAN: Well, on that topic, I really want to thank everyone who was
involved in helping me get that year back. That was a great feeling, and I was
super excited. Just really the anticipation of this season, I'm super excited,
super excited about the freshmen and our returners. And I'm excited about what
we're going to do this year. I know we have high expectations. I'm just super
excited to play again, so excited would probably be my word, excited.
(Laughter).  
  
Q. I just asked Larry just a little bit on this Fair Pay to Play. How
much do you think that could affect the women 's game? He expressed major
concerns, and I know we're still a few years off from this, but it's sort of a
big deal for California. You're a big California institution. Thoughts on
that, and does it blur the lines for pro sports?  
CORI CLOSE: You know, I'm a huge advocate for student-athletes and
opportunity, and I'm a huge believer in what happens in the lives of young
women as a result of being involved in college sports and amateur sports,
quite frankly. So I think to be honest with you, I have some more to learn. We
actually had a good meeting this morning about it, and I'm learning and
educating myself on our campus. It's such a delicate line, right? You want
players to have opportunities and you never want to limit opportunities, but
you also don't want unintended consequences to maybe trickle down to how it
could affect women's opportunities and how it could play out in recruiting
circles. And is this good intention to try to reward image and likeness really
going to play out to reward that, or will there be some other things that are
taken away that are unintended? And I think that's sort of my caution.  
  
But I don't think I'm educated enough yet to really play -- to do a side, but
I think it's a complicated issue that we need to think carefully about, and we
need to not get sucked up into the momentum of public opinion. But at the same
time, listen well, consider well, research well. And my job is always to look
out for women's -- and especially women's basketball -- but women in sport in
general.  
  
Q. Quick question regarding your incoming class. You 've got some
wonderful veterans returning, and yet another great incoming class, whether
it's the transfer in Natalie and some of your four or five-star kids. Help us
understand how quickly they can help.  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I'm really thankful for the newcomers to our program. You
know, I think that we've really needed some size, and I think Brynn Masikewich
has been a huge addition to us already. She's getting healthy a little bit
right now, but she has already made a huge impact on our program, and I think
that was maybe the biggest surprise I didn't know. It was really fun to be
over in Thailand coaching in USA Basketball because I got to watch her in
competitive environments and be around her to see how she would transfer over.
But I will tell you she has done better than I would even have hoped, and I
was pretty excited going in.  
  
Our guard play from Camryn Brown to Jaden Owens as well as Charisma Osborne,
they have really been -- their passion for the game and their confidence --
you never know with freshmen how that confidence is really going to go. And I
would say they have been surprisingly confident, and especially Jaden Owens,
really using her voice in leadership has been already an impact in our
program.  
  
I always say that freshmen will hit the wall. It doesn't matter. It'll be a
matter of who can get around the wall, over the wall, through the wall,
because it is a hard transition. But I think this group has a chance to really
be strong contributors.  
  
And then Natalie Chou, it doesn't feel like she's a new player. Obviously from
a public standpoint she is, but she's been practicing hard. And her love of
the game, pretty much every day you're going to get her to get 500 shots in
before she goes to class, and she's a come-early, stay-late player that wants
to do whatever it takes. My biggest thing for her is she loves it so much, she
puts so much pressure on herself, and I want her to bring the joy. She has so
much creativity in her game, and I think the more joy she brings to what she's
doing, I think the better she's going to play, and she's going to be a
tremendous asset for our program.  
  
Q. Michaela, last year earlier in the season you hit a stretch -- you
were in transition after Jordin and Monique, and you guys hit a little bit of
a wall and you had to put it back together. Are you confident that the early
part of this season you guys aren 't going to be in that same position?  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: I think that last year that was kind of the story for our
team was just finding our new identity after Mo and Jordin left. So I think
last year we did find our identity. And I think that yes, we had a great
season last year and we're going to look at that as a great season. But I
think now coming into the season that we know our identity and we're going to
find our new roles or new teammates, new freshmen, and we're going to be
really, really good this year.  
  
Q. What is that identity?  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: I think last year, like I said, that identity was finding
our identity. And now that I think that we've kind of implemented it, I think
that this year we're great rebounders, great shooters. We work well together,
great teammates, and so I think that last year kind of helped us find that new
identity.  
  
Q. Cori, I was wondering what you remember about the triple overtime
game with Arizona last year and if you thought they 'd be capable of going on
to winning the WNIT and looks like now they're being predicted to being kind
of middle of the race?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I just give Adia so much credit. Not only did she get her
team playing their best basketball in March, but she rallied an entire
community to get behind that team in a really special way. We all need to
celebrate that because that's growing our game and growing enthusiasm for the
journey of women's basketball.  
  
I think that that triple overtime game, that weekend was our turning point in
the season. So going to Arizona State and being able to come with a win, a
great shot in a clutch moment by Japreece Dean in that game and then to
respond a couple days later with a triple overtime win against a very, very
good Arizona team, I think it was -- for our building process, it was really
important for our mentality. But I'll tell you, they earned our respect by the
way that Arizona played, by the way they competed. Neither team could stop
each other in crucial moments. We were thankful to come out on top, but
definitely earned our respect.  
  
And we're excited for where that program is going, and I think that's really
the key to our conference. There's a lot of attention given to the top of the
conference, but the way that our entire depth of our conference has been risen
up, and Arizona is a big part of that, I think that's a major story line in
why our conference is the best in the country.  
  
Q. Coach, kind of following along those lines, you 're one of four teams
that's projected to be potentially preseason top 10 this year. How do you see
the depth in this conference compared to previous years?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think, like I said, that is the story line, and I think
obviously Stanford has been the torchbearer for a long time in terms of
consistent level of excellence. And obviously Oregon and Oregon State have
earned a lot of attention and are phenomenal basketball teams. But I think
we've had really good teams in the past at the top, and I think what
differentiates our conference this year is the depth of excellence.  
  
And I think we're going to have eight teams vying to be in the NCAA Tournament
and maybe more than that. But I think that truly the depth of the conference
-- if you go along any other conference and you look at what are the
differentiators, the top -- there's a lot of really good teams in the top of
the other Power Five conferences, but I don't think anybody has the depth from
top to bottom all the way through that we do.  
  
Q. Cori, you guys -- you can all weigh in if you 'd like. You mentioned
that pivotal weekend against Arizona. But going into Eugene and handing them
their only home loss of the season, what did you draw from that? I understand
Ruthy was hurt and blah blah. You still had to win there with a hostile
environment, et cetera, et cetera. If you guys could help us understand maybe
there was a moment where you looked at each other and said, you know, we can
hang with anybody in this country. And it played out as you made the great run
in the NCAA Tournament. If you could talk about that win.  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: I think playing in Matthew Knight arena, it's a crazy,
crazy atmosphere, and I think that night it was a testament to how hard we
worked as a team. We were down 22 at one point, and I don't think there was
one point where we ever gave up. I think that speaks a lot to our character as
a team and how the coaching staff has instilled in us what our values are. And
I think that just kind of shows to our identity of what kind of team we were
last year.  
  
CORI CLOSE: I think one of the biggest lessons we learned last year as a
program coming into this year is to not let anyone on the outside determine
what we can do and what our identity is, and if you're not distracted, you can
accomplish anything. And that's why we became really, I think, a very good
road team is that we really limited distractions. We have a phrase in our
program that says, "performance equals potential minus interferences," and I
think that really learning as a program how to minimize interferences --
because when you go into Matthew Knight arena as Michaela referenced, it's a
great environment. How fun to compete in. They have earned that support of
that community, and what a challenge.  
  
But our job is minimize those interferences. Our job is to look each other in
the eye and to know what we need to do possession by possession. And that's
easy to talk about, hard to build into your psyche, as well as into your
habits. And I think they actually taught me about that, I think, last year,
the power of that. They reminded my coaching heart about how powerful that can
be, and that's something I want to continue to teach, and that's why that was
a great win, but also a reference point going forward to what mentality can
do.  
  
Q. For Cal and for the conference, Charmin Smith had left in the spring
to join a WNBA team and come back. For Lindsay to go to the WNBA, what does it
mean for Cal but also for the Pac-12 that Charmin comes back here and is one
of the new faces in the conference?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think we get to be a part of two special things in that,
right? That Lindsay is blazing a trail for women as the way she embarks into
her NBA journey and fulfills a childhood dream and maybe blazes a trail for
other people to walk in in the future or more people to walk in. And then we
get to keep one of our own at home, somebody who has invested and sacrificed
not only as a coach but also as a player in her time in the Pac-12.  
  
I have a lot of respect for Charmin, not only as a basketball coach, but as a
human being that wants to invest and use sport as an opportunity to invest and
progress the lives of women. And I think she has a great passion.  
  
I had the opportunity to serve on the WBCA board with her and to see her
wisdom, to see her vision, even in our coaches' meeting this morning. I just
think it's a tremendous asset to keep her home in the Pac-12 footprint, and I
think she's going to do a great job. And I'm really thankful that she's
involved and I'm thankful for the trail that Lindsay is getting to blaze for
the rest of us, as well.  
  
Q. Japreece and Michaela, you came from another state to play in Los
Angeles. I know Coach just talked about distractions, but I wanted to know
what you 've been enjoying about Los Angeles? Does your team have a restaurant
they like to go to? Or is the beach a big deal? I'm just really interested in
that part.  
JAPREECE DEAN: Well, for me, I think that hanging out with my teammates is
probably the best part of being in LA. I don't really have too many outside
friends outside of my teammates. But I would say our go-to restaurant is the
Boiling Crab. We go there pretty often. They've kind of changed the menu, so
it's kind of messing up our pockets. But we go there pretty often and a lot of
people love crab on our team, so yeah.  
  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: I'd also have to agree with Japreece. Coming from a
different state, you don't really know the city and all the new people, but I
think my teammates have made it a really easy transition. We have some of the
funniest people on my team, so I think it's always a great time. From the
Boiling Crab trips to just being around each other, it's always such a great
experience.  
  
CORI CLOSE: Aren't you a beach kind of gal?  
  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: Sometimes, sometimes. The sand kind of gets me, but I do
like going to the beach if it's with my teammates. But yeah, I love hanging
around with my teammates. They're just great people to be around.  
  
Q. Japreece, I wanted to ask you, you got this extra season. What
benefit do you think you can bring with that extra year of knowledge and that
extra year of experience and maturity?  
JAPREECE DEAN: I think, like you said, knowledge and experience is going to
help me mentor and lead the younger class. I know we've got two guards, two
point guard-ish guards in, so I think that's going to help me and it's going
to keep me present. And I think about the future, so I think it's going to
help me lead them more instead of thinking about what I'm going to do next.  
  
Q. Cori, is there a team that you think is particularly -- you were
talking about the depth of the Pac-12. Is there a team or a couple of teams
that you think are particularly overlooked or underestimated?  
CORI CLOSE: Well, I think Utah is one of those teams. I think Lynne Roberts
does such a great job, and I think what they're building and their ability.
And I love the way that Salt Lake is coming alongside of them, as well, as
their attendance numbers have really grown. But they're a team that comes to
mind right off the bat.  
  
But I just -- I mean, I'm looking around the room in our coaches' meeting this
morning thinking, man, I get to compete with all of these coaches, and I think
that is something -- we always talk about as a coaching group that you'd
better adjust because the coaching group here is going to force you to be on
your A game, and I think that all of them have made me better.  
  
So I think that's what is leading to that depth. But Utah is definitely one
that comes off the top of the head in that group that could really make a
surge. I think they proved that in how they played at spurts last year.
Obviously Arizona is really exciting to think about with their NIT
championship, and we can really identify with the impact that has on a
program. That was a huge turning point for us in 2014 -- or I guess the
2014-15 season where we won the NIT -- and really spurred us on and really
taught us how to win.  
  
I think those are teams that come to mind right away, but I think there's many
teams that could make that kind of run. I mean, you look at what Washington
did in the tournament, and there's just a lot of really well-coached teams
with really excellent players that know how to make plays. So that's what
brings the excitement of this incredible conference.  
  
Q. What 's your biggest takeaway from your USA Basketball experience?  
MICHAELA ONYENWERE: I had the opportunity to participate in the USA 3-on-3s
basketball realm, and then I also was on the Pan-American team which went to
Peru, and I think they were both really great experiences. It took me to
Russia, to Canada, obviously to Peru, Brooklyn, like all over, so it was a
really great experience.  
  
As far as what it's going to teach me, I think it's a little bit different as
far as like bringing back what I learned, because it is just so physical in
the international realm. It is so aggressive, and that's something that was
definitely an adjustment period coming from college.  
  
So for the Pan-American team, I would say just working hard. I think that's
kind of what got me to being able to be on the Pan-American team, and I think
that's something that we talk about, too, in our program. So just working
hard, having fun while doing it, doing the right things, and yeah, so I think
that's probably what I learned.  
  
CORI CLOSE: And she won't say this, but I think her IQ has just skyrocketed
because she already studies the game all the time. When she watched film with
Coach Tony every week -- and she'd already watched it twice by the time she
got to her film session with Coach Tony. But then having to learn not only
different systems in terms of the Pan-American games, but then an entirely
different game in 3-on-3, I just see the way she's talking about the game, and
I don't even think she realizes how much her basketball IQ has increased by
those experiences, but I think that will pay dividends in our preparation over
time.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL MEDIA
DAY](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+MEDIA+DAY)

  

## October 7, 2019

  

### [Adia Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32004)

### [Tee Tee Starks](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=38090)

### [Aari McDonald](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36596)

  
_San Francisco, California_  
  
ADIA BARNES: This is going to be the best year for Pac-12 women's basketball.
I'm fired up. We all say we're excited, so I'm very excited. But I think that
there's so much parity in the league right now, I think it's going to be a
great year for the best conference in the country.  
  
Q. Can you reflect on the NIT run and kind of all of it, the things you
did to promote the program and get people into the gym? Was it more than you
even thought it could be?  
ADIA BARNES: It was a lot more than I thought. You know, a lot of people asked
me was I disappointed because we didn't make the tournament. I mean, of course
you are. You always want to make the tournament. But it was the absolute best
thing for our program and where we're at. I mean, going to the NIT, playing
six games, ending the season with a win, having momentum carry over to this
year, it was the best thing.  
  
I think one of the most rewarding things was seeing how the city just
gravitated towards it. They were hungry for excitement with women's
basketball, and the crowd just grew every single game. It was fun. We weren't
focused on the crowd. People were like, oh, you were marketing, you were doing
this and that. No, I was having fun and it doesn't take a lot to tweet, so
thank goodness for social media and you guys because it was easy. That was the
easy part. It was fun, and we all believed in our room, we believed that we
could win, so we were on a mission to win. Like I said, there was two teams
that were happy at the end of the year, it was us and Baylor, so that was a
pretty good situation to be in.  
  
AARI MCDONALD: Definitely the NIT run was an amazing experience for us like
Coach said. We were on a mission, and by that part of the season everyone was
bought into what Coach was saying and we played for each other and we came out
victorious.  
  
TEE TEE STARKS: It was fun. There was no other way to explain it but it was
fun. It was great to see the whole team just kind of come together and finish
strong. People would always tell us that we were a totally different team in
the NIT championship than what we started with. It was great to see us grow
and finish strong.  
  
Q. Coach, you 're always so positive. You have this big smile on your
face all the time. It up lifts me personally, and I just want to know, what's
your secret?  
ADIA BARNES: Well, I'm getting gray hair, so that's not a great thing. But no,
I just think that -- I'm definitely a positive person. I think that there's
challenges, there's adversity. We all have it. And I think that part of being
a role model and being a professional is taking care of your business.  
  
How could I not smile? I go to work every day, I get to wear sweats, I don't
have to wear heels every day. I wear sweats and I mentor young women and I
coach basketball. So for me, that's a blessing, and there's nothing to take
for granted because one day I probably will get fired. Everybody gets fired in
this profession.  
  
But I think that I'm in a great situation helping young women, and I think for
me that's something to always smile about. Yes, are there highs and lows, yes,
but there are in every progression. I'm coaching at my alma mater, I'm doing
what I love, I'm in a game that has changed my life, and I'm still part of
this game. So I mean, I'm going to smile for a long time because of that. For
me, I'm where I want to be. I'm in the right place. I'm at the right place,
and I think the timing is right for everything. I think everything happens for
a reason.  
  
Q. I want to know what 's going to inspire you to take it to the next
level next season because I know that's a goal.  
AARI McDONALD: I would say just -- I'll reflect back on last season. I know
that the NIT, like we weren't satisfied, so just winning that will make myself
and my teammates hungrier for this year, and we're hoping for better things.  
  
TEE TEE STARKS: We spoke earlier, but, honestly, I think about how close we
were to getting into the NCAA Tournament. We were a couple games from getting
in, so I think just having those experiences and being able to implement them
into this year and kind of handle those situations better, I think we'll be
able to accomplish those goals.  
  
Q. Aari, what did you work on this summer to make you even more
dangerous this year?  
AARI McDONALD: I've been working on my jump shot, just making sure I have a
consistent jump shot and just making sure I have like a better shot selection,
and like knowing when to push tempo, when to slow down.  
  
Q. Tee Tee, what was behind your decision to stay at Arizona?  
ADIA BARNES: Besides me getting the crowd to say one more and having the
people carry the ones. That was like part of behind the scenes, so that was an
influence a little bit, I'm sure.  
  
TEE TEE STARKS: Yeah, she definitely embarrassed me a little bit. But Coach
Adia talked about all the things that we could do this year. I talked it over
with my family. I have a really big support system back at home, and this was
a decision that I couldn't make on my own. So I relied on the people that I
trust, my family, my mom, and we kind of just went with the best decision for
me, and that was to be here.  
  
Q. Coach, you look at tremendous talent coming back, and then a really
eclectic unique incoming class, kids from all over the world. It would appear
from the outside looking in that with great veterans coming back, the freshmen
or the incoming class doesn 't have to be great right away. Can you massage it
a little bit as they learn the ropes of D-I basketball in America?  
ADIA BARNES: Yeah, so it's a big cultural transition for a lot of those
players. But the returners have to be great right away, and that's their job
is to be role models, and their job is to bring the freshmen along. We have
seven new players. There is a little bit of language barrier, but I think
that's what makes it so special. We're a special group with a lot of different
people, and I think that makes them culturally more diverse and more well-
rounded.  
  
So I think things will be a little bit slower because there are so many new
people. But with everybody back from last year, all the starters back, I think
that it's easier for those freshmen not to have pressure to be so great.  
  
The other thing is we have a lot more depth, and I think we're more talented
this year. So just shooting the ball a little bit better, not having to play
players 37 minutes. So I think efficiency-wise they'll be a little more
efficient. I think sometimes there is a little bit -- practices can be a
little bit longer because you have to kind of back-brief a little bit more and
talk a little bit more behind the scenes. But I think the one thing it has
helped us with a lot is communication, and that's been something we have to
work on. And we're not going to get better until we worked on that, so this is
a great way to work on that because we have no choice but to do it.  
  
It's funny because it feels so different in practice because having like 11
healthy people last year, now 15, it's like there's no room to run a sprint on
the baseline. It feels different. It looks like we have a lot of people, but
I'm excited there's 14 eligible players this year. One is sitting out, but I'm
excited. I'm excited, too, because they're excited. They've had some success,
and the level has been raised. And now the freshmen, we expect more from the
freshmen coming in. They can't just say, oh, we're freshmen. They've got to
come along faster.  
  
Q. What 's it like with expectations higher on your program, period,
after what you did last year? Folks are looking at you with a little bit more
of a target on your backs.  
ADIA BARNES: Yeah, I don't really pay attention to a lot of that stuff. I'm
not saying every day we need to make the tournament. That's what we want and
that's the ultimate goal, but I believe in getting 1 percent better every day.
So every day we're doing our best and we're getting a little bit better. We
talk one more, so what's your one more today? That's my one more as a coach,
and holding me accountable for that. And I think that by us doing all that and
having the small victories, the big things will take care of themselves. I
don't feel like there's pressure. I think the climb is the fun part. I think
there's a lot more pressure when you're No. 1 and you have to finish No. 1.  
  
Yeah, we're picked sixth, but that doesn't mean a whole lot to me because
we've got to go out and play and do better. If I talk to this group, they
don't expect to finish sixth. They want to do more, so that's what I love
about them. So I am willing to do whatever it takes to help them reach their
goals and aspirations.  
  
But really big on little victories and 1 percent better every single day.  
  
Q. Do you feel like being picked sixth is reflective of where you 're
at, especially after a couple years ago you were picked 11th and 10th?  
ADIA BARNES: Yeah, I think it's a lot easier when you're picked 11th and 10th
because if you go up one spot, it's a great season. I don't really get into a
lot of that stuff because, regardless of where you're picked, you've got to
still go out -- this is the best conference in the country. You've got to
still go out and play. And I think whether you're picked second or fourth or
12th, there's really good teams. And I don't think you can take anybody
lightly and we have a pretty tough Pac-12 schedule. So I don't really look at
that, but I know where we need to be to try to make the tournament. And to be
honest our goal is to make the tournament. Yes, winning the WNIT was fabulous,
but now we want more, and you always want more after you've had some success.
So if we went to another WNIT, it probably wouldn't be a great year for us in
our minds and how we feel.  
  
You know, our league is competitive, so we just have to do our best and get
better every single game, and I think everything else will take care of
itself.  
  
Q. For Adia, you 're part of an elite group now, former Seattle Storm
player, WNBA championship. Charmin also was with the Seattle Storm.  
ADIA BARNES: They were teammates.  
  
Q. That 's right, in 2000 --  
ADIA BARNES: A long time ago. Don't mention the year.  
  
Q. Since you 've become head coach at Arizona and with your background
in the WNBA, do you have maybe a former player or former teammates or players
that are in the league now reach out to you about coaching, and what has that
been like as sort of a full circle moment for you?  
ADIA BARNES: Yeah, it happens a lot. I think there's so many -- some of your
teammates you're thinking, I would never give you a job. But I think it's just
a blessing to be in a situation where you can help people, and so I'm all
about paying it forward and giving back and pulling someone else along. So
creating opportunities for women I think is a great thing.  
  
I think when you're a player and you're a pro for so long -- I've been in that
spot. You kind of come to a crossroads. You've made some money, you've kind of
taken naps every day for 10 years, practiced four hours a day, and you get to
a point where you're a little older and trying to figure out what you want to
do. So I'm always giving advice and helping friends because it's not an easy
transition for women because -- it's different with men. When you've played
that long, you're financially stable and you don't have to get another job.
You can go chill out in Italy on the beach. But when you're a female athlete
that's pro, you don't make millions of dollars so you have to transition into
something else.  
  
I really take pride in helping friends, and I think this is a great avenue to
be around the game, give back, and to mentor. And I think that there needs to
be more former players coaching, and I'd love to see that. So however I can
help in any way and give advice and input, I always do. I let people come to
practices and talk to me, and I help when they first start getting into the
game because I think we need more players in the game to be successful.  
  
Q. With Charmin being at Cal now, what are your thoughts on that?  
ADIA BARNES: So I reached out to her when she first got the job, and she had
some questions she asked me because very similar situations. When you're
turning over a program, it's not easy. It takes a lot of time and a lot of
work, and I think Charmin is really cut out to do it. She's extremely smart.
She was a great player. She was a great teammate. I think she's a perfect fit
for Cal. And I think she'll be very successful. But it takes time. It doesn't
happen in one year, it doesn't happen in two years. There are growing pains
when you turn around a program.  
  
But I think that I'm happy she got the job because I think she's the right
person for the job, in the right place since she was there over a decade. So I
was happy to see her in the league, and I just want her to be successful.  
  
Q. I was just wondering, you alluded to the international players and
especially with the freshmen coming in. Has that led to any light moments or
challenges, stories you can tell about how it 's gone?  
ADIA BARNES: You know, I think that there was one -- a couple moments. We did
something called the program. The program is -- they probably don't love it,
but I loved it. It's military-style training, which makes you face a lot of
adversity from being in a pool at 5:00 in the morning to log carrying, I
guess, as a team. So I think we had some people that don't speak great English
step out of their comfort zone and have to lead a group. And I thought that
was extremely eye-opening because of a couple things. Not because they said
the commands right in the right words, but because the team had to rally
around them and really communicate well and have their backs. So I really
loved seeing that.  
  
And I think that we really grew as a program, and it's something I plan on
continuing to do. I think it showed me a lot about people's character and
people that we can mold into leaders for the future. But I think the
communication, that was big. And I talked about communication before, but
that's one of the areas we had to get better at to go to that next step and
get -- just the next level in the program.  
  
But I think some of those moments or just some translation during practice,
and Salvo, who happens to be one of the assistant coaches, he's really good at
Spanish, so he can translate and speak a couple different languages, so that
really helps. If you have international players and you have a coach on staff
that speaks multiple languages, it's definitely helpful.  
  
Q. How many native languages -- different native languages are on the
team now?  
ADIA BARNES: Well, it's kind of -- that's a little misleading because from
Latvia and Iceland, they speak perfect English. So I'd say predominantly
Spanish, Turkish, which none of us speak Turkish. But they understand English.
It's not that difficult. And then Australia is obviously English, so I think
it's just two. So it hasn't been that bad.  
  
But also I think the great thing about our players is they're learning some
words in their language. As a team just for a cultural experience, we went to
a Turkish restaurant when they first got here. So I think there's things that
are valuable that the players on the team are learning, and how to embrace
different cultures because that's what America is. That's what life is. And
the thing is most of them, they don't understand because they've never been
inserted into another culture. But a lot of them aspire to go and play pro.
It's going to be the same situation they're going to be in, but it's going to
be flipped.  
  
So I think having sensitivity to that and exploring new things and learning
about different people, I think that's one of the great things that our sport
does, it brings people together.  
  
Q. Are there any plans to auction off Assistant Coach Salvo for
tickets?  
ADIA BARNES: No, because he might divorce me. No, I thought that was funny and
it was a joke, but he didn't think it was that funny. But now I've got to
auction off someone else because we won't stay married probably. But yeah, it
was to reach a ticket -- it's funny, so I think one of the things you guys
talk about momentum from the WNIT. So one of the things is last year we had
this big rally trying to go to sell a thousand tickets, so another way that
the momentum from the WNIT helped was this year like we're -- we're really
close to 3,000 tickets, and 84 percent were new accounts. So new fans for
women's basketball, I think that was really good, and I didn't have to auction
my husband to get to 3,000. But yeah.  
  
TEE TEE STARKS: Maybe next year we'll auction her off.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Sabrina Ionescu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32677)

### [Ruthy Hebard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33290)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Stanford - 64, Oregon - 57  
  
COACH GRAVES: Well, congratulations to Stanford. They earned it today. They
were better than us. They were more focused, more determined. They played
harder than us for the most part and they're certainly worthy champions, no
question about it. They have the opportunity to go a long way and represent
the Pac-12 well.  
  
You know, disappointed. I thought we continued to play hard and got back in
the game, and I was a little disappointed with our execution once we took the
lead in the third quarter. Or the early fourth quarter. I thought, okay, this
is our time that we usually shine. We just didn't make the plays when we
needed to.  
  
So doesn't derail our goals of doing well in the NCAA Tournament, going a long
way. But, you know, we feel bad now. But hopefully we'll learn from this and
move forward.  
  
Q. Obviously they opened with the first eight and closed on a pretty
good run once you took the lead there in the fourth. Sabrina, maybe more
frustrated with the start or the finish, one or the other or just both?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I mean, both, honestly. We didn't come out and we didn't have
any fire and they came out, and you could tell they really wanted to beat us
and we were on our heels for most of the game.  
  
We fought back, but we didn't fight back hard enough and long enough to win
this game.  
  
Q. Ruthy, after the game in Maples, you had to have a sense they were
going to come out pretty fired up. Is there a reason you guys weren't able to
match that?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I'm not sure. We knew they were going to come out fired up, but
for some reason we didn't match that intensity, which we should have.  
  
Q. Kelly, I think Sabrina hadn't hit a basket for the last eight
minutes. I think Sabrina was it just other people weren't getting shots to
fall, what was it in that fourth quarter that the execution wasn't there?  
COACH GRAVES: Yeah, well, you put the ball in your best player's hand, and you
let her work with another great player, and we did some good things to get
back in the game with that formula. Just down the stretch, again, couple of --
we had a couple of decent looks, but a couple of timely turnovers didn't help.  
  
But, you know, you kind of ride the ones that got you there, so to speak. A
lot of our sets, quite frankly, just, you know, we weren't on point tonight.
So we decided we're just going to kind of play ball in the middle of the
floor, and screen and re-screen, and see if they would bite.  
  
We didn't get the roll action tonight. They did a nice job on that, so we
ended up taking tough, contested pull-ups. Didn't get the three game going
either. But the best shooting team in the country shoots 33% for a game,
you're just not going to win. That's credit to Stanford, credit to lack of
execution on our part, and credit to just a night when we had some open looks
and normally go and didn't make them. So it was all three.  
  
Q. Kelly, the defensive address you made at the half, it looked like
third quarter, beyond the momentum that they lost when Dodson and Smith went
out, but it looked like you had them stifled offensively. Did you like what
you were doing defensively, and was it a matter of not being able to sort of
maintain that?  
COACH GRAVES: Yeah, I mean, you know, we trapped a little bit more. We put
more pressure on the basketball. It wasn't a ton of adjustments. I think we
played harder. We were more active. I think we got hands on more balls in the
second half. First half, it seemed like we just kind of went through the
motions. So that was the main thing. I just thought we played a little harder
and with a little more urgency, and when we do that, we can make things happen
because we're really long.  
  
So we created some turnovers and, you know, they were -- we didn't have many
run outs. At least we had some in the second half a little bit.  
  
Q. What can you take from that that you guys can use moving forward in
the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, this is an NCAA Tournament game. This is an Elite Eight,
Final Four, kind of game. Both teams are certainly capable of getting there. I
think hopefully we learned that you can't come out -- I'm not saying we
weren't ready to play. I think our kids were fired up, and we were prepared as
much as you can do in one day, you know. But it's just that sense of urgency
just wasn't there. You do that in the NCAA Tournament and you're done. It's a
one-and-done deal, and it's hard.  
  
If we want to achieve the goals that we want to achieve, we better be ready
each and every night for three weeks.  
  
Q. You still feel like your body of work is worthy of being in that
Portland region?  
COACH GRAVES: I'll leave that up to whomever. Listen, we've earned what we've
gotten. You always want to win the tournament championship. But to me the real
championship is the two-month grind. I'm sorry, the regular season
championship, having to go nine games on the road over two months, battling
injuries that everybody has to, and that should count for something.  
  
You know, we're the number two RPI conference. And listen, we lost today to
Stanford, and they're pretty good, and they beat Baylor who is right now the
overall No. 1. So you're talking sure, I mean, but where they put us, hey,
we'll be ready to go wherever they send us.  
  
Q. Sabrina, any sense that playing a really physical overtime game last
night against UCLA that you guys were tired?  
SABRINA IONESCU: No, I don't think so. I know we recovered well. We got to
sleep in and take care of our bodies, so, no, I don't think we're tired.  
  
COACH GRAVES: We had a tough grinding game last year against UCLA in the
semifinals that could have taken us out, and then we won the next day against
Stanford by 20. That's not an excuse. We won't ever use that one.  
  
Q. Sabrina, how tough is the next couple weeks because you don't play
for probably two weeks from now. I know you like to be on the court. Is it a
chance to rest your body and mind and get ready or is it, I want to get back
out there right now to play again and erase this feeling?  
SABRINA IONESCU: I think it's different for everybody. The people that need to
take care of their bodies should take care of their bodies and take the rest
that they need in order to be a hundred percent in a week. And the people that
want to get out there, can get out there. We just have to be smart about it,
and our coaches trust us to be smart about it.  
  
So it's going to depend on the player. But we have this week to get ready and
prepare ourselves for the following weeks.

### [Alanna Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32740)

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Kiana Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34751)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Stanford - 64, Oregon - 57  
  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think the competition that we played game in and game out
really prepared us for today's game. We won with our defense, and we came in
as the top ranked defensive team in the Pac-12, and people were really locked
in defensively, whether it was Kiana, D, Alanna, her blocks, rebounding. Maya
really helped us a lot, Anna Wilson had a great game defending Ionescu. She's
a terrific player.  
  
I thought our associate head coach had a great scouting report. And our team
just locked in, and we did what we needed to do, and I'm just really proud and
really happy for these women that are sitting up here, and the rest that are
in the locker room.  
  
Q. It was a month ago today that you guys had a pretty tough day against
Oregon at home. How much of that went into this?  
ALANNA SMITH: I think that was something that we had in our minds ever since
we lost that game. When you take a loss like that, you have no choice but to
learn from it. So we were happy that we got to play Oregon today, because we
wanted another chance at them.  
  
I think just from the result and how we're all feeling right now, it just
shows how badly we wanted it. Tara says every time, every disappointment is a
blessing. That was a huge disappointment to us, but this is a huge blessing
right now too.  
  
Q. When she says that and you're in that moment, do you believe that?  
ALANNA SMITH: I think we do. I truly think we do. When you take a loss like
that, you're forced to look at the mistakes you make. You're forced to.
Sometimes when you win and you make mistakes, you're not looking at those. But
when you take a loss like that you learn from it better.  
  
Q. You talked about her just a little bit, but she might not have shown
up on the stat sheet other than the blocked shots, but can you elaborate on
the presence of Maya Dodson down low?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Maya had, what, four blocks. You know, rebounds, six
rebounds. But I think her presence in there and just her running the floor I
think gave us another alternative, actually. A lot of times this year when
Maya has been out, Alanna has had to play the five, but it allowed Alanna to
play the four the whole game basically.  
  
I don't think we ever went small the whole thing. Alanna was our five. I think
playing three games in three days is really tough. But our depth I thought
really helped us.  
  
Q. For any one of the ladies, to go back to talking about avenging the
loss against Oregon. I know one of the players mentioned yesterday Tara had
said don't look in the rear view mirror and don't dwell on things either. So
when you scouted this for this game, did you look at what they did in the
first game, or did you try to concentrate on what your defense can do in this
tournament rather than focusing on the previous game?  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: Actually, we didn't look -- I mean, after we finished that
week out, from then on we haven't harped on it. We haven't looked at that
film, actually of what they did. We looked at what we did well and what
openings we had on offense and things we could have done better on offense.  
  
When we watched film last night and this morning, we looked at the good things
we did and the good things we know that we can get, the good things that other
teams did against them, especially on defense. And we knew we didn't have a
great offensive performance that day or defensive performance. But we knew
that we were capable of it.  
  
Yeah, we didn't focus on our negatives at all, which was really good for us, I
think.  
  
Q. Coach, is you've won 13 of these now, so I don't want to say it's old
hat because each one I'm sure is special. But what's it mean to beat a team
that you lost to 40 points a month ago, and to have lost to them last year in
the title game? Does this one have a certain place now because of what you
guys did to get it?  
COACH VANDERVEER: It's not really about that. It's more what you feel from the
players that you coach. That they really care about each other. That they have
each other's back, and that they get the big picture of this is a team game.
These are our leaders with Kiana and Alanna, and DiJonai, and what great jobs
they've done as captains and leaders.  
  
It's a team game. We don't win without going through the scouting report with
Mikaela Brewer doing what she needs to do, or Estella or anyone. Shannon's
stepping up big for us.  
  
I don't look at it like, oh, it's just another trophy or another net or
anything like that. It's just another great memory. And I'm so proud of these
women and the other women in our locker room. Not for just the basketball,
which was great today, but just who they are as people. That's what makes it
really rewarding.  
  
Q. Alanna, can I ask about your ankle? And also, in that moment when
Alanna goes out and Maya goes out right after her and it seemed like things
got a little shaky there and Oregon made a run at you guys?  
ALANNA SMITH: Yeah, I think I just rolled it or landed on it wrong. I think I
landed on one of the other team's feet. But we've got a great support staff in
our athletic trainer, Katelin, and she knows what to do in those types of
situations. Yeah, she got me right back out on the court. I think when the
adrenaline is pumping like that too, I didn't want to miss out. I wanted to be
out there for my teammates.  
  
So, yeah, I just did what I had to do to get back out there, and I think Maya
did the same thing as well.  
  
Q. Kiana, the three you hit with about a minute and a half to play was
one of the only separators in that fourth quarter. Basically one-possession
game the whole way through. What do you see coming up the court leading to
that shot? And what's that moment going to do for you next time you're in a
situation like that late in a game against this kind of team?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: I just knew they needed a basket, and they were guarding D and
Alanna really hard because they played a great game. I think she went under
the screen, so I had confidence. My teammates have confidence in me. My
coaching staff has confidence in me. Yeah, I just knocked it down. I think
Shannon set a great screen and I knocked it down.  
  
ALANNA SMITH: She has ice in her veins.  
  
Q. Kiana, to follow on that, you guys closed the game on a 16 to 3 run
or used the 16 to 3 run to take a double-figure lead there. In a game like
this and situation like this, what are the key components of going on a run
like that in crunch time in high-pressure situations?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: Just execution. I think our last media timeout, we were
talking about it on the way here, I think we had four minutes left, and we
were just saying four minutes, just two minutes at a time, one minute at a
time, one possession at a time.  
  
So credit to my teammates for just locking in. After that media timeout, I
think D got a lay-up and a steal, and that took us the rest of the way. It
took us the rest of the game. Shout out to D.  
  
Q. Coach, I would imagine quite a few teams going forward are going to
look at this tape for how you guys shut down Ruthy Hebard. What was the big
key for kind of limiting someone who coming into this had been playing really
light's out all the way through the tournament?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Well, again, I guess I got to watch it to see what we did.
But a lot of it was not just having a plan. It was people making the effort,
believing in what we were saying to do, and then working as hard as they could
to do it.  
  
But both Shannon and Maya worked really hard to get good position on her. They
studied film on her and knew what she liked to do. We got some help from other
people doubling in a couple times. Just, you know, she's shooting 77%
basically or 76%. I mean, that's not rocket science. You've got to do
something about it, right?  
  
People really did what we needed them to do. But they're not a one-person
team. Other people had to -- guarding Sabally was tough, Erin Boley was tough,
they're a really talented team, and we needed everyone playing well to do it.  
  
Q. Coach, been addressing the crunch time in the fourth quarter. But you
guys came out blazing right away. How important was it to attack this team as
far as the emotion it put forth in an overtime win yesterday, establishing and
setting a tone for yourself for that confidence to come out on a 10-3 run and
building that confidence for yourself?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think actually in our game against Cal we did that. I
think people just realize, wow, it's ten minutes. Can you do anything for ten
minutes. We went hard and ran hard. We have a great floor leader in Kiana. She
pushes the tempo. You know, they let mistakes go better than I do. You know,
they let it go and move on to the next thing.  
  
With Alanna knocking down shots, I thought D's steal, first, the lay-up was
great because there were only 4 seconds on the shot clock on that one, and
then the steal was great. Then Ki had a three. I think at some point the clock
is going down and we're going up, and it just got away from them.  
  
Q. As a follow-up on the question about defending Ruthy. It seemed like
Maya was really making it a point to sprint up court on offense and force
Hebard to get back. They are not necessarily the fastest team or most athletic
team. I'm not suggesting that Maya did something that was revolutionary for
her, but was it a point of emphasis?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Definitely, definitely.  
  
Q. To make Hebard sprint?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Yes. I don't know that we ran as hard as we're capable of,
but, again, we wanted to really push the tempo. Third game in three days.
We're, what we call, tag teaming with Maya and Shannon. If Maya got tired
Shannon came in, if Shannon got tired, you know, we just switched them back
and forth.  
  
We also did that, I thought, really well with Lacie and Anna. But Anna's
defense was fantastic. She worked so hard and came up with so many big plays
for us.  
  
Q. When you guys get the scout, obviously, Tara, for years been knowing
about what great scouts they put together and how they take players out of
games and things. When you guys get the scout and Tara says about executing,
can you talk about the trust you have in that scouting report?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: Yeah, we just have total faith in our coaches. They know what
they're talking about. Tara has been here for quite a while. So, yeah. They're
really like open to what we see on offense -- I mean, defensively, what we're
seeing knocked down the floor. So it works both ways. We trust them and they
trust us, so we just have like a system.  
  
Q. DiJonai, at one point it was tied at 51, and you had a tough bucket
take. Then on the next possession you were (indiscernible) strip Maite and go
away, and it was a four point, two-possession game. Tell me how you saw those
two plays? In the back of your mind when you were trying to pick Maite, did
you hesitate at all?  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: I would say, like Kiana said earlier, right when we came
out of that media timeout, we huddled up, and just said there's 4 minutes and
I want to say 10 seconds left in this game. It was like: We want this, and we
need to show it right now. Coming out of that huddle, I saw it on everyone's
face that we wanted it. And we knew we had to do whatever we could to get it.  
  
On that lay-up, I tried to use my body. But on the steal, yeah, earlier in the
game she was very comfortable, and we liked that, and we knew at some point we
were going to get one of them, right. So I took my chance. I didn't have any
fouls either, so, I had one to give.  
  
Q. Going back to Anna Wilson's play and the way she defended Sabrina, it
looked like she kind of wore her out a bit and made her fatigued. Was that a
point of emphasis to maybe try to tire Sabrina out and take that part away
from Oregon?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think we were just trying to keep someone fresh on her.
Actually Lacie picked up two quick fouls, and Anna just stepped in, it was her
name, and we've talked about it all year, and just be ready. When you go in
the game, do what you need to do.  
  
She, I think, showed a lot of just confidence, and she's always at practice
early, working on things. Just it worked out, and she really took advantage of
her opportunity, and we're really proud of her.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Jody Wynn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34197)

### [Hannah Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34199)

### [Jenna Moser](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36081)

### [Amber Melgoza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34706)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Stanford - 72, Washington - 61  
  
COACH WYNN: I don't have a lot of voice, so, first of all, that Stanford team
is a phenomenal team with a legendary coach and a classy woman.  
  
We knew that we were going to be challenged on both sides of the ball today,
and it was just tough. They just make it difficult because they're very, very
good, and very well coached, and they just made it difficult for us to take
one thing away versus another.  
  
I will say that I'm super proud that we didn't quit. I'm proud of our overall
effort for three games that we had in this tournament. We grew so much.  
  
Out of the three opponents, in six games this year we were outscored by 161
points. So what we did in this tournament, what they did in this tournament, I
should say, is truly special, and it's absolutely remarkable, and it's
something that they will remember for the rest of their lives and hopefully
grow from and improve on.  
  
We had lost to Stanford in the two games combined by 56 points. You know, I
think we gave a hundred percent of our effort. I'm super, super proud of our
group. We're very together and proud of our two seniors. That's why I brought
them up here with us today. Certainly Amber was a beast today. She really
competed on the floor. We all played really, really hard, and no reason to
hang our heads.  
  
Q. Amber, can you just talk about how you guys felt in terms of energy
and physically? I mean, last night was emotional. It's been a big couple days
and the third straight game. Did you guys run out of gas at any point?  
AMBER MELGOZA: I mean, three straight games is obviously a very hard thing to
do. But I thought that just we all just played with tremendous heart out
there, and we were just battling. We've battled for 40 minutes as much as we
can, and, I mean, we obviously didn't have the ending we wanted to because we
obviously wanted to compete tomorrow. But I just thought our team did a great
job, and I thought that we stuck together and that's something that's really
important and that's going to carry on until next year.  
  
And these two people here, Jenna and Hannah, they've led us this whole year. I
can't be any more grateful for them. And they're some really, really special
people. I know they're going to do great things after this.  
  
Q. It sounds funny to say this, but you kind of had them where you
wanted them, down double digits in the second quarter and you made your run
--  
COACH WYNN: I guess.  
  
Q. How big was that shot they hit to end the half? You had everything
going your way, and that's a momentum killer?  
COACH WYNN: That was the momentum, yeah. I felt like the first shot of the
game, that was a bank three, and then the last shot of the second quarter was
the half-court shot. Those six points, those were big six points by DiJonai.  
  
But we were down 14, and we don't hang our heads when we're down. We know
we've got to battle back. We were down a lot this year. It's easy to quit. But
we've learned so much in the last couple weeks that quitting is just not the
answer. It's not what we're going to do.  
  
So those six points and the four free throws at the end, I mean, it could be a
different last minute of the game. But we didn't quit.  
  
I thought they were tremendous in the paint tonight, and they really did a
nice job of isolating us in a one-on-one situation in the paint. Then you
couple that with their three stars making threes with high efficiency, it was
tough, tough to stop them.  
  
Q. The season probably wasn't what you guys were hoping for until this
run. How special is it to sort of end your career, even though it wasn't
getting to the finals and playing more, but to have this run that is historic
for Washington and the Pac-12 Tournament?  
HANNAH JOHNSON: I actually looked at Jenna before the game, and I said, No
matter what the outcome is today, we can be proud because we won two games
that we weren't supposed to.  
  
And if you would have asked me at the beginning of the season if we were going
to be here, or in the middle of season, I wouldn't have thought so, and we
were. So I think it's hard it's over, but I'm really proud of my team and the
way it ended.  
  
JENNA MOSER: Yeah, same. We're really proud, and we're proud of the legacy
that we get to leave. And we're thankful for the opportunity, and we talked
about just these memories are going to overpower any memories of losses. It's
hard to be part of a program that's being built. People don't talk about that
enough. It's hard. But we're just really proud of how far we've come, and I'm
excited for the future of this program.  
  
Q. Hannah and Jenna, what have you seen these last two years from Amber
emerging first as a scorer that every team has to think about, and what she
can mean next year as this program hopefully takes the next step, and what are
you most proud of the players around her and what they've shown in this run
here?  
JENNA MOSER: I think a lot of people stepped up this tournament. Amber,
obviously -- I mean, what is the box score? 32 points, and a lot of steals and
assists, too, and rebounds. Missy obviously had a great tournament. I feel
like we're leaving the program in good hands.  
  
Amber is our third captain, and we have a lot of young players who are really
going to contribute a lot in the future character-wise and athletically. So
I'm excited for them. I'm excited for Amber to get the opportunity to lead
them next year.  
  
HANNAH JOHNSON: I think one of the biggest things that Amber has grown is in
her leadership, and that's something I'm really proud of her. I think next
year she's going to be an even better leader. Me and Jenna are passing her the
torch, so you've got a high stake right there (laughing).  
  
But, no, I think she's going to be great. I think she's learned a lot from me
and Jenna. Her work ethic is amazing. Every day I see her in the gym extra,
and that's something that we want Washington culture to be about.

_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Stanford - 72, Washington - 61  
  
COACH VANDERVEER: First of all, I think that we had a battle on our hands, and
that points to the depth of our conference. If that's team No. 11, wow. Just
incredible. I mean, how hard we had to play and how well we had to play to
beat Washington and to beat Cal and that 7 and 11, I think it really points to
just the great teams we have, the great players we have, and the great coaches
we have in the conference.  
  
Washington was playing with a lot of confidence and a lot of just house money,
so to speak, and we had to play really well. We needed that half-court shot,
D.  
  
But I was really excited about how Maya Dodson stepped up for us tonight.
She's been out a lot with her injury, and when we needed her to, she got right
on that block. She finished. She made free throws. She was rebounding, playing
defense. So it's great to have kind of the old Maya back. We need her.  
  
You know, D, Ki -- Kiana Williams is my MVP. She just goes and goes and goes
the whole game. So we just have one more game tomorrow, and we're going to
need her to play well. Along with Alanna, the twins. We've got some great
minutes from Shannon. Who else? Anna Wilson came in and gave us some really
good minutes. So we're really excited about playing in the championship game,
and it's a lot to do with the people to my right.  
  
Q. That shot you hit with the three, but at that time when they were
making this run, as they were doing all tournament, to sort of get the
momentum your way, going to the locker room and then you hit a normal three,
so to speak, coming out of the locker room, how big was that stretch, that
first three and the second three, to getting it back to having the momentum on
your side?  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: I would say, yeah, for sure they were making a run. I
think it was about a six-point game at that point. So whenever anyone hits
like a big half-court shot or a big three, we all get excited. But everyone's
always there in practice rebounding for me and passing it back to me. So it's
kind of like everyone's hard work in that shot.  
  
But, yeah, it gave us a lot of momentum, I think, going into halftime, and it
kind of gave us a little bit more of a cushion.  
  
Q. This is a quick turn, obviously, with the third game in three days
plus the time change. You'll face an Oregon team that you guys probably have
some thoughts about after what happened in Maples. But can you talk about a
quick turn and preparing for an Oregon team after the last time you faced
them?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Oregon has a great team, we know this. They're playing three
games, too, so it's not like we're playing more or anything like that. They
have terrific players, a great system. They've demonstrated that throughout
the whole year, but we're here to battle.  
  
I'm really excited about how much our team has improved, how hard we're
working, and we're going to come out. We were in the same situation last year
and we're going to learn from the good things we did and learn from the
mistakes we made. But I have a lot of confidence in our team and our players,
and we're just going to play our game.  
  
Q. There has been 18 Pac-12 championships, and you've been in 16 of
them. What does that mean to you, and what has been the key to your success?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I remember the two that we weren't. We're really
appreciative of being in the championship game. I mean, it says a lot about
our program and the support we get for our program, whether it's our fans or
our administration, the great players we have. We're just really -- you said
18? Has it been 18 years we've run the tournament? Wow.  
  
We're just -- I think the tournament has been a great thing for our conference
and women's basketball, and I think it really helps to get us ready for the
NCAA Tournament. It's extremely competitive, and it always has been. But we're
very excited to be playing in the championship game, and we want to play very
well.  
  
Q. The game against Oregon at your place was not how you wanted it to
go. Has that been in your mind; that we get another chance to play them again
and what could happen?  
MAYA DODSON: Yeah, we didn't come out ready to play them. Oregon is a great
team, and we came out kind of flat, and they took advantage of that. But we
learned from that game. It's in the past, and I think we're ready now as long
as we play our game.  
  
DIJONAI CARRINGTON: Yeah, I would agree. As Tara always says, we have to look
at it as we're driving a car. It's in the rear view mirror, and we can't
always harp on that loss, but we have to look every couple seconds, right, and
see what we can build from it and what we can learn from that.  
  
I think that's what we've done from that point on. We've grown as a team,
we've grown as a unit. We're improving our shot percentages and our field goal
percentages, and we're playing smart and together. And I think tomorrow that
will show for us.  
  
Q. Maya, going into a match-up where you're going to spend some time
against Hebard tomorrow, how do you think you've progressed over the course of
the season to battle with a player like that on the inside, while also paying
attention to all the other options of getting to the basket and pull you out
of the three-point line too?  
MAYA DODSON: Yeah, Ruthy Hebard is a great post player. From the last time we
played them, I learned a lot about how she posts up every play and gets great
position. I think I just need to come out. It's going to be a challenge, but I
think as long as I play hard and also try to help my team out, call screens,
it's going to be a great game.  
  
Q. Tara, we have the typical, quote/unquote, 1 and 2 seed playing in the
championship, but this tournament has been anything but typical. Given the
fierce level of competition that we see, how does that change anything you do
to prepare for the game or communicate with your players to make them aware
that this is not the typical tournament even though we have 1 and 2 in the
championship? "  
COACH VANDERVEER: You mean we just didn't get a pass to get to this point? Our
team has worked really hard. I think the depth of the conference, the
competitiveness has prepared us for being in the championship. And we'll carry
forward into the NCAA Tournament. But whether it's been the battle we had with
Washington, whether it was being down against Colorado, having to basically
hit a game-winning shot to beat Arizona, we have a great conference with great
teams and we know that every night we have to play well.  
  
I think that that is a good thing because you don't come out and think, oh, I
can just slop through it. It helps you develop good habits. So the depth and
competitiveness, if you don't do the right thing, you're going to lose. I
think that's good to have every night. We welcome it. So hopefully it will pay
off for us.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Ruthy Hebard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33290)

### [Maite Cazorla](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32732)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon - 88, UCLA - 83  
  
COACH GRAVES: First, I want to congratulate UCLA on a great tournament. It's
two years in a row we've played a classic against them, and it just seems like
we bring out the best in each other in the Pac-12 Tournament.  
  
But this time, again, we were able to come out on top. We're obviously excited
and happy that we get to play again and play tomorrow for another
championship. But really proud of our team. I thought tonight we really showed
our championship mettle, making plays when they really needed to. I thought we
played a good basketball game. I thought they played a good basketball game.
This was women's basketball at its highest.  
  
Q. Not statistically the strongest game for Satou, but she made so many
pivotal plays and key plays, particularly in regulation. The jump ball,
drawing the charge early on when she had three fouls. Could you speak to the
caliber of game she had, even though statistically it may not show up there?  
COACH GRAVES: And seven assists. That's probably a season high for her. I
mean, yeah, sometimes people look and maybe our third option or fourth option,
but it's nice to have someone like that be able to do what she does.  
  
I thought defensively she was really good tonight, and like you said, made
some really important plays. It won't get noticed. They'll look at the box
score, like you said, and those plays will get unnoticed.  
  
But we know what she did and her value to the team.  
  
Q. Ruthy, what was your mindset tonight, obviously missing the last UCLA
game, and knowing you had to scrap for every point, every rebound against
their post players?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, I think it's the same as every night. I wanted to come out
and give my team what I could. Yesterday we knew we were unhappy how we
played, so I think we were all ready to come out and play Duck basketball, and
I think that's what you got today.  
  
Q. Was this fun to coach this game? It seemed it was a great showcase
for women's Pac-12 basketball. But, I mean, was it fun to be part of as a
coach?  
COACH GRAVES: Maybe after the moment. It's never really fun in the heat of the
moment (laughing). I wouldn't say fun, but it's challenging. I think that's
great. I think that's when coaches and players are at their best, when the
moments are challenging and critical. Each possession for really the last
quarter-plus overtime, every possession seemed to matter big-time because
neither team could separate much from the other.  
  
But, listen, I know I have a great group, and they've bailed me out many, many
times, and they did again. I thought just Ruthy was big-time.  
  
I thought Maite, she played 45 minutes on heart, you know. On pure heart. This
kid was quarantined three, four days ago and wasn't near humanity anywhere,
and she just played 45 minutes against elite pressure.  
  
These are the ones that, man, they got it done tonight.  
  
Q. We know what Sabrina has brought all year from a tangible
perspective. Tonight, 45 minutes, key plays down the stretch. What does she
provide to your team from an intangible standpoint?  
COACH GRAVES: Everything. She had a tough shooting night. She'll be the first
to admit that. Maybe forced a few. But there's nobody we'd rather have the
ball late in the game to make a play or make a free throw or just get the
inbounds pass.  
  
I mean, she just finds a way to make the play when you need it. It's nice to
know when she doesn't have her best game that we've got certainly other
weapons. You know, that came through.  
  
But, listen, Sabrina, she's the straw that's stirring this drink and the
conductor of this orchestra. That's who she is. Again, on the biggest moments,
you can count on her.  
  
Q. Maite, obviously, you didn't have Ruthy last time you played that
team. How different a match-up is it to have her in there as an option, as a
scoring option in the post, but also to open things up for you on the
perimeter?  
MAITE CAZORLA: She's been huge, especially offensively, but defensively,
getting the rebounds, make it tough for the other team. So she's been a huge
impact.  
  
Q. Kelly, what kind of problems is UCLA going to present somebody in the
NCAA Tournament?  
COACH GRAVES: A team that's really playing with a lot of confidence right now.
They're good. They're legit. They have a lot of talent. We don't have anybody
on our team that plays like Michaela. We don't have anybody that plays like
Kennedy Burke. And Japreece Dean is as good a point guard as we've had to
play, and this is a league full of really good ones.  
  
So they are a very good team. We've talked about the keys tonight for this
game is you have to keep them off the boards. We actually had more offensive
rebounds than they did. It seemed like they got every one, but we actually had
more. And the other thing you have to do against UCLA is take care of the
ball. We only had ten turnovers. So you do that against these guys and you're
going to have a chance to win.  
  
As they go and play other teams in the NCAA Tournament, are those teams going
to be able to do that? We'll see. I've got them being a candidate to win
several games in the NCAA. That's a good team. Because we're a good team who
played well tonight, and we were pushed to the brink.  
  
Q. Maite, we know that you've been under the weather, and you were able
to play 45 minutes today. When you felt your worst earlier in the week with
the flu until now, just tell me what you've been through and what made you be
able to push through today?  
MAITE CAZORLA: I mean, on Monday and Tuesday I was literally laying in bed.
Couldn't hang out with anybody. I was in my bed. Didn't go outside at all. But
now I definitely feel better. Obviously I'm still tired, but I definitely feel
way better than how I felt before the week.  
  
Q. Kelly, you've had a lot of games over the course of this Pac-12
season where you guys have cruised a little bit, wins by 15, 20, 30, even 40.
Is it almost nice that you guys are getting counterpunched and seeing a little
bit of adversity here leading into not only this final but also toward the
NCAA Tournament? It's not as much of a cruise as points in the conference
season might have been?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, those days are over. Every opponent now is big-time. This
is postseason. It's a grind. You're not going to see those hundred-point games
and 30-point blowouts. Those are over. So we play the winner of this game, and
then NCAA Tournament teams.  
  
So they're all going to be grinder kind of games. Listen, I don't think
anybody is better in the country in an open-court game and passing and moving
and shooting it. We're the best shooting team in the country, and the best
passing team in my opinion. The numbers will prove that out.  
  
But it's nice to know that we are capable of playing the grind-it-out games,
and we've won two of them in this tournament alone. That, again, speaks for a
really talented group that knows how to win.  
  
Q. Can you speak to Morgan's night, and some enormous three-pointers
there late from her?  
COACH GRAVES: Thank you for bringing her up. You have some injuries, Taylor
Chavez. We have some confidence in Morgan, and she did it tonight. It was
really great to see. She didn't hesitate and she was confident and certainly
capable.  
  
What gets lost is she defends pretty well. She's good at the other end too. So
she's a dual threat, and we're going to need her to continue to give us those
kind of productive minutes the rest of the season.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Japreece Dean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30409)

### [Kennedy Burke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35194)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon - 88, UCLA - 83  
  
COACH CLOSE: Sorry. I love these young ladies. I'm so proud of their fight. We
have a saying in our program that you're not born for this, you're built for
this, and we talk about building a house all year long, and what do we want
our house to look like? And I think about how deeply they believed, and I
talked about this after the last press conference, but it hits me so deeply,
is that they are fighters.  
  
I told them in the locker room after the game that in November, December, when
we were starting out 3-and-5, I told them they were going to be playing at
this level on a consistent basis and be in this position would they have
thought that was okay, and they were like, yeah.  
  
I just, you know, it's a game of inches. I wish -- me as a coach, I wish I
wouldn't have gotten that T. I wish I had switched how we were playing the
pick-and-roll sooner, but it's a game of inches, and I just want to fight like
crazy just like they fought for me.  
  
Q. Great game by you guys. I know you came up short, but really great
game for women's basketball. That final possession that Kennedy drove on, what
was that supposed to be?  
COACH CLOSE: Yeah, we were trying to spread the floor, and we wanted to get
the ball to Japreece and come off the backside screen and give her space to
get to a three-point shot and spread them out as far as we could, and we
didn't execute the way we wanted to. We had executed really well on a lot of
our special situations, but that wasn't what we had in mind. So we would love
to have done that one differently.  
  
Q. Japreece, like Coach said, you started the season, it was pretty
bumpy. You put it together and you end up in this place. How long is it going
to take you to find the silver linings in this game, the way you fought
against one of the top teams in the country, and that kind of momentum heading
into the NCAA Tournament?  
JAPREECE DEAN: Coach Cori just always emphasizes just responding to whatever
happens, win or loss, we just have to get better and look at what happened on
film, and go back and practice and get better. So I think we will respond
quickly, and get ready for the NCAA Tournament.  
  
Q. Cori, you hold Sabrina to 4 of 19 shooting from the field. Just what
goes into game planning, preparing for a player of her caliber?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, she's spectacular. I mean, it's not just her ability to
shoot, it's really her ability to run the team and her passing. She's an elite
player. Most of the time that fell on Kennedy Burke, and Kennedy Burke is an
elite defender. She proved that in the way she contested shots, moved her
feet, kept people in front, blocked shots.  
  
So I credit Sabrina. I've been watching her since she was a little kid. She's
a phenomenal player. And so is Kennedy Burke, who is a phenomenal defender.  
  
But it's team basketball. Everyone playing what we call the who, we had to
play the who, what were their tendencies and know that in advance and try to
anticipate those. They're very difficult to stop. Their approach was to try to
go inside to Ruthy, and they did that well. We had to take something away, and
we were able to take that away.  
  
Q. Kennedy, you've had some real battles with this team over the years.
Getting late into a game against a team that a lot of teams just can't even
get that far against. What about this match-up brings so much out of players
on both sides as you continue to just rise to the occasion time and time
again?  
KENNEDY BURKE: Specifically with this team it just shows that we can compete
with any team in the country. It just comes from loving each other and just
being invested in each other, and just focusing on a game plan, and we did
that. We still have more to go.  
  
COACH CLOSE: The reality is we've got a great battle going, and all the
respect to what Oregon has built on their team. But also I think we showed
we've built something pretty darn special too. So proud of the level of
basketball we are playing for the nation on multiple occasions back and forth.
I'm really hopeful that not only is it great for our two teams, but it's great
to inspire little kids. It's great to grow our game, and we're proud to be a
part of that.  
  
Q. You came in projected as an 8 seed. What do you think you've proved
to the committee with your performance in this tournament, and actually for
all of you guys, really?  
COACH CLOSE: Well, I asked them to not even think about that. Their job is to
look at every day through a microscope and to think about the inches and how
they can improve. And it's my job to look at the telescope. So I'm going to
let them pass on that.  
  
I just think that from the eye test to how we've been playing the last 15
games to what we did, some people said, oh, it wasn't that big a deal. You
went into mat court and beat them at No. 2 because they didn't have Ruthy. I
think we proved today that we can play at a pretty high level when they've got
Ruthy. We've got a lot of people to contend with as well.  
  
So I'm very hopeful that not only our body of work, but our trajectory in the
last several games, as well as how we passed the eye test in the last several
games, I'm very hopeful the committee will see that and seed us accordingly.  
  
Q. Japreece, you were pretty emotional after the game, and Coach Cori
and Coach Kelly came up to you afterwards. Do you want to shed some light on
what they said to you?  
JAPREECE DEAN: Coach Cori just told me to move on and keep leading the team
because it was a great game, and we just have more basketball to play, and I
think that's what she really emphasizes is that this is not the end.  
  
And Coach Kelly just -- I mean, he just said that I brought this team a long
way.  
  
Q. There's a lot of emotion up here tonight, and it looks like a little
bit of hurt. Why do you think this one hurts?  
COACH CLOSE: Because we believed, and we didn't come in happy to be here. We
didn't come in -- that's a credit to Oregon, but we didn't come in being, oh,
we've come so far. We expected to win. And, you know, the chemistry of this
team is what has been our backbone the entire year.  
  
Even back -- I remember at Pac-12 Media Day that Kennedy and Lajahna talked
about how the closeness of this team and the commitment to relationships, and
that has been what you built.  
  
What I told them in the locker room is when you love deeply, it hurts more.
But would you have it any other way? When you invest deeply, it's going to
really sting when you're disappointed, but that's how you have peace, because
you finished empty.  
  
I'm very proud of the way they have finished empty and the commitment to
themselves and the way that they fought and the way that they believed. We
will respond and we will let this experience propel us to even something
greater. And we will let this experience teach our hearts, and I believe that
we'll be possessions and inches better because of the way we will respond from
the hurt.  
  
Q. I know obviously it hurts right now, but was this a fun game to be
part of? It was exciting and thrilling. And obviously you came up short, but
was it fun to be out there playing in this game?  
KENNEDY BURKE: Yeah, I think it was a lot of fun on both ends of the floor,
even though both teams were up and down. It was just a lot of fun just
fighting together and just being there for each other.  
  
JAPREECE DEAN: Yeah, I would agree with KB. It's a great game, great team, and
I think it's going to prepare us for March.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Jody Wynn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34197)

### [Missy Peterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36612)

### [Amber Melgoza](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34706)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Washington - 68, Oregon State - 67  
  
COACH WYNN: What a game. A few years back I saw a guy go from a D-III head
coaching job and take over an Oregon State team that was depleted, and he was
able to convince some great players to come to Corvallis and turn that thing
around, and I always admired that.  
  
You know, I was trying to build a program myself at Long Beach State with
incredible fan support. I just have always admired the way that Scott has gone
about building his team, and he's such an incredible strategist. I never
really told him, but we got the chance to play against his team in Corvallis
my last year at Long Beach, and our gutty little 49ers had a chance to pull
off the biggest upset in 90 years in an NCAA tournament.  
  
And I just was saying like, you know, this is why I do what I do to empower
young women and give them an opportunity to do something that is great and
that will stick with them the rest of their lives and maybe do something that
they don't believe they can do.  
  
Coming here to Washington, you know, everybody says all the stars have
graduated, you've inherited kids that might not have had an opportunity to
play ever Division I basketball, a couple walk-ons that are now on scholarship
on our team playing out here tonight.  
  
It takes time to build a program, but when you have incredible women that have
high character and they check their egos at the door, you know, and they just
want to learn and want to get better, and truly appreciate all the small
things that these guys do, you know, it's pretty awesome to see them be able
to achieve the reward of the scoreboard for all their hard work.  
  
It's really difficult to win at the Division I level. I'm sure at every level,
especially in the greatest conference in the country. You know, we only had
two coming into this tournament, and everybody wrote us off and an easy out,
whatever. But when you have a group of people that believe in each other and
love each other and inspire one another, I learn so much from these guys every
day.  
  
I'm just incredibly proud of their courageous effort. I'm proud of their
resiliency. I'm proud of their coachability. And I admire their team
chemistry. Sorry, that was long-winded.  
  
Q. Take us through that last five seconds, from the play, the shot, the
technical foul. That probably felt like an eternity, but just walk through
that last few seconds.  
COACH WYNN: Well, it was sideline out of bounds, and we drew up a screen-to-
screener action for this one right here. And our best inbounder all year long,
or actually for two years, has been Missy Peterson. I just trust her with the
ball in her hands.  
  
We did a screen-to-screener action, and we said they're going to switch a lot
of stuff, so if we can't get it to Breezy, Mai-Loni flash back to the ball,
and she's going to step in. And she's a basketball player, Missy is. She's not
a robot. She just plays free and makes decisions, and they went to a zone. We
set a pin screen for J-Mo. We set a screen to screener. We couldn't get it in
to Amber, and we were able to get it back to somebody with ice in her veins.
She's just a gutty, a gutty girl. Yeah, she knocked an incredible shot down.  
  
I think the inbounder is usually the most dangerous player on the floor in a
situation like that. She just moves so well when the ball's not in her hands.
So she stepped up and made a big-time shot. And then we got a technical. We
get excited somebody said. I think it was you that said like you celebrated
yesterday like you won a National Championship. You're darn right we did. Why
not? Wins are hard to get. My goodness, you know, this is a tough gig we've
got. It's hard to get wins in this league.  
  
So, yeah, we got a little too happy on the sidelines. The officials made the
right call.  
  
Q. Missy and Amber, wins have been pretty hard to come by especially in
the last few weeks. To put these two games together back-to-back in this
tournament, just both of you kind of talk about what it means? How it feels?  
AMBER MELGOZA: It's amazing. We couldn't have done it without our coaches.
Just the UW staff in general and my teammates obviously. But we've obviously
had a tough season. We've just worked so hard, and we've had so much toughness
and grit, and just heart. I thought that the last couple weeks almost, we've
really focused on our defense, and I think that's something that's really
going to carry us on and carried us on in this game for a win.  
  
MISSY PETERSON: Yeah, adding on to that, we've battled through a lot of
adversity this season, but one thing that has always remained the same is how
together we are, our team, our coaching staff, everyone supporting us. We
never quit on each other. We never gave up on each other despite our record.
Even when things got hard, we kept our heads up. We see behind closed doors
how good this team is and how bright our future is.  
  
So these last couple games, you know, we weren't ready for our season to be
over, and we laid everything out we've got on that floor. We pulled it off two
games in a row, and I couldn't be happier about it. It's even better to do it
with the people that you love, so it's great.  
  
Q. Missy, Coach certainly gave the Xs and Os of that last sequence. From
your perspective, what is going through your mind when the ball finds its way
to you there and you make the shot? Obviously, there is enormous jubilation,
but the chaos that falls there after. But sticking before that, the ball gets
there, and you make it. What's going through your mind in those couple
seconds?  
MISSY PETERSON: Yeah, when I had the ball out of bounds, the first thing I
noticed was when they were kind of sagging off in a two-three zone, I waited a
little and tried to see what was going on in the screening action. You could
they were really (indiscernible). So the second I saw Mai, they weren't
looking at me throwing the ball in. So I hit Mai and I knew their eyes were on
Amber and Jenna and the rest of the shooters on the floor. I stepped in and
didn't realize I was as deep as I was. But at that point, you've got to let it
fly. When it went in, it was a great feeling.  
  
Q. Obviously a tremendous win for you guys. But had any number of things
in those final 30 seconds gone another way, we'd be talking in a little
different way about what Hannah did in the last 30 seconds in two instances.
What do you say to her here in this spot? It's easier after a win, for sure,
but what do you say to her about what was an inexplicable shot and then
leaving the bench?  
COACH WYNN: These are young student-athletes that are trying to learn every
day, you know? Nobody's a professional. And Hannah's going to be a great coach
one day. She wants to be a coach, and she's going to be a great coach.  
  
It's certainly easier to talk about it now, but it's a life lesson. We talk
about life lessons all the time. We talk about who we're becoming as women and
the character that we're building. So I call them kids because I'm a mom and I
have two kids, and these kids sometimes do things like make great shots and
big plays, and sometimes make mistakes.  
  
You know, she's just -- if you know Hannah Johnson, she has an incredible
heart. I mean, she'd give her shirt off her back to anybody, and she was just
so proud of her teammates, and you can't fault that. You just can't, you know.  
  
You know, she got a little excited on the break, and she was open, and she
just got a little excited. That's all. But it's a life lesson, you know. She's
going to be a coach, and she's going to talk about time and score to her
players for the rest of her life, and staying on the bench (laughing) .  
  
Q. For Amber, last season around this time you guys lost in the first
round to Cal, but it was a very close game. You had, I think, 30 points. Was
that in the back of your mind anytime this week, thinking that I don't want to
go out like that and we have to perform down the stretch so we can continue?  
AMBER MELGOZA: Yeah, definitely. I look at it as like a new season for us.
After the game losing against Cal, it was kind of -- it was a little
frustrating and it was sad. But I think that made everyone who was coming back
very hungry. And just to prove people wrong; that we're meant to be here and
meant to be playing in March.  
  
I just thought that I just carried on each day, each practice, each film
session and each workout in general throughout spring, to summer, into season,
we've all come together and worked really hard. I think that was just really
showing what we have done through the off-season and during the season.  
  
Q. Missy, have you hit a game-winning shot like that before? Obviously
not as much on the line, but in your high school career or some other point?  
MISSY PETERSON: Yeah, I have. I've hit two.  
  
COACH WYNN: She's got ice in her veins, guys.  
  
MISSY PETERSON: I've hit two before in high school. One was a lay-up, one was
a three. A game-winning shot is always one of the best feelings in the world.
But at this level, and with this team, and everything we went through, I think
this was probably the funnest game I've ever played in my life.  
  
Q. I don't know if you guys have been on social media yet, but the men's
team --  
MISSY PETERSON: Yeah, we saw that.  
  
AMBER MELGOZA: That's so amazing.  
  
Q. What's it like to have their support through this as they're going to
gear up for this next week?  
AMBER MELGOZA: When I first watched it, it gave me chills. It was just amazing
to see like the men's team, we're so close to them and we have such a cool
connection with them. It's just so cool to see them just cheering for us, and
getting so, I guess you could say, hyped for us. It was awesome to see that
video.  
  
MISSY PETERSON: Yeah, those guys are like our brothers. We see them every day.
We look up to them in many ways. They're a great team, and we love watching
them. To be able to have them support us, especially through all the ups and
downs that we've been through this season, and all the people that might have
given up on us or continued to doubt us, that's a men's team who is just so
well experienced and just a group of great guys.  
  
Just to see them supporting us and cheering us on means the world, and we love
it.  
  
AMBER MELGOZA: Get the W tomorrow.  
  
MISSY PETERSON: Yeah, they need that.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Tara VanDerveer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14565)

### [Kiana Williams](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34751)

### [Shannon Coffee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36639)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Stanford - 72, Cal - 54  
  
COACH VANDERVEER: A tough game for us. It's not just that Cal is a very
talented team with great players and great coaching staff, but, you know,
they're our rival, and it just brings out the best in both teams.  
  
I thought we played really, we played very well defensively. Anytime you can
hold Kristine Anigwe to 14 points, you're doing a great job. And a lot of that
is Shannon and Maya, Alanna a little bit, too, but team defense. I thought our
fourth quarter really just we really just opened it up, and that was a great
fourth quarter. I think that was a reflection of a lot of our depth. Able to
play Lexie, Lacie, bring in -- I thought Anna, three rebounds in 11 minutes, a
lot of different people contributed.  
  
Q. Tara, did you do something different with Kristine this time than the
previous two games?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I don't think it was really different. We just, you know, we
just -- I thought we were just more aggressive. I think having played against
her a couple times you saw what didn't work. We just tried to really be
physical.  
  
I think it does make a difference the fact that they played a game yesterday,
and the fourth quarter, I felt like we were able to run, get out and get some
transition baskets and attack the basket. Just I think it's different having
-- when they play a back-to-back game. We earned that by our seed, and I think
we took advantage of it.  
  
Q. Tara, you talk about the defense on Kristine, and the threes she hit,
I think it's only the sixth of the season, and that started that run for the
season. How big a shot is that for somebody that doesn't take that many threes
for you?  
COACH VANDERVEER: Early on in practice Shannon was shooting the best three-
point percentage on our team. So I personally have a lot of confidence in her
three, and I like the fact that she's not a gunner. She takes the three when
we need the three. Not just coming down and thinking I'm going to shoot,
shoot, shoot.  
  
So I was not surprised at all. I was happy to see it go in, obviously. But it
wasn't just that. Her whole play was fantastic. She was facilitating our
offense. She was talking out there and very calm and just really mature. I
thought she was the glue, and Ki also, to making our whole thing work.  
  
But the three was fitting because she has a knack for making threes against
Bears. Like she had a couple threes, three against Baylor against UCLA. I tell
her every game we're playing the Bears. We have kind of a little bit -- maybe
it's my joke, but I think it's funny.  
  
But I am so proud of Shannon. She's worked so hard. She's been kind of a role
player for three years. This year she's really stepped up and made some big
plays for us. She played behind Kaylee Johnson or maybe Nadia, and she's
saying, hey, it's my turn, and she's doing a great job for us. And just a
great leader. It's really exciting to see her have such a big game.  
  
Q. Can we talk about the mask for a minute? How long have you been
wearing the mask this year?  
SHANNON COFFEE: Since the Baylor game, so quite a while.  
  
Q. So you got hit? Did you break your nose?  
SHANNON COFFEE: I'm just kind of -- I don't really want to get hit again. I'm
down in the battlefield there with a lot of elbows going around. So it's just
kind of preventive.  
  
Q. So I have a question about the clear mask versus the black mask that
you're wearing. Is there a difference in terms of peripheral vision, or does
it change anything to have the solid mask?  
SHANNON COFFEE: Yeah, the black mask is a lot closer to my face. So I have a
lot better vision with that mask, so I feel more comfortable in it.  
  
Q. Going into a match-up with Kristine, it seemed like you were able to
get into her a lot physically and made sure she did not get too deep. How much
was that part of your approach, and how do you keep a level head in that
match-up knowing it's the kind of player where she's going to make some plays
and you have to tip your cap some of the time?  
SHANNON COFFEE: Yeah, definitely doing my work early. That is the thing that
Tara likes to say a lot. I like to start the contact at the free-throw line.
Not let her get to where she wants to be. I kind of went into the game knowing
that there was going to be a lot more physicality than some other games. She's
a great player. She's going to make shots, so when she does, I can't hang my
head. I just have to focus on the next play. So that's what I focused on doing
as well.  
  
Q. Kiana, when Shannon hit that shot, you guys were only up by three
points, and you won by 18 points. Was that a turning point in your mind as far
as confidence to say, we got this?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: Absolutely, I said that in the previous interview. Shannon
shot with like three minutes in the fourth, and that just carried us to the
end of the game. Like Tara said, she has a knack for making shots against
Bears, and we needed that shot. It was huge, so we rode her the rest of the
fourth quarter.  
  
Q. I was a two-part question, do you have a thing against Bears? And I
thought you passed up a couple threes earlier in the quarter. And was that
one, you were open, I should take it? Is there a reason you took that one
versus a few seconds earlier where you were open and didn't shoot it?  
SHANNON COFFEE: Yeah, that I can think of, I don't think I necessarily have
anything against Bears like in real life.  
  
But on the court it seems I do. But looking at it, I think there was a better
play that could be made. Like Tara says, I'm not out there gunning. I know I
have confidence in my teammates to create some other plays. So I'm kind of out
there facilitating, trying to run the offense and get the best shot there is
possible. So when the time came, I took my shot.  
  
Q. Kiana, you had two of those big buckets at the end there as Alanna
was waiting to come into the game. But as you play extended stretches without
her, how much do you say I need to create some opportunities for us to score
because maybe she isn't there to take some of the possessions that she
normally would?  
KIANA WILLIAMS: I think I was just playing within the flow of our offense.
Like you said, Alanna wasn't in, and she's our best player on our team, so
when she's out the game, other people have to make plays, and I made some
shots. Made some plays. Shannon handed it off to me. I think I got a lay-up.
So just playing within the offense, and not trying to do too much.  
  
Q. Tara, speaking again of the margin of victory, the game wasn't really
that wide open, you know. Of course you guys were only leading by three when
she hit that shot. What is the importance of closing a game out like this in a
tournament so late in the season? And just being really strong like that?  
COACH VANDERVEER: I think the fourth quarter, again, we were able to play a
lot of people, and they had their legs for their shots and made big shots. Our
field goal percentage is really good. Our defense was really good. Again,
they're a really talented team, so we knew we had to play really hard and play
really well, and we just had to keep playing that way for 40 minutes.  
  
We talked about the fact it was going to be a 40-minute game and not be over
in the first five minutes or ten minutes or even halftime. But I just credit
our team to stay with things and keep working hard. Really play hard for each
other, and it was a very big win for our team and our program.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Charli Turner Thorne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30388)

### [Reili Richardson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35156)

### [Sophia Elenga](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36623)

### [Kianna Ibis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34725)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UCLA - 73, ASU - 69  
  
COACH TURNER THORNE: All right. Thank you. Well, first of all, I just want to
thank everybody here at the MGM in Vegas. I want to thank the Pac-12 for
putting on the tournament. It's always first class. You guys do a great job.
We really appreciate it.  
  
As for the game, I mean, we're very disappointed. We're not a team that turns
the ball over, which is very uncharacteristic of us today. And we're not a
team that fouls, so we were just not a disciplined team that we normally are.
So it's a little tough to swallow, but give UCLA credit. They're playing
really well. Very aggressive team. They made some plays when we didn't, and
they're going to do really well in the tournament, as will we.  
  
I thought we had a great weekend last weekend, and came back this weekend. The
break will do us a really -- the break will be really good for us just to kind
of, I think, get our offense going on all cylinders. Again, just the things
today, this team has been amazing all year long at not putting people on the
free-throw line and not turning the ball over. So tough day for us in that
regard.  
  
Q. Can you talk about the fight your team had today? From what I've
heard, it's kind of what it's been all year, but to be down 13 in the first
half, 14 in the third, and battle back down 9 with a few minutes left and
battle back. Just the resilience this team showed?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, thanks. Incredibly resilient team. You add
discipline to that, and we can beat anybody in the country, and we know it.  
  
So we do have that. We're experienced. I mean, these players have played the
best teams. Played four, five top 5 teams in the country. There's nothing they
haven't seen. We haven't usually been down this much. Usually we're back and
forth. But we are tough, we're resilient. We do know how to make plays at the
end of the game, so we're going to be very confident going into the NCAA
Tournament.  
  
Q. Reili, because you primarily run the offense, how would you say
communication was on the floor today?  
REILI RICHARDSON: I think we were just inside our heads too much. So that
affected the whole team. I think we need to carry more energy to our team and
make sure we feel each other on the court.  
  
Q. Charli, the bench had 25 points today, what was it about the
performance, and how important is that moving into the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, really important for us. Especially with the
offense. We're getting Jamie Ruden back healthy, so that's huge. Sophia is
playing hands down the best basketball of her career right now, and she was
amazing today. So, I know if we, you know -- with this little bit of practice,
I'm very excited. Because I know Reili and Ki, they're better if they can be
at 27 minutes or so, and not plus minutes. So that's going to be key for us.  
  
Q. Sophia, you had easily one of the best games of your career today.
Can you kind of just elaborate a little bit on what your thought process was
coming into this game, and what really clicked for you in that second half
when you guys were on that big comeback?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: You should have saw her against Louisville? I'm just
saying.  
  
SOPHIA ELENGA: Thank you. I think just coming into this game it's like
postseason, like what you did before doesn't matter. Like you came here with
your recourse, just especially as a senior, just don't think about anything,
just play. I mean, it's either you win or you lose and you go back home.  
  
So just really playing all out, not thinking about everything else and just
really wanted to make it for the team and just feel my team and just play
every minute like it was the last minute because tough games are coming soon
too. Just want to enjoy it as much as I can.  
  
Q. Coach, what are some of the early issues you had in the game that
allowed them to go on such a big run early on?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: We just got off to a slow start. Really, our defense. We
weren't locked in. We were switching screens we shouldn't have switched. We
were playing soft. So we let them throw the first punch and kind of jump on
us. And then we came down. We didn't get terrible shots, but we kind of
settled. They like to come out pressuring, so we talked about it, hey, let's
really jam it down their throats, and we kind of settled. So we weren't really
going well on either end of the floor to start the game.  
  
We settled down. We fought back.  
  
Q. Kianna, what got you into foul trouble so quickly?  
KIANNA IBIS: I would just say that maybe I was just not really focused and
wasn't ready most of the time, I guess. Just a little undisciplined. Yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, UCLA had 40 points in the paint. What are some of the
takeaways you guys can have after playing such an inside oriented offense,
especially a team like UCLA that only took like four threes altogether?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, usually we're really good at that, and that was our
game plan, don't give them lay-ups. So we know what we need to do, we just
didn't do it. And usually, we're very good at it.  
  
Q. Kianna, how did you feel today physically?  
KIANNA IBIS: Well, I mean, I bet everybody in the Pac-12 right now is feeling
-- it's the end of the season. Everybody's feeling a little beat up and sore
and stuff. I just have to play through it better.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Scott Rueck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24817)

### [Taya Corosdale](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35196)

### [Mikayla Pivec](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32690)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Washington - 68, Oregon State - 67  
  
COACH RUECK: From Beaver Nation, walking out and seeing so much orange
reminded us of Seattle, honestly. Just an honor to have a fan base that
supports us the way they do. Wondered what it would be like down here, and it
was unreal. Just to see that much orange, and for that reason, that's what I'm
most disappointed about is letting those people down tonight, which I kind of
feel like we did.  
  
All the credit in the world to Washington, though. They played a phenomenal
game. They hit huge shots all game long, answered everything we did. I told
Jody before the game last night I was impressed by the way they played, not
only did they play like they had nothing to lose, they executed, and they kept
it up. So it's a funny thing that happens in March, especially in conference
tournaments is that you get hope.  
  
So for teams that there's no postseason beyond this unless they win it, you
get hope, and hope is a powerful thing.  
  
They clearly are playing with a renewed energy and with a lot of passion. So
it was an impressive performance. These two next to me did everything they
could to get us going. I was so proud of them and our team in general, of
course. But you've got to give all the credit in the world to Washington for
finding a way to win tonight.  
  
Q. For the players, in that bizarre final sequence there, after they hit
the three, would you have preferred -- while the technical was correct, would
you have preferred to get a clean shot? And, Scott, same thing. Would you have
preferred, frankly, for them to even ignore -- while the call was correct,
would you prefer in that moment, rather than to get set in the delay, and I'm
sure you guys were somewhat stunned, to just try to get a clean shot in that
spot?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: I would have preferred getting a stop defensively, but after
she hit that shot, we probably wouldn't have gotten a great look up if we had
gone right away. So two more points gets a little closer.  
  
TAYA COROSDALE: Yeah, as Mik said, getting a nice, executed shot would have
been ideal.  
  
COACH RUECK: I thought we had a chance while they were laying on the ground
nobody was playing defense. So look up, throw the ball, you're two dribbles
from a lay-up, and you can do that in two seconds. So I was trying to tell
them to go, go, we hadn't heard a whistle yet. They're distracted.  
  
But it was odd. That was the first time we've been in a situation this year
without a timeout in that situation, which is so weird in the women's game.
There are so few baseline out-of-bounds situations where you're going the
length of the floor anymore, and it's very odd.  
  
So the whole thing was chaotic, odd. And I'm with Mik: Get a stop, and you
don't have to worry about it.  
  
Q. It seemed you guys had them not dead and buried but in pretty good
shape for you in the first half. You're up 14, and everything was going your
way. What changed to get them back in this game to have what happened
happen?  
COACH RUECK: Well, scoring drought. We just talked about that in the locker
room. You can't give a team hope. That's the word of the day, I guess. In a
situation where we're in control, they switched their zone and that gave us
trouble, and we did not respond to the zone.  
  
We had some reserves in at the time. I subbed our first group back after a
couple -- after a couple of their stops, but then we still could not generate
offense. We still had a lead, but it was different, of course, than before. So
we just didn't adapt to their defense like we needed to.  
  
Q. Mikayla, did you feel like the longer they stayed in it, the more
confident they were getting as it stayed close and it was getting later in the
game? And did the opposite happen for you guys? Did you feel like you were
getting tentative the longer they stayed in it?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: I think definitely on their part they felt more and more
confident as the clock got to zero. You could feel it from the crowd, from the
bench, from the people on the court after Missy hit that shot, all of them
collapsed on the ground.  
  
But I think us, I don't think it was more tentative. I think as we got closer
to the end we were more aggressive because we realized we need urgency, and we
should have played like that the whole game. We attacked, and it was too late
because they had gotten ahead of us.  
  
Q. I realize this is going to be hard to shift the attention so quick
after a loss like this. But you guys were projected to be in the top 16, this
is certainly the worse loss on paper for the season. What is your message not
only to your team, but if you want to say anything to the committee at this
point about where your program stands relative to trying to stay in that top
16 seeds?  
COACH RUECK: Well, I think if you look at our resumé, it's pretty good. This
is the only loss outside the top 20 RPI, and three of our losses are to top
five or six -- Notre Dame, Oregon, Stanford, two on the road -- you know,
against those.  
  
So what this team has done, if you look at the success all year long, the
resumé, I think it's strong. I think everybody knows March Madness is a bit
odd. And you look at this game, look what it took to beat us. I don't know.
Those things are out of my hands. I don't know all of it. But based upon what
this team has done and the fact this is a conference tournament, if we didn't
host, I think that would be criminal.  
  
Q. On the play that Missy hit that three on, what were you guys figuring
they were going to do? It seemed like it was a pretty good play by them to get
it right back to her with the deep three that she had?  
COACH RUECK: Yeah, we assumed they'd go to the rim. That was one part of it,
anyway. We assumed maybe an on-ball screen. There was still five seconds, so
there was time to make a play. That was clearly a quick look. We still had 2.3
on the clock. Where she shot it from, I mean, we were in the vicinity. It was
somewhat contested.  
  
In that situation it's kind of pick your poison a little bit. If you extend
out, they can throw it behind the second level of your defense and get a
better look. It's not often you see a shot like that go down though. That's
pretty rare. In my career I'm trying to think if I've been beaten by a three
like that. I can't remember.  
  
Sabrina hit a huge one against us in Gil last year, but it was off the bounce,
off the top. This one was just kind of a gutsy move, a gutsy shot in that
situation.  
  
I'll have to look at it again, but to me it seemed like it was somewhat
contested even, so great shot.  
  
Q. For Taya and Mikayla, to have now a game like this over, can you
recall a time where you've seen especially Katie and Aleah miss this many good
looks? Like I said, now that this game is over, how much can you take from
this to maybe apply this to the tournament to say there may be another night
where some of the shots aren't going, and we have to find a way to play
through it, or find a way to get buckets?  
MIKAYLA PIVEC: I would say it was definitely uncharacteristic to miss that
many good looks. We got a lot of great looks from the three-point line, but
when that isn't falling, we need to attack the rim and get to the X and get
lay-ups because we know those are a much higher percentage shot.  
  
TAYA COROSDALE: Yeah, and I think everybody else just needs to step up and
play their role and do everything you can to get a win at that point.  
  
COACH RUECK: It's basketball. There's nights like that.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Kelly Graves](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23609)

### [Ruthy Hebard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33290)

### [Sabrina Ionescu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32677)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon - 77, Arizona - 63  
  
COACH GRAVES: Sure, yeah, we've played a few like this and done well in those
grinder kind of games. This was certainly one of them. We didn't get it going,
we weren't moving the ball like we normally do and shooting it as well as we
normally do. Even though our percentage was good, it wasn't from the three-
point line.  
  
But, yeah, we can play those kind of games. There's no question about it. But
I think sometimes even as a coach, you just didn't have that feel of a typical
Duck game, but in the end it was a convincing win.  
  
Q. Sabrina, obviously McDonald led the Pac-12 in scoring this year. But
what was it like going against her? It seemed she was pretty determined to go
against you guys, and how hard is it to beat that team three times in a row?  
SABRINA IONESCU: She's one of the best guards in our conference. We knew that
going in and we knew she was going to go in and try to prove something. But we
knew we had to stop her as a team, and that's what we tried to do tonight. If
we couldn't stop her, we had to limit their other options, and I think we did
that pretty well tonight. But we're going to learn, she did go off for 30-plus
points. So we are going to learn from our mistakes and continue to grow.  
  
Q. Sabrina, I understand you were facilitating in Maite's planet 100
percent. But what was it offensively that it seemed ball movement wasn't
particularly good? There were a high number of turnovers. I understand Maite
was playing through sickness, but it seemed you were out of sync for a good
portion of the game.  
SABRINA IONESCU: It might have been those first-game jitters. We're all super
nervous and honestly excited to get out there and play. And I think that
definitely took that play into this game. But we'll be fine. Maite will come
back tomorrow better than she did today, and we'll have players step up and
play Duck basketball.  
  
Q. Ruthy, James mentioned Maite being sick. Coach said the other day it
would probably be after the season before you're back to a hundred percent
with the knee and everything. How much did it feel like you were battling
through today and had to kind of grind this one out?  
RUTHY HEBARD: Yeah, being not a hundred percent definitely sucks. But we did a
good job of staying together, and we're going to do that for the rest of the
season.  
  
Q. Just to piggyback off that, Coach, how nice was it to just kind of
see an almost classic Ruthy performance right on the first game here in the
tournament?  
COACH GRAVES: Yeah, no question about it. 9 for 11, that's kind of what we've
come to expect from her. I thought we did a better job in the second half of
getting her the basketball. And, you know, that made a big difference.  
  
So our shooting percentage on the night actually was really good thanks to
her, but it was those outside shots we weren't getting. But Ruthy's a force,
there is no question about it. When she's playing at her best, she's one of
the best post players in the country, certainly.  
  
Q. Kelly, I understand this may be a strange question given the rebound
margin, but how did you feel about the defensive intensity? Because I know
you're not a team that's necessarily going to force the issue and apply a ton
of pressure at times. But just seemed like you guys were willing to sit back a
lot and allow slower passes to get there and rebounding, though the margin was
high, just didn't seem like you guys were necessarily really pushing it that
hard?  
COACH GRAVES: Little step slow I thought all night long. Defensively I don't
think we were as connected as we need to be certainly. Yeah, you know, still
plus 17 on the boards, you're going to take that. They shot 40% from the
field? You're going to take that. It seemed worse than it really was when you
look at the numbers.  
  
But I agree, it just seemed like something a little bit that was missing. To
your point about the 13 turnovers, you said turnovers were high. Well, that is
high for us. There are a lot of teams in this country that wish they could
only turn it over 13 times against a team that pressures you. But, again,
that's the bar that we've set for ourselves. When we get more than eight, nine
or ten, it's like, wow, what happened?  
  
So, you know, it's just one of those nights that just didn't feel like a
14-point win.  
  
Q. You guys have played some memorable games against UCLA the last
couple years. Just kind of what are your thoughts on getting ready for them in
the semifinals?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, yeah, they're good. They're playing so much better now
than they did when we played them in January, and they obviously beat us a few
weeks ago in Eugene.  
  
Yeah, they're just so aggressive. We didn't do so well against tonight's
pressure, and we're going to see it tonight, plus another level tomorrow. So
we're going to have to make sure that we pass it to the team. Are we in white
tomorrow?  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Green.  
  
COACH GRAVES: No, we're white. We have to pass to the team in white. Because
when you turn it over against UCLA, they're quicker, they're more athletic
than we are, and we can't catch them. We can't catch them. But if we take care
of the ball and spread the floor and do the things that we normally do, then,
you know, I think we're going to be okay. But, hey, make no mistake, these
guys are good.  
  
We're a little bit different. Last time we didn't play them with Ruthy, so we
can show them something a little bit different than we did last game.  
  
Q. The head coach of the Arizona State women's basketball team, Charli
Turner Thorne, stated yesterday, quote, "The Pac-12 is the best women's
basketball conference in the country." I was just curious what are your
thoughts on that comment? Do you agree with it? How do you feel that that
comment holds up nationally against the other teams?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, since I didn't play every other team in all the other
conferences, I can't say definitively that that's the case. However, I will
say that we're certainly one of the elite conferences, and in my opinion, I
think, the best.  
  
When you look at it in terms of how many teams have potential to go to a Final
Four, perhaps win a National Championship, yeah, we have teams that can do
that. We have a multiple number of team that's can get to the second weekend
and perhaps beyond.  
  
But we haven't played Notre Dame, and we haven't played Louisville, and we
haven't played Connecticut, and we haven't played those teams. So I think
that's a bold statement, but we're certainly one of the best, there is no
question. That's why we love Charli.  
  
Q. Sabrina, you've got Bill Laimbeer sitting courtside, obviously the
local franchise here's No. 1 overall pick. There is a lot of speculation. How
have you blocked all that out and led your team towards the Pac-12 Tournament
toward the NCAA Tournament?  
SABRINA IONESCU: Yeah, that didn't really cross my mind. I wasn't looking
around trying to see who was watching our game. I just knew we had to come out
and get this win and do it collectively.  
  
Like we were talking about, I don't think it was pretty, but we stuck together
and fought, and that's what March is going to take. But all that other outside
stuff, whoever is watching, I'm not paying attention to that. I probably would
have played the same exact way if Obama was here.  
  
COACH GRAVES: Who?  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Obama.  
  
COACH GRAVES: Where did that come from?  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: I'm just saying like I'm not changing the way I play because
somebody's sitting there. You all know what I mean. Don't type --  
  
COACH GRAVES: He was a baller too.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: I know. Don't type some weird stuff.  
  
COACH GRAVES: I wonder if he could have kept Aari under 34?  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Next. Why are you roasting us up here?  
  
COACH GRAVES: It's collective. You said it was a collective win.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: Right, you're included.  
  
COACH GRAVES: Exactly (laughing).  
  
Q. Just looking at how you guys kind of tightened up in terms of
turnovers from first half to second, was that a scheme adjustment that you
guys kind of walked through in halftime, or was that more just kind of taking
a deep breath, letting nerves kind of settle in now that you're out here?  
RUTHY HEBARD: I think it was more letting nerves settle in, like Coach said.
We don't usually have that many turnovers. So letting the nerves settle in and
playing the basketball we know how to play helped us with turnovers.  
  
Q. Congrats on the win tonight. It's also International Women's Day, so
I wanted to ask each of you if you could shout out a woman that has offered
you great mentorship or inspiration.  
COACH GRAVES: Great question.  
  
RUTHY HEBARD: My mom. Yeah, she's a great woman.  
  
SABRINA IONESCU: That's what I was going to say. But honestly, I mean, shout
out to every woman in this room, every woman that's trying to empower women,
and every man that's trying to empower women. I got you. We're back on good
terms now.  
  
COACH GRAVES: I love these two. My team inspires me each and every day. That's
the honest truth.  
  
Q. Kelly, big fan base here today. Just how in your tenure as head
coach, how have you watched the program grow into now one of the better fan
bases in the country?  
COACH GRAVES: Well, they're here to see that good-looking coach. No, they're
here because they love this team, and they play with so much passion and
heart, and they're unselfish. I believe they play the right way.  
  
So I think they have endeared -- this team has endeared themselves to our fan
base, and they appreciate what they see each and every game. They're
accessible. You should see them after games taking pictures, signing
autographs. It's not easy. But they do that. That's what wins the fans, you
know. They want that connection.  
  
So that and the fact that we're a pretty good basketball team. It's no secret,
that's what does it. But this is a fantastic, fantastic group of young women
who play hard, they play for each other, and they play very unselfish
basketball.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

### [Kristine Anigwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30389)

### [Recee Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36608)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Stanford - 72, Cal - 54  
  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Really tough one for us. Thought we had a great opportunity
there. I'm extremely proud of the way our kids fought, and I told them in the
locker room, what I'm proud of is that 4 for 15, 2 for 15, 2 for 10 from three
of our starters will never happen again. It just won't happen again. To have a
one-possession game speaks to how they bought into our messages about being
better against Stanford, how they hung tough when it was hard.  
  
I think we're going to get a shot against a team of this caliber in the NCAA
tournament at some point, maybe in the first round, second round, whatever it
is. And I think we're going to be ready because of the way that we approached
this.  
  
Credit Stanford, they did enough to win the game. They frustrated us on the
offensive end, and we figured it out too late, I think. And we had a couple
break downs on defense that they capitalized.  
  
Kianna had just some dagger threes that were huge, so credit to them. I'm
proud of our players. I'm really proud of the fact that they won games we
needed to win when our backs were against the wall. So we'll be playing in the
NCAA tournament, and have another shot to do something really special, which I
think this team is capable of.  
  
Q. It seemed you guys kept on battling back to get within one within
two, but couldn't get that lead to maybe put some more pressure on them. Then
I think you were down three, and Coffee hit a three, which was only her sixth
of the year. Was that a big thing? You couldn't get over the hump to put a
little more pressure on them?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Exactly. We were down. We had the early lead, and we were down
3 at the half. They came out, we didn't start the second half great. And we
could have folded when we were down 7. Called a timeout, and battled back, and
it was at three for a while.  
  
I genuinely felt if we could get over that hump, we'd tie it and win the game.
It puts some pressure on them. I thought there were a couple big turnarounds.
There was the one where there was a questionable non-call and got the three-
point play and that extended it to five, and we were down two, and came right
back and hit a three, and it was at two again, and then when we had several
possessions where it was down three, I thought we were going to hit a three,
you know. We had it cooking here with these two, and two-man actions and I
thought we were going to get over the hump, and we didn't.  
  
And credit to them, when you have the chances and you don't take advantage, a
great team is going to eventually do what they need to do.  
  
Q. You're ninth from the floor. How much of that was Stanford and the
game plan you knew what they were going to come with, and how much was things
you thought just didn't fall tonight?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Stanford always comes with a really good game plan. And I was
ready for the intensity of the defense, and personally like I've been playing
really well against Stanford this season, so I knew they were going to try
something different.  
  
I think our guards, well, our guards shot really well tonight. Recee was 7 for
15, like you can't really guard that. I think if we would have capitalized
when Anna was on the bench, it would have been a different outcome, but we
didn't.  
  
I think that's what it came down to. For me to be 4 of 15, and for us to still
be in the game, shows the talent of our team. Like Coach said, this doesn't
happen again, you know? Our starters don't go below 30% from the field goal.  
  
Q. Receé, curious on your part. Kristine's getting looks, some of the
same looks she got yesterday, and it seemed like she was doing everything
possible, and the ball just wasn't falling at times. It seemed there was a lid
on the basket, and you're running the offense, you're facilitating. Is there a
time where you think I have to make a different pass, go a different option,
or do you just keep pounding away thinking the ball is going to fall? Because
it looked like there was a lid on the basket. There were some even though she
was getting good Rooks?  
RECEÉ CALDWELL: I never lose my trust in KA. She's proven time and time again
that she's gone 30 pieces on triple-teams, you know? So we'll continue to
pound away at her. And she never really has these nights, you know. Sometimes
-- I mean, shooters always have these nights. I've had a lot of them this
season.  
  
But like I said, we were -- like Kristine and G said, we were still in the
game. A couple go down at certain times and we win that game. Just got to go
back and game plan and get ready for the tournament.  
  
COACH GOTTLIEB: I also thought, maybe I was watching it different, we took 30
threes. We took 30 threes. I thought in the first half Tara said someone other
than Kristine's going to beat us. I mean, I would do that when she's had 25
and 20. And I thought Christine kicked it out extremely well in the first
half. And Asha Thomas is the career three-point leader at our school. We have
a ton of trust in her. She's one of the most steady kids, and she went 1 for
10 from three. It happens. I believe because of who that kid is, she's going
to make 10 for 10 in the NCAA Tournament. I really do. She's hit 7 in the NCAA
Tournament game, right?  
  
And then I thought our offense looked better in the second half when we were
in and out, and in and out. Are they going to make it easy on Kristine? No.
But look, Tay took 15 shots and Teisy took 15 shots and Kianna took ten shots.
I thought we figured out how to get a little inside out going in the second
half, and we just didn't make shots. And Stanford doesn't make it easy on you.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Cori Close](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=24856)

### [Japreece Dean](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30409)

### [Kennedy Burke](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35194)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
UCLA - 73, ASU - 69  
  
COACH CLOSE: 20 points in 20 minutes, 7-for-8 shooting. Besides those two free
throws at the end, that was a pretty darn efficient game from that
perspective. So she's got to stay out of foul trouble with us. That last over
the back with the third call, she's got to realize what point in the game is
it and she needs to not take that chance because she's too big of a piece for
us offensively. So that's a huge piece for us. So just credit to her. She does
what Michaela does. She's efficient, she's selfless, she plays her tail off,
and we really rely on her for that.  
  
Q. KB and Japreece, things got away a little bit there in the third
quarter. Can you take me through the troubles you saw on defense?  
KENNEDY BURKE: I think the most important thing was we weren't communicating
on defense, which is why they had those easy lay-ups and they were able to get
those threes off. I think during that segment we just came back together.
Japreece was a huge part in that.  
  
JAPREECE DEAN: Yeah, I would agree, a lack of focus and a lack of urgency,
knowing who they were going to go to. I think we picked it up after that.
Knowing people, challenging people, and just communicating in huddles.  
  
Q. Japreece, we found out that you're coming back for another year next
season. That video made all of us smile yesterday. What sort of impact did
that have on the incredible performance that you brought today?  
JAPREECE DEAN: You know, I couldn't sleep last night because I was thinking
about it and so much was on my mind, and I just tried to get it off. Because I
don't play with a bunch on my mind. But I don't think it had much of an
impact. I just knew I was going to be on an attack mode, whether that was
defensively or offensively or creating for others, and that's what I did.  
  
Q. For both of you guys, Coach said start of fourth quarter she had some
choice words about stepping up again. I think you two combined for the first
eight points so you had a cushion again. Did you think we've got to get going
again to get this back to where it was in the first 30 minutes?  
JAPREECE DEAN: Oh, yeah. There was a part, I don't know when it was, but KB
had missed the lay-up, and it was over the top. I looked at her like are you
going to buck up or what? And we started arguing.  
  
KENNEDY BURKE: We were going back and forth.  
  
JAPREECE DEAN: It was like let's go, let's go. And we were arguing, and she
came out and responded. I like how she responded to the challenge, and she did
great.  
  
KENNEDY BURKE: It shows how much impact she has on all of us. It shows on the
court that she's a great leader so.  
  
COACH CLOSE: I thought Lajahna Drummer was the other part of that. It's not
going to show up on the stat sheet, but everybody, of the three seniors,
people talk about what they've meant to the program and what their impact has
been, and everybody talked about her competitive backbone; that we rely on her
to get passion plays and to get rebounds and to be our sort of rock.  
  
We went back to that and said listen to what everyone said about you last
night. Right now we need you. And I thought she responded as well. And she's
just a confidence person for us. She's an anchor for our team. The next couple
of possessions, she denied touches to Ibis when they were deliberately trying
to get her the ball. That's not going to show up on a stat sheet, but we know
that was a huge piece.  
  
Q. Coach, you mentioned that you got into some of the players' faces
during timeouts and stuff. In the fourth quarter I noticed you walked straight
to Japreece. What kind word of words did you exchange in those encounters?  
COACH CLOSE: I looked her in the eye and I said: We have Japreece Dean, and
they don't. You have to lead us right now, right now. And she looked me in the
eye, and she knew. She has that kind of command of our team, and she was
playing really well. I needed her to really focus that we start and end with
her, and she's got to keep it rolling.  
  
Q. On that note, there is obviously quite a connection between you two.
What's it mean to you, Japreece, to have another year? And same question for
you.  
JAPREECE DEAN: It means a lot. I want to thank everyone who put the time in to
make that happen. Our staff, Coach, I'm really blessed for that. It's great to
be with these girls. She brings in amazing people to our program, and it's
great to be with a great staff.  
  
COACH CLOSE: I think one of the things when we found out the other day, we
actually had a film session that day. I just said, you know, what is it that
you're supposed to learn in this next year? Why was this granted? You've got
to figure that out.  
  
But for me, to watch her grow so much over the last two and a half years and
to see how much from the inside out, in her leadership, her character, in the
way that she can connect with all different kinds of people, to be a great
influence on them, I just was thinking to myself, man, I'm going to get to
watch her grow another level, in both leadership as well as in her game.  
  
One of the things for me, I was a point guard, and I wasn't nearly as talented
as she is, but one thing that's so fun is she loves the game. There's not a
day that she doesn't want to talk about an NBA game that happened, a WNBA
game, a college game. To be a head coach who is a point guard and have her
point guard love the game as much as you do, wow, what a blessing.  
  
So I'm really, really fortunate and couldn't be prouder of how much she's
grown and all the people echoing what she said and really fought for her. It
was the right thing, and we knew it was right. But a lot of people had to
sacrifice a lot of time and energy and relentlessness to put her in that
position.  
  
Q. Happy International Women's Day to each of you. I wondered if you
wanted to take a moment to shout out a woman that's inspired you?  
KENNEDY BURKE: I would like to shout out my sister, Kody Burke. She's been a
huge inspiration for me. I love her and I miss her.  
  
JAPREECE DEAN: Shout out to my mom. Great lady, great heart, just has so much
grace for people, and I admire her so much.  
  
COACH CLOSE: I'm going to shout out Ceal Barry. Honestly, I remember just
thinking to myself I was a restricted earnings coach at UCLA, and she was the
head coach at Colorado. I wrote her a letter and said this is my dream job. If
I could ever just have time with you. I didn't get time to work with her, but
she spent time with me in the summers and we talked about life and basketball.
You're a trailblazer in our game. She was Jenny Huth's college coach, and to
watch her influence as she came into our program, all the trickle-down of
that, and thinking about without people like you, Ceal Barry, we don't have a
press conference like this, or exposure your to our game. You've impacted me,
but you've impacted countless others. So it's a great opportunity to say thank
you.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Adia Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32004)

### [Lucia Alonso](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36627)

### [Aari McDonald](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36596)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Oregon - 77, Arizona - 63  
  
COACH BARNES: I'm really proud of our team's heart, our team's effort, and we
played 40 minutes as hard as we could. Was it perfect, no. We knew today we
had to play 40 minutes of perfect basketball to win this game, and we didn't,
but we had chances to. We hung in there, and I'm really proud of these ladies.
They put so much hard work in, and they believe we can play with anybody.  
  
We realize we're not there yet. They're No. 2 team in the country. I think
they're ranked 6 right now, but they're a very, very talented basketball team.  
  
But we gave them a fight. We didn't lay down and die. We took some punches, we
tried to punch back, and that's all I ask of our kids is that we play hard,
they never give up. And they never gave up. So if you give a hundred percent,
and you walk away holding your head high, so that's what I expect from all of
them.  
  
Q. Talk about Aari's game. She kept you guys in it with shot after shot.
You've seen it all year. But what she brought tonight to give you a chance to
win this game?  
COACH BARNES: She brought everything. She's very, very difficult to guard. I
don't know anybody in the country that can guard her one-on-one, so usually
they guard her four-on-one. I thought she did a great job finding her
teammates, and she made some very tough shots.  
  
Just so you know, I ask a lot of her. She's played 40 minutes today. I ask her
to guard one of her best guards. I ask her to play 40 minutes. I ask her to
run the offense. That's a lot. As we get better, it won't be so much.  
  
And Lucia wasn't healthy, so she's playing point guard all the time. I prefer
to put her in a situation where playing off the ball and on the ball. I think
she played great. She made some shots, and I was like how in the heck did she
make that.  
  
But you can't teach quickness, and you can't teach size, and she has that.
She's special. She's one of the best guards in the country, and she continues
to make noise. I'm proud. The good thing is she's only a sophomore. She's
going to be around two more years. It's going to be some long years for other
people, and I'm happy about that.  
  
I'm just proud. I think her teammates also did a great job of finding her.
When she's hot, they open lanes for her, they find her. So I'm just proud of
her fight. I mean, she played a great game. I don't know if I could ask her to
play any better. She could have scored 20 more points and scored 60 points and
we would have won, you know.  
  
Q. Aari, what is it like going against a 3-2 after the time, and they're
all following you around? And just summarize your game today. What did you
think?  
AARI MCDONALD: It's a little difficult because Oregon is a tall team. They
have length, they have long arms. So it was difficult. But I was used to it.
This is the third time we've played against them. They played that the whole
game. I was definitely finding their weakness in the zone. And my teammates
did a good job finding me, and they also were doing good creating their shots
as well.  
  
Just today, my game -- my mentality was like I'm not going to let my team
lose. But I felt like we fought hard against the top team in the country, and
I couldn't be more proud of my team. There is a lot of basketball left. But on
the bright side, we're improving every game, and we're making noise.  
  
Q. We all know that Aari is fearless, but it seemed to reverberate
through the rest of the team. Could you talk about that and how that
progressed over the season?  
COACH BARNES: Yeah, so Aari's fearless, Tee Tee's fearless, Sam Thomas is
fearless, Cate's fearless. That's our identity and who we are. We're not
scared with anybody. We may not be the most talented, but we play with a
tremendous heart. That's just our character and who we are and what we do.  
  
I think we wouldn't have been as successful this year without Sam Thomas. Sam
Thomas is one of our best defenders. She's one of the most underrated players
in this league. She can play the two, three, four. She always locks down the
person she's guarding. She hits threes. She plays a lot of minutes.  
  
I think that she just never gives up, and she's consistent. So I know what I'm
getting from her every game. Last year she played the four. If you remember,
she was battling against players like Anigwe. She's like 40 pounds thinner, so
she battles. If I said go guard Ruthy, go guard Sabrina, she would do it and
she's fearless.  
  
Tee Tee, wasn't her best game tonight, but one of the reasons we're here today
is how Tee Tee played yesterday. She's fearless. She's a competitor.  
  
All these players have grit. That's the kind of players I want to coach. If
you don't have those things, you probably don't fit in our program. So they
play with heart. They don't give up. They give it their all, and that's all
that I can ask, and that's every single one of us. It may not be perfect all
the time, and that's okay. I love their imperfections. We're not perfect. But
we do our best, and we did that today.  
  
Could I have done a better job of getting there off the floor, getting Sam off
the floor? Yeah, but it's really hard. It's hard. Against a team like Oregon,
them off the floor is a big run.  
  
So I think that they've continued to get better. If you looked at us in
October, and you look at us now, we are a much improved team. That's the thing
that I'm proud about is we are getting better as a team. That's just
cohesiveness. That's individual talent. All those things they're improving.
It's not because of me. It's because of their hard work. I told them today, we
have more basketball to play, so we don't hang our head and we go out and
we're trying to win something else. That's just our mentality.  
  
You can be disappointed, but you've got to move on.  
  
Q. Coach, there is more basketball to be played. Do you want to make a
case for why you should be in the NCAA Tournament?  
COACH BARNES: I think we've given ourselves some chances. There's been some
opportunities. I think that we are someone that the NCAA Tournament would
consider. I think there are some key games we lost that hurt our chances to be
in the tournament.  
  
Now, if we did, I'd be very happy about that, of course. But I think if we had
a couple key wins, like a triple overtime against UCLA, would have been big.
Us going down to Cal and Stanford, that game we lost at Cal I think kind of
hurt our chances. Then we needed to probably sweep the Washingtons, and when
we split at Washington, Washington State, we split Washington State. So I
think that kind of hurts us, and I don't know what the committee said.  
  
But my main thing is we've changed so much. This wasn't even a conversation
last year. We won two games in the Pac-12, and six overall. So I'm proud that
we've come a long way in a year. It's because of these two talented young
women beside me. And whatever happens, happens, whether it's the NCAA
Tournament, or the NIT, we're going to try to go win it.  
  
I remember me as a player at Arizona, the pivotal point in our program was
going to the NIT and winning it, and that changed everything. That started the
avalanche, and we got better. Then we made the NCAAs. So regardless of our
course, what will happen will happen, and it's going to be meant to be that
way. We're just going to fight and go beat someone we're not supposed to, and
that's what I expect from them. So we're just going to have fun and do what we
can to make a difference.  
  
But on the flip side, we're playing in the best league in the country. It is
hard. We've battled every single game. There wasn't one game this year where I
was like, oh, we can win that easily. It was hard. I'm just proud of all that
they accomplished this year, regardless what's in front of us. They've done a
great job, and this is a tough league, and I just hope Oregon's a great team,
and I think they're one of the best offenses in the country. I think they have
a chance to go to the Final Four and a chance to win the championship. So does
Oregon State. I think UCLA could surprise some people.  
  
I'm just proud of our league and the parity in it and the chances that our
league has to win a championship.  
  
Q. I just wanted to ask you, back on the game, they present so many
problems, and one of them is their physical play inside. Was that a hard thing
to play with?  
COACH BARNES: They present a lot of problems. They present five players and
present five problems on the court, and that's why they're so good. Most teams
you can help off of someone. You can double off of someone. That's what makes
Oregon so difficult to guard. Yes, Ruthy Hebard is a problem inside. She was a
big problem today. It just poses a difficult situation defensively because
normally you can double off of someone, but in Oregon, who are you going to
double off? You can't double off Bole, you can't double off Maite, you can't
double off Sabrina. So you've got to play one-on-one, and Cate is a freshman,
Ruthy's more experienced and stronger inside, but Cate fought and tried her
best. I think that's one of the things that makes Oregon so special because
you have to pick your poison. It's really hard when their three-point shooters
shoot over 40%.  
  
So Ruthy inside, shooters outside, I think we could have probably done a
better job. We were supposed to be in more of a front, but we had a really
tough time getting in front of her. So she did a good job of just making some
tough baskets down the stretch, and that really hurt us with the momentum of
the game.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Jody Wynn](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34197)

### [Missy Peterson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36612)

### [Darcy Rees](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36613)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Washington - 64, Utah - 54  
  
COACH WYNN: First of all, I just want to say that Utah's a heck of a ballclub
with a great coach. We all understand who they're missing. But they're great
competitors and great players and really just a really, really good coach.  
  
It's late, and I just want to say that it took all of us to believe, and it
starts with the belief that we can do something that maybe nobody else thinks
we can do. And we talked about that. We talked about the character of our
women and the perseverance that we've had. You know, it's easy to quit on each
other and ourselves when the going is tough, and it's been a tough year.  
  
But it's a true mark of great character when you rise to the next challenge
when nobody thinks you can do anything. I'm just extremely proud of our entire
team. I've been proud of the entire support staff that continues to encourage
and give our program positive thoughts, because we need that, and we've needed
it this year.  
  
It took all of us. Not everybody had the best offensive night, but it started
with our transition defense in the first half, and forcing turnovers, and that
got us going.  
  
Q. You guys celebrated after the game like you had won an NCAA
Tournament game is what it looked like. How big a win was this for this
program for what you guys have gone through this year to get a tournament win
in the Pac-12?  
COACH WYNN: First of all, if you come into our locker room after every win,
you'd see us celebrating like that. Because getting wins at this level is not
easy to do. But on a stage like this, with a group of people that are doubted,
and rightfully so, you know. We hadn't performed well enough to get the wins
that we all want, but it's big for our program. We are in the stages of
building Washington women's basketball back up, and we're going to do it the
right way with classy kids that work really hard together and that are
unselfish. The celebration in the locker room was a sign of how much we truly
love each other, and just how proud we are of each other and how hard we've
worked to get this win.  
  
Q. Coach, that being said, how quick do you have to say, okay, and turn
it off and focus to tomorrow so you don't sort of expend all that energy and
that emotion? Soak it in, but move on?  
COACH WYNN: Yeah, I mean, they'll enjoy dinner tonight. It's kind of late for
that, but we understand that it's survive and advance. You know, loser out,
and we're facing an incredible opponent tomorrow night.  
  
So the focus has to start as soon as we get back on that bus.  
  
Q. Missy, that shot you hit at the end of the pull-up jumper, the
clock's winding down. You talked like they were kind of coming to life at the
end there. Just take us through that moment, what's going through your head,
and the feeling to hit the stop to stop the run a little bit?  
MISSY PETERSON: Yeah, I've had a few possessions this year where the shot
clock winds down, and I've passed it and not taken my shot. But that was when
Utah was going on a big run, and they got within single digits, and hadn't
scored in a while. We knew we needed a bucket, the shot clock was winding
down.  
  
I've been working on my pull-ups all the time. That's been in my game since
high school. So I got to the paint, nothing going through my head but shoot
the ball. Clock is running down, and when it went in, it felt good. So we just
had to go back on defense, and had to get a stop and finish off the game.  
  
Q. Darcy, going through a freshman season like this, what have you taken
away from the contrasting style of players in this conference? Someone like
Megan Huff tonight, and tomorrow night, a player like Jo Grymek, who is big
and strong and at the rim all the time?  
DARCY REES: Well, I think every week we've gone against a really quality
opponent in the big position, so it's been a really great learn experience for
me. And Hannah Johnson teaching me so much in defense, and how to defend a
different style of play every week. But it's just adapting, reading what the
player is good at, and learning how to work around that.  
  
Q. Missy, same thing I asked Coach, you guys looked like you just got
into the NCAA Tournament and won a game in the NCAAs in that celebration. What
does it mean to you to get a win in the Pac-12, and get the only upset of the
day and play another game at least?  
MISSY PETERSON: Yeah, totally, like she said, winning in this conference,
individual win in women's basketball is huge, period. Nobody you play,
especially in the Pac-12, is an easy game. We knew it was going to be hard. We
had what we got and laid it on the floor tonight. We weren't ready for it to
be our last game. We wanted one more. So when the buzzer went off and we won
that game, we were so excited.  
  
Nothing feels better than a win, and especially with the people you love. So
it was great, we love it.

Arizona State - 66, Colorado - 49  
  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, first of all, I love this venue. I vote Vegas
forever (laughing). I thought it was a great crowd, great energy, just the
facility, everything has been amazing. The people have been fantastic.  
  
And then, you know, we just -- I was telling our team in the locker room,
sometimes it's not the worst thing to have the play-in game because the first
game I felt in my 30 years of college coaching is the hardest, even when it's
not the toughest opponent. It's just that first game, and kind of the pressure
and the excitement of the moment can get to you a little bit.  
  
I thought we had great moments, but we definitely weren't at our normal
selves, as connected as we usually are. So I'm really proud of our team for
just staying with things and stepping up in the fourth quarter and putting a
really resilient Colorado team away.  
  
That's the third time -- it's hard to beat a team three times. JR does an
amazing job, and they've had injuries, but they're just a top team and you
know they're going to keep fighting. They have kids like Robinson and Leonard
and just kids that can hit tough shots. Like you can play great defense and
they'll still make the shot. So that's a dangerous team, so we're excited to
be hanging around for another day.  
  
Q. What changed going from the third quarter to the fourth quarter?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: We made shots.  
  
COURTNEY EKMARK: Just being aggressive. They came out and kind of jumped on us
at the start of the second half, and that's not what we wanted to do at all.
Just trying to get the momentum, shift it back in our way and keep the
aggressiveness.  
  
Q. Coach, in piggy-backing off of being able to get that first game out
of the way and get those first-game jitters, what can you take from the third
quarter as far as it possibly being a wake-up call or not allowing a team to
get back and play -- especially you talk about two different programs, from
Colorado to UCLA, and what you can take from that third quarter sort of as a
learning lesson for your team.  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Right, we've had -- I think I just needed to say it to
the camera on TV that we were going to have a great third quarter because when
I did that against Oregon State, it worked really well.  
  
But this is a veteran team, and I think -- I'll say this to these two and they
can go back and say it to their team. But I think that one of our -- maybe one
of the knocks on us a little bit at times is we'll kind of, okay, we got this,
and we'll take our foot off the gas. They took their foot off the gas, and you
can't do that in March. You can't do it in our conference.  
  
I feel like we already kind of know that, you know, and it was a great
teachable moment and reminder to us, like listen, at this point you've got to
be 40 minutes all-out with your effort and your focus and your connectedness.
But they know it. They know it. It's not the first tough third quarter that
we've had, and it's really been more about us, to be honest, kind of taking
the foot off the gas.  
  
Q. Courtney, during that kind of rough third quarter, one of the main
things was you started hitting your shots and you had a really, really good
quarter just overall. What was going through your head when Colorado was
making their run to fight back into it and you were hitting those big shots?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: I think just keep shooting it with confidence. I knew I had a
couple in-and-outs in the first half, so staying aggressive.  
  
Q. Coach Charli, Kianna Ibis went down with an injury it looked like in
about the third quarter. What was going on? What happened there?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, she's actually -- she's okay. Thanks for asking.
She banged it really hard. I think it scared her a little bit. But
structurally Diana Padilla, our trainer, said she's good, and she was
available to go back in the game, but I didn't want to put her back in the
game unless we absolutely needed to, and we pretty much got the game under
control, so got to rest her a little bit, which was good.  
  
Q. Robbi, you guys had a put-back at the end of the third quarter to get
the momentum back your way and then had a run to start the fourth. How big was
it to get things going in the fourth and create some space for you guys?  
ROBBI RYAN: It was really important, especially with the third quarter we had.
They outscored us by almost 10 in the third quarter. Really needed to pick it
up, defensively, offensively, everything, and we did that.  
  
Q. Busload of 942 crew here; how important is that?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yes, thank you so much for bringing that up because we
want to -- obviously it's amazing how much of the Sun Devil Nation came out to
support us in the Pac-12 Tournament. That big group behind our band is our 942
crew, our student fan base, for all student athletics. We're on spring break
this week, so that probably helped get a few more of them here. But they're
amazing and they're definitely a great X factor for us here at the tournament,
so we thank them.  
  
Q. I want to ask specifically about Jayde and her contributions not only
from today's game but from the weeks leading up to it, especially when she had
to fill in for Jamie because of injury and just her production coming off of
the bench so far.  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, Jayde just gives us energy. She plays so hard, and
she'll rebound, she'll get a steal, she'll get her put-backs, she'll be in the
right place at the right time. I actually didn't want to sub her out, but
Jackie told me her nose was bleeding, and I think she got hit pretty hard in
the nose, so I would have liked actually to leave her out there a little bit
longer in that fourth quarter because I thought she just gives us such great
energy. And she's a good scorer.  
  
I mean, moving forward, we're going to lose a lot of production in the post,
and yeah, Jayde the Jet is going to be a force to be reckoned with in the
further the way she is now.  
  
Q. For either one of the players, in getting that first game out of the
way, getting those first day-jitters out, do you like the back to back? Do you
like the fact that you'll be right back up on the court?  
ROBBI RYAN: I guess it doesn't really matter if we like it because we're going
to have to play tomorrow anyway.  
  
COURTNEY EKMARK: I love it. Let's play as many games as we can.  
  
ROBBI RYAN: Yeah, no, but we're excited for tomorrow. Just having this game
today was really beneficial for us just to get our first game jitters out and
kind of like feel out the arena and just get more connected.  
  
Q. Coach, when you look at UCLA, who you last played a little over a
month ago, what differences do you see in their game now when they've been on
a hot streak from when you lost to them in January?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, I've watched them some; I haven't watched them a
lot. I have a little homework to do. But they've just continued to play I
think better and better. I think that they were a team that knew that they
were better than they were, and they were just not hitting shots that they
normally hit, and they finally just kind of settled down, and I think they
started going to their bench a little bit more, which helped them.  
  
So I think they're playing right now about as well as they've played all year.
I mean, I think Cori does a great job. They've got some -- like us, some
really veteran, tough, savvy upperclassmen and seniors, so they know how to
peak down the stretch of the season.  
  
I think they're peaking now. They're playing their best basketball now, so
they've just gotten better and better in terms of their offensive execution
and production, and also with their defense. Everybody knows they rebound.
That's been good the whole season.  
  
Q. Were you happy with the minutes distribution today? And what is your
philosophy of divvying up the minutes in a tournament format like this?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Well, obviously if we would have had a little bit better
third quarter, maybe we would have had them a little bit more distributed, but
it's all good. It's all good. There's no -- you can't really -- I'm going to
play Robbi this many minutes -- you've just got to go with the game and see
how things play out.  
  
I do think that we're built for back-to-back-to-back games. We do have really
good depth. Even though maybe some of our bench didn't play as many minutes as
they might in other games, they've been in against top 5 -- we've played how
many one-possession games with top 5 teams, and all my freshmen and other
bench players have been in in key moments in those games.  
  
I do have a lot of confidence in our bench, and so I think -- tomorrow, you
know, depending on where our legs are at, we have that to go to. But you can't
really map it out. You kind of just have -- we had Nea in foul trouble. Things
just happen.  
  
Q. Obviously Kianna, not really quite her game, only six points for her.
But can you talk about the contributions Robbi and Courtney, big games for
both of them, as well as how Kianna will be able to bounce back tomorrow?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, and I thought we did get some great minutes -- Kiki
Russell, one of our veteran guards, stepped up, and Sophia. So we did get some
good bench scoring. But yeah, that's kind of our big three, Ki and Robbi and
Courtney, and they kind of take turns. Obviously most of you know that Kianna
has carried a huge load a lot of the season, and she's getting keyed on a lot.
And she handles it really well, and she passed out of a number of traps today,
and we -- we never really anticipated having to lean on Kianna the way we
have, to be honest, because we do have so many great scorers and other players
on our team that are capable of posting, knocking down shots and stuff.  
  
This is good, actually. It's actually -- if I had to script it, it's like,
thank you, yeah, good. Go, go, other people, take your turns, take your shots,
because obviously to be an elite team in March and advance, you've got to have
five scorers on the floor.  
  
Q. You mentioned making shots. What did you make of your team going
against their zone as the game went on and the pressure as they tried to speed
you guys up?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: Yeah, I mean, we've got to get a little bit better in the
press attack at the beginning. But they're not really a pressing team, so we
just kind of had to adjust to that. But I thought we got the ball centered and
did -- you know, got good looks, got second shots down the stretch of the
game.  
  
We kind of know what they do. At the end of the game they're going to trap in
their zone. Got caught a little bit deep on the sideline, but then we got the
ball -- after a few possessions I thought we got the ball centered and we
basically defused it by just getting the two-guard front and keeping the ball
centered.  
  
Q. Courtney, you hit about six three-pointers in that game. You were
only about one three-pointer way from trying the school record. Did you
realize how close you were or how hot you were in the moment? What was your
mindset in the middle of the game when you were knocking down those tough
shots?  
COURTNEY EKMARK: I don't really pay attention to that stuff, but just whatever
I can do to help the team win, that's what I want to do. And if hitting shots
is it, then that's what I'll do.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a bit about how Colorado was a tough team, but when
you look at the bottom half of the conference, any of those teams could maybe
come in here and advance. Tara said that she feels the conference is more wide
open than it has ever been as far as getting a conference champion. Do you
feel that way?  
COACH TURNER THORNE: A hundred percent. A hundred percent. I agree with Tara a
hundred percent. I think it's wide open. We just had a tough game with a
couple controversial calls at the end against Oregon, and that could have gone
I guess either way, especially top six, seven, eight teams have had great
games against each other.  
  
But there's not an easy game in this conference. There's not. We are
definitely -- the Pac-12 is the best women's basketball conference in the
country, and I will have a discussion with anybody in the country that wants
to debate that.  
  
You know, we played other conferences enough head to head. Washington blows
out Duke, on and on and on, different head to head against other top teams and
top programs in other conferences.  
  
Yes, I think it's wide open, and yes, I think this is the best the conference
has ever been. I think there's an argument for eight plus -- I don't really
know. I don't look at that stuff. I don't look at bracketology, just kind of
live in my little bubble. But eight or nine teams in the NCAA Tournament. I
don't know what is projected right now, but I know our teams and I know how
they've done against other teams, and they've done really, really well. Should
be a great tournament. It's going to be exciting.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Mark Trakh](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30760)

### [Kayla Overbeck](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34671)

### [Mariya Moore](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28386)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Arizona - 76, USC - 48  
  
COACH TRAKH: You've just got to give all the credit in the world to Arizona.
They played well. They defended us well. They ran their offense well. They've
got a kid that's really hard to guard in McDonald, and we tried.  
  
But I thought defensively we weren't really that bad, especially in the second
half. It was just offensively a combination of their defense, and we hadn't
shot like that in a long time. We've been playing offensively pretty well.  
  
But hats off to Arizona. They played great. Best of luck to them against
Oregon tomorrow, and we've got to see if we're going to get a WNIT invite
because I know these kids don't want this to be the last memory of a decent
season. I think we had a pretty good season. But hopefully this won't be the
last memory of this season, and we can get in the postseason and move on.  
  
But you kind of get a game like this, you've got to see what you did wrong and
how you can improve and coach the kids up. I think the important thing is to
coach the kids up after a game like this. We just had a great weekend, and we
didn't play well, but it's a total team responsibility from the coaches to the
players. We all didn't do the job we needed to do. But like I said, we correct
everything by just coaching them up and getting ready for the next game.  
  
Q. Coach, that second quarter just got away from you guys. Was it
anything they were doing specifically that got them that huge advantage, or
was it just the defense wasn't working, the shots weren't falling and they
were able to add to the lead?  
COACH TRAKH: Our defense wasn't good in the first half. I thought it tightened
up in the second half. But yeah, we've -- early we would have quarters like
that, but I think we corrected that problem in the last month and a half, and
we had a bad quarter. It was 23-7. That's when they kind of extended the lead.
But yeah, I think it was a combination of we couldn't defend them, or we
didn't defend them well, and we didn't make shots.  
  
Q. Kayla and Mariya, I saw you both on Sunday, an incredible overtime
win over Utah. What was Arizona doing that was making things so difficult for
you out on the floor today?  
KAYLA OVERBECK: You know, to be honest, looking at this sheet, we weren't
really hitting it. We weren't making shots that we make in practice, that we
make in shoot-around, and just like shots that we know we can make. But then
defensively we weren't the team that we know that we could be.  
  
And it's heartbreaking because to lose a game like that and know that, wow, I
wish I had one more quarter, or wow, I wish that this play of the game I would
have called a coverage sooner or I would have done something differently
defensively, and then offensively making shots or trying to get rebounds extra
hard.  
  
Like now it's too late to say that. But it's time to like change that mindset,
and okay, maybe we can do it next time, you know, not them but our next
opponent. And then for Mariya in the professionals.  
  
But we really -- I'm going to be honest, felt like we shot ourselves in the
foot because we know we can play better, but we did not, you know.  
  
Q. Coach, you've seen the Cats now three times. What's the biggest
improvement you've seen over the course of playing them three times?  
COACH TRAKH: Two times. We only played them twice. Played them once this year.
I think the improvement of the players around McDonald. I think that's the
biggest thing that those four players are -- I hate to use the word supporting
cast because they all played well. It's not her supporting cast, it's her
teammates, and I think her teammates have really improved throughout the year,
and I think that's what makes them so good right now is her teammates are
really -- I mean, if you look at the stats sheet, she got 19 points, but
Reese, Cate, got 19 and Tee Tee Starks got 14 and Sam Thomas got 10. So her
teammates have really picked it up, and that's making them very tough at this
time of year.  
  
Q. For both the players, Kayla, you mentioned that -- is it more
frustrating that you guys didn't give your best shot today, and hopefully you
will have another game to go out with your best as opposed to not having the
game you guys wanted to end on?  
KAYLA OVERBECK: Most definitely because as a player, like knowing that you --
yes, like you give it your 100 percent but maybe I could have given it 5 more
percent. Like that couldn't be in you? But still like try to get as much as
you can out of yourself.  
  
But at the same time, you have to be happy that I gave everything that I gave,
you know, and then as -- like personally, but then as a team, it's like, next
time we'll get it. I don't know, it's just a positive-type mindset, you know.  
  
Q. Anybody can answer this: If you had to make your case right now to
the NCAA Committee about why you deserve to be in, what do you want to say to
them?  
COACH TRAKH: We don't deserve to be in. Let's end that conversation right
away. That conversation is over. We would be fortunate to get an invitation to
the WNIT, so there is no case to be made.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Lynne Roberts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30341)

### [Megan Huff](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36079)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Washington - 64, Utah - 54  
  
COACH ROBERTS: As I look into their eyes, they're tired. And I want to, you
know, celebrate this season that we had, and rest up, get healthy, and use
this to springboard us into the future.  
  
Q. Can you put a perspective on this season, and your time in Utah, what
it's meant to help get this program where it is now and where it could be in
the future?  
MEGAN HUFF: Obviously, like Coach said, this isn't how we wanted to end our
season. But how the girls and how everyone's handled it has been amazing. I
don't think we've ever focused on, oh, my gosh, this player's hurt. We never
focused on that. Even when Coach came into the locker room and said that, I
don't think that's something we ever thought about or pitied ourselves about
it. Through the season, we just played and just played.  
  
Like Coach said, I think we've gotten worn out. We've asked freshmen to step
up and into huge roles, and they have done that. Really, the program is
jumping forward. We had four seniors this year. Three, four, and, I mean, this
program is on another level. Like Dre's coming back next year. We have so many
good recruits coming in. We have red-shirts that are working so hard that are
coming next year, playing.  
  
I mean, yeah, like the leadership of the senior class. But there's not going
to be a downfall. Our team is going to jump forward. We have so many leaders
and so many great players.  
  
Q. You said that looking in your players' eyes you kind of knew it
coming down the stretch with the injuries taking its toll, the fatigue. You
never really want to concede, but did you foresee this, or did you maybe just
not think as tired as we are, we're just not going to lose to a team that only
beat Colorado? Was it a possibility or maybe overlooking, or you just knew
they were tired and hoped that they could get as far as they could in the
tournament?  
COACH ROBERTS: We certainly didn't overlook them whatsoever. I think they have
some firepower. You saw it tonight. They can shoot the three. We didn't
overlook them at all. We had them prepared. We've been talking about them for
four days. I respect them a lot.  
  
So there was none of that. I don't think I came in hoping we could win. I
think we all kind of had this mentality like we're down to 7. Okay. Let's
compete. We can win. Certainly didn't think we were going to strut in and they
were going to hand us the W.  
  
But, yeah, I mean, yeah, I could tell in the game like we just didn't have the
pop. So as a coach, you know, I guess the best way to say it is I think we've
squeezed everything out of this group that we can, and they squeezed it out of
themselves as well. You know, just the adversity we hit, it just happens, and
life goes on, and we've just got to move forward and focus on the future. I
think what Huffy said is right, the future is bright, and I'm excited to see
where we can take this thing.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [JR Payne](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32001)

### [Kennedy Leonard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32002)

### [Alexis Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34201)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Arizona State - 66, Colorado - 49  
  
COACH PAYNE: Well, I'm just really proud of our team's fight tonight. I said
today was sort of the epitome of our entire season, sort of being the underdog
and undermanned and facing adversity, but just continuing to never back down,
never stop fighting, staying together, and playing really hard for each other.  
  
I thought we showed tremendous toughness and togetherness today, so I'm very
proud of our team today.  
  
Q. You had a great third quarter, JR; what happened in the fourth? You
had Alexis making some great shots, back-to-back shots. What was going on?  
COACH PAYNE: Well, the fourth quarter I think we saw sort of a reversal on
both ends of the floor. We gave up a handful of threes. In the fourth quarter,
these guys were playing a lot of minutes, and I think fatigue set in a little
bit. But we had a hard time getting stops in the fourth, and then that
transferred into we weren't able to go downhill and transition as effectively
in the fourth as we did in the third, simply because we weren't getting stops,
so it sort of snowballed the wrong way for both offense and defense.  
  
Q. Talking about that third quarter, what was working that got you guys
within a point, and sort of first half offense seemed to be a problem, but the
third quarter you really got going.  
COACH PAYNE: Well, we were creating offense with our defense. So we were
forcing turnovers. We had really changed the tempo of the game in the third
quarter with our defense. And so when we were unable -- again, like I said, to
get stops, we kind of slowed ourselves down, I think, in the fourth. But it
was just sort of toughness defensively and getting stops.  
  
Q. Lex, talk about your third quarter. You're coming off the bench at
the end of the season, a different role for you. What started clicking for you
and how did you kind of adapt into that?  
ALEXIS ROBINSON: I just kind of did -- I was just trying to do whatever it
took to win. I know I could shoot it, so that's what I did. I tried to create
open shots for myself and create open shots for my teammates.  
  
Q. Kennedy, how did you see the second half for you guys kind of evolve?
You got it back to three at the end of that quarter. What was the feeling in
the huddle, and how did you as a leader kind of see the team?  
KENNEDY LEONARD: I mean, I think we just tried to play like faster in
transition, get the ball up the court, and Lex was hitting shots, so you don't
really have to do much, just give her the ball and let her hit shots.  
  
I think we were all just ready to get a lead and get the win, but like Coach
said, the fourth quarter kind flipped a bit on us, but for us to play the way
we did in the third and bring it within one or two I think says a lot about us
this year.  
  
Q. It's been incredible watching both of you grow over your past four
seasons. You got to go to Italy this off-season. Just wondering if possible so
quickly after this game if you can reflect and share some of your favorite
memories about being a Colorado Buffalo?  
KENNEDY LEONARD: My favorite memory of being a Colorado Buffalo, I think just
the people I've met. I read an article the other day that said we went through
like 28 different teammates, which is kind of a lot of people, but just like
the relationships that I've made with all of them and the kind of things we've
been through together, even this year everything we've been hit with, I think
being able to overcome that and remember that and the people you did it with
and overcame it with, I think that's the biggest thing for me.  
  
ALEXIS ROBINSON: You mentioned Italy, and that's just one of the best trips
I've ever had in my life, just spending it with my sisters and all that, it
was really awesome.  
  
Q. Coach, can you talk a little bit about the seniors and what they've
brought to this program?  
COACH PAYNE: Yeah, the legacy of these two will be felt for many years to
come, for a variety of reasons for both of them. I thought it was -- I told
the team, I thought it was very appropriate that we were handed t-shirts for
warm-ups today that we didn't know were coming that said "Family," because a
lot of people talk about that, but we really are a family.  
  
The amount of obstacles and things that just the three of us have been through
together in our three years is pretty remarkable, and these two have shown
what it means to be a Buff as far as loyalty, not just to the program but to
each other, to their teammates, to the brand of Colorado, and their work
ethic.  
  
These are two of the hardest-working players that have ever worn a jersey, and
so they've had that impact on their younger teammates. They've had impact on
teammates that haven't even committed to Colorado yet because they'll be felt
for many years to come.  
  
So I love these two the same way I love my own children. I know that they're
going to do really, really great things moving forward.  
  
Q. You both made the conscious decision when she came in your sophomore
year to stay and play for her. Lex and Ken, what have you learned playing for
JR and getting to know her as a member of your family?  
ALEXIS ROBINSON: I've definitely learned that Coach J is one of the most
caring, like -- she's definitely like -- she's been really big in my life, for
real.  
  
KENNEDY LEONARD: Yeah, I mean, I'd say the exact same. I'd run through a wall
for Coach J, run through a wall for -- I'd do anything for her, and I think we
all would, and I don't regret my decision to stay for a second, and I know Lex
doesn't, either.  
  
It hasn't been the easiest road, but easy times don't make the greatest
people; tough times do. If anything comes out of this, I know we're all going
to be pretty tough people.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Lindsay Gottlieb](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23422)

### [Kristine Anigwe](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30389)

### [Recee Caldwell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36608)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Cal - 77, Washington State - 58  
  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Credit to Washington State. It's kind of different playing a
team twice in a row. We beat them pretty good at this their place, and they
came out today to win the team. They're a very talented team particularly on
the offensive end, with some scores that make coaches have fits. I thought
they really challenged us. The score ended up being similar the last time we
played them, but the field was really different.  
  
We were challenged. That will help us for the rest of the week here if we're
able to stay a while. And excited to be able to do a game plan tonight for
Stanford.  
  
Q. Lindsay, how tough is it when you play a team four days earlier?
Obviously the scouting report, you think you know them, but knowing that you
won handily and you have to play a team that's going to be hungry to try to
keep their season alive?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Yeah, it's a different kind of feel. If you're the higher seed
and you're supposed to win kind of thing, any mitigating factors that are
different usually help the team that wants something to be different. And
especially when Kristine had such a monster game against them last time, you
knew they were going to come with a different urgency around that. So it's a
different kind of deal.  
  
But I do think our players were really focused in a quick turn around. We
thought there were ways that we could be better last time against them
defensively. Particularly our defense on Bobi, No. 45, Hristova, and I thought
we did do a better job on her. They're so talented, Molina gets going a little
bit. It's a little different feel. But our players were locked into the
message we don't get to stay here unless we win this one.  
  
Q. Kristine, you set the All-time Cal blocks record tonight. Can you
talk about what you saw on defense? It seemed defense really sped upcoming out
of the first quarter for you especially?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Well, that record was there for 30 years, and I'm just really
grateful to have broken a lot of these records. I couldn't have done it
without like my coaches believing in me and my teammates being there. I think
our defense speaks volumes, and the second half we really, really dialed in,
and we weren't going to lose this game. It's March, and crazy things happen.
So you really, really have to pay attention, and just stay focused.  
  
Q. Receé, you did a really good job tonight kind of controlling the
offense. Nine assists, two turnovers. What did you see out there?  
RECEÉ CALDWELL: Stuff really opens up, I think, whenever our shooters are
shooting the way that we've been shooting for a long time now. I mean, you
can't really just guard Kristine one-on-one. I think every time someone guards
Kristine one-on-one, it's an automatic in. (Indiscernible) obviously knows
that. She had nine assists and zero turnovers with a great stat line,
honestly, for any point guard. And Kianna and Kenzie and Jaelyn, we all know
when to throw it in, and she also knows when to throw it back out. I think
that's where we have a perfect balance of our beast that no one can guard one-
on-one or even double teams. Then we have shooters that are shooting 35, 37%
from three. So it's pretty easy to read the game when it's a one-on-one game.
You know, it starts getting more hectic when there is a one on two. But every
time it's a one on one, it's pretty easy to read.  
  
Q. Kristine, you had a relatively quiet first quarter, and took over the
second quarter. Did you feel, okay, we're down a little bit. It's time for me
to get going and get this team where we want to be?  
KRISTINE ANIGWE: Coming off a 30-30 game I was like they're going to put some
people on me. I don't know if Receé found me. I think I wasn't wide open and
she got me the ball. I think that's a really good point guard. When the Pac-12
came out with the awards, I was surprised I didn't see her name on it. Because
when you have a point guard that can see you and get you wide open lay-ups,
even when the coverage is so intense, I just never played with a point guard
like that. Usually they're like nine assists and zero turnovers, that's crazy,
you know. I'm really grateful to have her on our team this year. She saw me
when I didn't even know I was open, so, yeah.  
  
Q. Coach, you talked a little bit about the feel being different from
this game to last week. What coming into that second half enabled you to
really gain the separation that you did late in this one?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Our defense. I mean, no doubt about it. I really challenged
them to lock in. We ended up switching a lot of screens. Again, we have a
smart team, a veteran team now. But Kristine and our her defense ability gives
us a lot of options that she can switch onto a guard like Molina. There are
not a lot of bigs that can do that. And our guards being smart enough to play
post players and their post players being finesse more than power. So just
really challenging them to get multiple stops in a row. No question on our
defensive end. We were fairly consistent scoring the ball across all four
quarters, got a little hot at times. They did come in strong defensively on
Kristine. We had to do some other things, knock down some shots, open the
floor, and then we found our scoring rhythm. We had to get stops because you
just don't want to be in a one- or two-possession game when you have someone
like Hristova or Molina who could get hot. That would be scary.  
  
Q. Looking ahead to Stanford, you guys split the series with them this
season, but it's been a while, and they finished the regular season strong as
well. What do you see, Lindsay, looking at them that's different from then
that you'll have to include in your prep for tomorrow?  
COACH GOTTLIEB: Well, I think any Tara VanDerveer-coached team continues to
improve as the year goes on. That's credit to her and them. They run the
Princeton offense, and they do it as well as anybody in the country. They cut
extremely hard. They put multiple shooters on the floor. I know when we played
them the first time, Dodson was just coming back from an injury and had a
setback and now kind of in and out. But they can mix up the lineups and go
bigger or go smaller, and they challenge you in different ways.  
  
But, you know, I expect them to have a great game plan. I expect them to run
their stuff really well, and we have to be better. They're not going to be
subpar. We're going to have to be great to get this thing done. But we'll
hopefully get our players ready. It was nice to beat them, but we remember the
sting of the second game at this point, I think.  
  
Q. What's it like having sort of a safety blanket in the middle that you
can throw the ball to and it usually goes in the basket, Receé? How much
easier does it make the offense go for you guys?  
RECEÉ CALDWELL: I mean, K makes the game easier for all of our players,
honestly. For as much attention as she draws, it leaves us wide open a lot of
the time. I think we've seen that in the progression of the season. The best
big in the country, best player to me. I mean, she's the best player in the
country in my opinion. No one consistently scores over triple-teams day-in and
day-out and does it with composure and savviness, you know. So Kristine does
what she does, and we all follow along.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Kamie Ethridge](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=35048)

### [Chanelle Molina](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36083)

### [Borislava Hristova](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32007)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Cal - 77, Washington State - 58  
  
COACH ETHRIDGE: Just doesn't seem like she ever settles for anything but her
very best effort for as long as she's on the floor. So I just look at her and
go what a great senior. She's just an example of she doesn't want her season
to end. She plays at an unbelievable level possession after possession. And
you better bring some big, strong bodies that can get into her and affect some
of her shots if you ever want to have a chance of beating them.  
  
Q. Coach, what do you take away from your first year at Pullman?  
COACH ETHRIDGE: Well, I'm unbelievably optimistic and excited. I really am. I
think I'm excited about an off-season. I think we need a great spring. I think
these two players are obviously huge for us, and their commitment level and
their talent level, and the fact that they're coming back for next year I just
think gives us a great chance.  
  
We clearly know what we need to do to get better and even remotely compete
with some of the great teams in this league. We've got to obviously improve
our roster, get more depth, and give these guys a break every once in a while.  
  
But I'm super excited. I think we're in the right spot. I think we're moving
in the right direction.  
  
I think what we do is really hard to guard. I just think we've got to put more
pieces together for us to be really effective, and like I said, compete at the
level that these great teams do in this league.  
  
You know, I knew this was going to be hard. We had a small roster. We've made
them empty their tanks. They have nothing left in them because they play so
many minutes. Put them through a lot of torture, probably, so they need some
rest and recovery. But it's great to know that we're coming back with these
two players and leaders in the future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you. Any other questions?  
  
Q. For both the players, just to follow up on what Coach said, what do
you take away from the season hopefully building for the future at Washington
State?  
CHANELLE MOLINA: For me personally, I can't wait to get back on the court. I
can't wait to get back on the court and be my best to help lead the team
better, and that's exactly what Bobi wants too. We're going to keep getting
better, and trying to lead this team, and steer this team in the right
direction.  
  
Q. What do you want to say about your senior, Alexys, all that time
she's played, coaching changes? Any of you? I'd love to hear from the student-
athletes, of course.  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: I mean, Swed is a great leader. Those four years with her,
having her with us has been great. She's a great shooter. She stretches the
floor. She's a great leader. Her talking to us game after game is just
something else, and we're definitely going to miss her.  
  
CHANELLE MOLINA: Yeah, I'm going to miss the energy she brings because when
she's hyped up, you'll see it. It gets all of us hyped up. And like Coach
said, she wears her emotion on her sleeves, and it does show. It's contagious,
her energy and effort. She's just brought so much to this program. Not just as
a player, but as a person. She's just very charismatic and friendly and
outgoing. We're going to miss her.  
  
Q. Chanelle, you've taken on a much bigger role with the team where
you've put together a lot of commanding stretches like you did tonight where
you were able to get to the basket and affect the game. What moments or games
or performances would you point to that let your confidence take off? And for
Bobi, what helped you take over to take some pressure off of you?  
BORISLAVA HRISTOVA: I think it's been great. I think it showed tonight when
the basket doesn't go through the net, Chanelle's going to step in. At this
point we need to help her and have as many players to do that. But she's been
great finding teammates, knocking shots down, and it just stretches the
defense, and we have more weapons.  
  
CHANELLE MOLINA: And it's been a process for me. I haven't run this type of
offense before, and just every game is different, different reads, different
read reactions. So every game I have to adjust and just learn what I can do
better coming off of screens, coming off of step-ups, looking to pass the
corner, hitting the pocket pass. Everything, I've just taken it in and kept
learning and trying to get better at it. I feel like now I know what I need to
do, and in the off-season I'm going to just keep getting better at it. I'm as
determined as ever to help this program.  
  
We just have these amazing coaches, and I just want to play super hard for
them. I'd run through a wall for them. That's how much I respect them and love
them. That's how much I want to get better.  
  
THE MODERATOR: I think we'll close on that. Thank you.

# [PAC-12 WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=PAC-12+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Adia Barnes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32004)

### [Aari McDonald](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36596)

### [Cate Reese](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36597)

  
_Las Vegas, Nevada_  
  
Arizona - 76, USC - 48  
  
COACH BARNES: Well, I'm really proud of our team today. We came out with a
level of intensity that I expected from this team. I told them when we talked
a lot before, we're playing our best basketball right now. That's not evident
because we have the gauntlet the last four games of the regular season, you
know, playing Stanford at Stanford, Cal, and then Oregon and Oregon State at
home. But we were competing and we had chances to win those games.  
  
We're playing our best basketball. And we came out, and we always say punch
first, and I think we did that. And we also know that USC is a very good team.
They're coached very well. They have very good players, and we didn't overlook
them by any means. We knew we had to play a good game to win, and I thought we
played a good game for about 30 minutes today.  
  
Q. You guys just played Oregon last weekend; how much does that help in
such a short turnaround time to have sort of a scouting report fresh in their
minds versus a team you may have faced a month ago?  
COACH BARNES: I think it's an advantage for us because I think when you've
beat a team just like us, when we beat SC a few weeks ago, it's hard to go and
beat a team two times in a row. But we know Oregon is a very good team, and we
felt we played 30 minutes of good basketball against them. We know they're
coached very well. They have a lot of weapons. But we feel like we have some
good weapons, too, so we're excited.  
  
And I think that we're in a situation where we're not afraid to be underdogs,
and when you're the underdog, you have no pressure. So you can go out and just
play your game, and whatever happens happens because no one expects you to
win. I think that for us, there's no pressure, we can go out and have fun and
just play basketball.  
  
For Oregon there's more pressure because they're supposed to win. And I think
at this time of year anything can happen. So I think we're feeling good, we're
confident, and we just have to go out and show what we can do tomorrow.  
  
Q. What was the message going into the tournament, coming off those four
tough losses at the end of the season?  
COACH BARNES: So the message for us, I was proud -- I didn't know how we'd
respond. Last four games, very tough. A lot of teams would have laid down and
hung their heads and just been a little discouraged from the four losses, but
I didn't feel that with this team. I felt like they knew we had chances to
win, we could have won and we didn't. But I thought like they're confident to
feel we can -- they feel like we can play with anybody. So I still didn't know
how -- this is a lot of firsts. Aari hasn't been here in two years. Dominique,
it's her first time in a Pac-12 Tournament. Tee Tee, it's her first time. So
that's three of my starters and one hasn't been here for a while, they haven't
been here. Cate has never been here. I didn't know how we would respond right
away. We knew we had to play good basketball, we knew we had to punch first,
and those were things we focused on.  
  
When I looked in their eyes, they were hungry, they were ready. Yesterday at
practice they were feeling good. They couldn't miss. I thought this is a good
sign or a bad sign you're either going to make them all or miss them. But I
think we're playing our best basketball of the year. I think we feel like we
can play with anybody, and they set the tone from the get-go, and I'm proud of
them because the whole year they've been everything I've asked, they've played
with their hearts, and they played a lot of minutes all year, and it just
doesn't look like that today, and I'm proud of that.  
  
Q. You talk about Oregon and the wealth of weapons they have. Obviously
Sabrina is one of them. What challenges does she present with her skill set?  
COACH BARNES: A lot. There's probably a list. But she's a very good player,
one of the best guards in the country. You know, she scores in a lot of
different ways. I think that what makes her special is it's not that she's the
most athletic or the quickest, she's extremely smart, a very high basketball
IQ, she can score in different ways. So she has a good mid-range game, a good
three-point shot. She's an extremely good passer. So I think that makes a
complete player.  
  
But we have a pretty good player next to me, so I think it's an exciting
match-up. I'm excited for that challenge. I think that they have a lot of
weapons, but so do we.  
  
But I think that we have to know that she's going to score, so we just have to
make it difficult for her to score and make her score in different ways, and I
think that -- what makes Oregon really special is they have four players that
can shoot above 40 percent from the free-throw line, and they have a really
good post player inside, so it's very difficult to double off of anybody
because of their shooting ability.  
  
But I think we're really good in transition, so we have to do a lot of
different things and just give it our best shot. We don't have any pressure.
We have nothing to lose, so we're just going to go out and play basketball
tomorrow.  
  
Q. What was the key defensively to you limiting them so much, players
and Coach?  
COACH BARNES: Well, I think we just -- we've played aggressive defense all
year long. The catalyst on defense for us is Aari and Tee Tee. She's a
competitor. She's -- you can't teach quickness and you can't teach size. She
has a little bit of quickness, so she's just a piranha on the ball. Tee Tee
also sets that tone for us defensively. But I thought tonight Cate, Dominique,
Destiny did a really good job on their post players. So I thought it was just
a really good team effort.  
  
I think also in the zone a lot of times we tend to relax and get a little
complacent when we play zone, but I thought tonight we did a pretty good job,
and I think that's been our identity all year. We just knew that this year, in
order to win games, we knew we had to play great defense because we had to
find ways to manufacture offense. So if we were going to play a slow game, we
didn't have the size, we didn't have the depth.  
  
So we knew we had to go out and get steals, be in the passing lane to get some
offense, and I think that's been good for us. And I don't think USC has scored
48 points all year long. So that's a credit to our defense, and these two
played some really good defense tonight, or today.  
  
Q. You kind of pooh-pooh'd your best game of the year. Is this not your
most complete game of the year?  
COACH BARNES: I don't think it's our most complete game. I think we played
good basketball, but I wouldn't say it's our most complete game because I
thought the third quarter was bad. I think we played a really good first half.
I think we came out and we were really intense, we were great defensively. We
had some good offense. But I wouldn't say it's our best game. You can ask
them. They can probably answer that better. Do you think it's our best game?  
  
AARI MCDONALD: I don't think it was our best game. I can say the intensity we
had throughout the game, that probably was one of our best. But no, like she
said, the third quarter, our defense was not that good. But we'll pick it up
next game.  
  
CATE REESE: I think when we play Oregon we can't let up like that in that
third quarter. It wasn't that great. And if it was a close game they would
have gotten a lead or gotten a bigger lead. We had to be more focused and stop
fouling so much because in the third quarter we kind of fouled a lot. But I
think other than that we were pretty focused in the game and we were intense.  
  
COACH BARNES: I think one of the things we learned, so we've had a lot of
learning lessons this year, and some of them have been tough. You know, we had
a triple overtime game against UCLA, so we really learned the value of free
throws at the end and boxing out, and then we had a tough game at Stanford
within one shot. Our shot went in and out; could have won that game but
didn't. So that was another learning lesson.  
  
Then we were up 20 at Cal, and we learned you can't relax and let teams make a
run on you. I think all of those things are preparing us for now and they've
made us better.  
  
When we played Oregon a couple weeks ago, we played 30 minutes of good
basketball, and then 10 minutes you don't. But against a good team, a top team
in the country, that 10 minutes can be 30 points.  
  
So we know tomorrow to win the game we need to play 40 minutes of really good
basketball. But we're very capable, and I think our team is confident and
feeling good. So I think they're ready for the challenge. I think it's going
to be fun.  
  
Q. Coach, I noticed you're up by about 30 and you almost emptied your
starters, but you left Sam out there for a little bit. Was that in regards to
maybe playing in front of her hometown crowd? She went on a little bit of a
run there for herself. How important was it for her to get out in front of her
hometown crowd and get to play? I know they've seen her, but in a tournament
game here in Vegas?  
COACH BARNES: I think really exciting because I'm sure a lot of people wanted
her to stay here and play here at home. I honestly didn't think about that. I
was just trying to not put everybody in at once and just get the experience
and rest some people, and I was trying to let her get into a little bit of a
rhythm.  
  
But I guarantee Sam didn't even think about that. I think when she's locked in
a zone, she probably didn't even think about that. But I think she is excited.
She had probably 30 people here at the game. But I think it's important for me
to keep her confident and keep her ready because she's a very important part
of what we do, and we need her to play really well against Oregon to win. So
there was a combination.  
  
I think also if you look at our stats sheet, this is probably a season low for
minutes for Aari. She has 32. That sounds like a lot, but she's usually
playing like 38 minutes a game. Sam had 36, so that's probably two minutes
less than she normally plays.  
  
Trying to find a way to also balance that, where we have the positions on the
court, but then we can kind of rest a little bit, was important, just because
we could potentially play four games in four days, and we don't have a
tremendous amount of depth.  
  
Q. Aari, what did you take away from those first two games against
Sabrina, and Maite Cazorla on the other end, too, just their backcourt that
you can use tomorrow?  
AARI MCDONALD: We just can't let them get hot, because like Coach said, they
shoot over 40 percent from three. So we just can't let them get hot. We know
we like to facilitate, so we have to apply more ball pressure. But I'm excited
for this match-up, and so are my teammates. They put on their shoes just like
us, so we're ready.  
  
Q. Cate, a couple of hard fouls in that first half where they send you
to the ground, but then you finished the half with a bucket inside, you hit
the three, you blocked the shot right before the buzzer. After going through a
stretch like that, how would you say you've kind of progressed with the
physicality inside and just how people are generally going to play you from
the start to this point of the season?  
CATE REESE: Sometimes I think it's kind of hard, and I've gotten used to being
undersized, and like my coaches always say, doing your work early, trying to
make sure they don't get the ball so I'm not put in the position to have to
guard them one-on-one. I mean, I think I've grown a lot as a player. When I
came in here, I couldn't play defense at all. So, I mean, I've definitely
gotten better in that aspect --  
  
COACH BARNES: Not all, but it's definitely improved. She was playing like high
school defense.  
  
CATE REESE: We weren't taught defense in high school, so I don't think I
played defense very well. They'll probably say that not in front of the
camera. But I definitely think I've improved, and my teammates, they pick me
up, they taught me a lot. I think I'd give it all to them from where I've
gone, especially on defense. I'm ready for tomorrow, and I think my team is,
too.  
  
Q. Aari, talk about Tee Tee's performance, shooting from the outside to
soften up that defense to allow you to start penetrating?  
AARI MCDONALD: It was amazing. When Tee Tee hit a couple threes in the
beginning, I'm like, okay, I kind of like where this is going, and she
definitely took a lot of pressure off me today, and so did Cate and my other
teammates. Like they're starting to contribute at the right time. But Tee Tee
definitely had an efficient game today, and we need her to continue that for
us to keep winning.  
  
COACH BARNES: I mean, Tee Tee, 5 for 7, 4 for 5 from the three, four rebounds,
14 points, five assists, zero turnovers. I mean, that's pretty amazing.  
  
And the thing about Tee Tee, she's not a shooter. She's just a competitor.
She's a fierce competitor that is not afraid of anybody. She's the type you
tell her you're going to guard Sabrina, she's like, Okay. Other people tell
her, I'm guarding her, she's like, Okay. She's not afraid of anything.  
  
We always -- like as a team, you say she has that dog in her. She definitely
has that in her, and she has that grit, and you can't teach that. She's not
afraid, so she finds ways just to get the job done. And when we need her, she
comes through, and she stepped into a different role.  
  
This is probably the most minutes Tee Tee has played in her college career,
and the exciting thing for us is she's back another year. She had the choice
this season to just have her senior year and be done because she's graduating
this year, but she decided to come back, and despite her injuries, and she's a
leader for us on and off the court, and we would not do a lot of things that
we do without Tee Tee.  
  
So she's important, and she's played great. This last month she has changed.
She's stepped into a role that has been amazing for us, and it's one of the
reasons why we've been successful. Yeah, she's just played great. I think Tee
Tee and Destiny were huge in the first half, especially to get us going.

### [Teaira McCowan](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30397)

### [Jazzmun Holmes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36617)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Mississippi State-101, Arkansas-70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State. We'll start with an opening
statement by Coach Schaefer.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: First of all, I want to congratulate and commend Mike Neighbors
and the University of Arkansas. That is a heck of a basketball team. He has
done an incredible job, him and his staff. That team's so much better than the
one we saw in early January. If that's not an NCAA tournament team, I don't
know what is. They are really good. They have a system. Mike has done a
tremendous job.  
  
You guys don't know this, but he has been such a dear friend throughout my
life. We worked together at Arkansas. He's at a place that he's passionate
about. He's from that state. I couldn't be happier for him.  
  
That's a guy that allowed me to call him every night for six months when I was
going back and forth from College Station to Houston, when my mother was
dying. He talked me home many a night from 12 to 2 in the morning. Never
blinked an eye, said, Call me tomorrow. He's somebody I respect in our
profession, but he's even a better friend and somebody that I love as a
brother.  
  
I'm happy for him that his team was able to have such a tremendous tournament.
Again, wish them the very, very best. That was a heck of a game today. I knew
it would be.  
  
Proud of my kids. I can't tell you how proud I am of these two. I thought our
bench was really special. Bre came off the bench and played extremely well.
Xaria came off again, did a nice job for us, gave us some really good quality
minutes.  
  
Tremendous atmosphere. So proud of my fans. I don't know how many were there,
five, six, seven, eight thousand. Sounded like Starkvegas East. Really a
special atmosphere for both teams.  
  
Again, proud of our team. Proud of Jazz. Good gosh, 12 assists. She had one
turnover. I know she'd like to have that one back. Just running our team, has
all year long. I'll say it again, if there's a better point guard in the
country, she's number one in assist-to-turnover ratio, if there's a better one
in the country, I want to know who it is. That runs her team, has the number
one stat in assist-to-turnover ratio and the other number one stat which is
the W. Her team is 30-2. Four new starters, two of which are new to our
program. She's running that house. She's running that team and has done a heck
of a job.  
  
Proud of T. Your double-double with her, you take it for granted. I don't take
it for granted, but I think it gets overlooked a lot. We gave her the ball
where she needed it today. Three assists, no turnovers. That same team caused
a five player last night to have six turnovers. That's what we talked about,
taking care of the ball, making good decisions. Teaira is just becoming better
and better to play through, instead of like a lot of five players where you
only play to them.  
  
The ability to play through her, to have a two guard standing out there like
Andra going 8 for 11 from three, that's what I call a good inside-outside
game. We certainly had it today.  
  
Proud of these young ladies. So hard to do what they were able to finally do
today. One last thing, then I'll stop rambling. We have had some really good
teams, y'all, that's gotten to this game. 28-8, 34-5 team, and 37-2 team and
they couldn't get it done on Sunday. We talked about this team had a chance to
separate themselves and be that team that could get it done.  
  
I thought they really did it. Today, y'all, is about toughness. When you're in
this tournament three games, three days, four for them, today this game is
about toughness. You got to have it. I thought today they allowed themselves
to really set themselves apart and had their toughness.  
  
Jazz, I don't know how many minutes she's gone. Only went 34. I think she's
gone 40 and 39 and done it at an unbelievable level.  
  
Proud of my team, our university. Proud of how we represented our program
today. It's a great day to be a Bulldog.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Jazzmun and Teaira, what does it feel like to have blue, yellow and
white confetti rain down on you so you get lost in it?  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: It's an unbelievable feeling. We played hard today. We played
with poise. We played together. We came out with the victory. That's what we
did so...  
  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: What Jazz said (laughter).  
  
Q. Teaira, yesterday you said it didn't feel different yet, but that was
only through two games. Now that you've completed all three, how much
different does it feel now?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: It's way different. We get to stay out in the confetti, play
around, take pictures. The other time we were going to the locker room trying
to figure out what we could have done, what we didn't do.  
  
It was just a good feeling being out there on the court with confetti falling.  
  
Q. Jazz, coach mentioned about separating yourselves from previous
teams. Different situations, but what do you feel this team did today to
separate itself from Arkansas and win the championship?  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: I think we played together as a team. We found the open
person, because they were double-teaming T. We made shots. We got to the
paint. I think that was the key thing to this game, getting them off the
three-point line.  
  
That was the game plan, and we executed it.  
  
Q. Jazz, it almost sounds silly to ask, but do you believe you can win
the NCAA tournament given what you've done this year?  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: I mean, we can do anything we put our minds to. This team is
different than last year's team and the teams before. I just feel like if we
play together and execute the game plan, do what he says, I mean, he's done it
before. Today we proved that we can do anything we put our minds to, so I
believe it.  
  
Q. Jazz, you guys aren't usually a team that likes to fire away from
three. What was it like today to see Andra and Bre'Amber to light it up from
three?  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: I mean, amazing. They've been practicing well. We find them
when they're open. You're open, you got to knock down shots in the SEC. Your
window is only so big, so... Glad they knocked down shots.  
  
Q. Teaira, the toughness that's needed to win the SEC tournament, this
team specifically, that toughness never wavered from the first game. How does
this team maintain that energy and effort?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: We just know we can't give in. We know that coach always says,
These games are about toughness. Whether it's being mentally tough or
physically tough, we still have to be in that moment. We still have to dial
in, just find a way to fight through the game.  
  
Q. Where does the leadership come from that sets that example from
everyone?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Him.  
  
Q. Obviously this means a lot to you, families, the school. Two people
told me the coaching staff stayed up all night, could rest on Monday. Talk a
little bit about getting back to that confetti, what it means to Coach
Schaefer in your estimation after three years of walking off the court.  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: I know coach is going to do whatever it takes to win. He's
going to give us his best, whether we're up by 30 or up by 10. I mean, all of
our coaches are going to give their all.  
  
I think we just have to play for them, not only for the name on the front of
our jersey and the back, we have to play for our coaches because they're going
to give their all all the time.  
  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Our coaches, they give us a lot. They don't go to sleep.
(Indiscernible) has a baby. She doesn't get any sleep. Just them sacrificing
their life, their time to make sure that we have a game plan that we can go
out and execute to the fullest, I mean, I thank them for that. Very grateful
for our coaching staff. One of the best in the country, if not the best.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, congratulations. We'll continue with questions for
Coach Schaefer.  
  
Q. I saw a video earlier this morning, you were talking to the team,
mentioning that last year's team weren't able to do this. What does it mean
for this team to be able to accomplish something like this, all the new
faces?  
VIC SCHAEFER: It's just hard to do. It's really hard to do with four new
starters, two new to your program. Replacing that group that we lost a year
ago, they replaced a group we lost before that. We replaced four starters,
this will be three years in a row.  
  
I'm constantly on this group about leadership, being a servant-leader,
toughness. They haven't shown the toughness that I think they can
consistently. To see them come today. We had shootaround this morning. We lose
two hours. We're on Central Standard Time. We're on Eastern now. You lose that
hour. I don't care how long you're here, you never get used to that hour. Then
we lose another hour last night because you're moving the clock up.  
  
I debated again whether to get them up. I think Jazz would have wrung my neck.
They got up this morning. We had a shootaround. 20-hour turnaround. My staff,
they're the best in the world. I mean, they're up. We were down there in that
room. I walked out at 12:45 with my computer to go watch it in the room. They
were still down there. There's papers everywhere. It's just a huge mess.  
  
I had to get somebody to go to my office last night and get some notes that I
needed. They did that. Emailed them to me. So many people that are involved in
this.  
  
Johnnie, Dionnah and Elena, those three are just warriors. When it comes to
preparing a team, spending the time. Dominique had all that film ready. I
mean, you got so many people working to try to put these kids in the best
position that you can to be successful. They're just givers. They're great
Bulldogs. I couldn't be more blessed. We couldn't be more blessed at
Mississippi State with the staff that we have.  
  
Again, that toughness piece. I've been on this team all year about it. To see
them get through today, I know they're going to feel good about it. Just about
every day I'm reminding them how tough we aren't.  
  
Q. Postgame on the podium you're cradling the trophy, welcoming the
confetti, then you turned the other direction and said what looked to be,
Finally. Take me through that moment.  
VIC SCHAEFER: As a coach, I've done this a long time, this is 34 years. We've
cut down some nets. I've cut down a lot of nets in my career. In this
particular venue, in this game, in this conference, as a head coach, that
moment has eluded me.  
  
Again, I believe that God puts you through moments and things that prepare you
for something greater down the line. I've had some heartache in this game over
the years. But my team, my kids, have had the same heartache. Jazz and T have
had that same heartache.  
  
For me, it's about them. It's about those kids. Nobody knows how hard our kids
work except me, my staff. To see the fruits of their labor come to fruition.
As a coach, it's why you do what you do. It's just a very rewarding moment for
me as a coach to see those kids.  
  
We push them. We don't apologize for being demanding at Mississippi State.
We're demanding in the classroom, on the court, in the community. I think
that's what gets these kids ready for the real world.  
  
For me, that's a moment that I really wanted for them. To be standing there
and seeing that, finally being in the confetti, not trying to get out of the
way of it, it was pretty good.  
  
Q. I'm going to ask about the NCAA tournament. Do you feel like you guys
have been a little under the radar and people aren't taking Mississippi State
as strongly as they should for contending for a national title?  
VIC SCHAEFER: The humble side of me said, you know what, we'll just keep doing
what we're doing, we'll just let that speak for itself. There's a pride side
of me in my conference, knowing that we have 14 teams that are monsters, 14
rival games, 16 rival games, 14 teams, that we have to go through, a gauntlet.  
  
Then we come here, and you got to go through another one and play three more
that are off the charts. I mean, we certainly feel like we went through a
gauntlet here.  
  
To go 15-1 in our league, to win the league, then to come here and win the SEC
tournament, we've lost two games, one on the road at No. 4 Oregon, then at
home to a really good Missouri team that probably should be in the top 25.  
  
I don't know what else you can do to not be considered as one of the top seeds
in the tournament. I just don't. But that's out of my hands. We'll go wherever
they send us. I'm not trading my team for anybody else's. I'm taking this
group and we'll go play. I don't care who it is or where. I could care less.  
  
I think these kids feel the same way. We'll keep doing what we are doing. The
SEC side of me, just like that Arkansas team, that's got to be an NCAA
tournament team. They got nine SEC wins now. They just about ran the table in
this tournament, which to me is the hardest thing to win, especially do it the
way they did it. They beat some pretty good teams. Those three teams they beat
are pretty good.  
  
I'm proud of my conference. I'm proud of the teams. I know what we have to go
through. The coaches that we have, the players that are in this conference.
I'd welcome anybody else come live my life in January and February, because
it's hard.  
  
Q. You talked all year about the offense, you haven't seen this team
reach its full potential. Is this what you're talking about today?  
VIC SCHAEFER: A little bit. Again, just like Missouri, I think Arkansas was
going to give us certain things, see if we could make shots. We made shots
today. I mean, good night, we shot 62%, 66% from three, 81% at the line.
That's a pretty good day offensively. I'm pulling my hair out for giving up
70. We held them to 37%. I'm trying to figure out how we gave up 70 points
holding a team to 37%. They made nine threes, even though it was 32% from
there, that hurts you.  
  
Yeah, offensively when you got Bre'Amber Scott coming off the bench to get 20,
Andy shooting at eight for 11 for three, those kids were 12 for 16 by
themselves. Pretty good shooters out there.  
  
Q. You talked so much about Teaira's potential as a basketball player.
When did you start seeing her be able to be a facilitator? Was there a moment
where you began trusting her as someone to run the offense through?  
VIC SCHAEFER: It's only been of late, not a matter of trust, but where I think
she's comfortable and understands for us to win that she's doubled and
tripled, there's somebody open for a dunk. The LSU game at our place, she and
Anriel worked well together in the second half. We got a couple of those. I
think she's learned to enjoy the assist and the success of her teammate as
much as the bucket that she gets herself and the rebounds she gets.  
  
She's just unselfish. I think right now she wants to win. Jazz wants to win. I
had to get on Jazz tonight, she wouldn't take a shot. She's more worried about
the assists. Jazz is such a good offensive player. She was really locked in,
12 assists, one turnover. Just a phenomenal game. Again, I'm so proud and
happy for her. She deserves to be all tournament, to run our team the way
she's run it, not just in this tournament but all year. Very appropriate she
was rewarded for that.  
  
A lot of times kids that aren't scoring, they don't get the recognition they
deserve. I was glad to see whoever voted on that voted her that because she is
certainly deserving.  
  
Q. Where does this one stack up amongst the others?  
VIC SCHAEFER: It's certainly special. It's the first, this one is a first.
Obviously we've had some big regional victories that have taken us to the
Final Four. Those are certainly big games, big moments.  
  
I think what makes today special is we have so many fans here. Mississippi
State is so special with our fan base, how they care about my kids, our
players. I just got to think it's unlike anywhere else. Isn't like this is a
couple hours away. I don't know how long it takes to get here by car. Like I
said, you probably are going to have to get an all-day sucker and pack a
lunch.  
  
I'm so proud of them for being here and providing a great atmosphere for both
teams. It's very rewarding. I hate it, y'all, when we lose because of our
fans. Those fans, they just love our program and our team. They love
Mississippi State. It's unlike anything I've ever seen, anywhere I've ever
been, as far as how they love their university. They're passionate about it.
There is no middle ground.  
  
I don't want to lose for the sake of all those folks that would be so
disappointed. They've been disappointed three years in a row. We've had the
same amount of fans here the last couple years. Just been a little bit of
heartache. So for me personally, there's so much gratification knowing those
fans, their ride home is going to be pretty quick because we gave them a
victory today. I'm just very appreciative of them.  
  
Q. You mentioned losing four starters, adding two new ones. The buildup
to a moment like this has been different for this team than probably any other
in your career. Is this team different from any other team you've had because
of the different buildup?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Without question. We talked about last year's team being unlike
any team I've coached in 33 years. This team is unlike any team I've coached
in 34 years. Just from a standpoint of new faces, chemistry, skill sets that
you have to add, skill sets that we lost. We played a certain way last year, a
lot like Arkansas, except we still had the big piece inside in T.  
  
This is a different team, so as coaches that's what you do. My staff and I, we
try to now, we got a different group, we got to maybe do things a little
differently. We don't quite have the space heaters that can spread you out and
shoot the three as much as we did a year ago, but we've got other kids that do
different things.  
  
Jordan Danberry, I don't care what defense you're in, you're not keeping her
from getting to her spot. She's the best I've ever had. She's explosive. Her
quickness and athleticism. She plays so much bigger than she is. You had a kid
that went from two points a game to 14. Y'all, that don't happen very often.
That's a testament to her, her position coaches working with her, getting her
ready for the season. That's a testament to her in taking the bull by the
horns.  
  
I knew she was like that when I tried to recruit her out of high school. She
turned me down the first time. I got her on the rebound. Not the first time
that's happened to me. It's part of it. I knew she was going to be good. I
knew she could do that. She was a big part of what we did a year ago.  
  
You do that, you got Andy, she played 14 minutes at Connecticut, 14 minutes in
seven games. She's really a freshman. Think about it. She's really a freshman.
She's having to come in not only offensively but now try to do some things
defensively that I want to do, which is a real struggle for some.  
  
I can go down. We can talk about Anriel, all that. It is a different team, but
that doesn't mean we're not as good or better. I think it's still out there
whether we can be better. That's what I've said all year, that's my challenge.
I think the upside for this team is still off the charts. It's my job to see
if we can't get it out of them. I'm going to coach 'em hard, teach 'em hard.
We're going to coach better, teach better every day until the last horn,
whenever that is.  
  
They deserve that from us. That's the only way my staff and I know how to do
it.  
  
Q. How much do you think you'll find yourself thinking about what you
did today, showing up here seven years ago, where the program was then, doing
something that Mississippi State has never done in program history?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I try not to think about the seven years ago thing because I can
remember playing on that Wednesday night, I think Alabama beat us 27. We had
just beaten them at home by 27. We came here, they stood in the 1-3-1, begged
us to shoot it, we accommodated them. I think we scored 43 points. I remember
standing out in the hallway and apologizing to my then-athletic director,
Scott. Of course, he was great. I felt terrible. Felt like we played terrible,
could have played better.  
  
Anyway, I can remember that day. In those days, it's good to keep those in the
back of your mind. I think that motivates you to where we are today. It's just
hard to do. That's all I can tell y'all. I don't have to tell you what we've
done in the last couple years, what our teams have done. This is two years in
a row now you win a Southeastern Conference championship, the regular season,
then to come here and add this championship today, it's what we do at
Mississippi State. We're there to play for championships.  
  
I said that when they hired us. I'm just trying to live up to my end of the
bargain, y'all. That's all I'm trying to do. I think our kids have embraced
it. Dominique and Ketara, that first recruiting class, deserves a lot of
credit. We signed those kids before we ever played a game. Good thing we did
or they may not have ever come.  
  
All those kids are kids to me that took a chance, believed in a vision when
you had nothing to show them. They came in and took the bull by the horns and
made an impact. We were 22-14 their first year. You get Victoria, Blair,
Morgan in the next class, same thing. Those kids, we signed them before we
played that year. They're believing in a vision.  
  
For Johnnie and I, we've been here the longest, we didn't panic that first
year. We were 13-17. We knew what 13-17 looked like. We just went to work. I
think that's what you do as a coach. Just like this year, we got a new team.
Okay, let's go to work. We don't have the people to spread out and shoot the
three, do the things those kids could do. Okay, let's try to build them and
put them in a position where they can be successful.  
  
This is what we do. This is our life. This is the bubble that we live in. We
love it. It's who we are.  
  
Last thing I'm going to tell you all. I want to thank Greenville. They've been
great to our fans, great to us. The city has been wonderful. I've run along
the rapids now two mornings in a row. They've done a great job down there.
Just want them to know how much we appreciate them in hosting us. It's been a
great four days. I want to thank them personally for taking good care of the
Bulldogs.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 10, 2019

  

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Mississippi State-101, Arkansas-70  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arkansas. Coach, if you could start with an
opening statement.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We said yesterday when y'all were asking about what it would
take to win four games in four days, I said we'd have to have tremendous
effort by our players. We got that. We'd have to have tremendous job by our
athletic trainers. We got that. We had to have our strength and conditioning
coach do his thing. We did that. Had a good plan.  
  
At the very end of that I said we have to hope they didn't play very well. I
was honest. I'm telling you, they just played great. We had no answer. We were
drawing stuff in the dirt literally trying to figure it out. They're just
really, really hard to guard, especially when they play like they did, shoot
it like they did on the perimeter.  
  
They got our best effort, but I feel like we got their best effort, too.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Malica, you kind of have been with this team for a long time. This is
disappointing. How does it feel to finish largely the way the team did?  
MALICA MONK: I wouldn't necessarily say it's a disappointment. It's actually a
goal achievement. Even though we didn't win, nobody expected us to come out
this far. I just feel like it's a really great experience to be out here
competing with the best and able to compete with my teammates, get as far as
we did. That's the best group of girls I have played basketball with.  
  
I'm hoping and praying we make it to the tournament so we can continue what
we're doing.  
  
Q. What do you feel about the state of the program going forward?  
MALICA MONK: We are headed in a great direction. As long as you have Coach
Neighbors on the coaching staff, there's no doubt this program is going to
excel up.  
  
Q. Chelsea, bittersweet? Reflect on the experience.  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: I'm proud of our team. I'm proud of the senior class. They've
led this team from the get-go. I'm so thankful these guys accepted me. We
played great. I'm thankful you guys believed in me, I'm thankful for the
coaching staff, I'm thankful for Coach Neighbors for believing in me.  
  
This is a great group of girls to be a part of and a great team.  
  
Q. Chelsea, your points is an SEC record. What does that mean to you?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: It means a lot. I'm really excited and really happy. I've
worked really hard behind closed doors. Just to see goals like that
accomplished, I'm thankful for my teammates. They're just as responsible for
helping me get to that goal as I am. I'm just thankful for them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate on what type of matchup problems McCowan caused for
you today?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: You can't prepare for it. If Gafford would have flew down here
with us... I'm telling you, at our place, when we played them, Gafford walked
by her, he looked at her, Do you think you can guard her? Maybe not.  
  
I don't think there's a way to guard her if they shoot it the way they shot
it. She's so good at using the airtime of the past to seal your position. You
can't move her. She's going to move you four to six feet every time she
touches you. She's an impossible matchup for 95% of the college basketball
teams out there.  
  
We tried everything. Like I said, we were literally drawing stuff up in the
dirt to try to stop her. She had four points in the second half or six. That
just opened it up for the shooters to have what they did all the way down to
the buzzer.  
  
Q. Monday, Tuesday, did you see any of this coming? How does what
happened this weekend change the narrative of your program?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We were talking an awful loft about the NIT. I think now you
change that completely to NCAA talk. That's what the SEC is about. That's why
you play in this league. If you can do what we did... Now we have three wins
over top 25 teams. We didn't have that before. Now we do.  
  
Last Friday I actually sat in for Cam Newbauer on the NCAA conference call
because he was having to play. I justifiably so, we didn't talk about
Arkansas, but no problem with that then. I wouldn't if that happened again
this Monday.  
  
I think our résumé stacks up as well as a lot of the teams being talked about.
I followed it intently for 15 years. I hadn't even got a folder out yet for
this year until now. When I get home, it will be one of the first things I'll
do.  
  
We're a 20-win SEC team, won nine games within our league. We beat teams that
are certainly already in the field. The narrative is going to change a lot. I
haven't put a tweet out in about three months for a reason. I've been saving
it. Get ready.  
  
Q. You mentioned how well they shot the basketball today. Coach Schaefer
remarked yesterday when they played through Teaira, that opens up things. If
they make it, bonus. How have you seen them evolve offensively, playing
through her more?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: They have. But I think you can run about any offense. She is a
piece that you build around, and they have. They went out and got kids that
make shots. Hunter from UConn. Danberry from Arkansas. People like that. They
surrounded her with pieces. A great point guard like Jazzmun Holmes. When she
gets the stats sheets, she's looking for the A and the TO, not the points and
rebounds.  
  
He's built a tremendous program. I was lucky enough to go down there and spend
time with him three years ago. When I was at Washington, we talked a lot about
offense, tried to learn some defense.  
  
They are incredibly good on both ends of the floor. It's why they are as good
as they are. 70 points against those guys with only 12 turnovers feels like an
'atta'boy'. You look up, you got beat by 31. That's how good they are.  
  
He's got them completely focused. They were playing down to the buzzer like it
was a two-point game. That's hard to instill in kids. It's tough to play
against. I know that's what they're trying to do with their team. We'll get to
that point someday.  
  
Q. Can you reflect on the performance by Chelsea Dungee breaking the
record this week in the tournament.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yeah, I think her performance is who she's always been in her
life. Now that she's here where she's surrounded by a group of people on and
off the court, she's had a chance to really become a great teammate and grow
up as a teammate. Now her game is getting ready to go to another level, too.
This is just scratching the surface of what this kid can do.  
  
She talked about working behind the scenes. I'll elaborate a little bit on
that. She completely changed her off-the-court regime with rest and diet and
exercise, focus in the classroom. As a result, she's able to play at this
level. She's only been like that for about six months. Wait till she's been
like that for a year and six months.  
  
We have some pieces coming, even though we're graduating a great class, we
have some pieces coming in that will build and start to look a little bit more
like teams at the top of our league.  
  
She is a kid who really, really takes a lot of pride in her team's success.
She wants to win as much as anybody. I think that's going to be the biggest
difference you see in her next year.  
  
Q. How do you feel about the program going forward?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Excited. We had a four-year plan that we're going to have to
erase I heard, talking to some people a year ahead. I'm okay with that. Jumped
a few hurdles quicker.  
  
I think the number -- you kind of number it by the number of text messages you
get after losses. The wins, you're going to get everybody. I had about 600 of
them. That's a good sign.  
  
We're going to do some home visits next week while we're sitting around. We
have every resource we need at the University of Arkansas to do it and get to
the top of the league. Mississippi State is a perfect example of that. Five or
10 years ago, this was a team playing early in the week, going home early in
the week. Now they've been here four or five straight years. They're somebody
we can look at.  
  
I think we've got a lot of those boxes checked already. We'll go to work
checking a few more this summer.  
  
Q. The amount of minutes that your starters played, do you think today
was a sign of fatigue?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We've never worked on four games in four days. I think it was
certainly a factor.  
  
But, no. The big answer is no. We start taking the load off their legs all the
way back into December. I guarantee you if we checked our load on our legs,
it's about the same as what we've had in a normal week. We didn't take our
shoot, gave them extra rest.  
  
I think the mental fatigue. It's that mental grind. We were all at the hotel
yesterday. Those people know us by name at the hotel. The places we've been
going to eat, they know us by name. We've been for a long time.  
  
There's a reason the top two get two byes. They make it a challenge for the 10
seed and below to play four or five games because we didn't perform as well
over the course of the year. That's the hard part. The mental side of it, the
up and the down, the quick turnarounds. That's why the higher seeds should get
an advantage.  
  
I don't think our kids were tired. I think, if anything, they may have been a
little bit mentally fatigued.  
  
Q. How proud are you of showing how tough they were, no quit?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: You're exactly right. That's the gist of those 600 texts, are
all about people being proud of the fight, the way we did it. All the way down
to the buzzer, every single day, coming back from a huge deficit yesterday,
bouncing back with a quick turnaround against one of the teams I think should
be considered for a top seed in the NCAA tournament.  
  
Very proud. It takes everybody in our staff, all the way to people that didn't
even make the trip with us, to get it to that point. It's been a year-long
process. We've had our ups and downs, some curves in the road. Where we're at
right now in finishing, I think that's what this team will always remember
about each other and what we'll be remembered for.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Thank you.

_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Mississippi State-71, Missouri-56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State. Coach, if you could please
start with an opening statement.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Just really proud of my team today. We beat a very good Missouri
team. Have so much respect for Robin and her staff. My heart was heavy going
into the game knowing that Willie wasn't there on their bench. I know what
he's going through.  
  
Really proud of my team and how they competed today. Loved how we came out of
the gate to start. These kids have really locked in and have played well since
we got here.  
  
Beat a good team today, a team that really played very well at our place. As
everybody knows, kept us from being 16-0. I thought we answered today. Second
quarter again was a big quarter for us. Anriel double-double, 19-10. T goes
for 16-27, with two assists. She's the most unselfish big kid in the country.
As well as so many other things. Really allowed us to play through today. I
thought she was really, really special.  
  
Anriel is getting more and more comfortable playing with her and finding her,
and T finding Anriel. I think this duo is finally getting some chemistry
between the two, enjoying the success of one another. I think that's part of
why we're playing so well together.  
  
Anriel comes out and is three for five from three. Jazz ran us great, four
assist, one turnover, 39 minutes, two steals. She was three for eight at half.
Every shot she's getting is really a good look.  
  
Thought Jordan answered. She started out a little slow, got in foul trouble
early, but came back with five assists, 10 points.  
  
Proud of my bench. Wiggins comes off the bench today and plays extremely well.
Made a big shot for us. The difference in the game the first time, they had 24
points off our turnovers. Today they had four points off our turnovers. We
only had 24 points in the paint the first time. Today we have 40. Those were
things we all talked about. We needed to fix them. I thought we fixed them.  
  
Proud of our kids. Proud of the victory. Giving God the glory for 29-2. We
need one more.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Anriel, you and Sophie have had a nice battle the last couple of
games. What has it been like going back and forth with her? What is that
competition like?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: I think that we're both just hungry and competitive. We want to
help our team win. Yes, it got a little competitive out there, like I said.
That's just part of the game. She's a great player. I respect her, so...  
  
Q. Teaira, the difference between the first game for you and the second
game, it looked like maybe today you did a better job of establishing low post
presence deep in the paint. How would you comment to that? Do you feel that
was the case, did you work on that hard?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I just had to get a feel for the game. The first time was
turning, turning to them, it was offensive fouls. I was just trying to do my
work early, mirror the ball, see where it was coming, then duck in.  
  
Q. Anriel, did you worry or have any concerns about coming to a team
with so many veterans who had accomplished so much, how you would fit in? How
easy was the transition for you?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: This is something that I've wanted. I knew what I was getting
myself into as far as the standard and expectation of this program. I wanted
to be a part of it, help it any way that I could.  
  
But I'm just really grateful to finally be a part of it. We got a lot of goals
that we're ready to achieve.  
  
Q. Teaira, how was the transition with Anriel coming to Mississippi
State?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: She's been great. She helps me on the inside rebounding. When
her man is coming down, she's knocking off shots down there. She's a good
token to have on this team.  
  
ANRIEL HOWARD: Thank you.  
  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: You're welcome (laughter).  
  
Q. Teaira, there was a moment in the second quarter where you fell down.
You stayed down for a while. Looked like you got up a little dazed. Throughout
the course of the season, taking hits like that, being able to respond, is
that something you've learned this year?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: Yeah, coach always say you got to be a pro. You get hit, I get
hit night in, night out. Got to get up, shake it off, be a pro.  
  
Q. Coach might quibble with the team's defense given he probably did a
square on the 47.5. Defensively, he's talked about your team defense
throughout the course of the season. It could be argued the defense is getting
better, more help. There are more signs maybe the coach is applauding. How do
you feel about the team's progress defensively even though statistically it
may not show?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: I think sometimes we fall asleep and lose our man. Tonight we
fell asleep a couple times. They got their three off. That's what I see. But
coach may have something different.  
  
ANRIEL HOWARD: I agree. Also I think we're finally learning -- we're gaining
chemistry on defense. I think our biggest issue from what I've noticed is
helping the helper. Now we're finally doing that. We're scrambling, going to
find the open man. I think we've been progressing individually as well. Well,
I hope so. I think I've been doing a little better defensively, so yeah.  
  
Coach Schaefer, take it away (laughter).  
  
Q. Anriel, coach mentioned the chemistry that you and Teaira started to
come together. When did you see that start to happen or consistently?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: That's a great question. I mean, we practice every day
together. I mean, just being able to be out there together every day, you'll
get chemistry eventually. It may have taken a little longer for me just
because I am in a new program, so I was just trying to get chemistry with
everybody. Understanding where I'm supposed to be, understanding the offense a
little more. I feel like I'm finally understanding it. It's helping Teaira and
my's chemistry. We're showing we can be a really good duo together.  
  
Q. Anriel, defining success defensively, growing, you were forced onto
Sophie when Bre and Jordan picked up two quick fouls in the first half. She
had a lot of points, but it was enough to win. How do you define success when
you're guarding someone like her?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: Well, I mean, you have to make her uncomfortable. You have to
be able to make her work. I thought that once I got on her a little bit, I'm a
bigger person, so I think that bothered her a little bit.  
  
She still ended up having a lot of points. I think it made her uncomfortable.
I think that helped with our success.  
  
Q. Teaira, this is now your fourth straight year in the championship
game. Coach mentioned the team seemed to be locked in since you've been here.
Has this year felt a little different?  
TEAIRA McCOWAN: No, not at all. I mean, we just keep trying to get to the next
game, the next game. We can't celebrate because it's not the last game.  
  
It doesn't feel any different from last year when we got here.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Obviously South Carolina is out of the tournament now, but that
aside, does it feel like this tournament might be different for y'all, you
might finally be on the verge of doing something that you've never done
before?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I don't think it has anything to do with who's in and who's out
right now for us. I think for us, we've just always been focused on Friday
night against Tennessee, today against Missouri. Whoever it is tomorrow, it
wouldn't matter. Teaira, she told you, Hey, this is how it's felt the last
three years. I just want it to feel different at 2 tomorrow, feel different at
4. I'm tired of walking off the floor and confetti hitting me on my backside
as I'm going to the locker room. I want to stand in the middle of it and have
it hit me in the face.  
  
For us, we have a saying of 'one more'. We've had that for a couple years now
with our season. You can use it right now in this tournament even. Whoever we
got to play, man, they're going to be number one playing really well, they're
going to be hot, as hot as they've been all year. We'll have to be ready to
play.  
  
Our style of play is different than both those teams out there. They don't
play man-to-man defense like we do. They're not picking up full court. They
don't have a 6'7" kid that's been dragging people up and down the floor 38
minutes a night, tonight 40. I'm curious to see how we respond.  
  
I know how it's been the last three years. We've looked like we're the team
that's half a step slow. My focus in there when talking to our kids was, Take
care of yourself starting right now, eat right, get an ice bath, cry, whatever
we're doing, get back, get off your feet, get some rest. That's where I'm at
right now.  
  
But it's one more. These seniors, four of them, five of them, they got one
more for the rest of their life. It's one more for the rest of your life. What
have you got?  
  
Q. Anriel and Teaira, after the game yesterday, Anriel said she didn't
want to be outworked. The ability to get as deep as Teaira did, then really
attack the glass like both of them did, how much was that something that you
stressed?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Anriel hasn't had a day in her career at Mississippi State in
basketball where somebody outworked her. She has a motor that is off the
chart. I liken her motor every day to a Dominique Dillingham who played for
us, just practice games, it's every day, does it with a smile, great attitude.  
  
She got a little fired up tonight. I'm excited about that because I know how
competitive she is. At the same time sometimes you got to realize, hey, we're
okay, we're winning. Don't let anybody get under your skin.  
  
But I like that. I like to see 'em getting fired up. For her, she's not going
to ever get outworked. That kid is going to be a great pro. Somebody is going
to get a kid that every day is going to make their team better. What will
happen with her, she's going to make some veteran mad, and they're going to
tell her, You need to pull it back a little bit. Anriel ain't going to pull it
back. The coach who gets her ain't going to want her to pull it back either.
She'll make some veteran pro mad because she's going hard, she'll be
embarrassing them because of how hard she plays.  
  
Q. Looks like Missouri at times was missing Akira Levy tonight. Did you
see that with the press?  
VIC SCHAEFER: She was really good at our place. At our place she was the best
player on the floor. She really played well for them, was a different kind of
point guard for them. That kid is going to have a great career. I hate what
happened to her. She'll be back. She'll be faster and stronger than ever. In
today's medical world...  
  
She's a heck of a player.  
  
Q. You mentioned playing through Teaira today, not just for her scoring-
wise, but the two assists. How important moving forward is it going to be,
facilitating through her with her passing ability? How big is that going to
be?  
VIC SCHAEFER: It's something, again, that just adds to her game. She's not all
about herself. She's all about the team, she's all about winning. That's a kid
that's worked hard on her game. She's five out of five at the free-throw line
today. She's down there battling against two, three people hanging on her most
nights.  
  
We talked about playing careful tonight. At our place, she was like a bull in
a china cabinet. She broke every plate in the cabinet, fouled out. We talked
about playing careful tonight, getting a feel for what it was going to be
like, how they were going to guard her early.  
  
I just thought tonight she was really special. When we went to her, she
delivered. At the same time I just think her and Anriel are getting more
comfortable with each other every day and enjoying each other's success. I
think that's sometimes really hard, y'all, in today's world. Everybody thinks
they got to get theirs. Your good teams, you don't have kids that are wanting
that. They're wanting to win. The rest will take care of itself. I think
that's where this team's getting to a little bit. It's good to see.  
  
Q. Anriel said she had to adjust, learn the offense. From your point of
view, how easy was that transition?  
VIC SCHAEFER: It's been a challenge. I think she's handled it great. I think
her teammates deserve a lot of credit for helping her. Anriel has worked hard
on her game. She's expanded her range. She's still a load down low. She's a
great midrange kid. She's got a lot of tools.  
  
But I think for her, the defensive piece has been a little bit of a challenge
just because we play a lot different than where she's from. Again, you get a
kid that's been in high school, they do it this way. Then she goes to a place
that's pretty successful, a university that's pretty successful, they won a
lot of games. They had their own way of doing things.  
  
Now she's coming to our place, we do things a whole lot different. You're not
just a low post player. You're not just a high post player. I'm wanting you to
step out, stretch it, develop that part of your game, go off the bounce,
create that part of your offensive game. By the way, you're going to get in
the press, we'll press people, you have to guard people player for player.
That can be a challenge.  
  
She's handled it like a champ. Her teammates have really been good for her.
I'm going to tell you, she's really special, y'all. From a work ethic,
attitude, she's just a joy to coach. I would have loved to have coached her
for four years.  
  
Q. Were there some things about Anriel that surprised you by what you
got?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I just think her energy rebounding. That's the first thing that
jumps off the chart at you when you're watching her practice. Even in
shootaround. You get kids walking through, jogging. We don't have any walk-
throughs. We tape, go through an hour and a half at home. We're getting after
it.  
  
Sometimes kids will come in and they might just only be going half speed.
She's going to embarrass you. She's going hard, getting every rebound. That's
just the infectious play that she brings. I mean, you got to know, hey, if
you're not ready, she's going to ruin your day in basketball. That's what you
love about her.  
  
I'm hoping my young kids see that because that's a piece, y'all, that's really
hard to replace, that energy level. A lot of kids are talented, but they don't
have that energy level.  
  
I talk about it all the time. In recruiting, they have a number by their name
because of their skill set. I want to know what the number is by your heart
because that's what separates you and allows you to play in our program. If
you don't have a low number by your heart, high ranking, it's really hard to
play that style of play.  
  
Q. How do you define success in guarding Sophie Cunningham? Did you meet
that today?  
VIC SCHAEFER: She gets 33. Nobody else had more than six. Two with five and
one with six. That's a pretty good day. She's good. We ran the gamut on her.
Used two, three different kinds of sizes on her. Anriel had the most success
on her, to be honest with you. Her size bothered her a little bit, her
competitiveness.  
  
I mean, I think you don't just talk about individuals. I mean, we've guarded
other greats. Chennedy Carter at Texas A&M. She might have 28, but you're
doing a good job as a team on everybody else. I think over the years when
we've had to play Kelsey Plum at Washington, some of those kids are going to
get there, but you have to do a good job on everyone else, then you win the
game.  
  
All the kids did a good job on whoever they were guarding. Another one got 13,
somebody got 12, somebody got 10. That starts adding up. Again, I think we
made her work. She had to work really hard to get that.  
  
Q. There was a stretch in the second quarter, she missed four shots. Do
you see the progress helping the helper, being in the passing lanes a little
bit more, overall team defense where it's getting closer to what you want to
see?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think there's stretches. We have glimpses of hope. For me, I
think you have those opportunities. You see those things. I'm looking for
consistency. I'd like to string together four, five games now doing it in the
50s. We did that in the middle of conference, then it got away from us. We
were back giving up 60-something. I know we're scoring a lot.  
  
Still, you know me, I'd like to see us engaged defensively because we're
really good in the open floor in transition. We get some steals, get out on
the break, Jo is running, Jazz is pushing. We're pretty good.  
  
For us, that's just a constant work in progress. I'm glad we held them to 56
today. That's awfully good. We gave up 75 at home to them. That's a nice
little 19-point turnaround, if my math serves me right, my three hours of
college algebra I had.  
  
Q. How much have you seen Sophie Cunningham's game evolve over the last
four years?  
VIC SCHAEFER: To me, she's always been that competitor. She's just an
unbelievable competitor. Wills her team. I think what she's really added is
she's now posting up down low on guards that are smaller than her. She can
really stretch you. She has the catch and shoot. She has that in her game
where she can catch and shoot, doesn't need a very big window. In this league,
you don't get a very big window. She's shooting like 50% y'all from three.
Pretty good. Ain't like people are losing her. Your job going into a game
guarding her is don't lose her. She's shooting 50% with people knowing she's
going to be out there and you don't need to be losing her. You have to give
that kid credit.  
  
I think Robin has done a tremendous job developing her. Robin is going to miss
her. We're all going to miss our seniors. That kid has been really good for
them, been a part of a lot of victories. Anriel, Jo, been a part of a lot of
victories for me, and Zion. Your team changes, you get new players, get a new
identity. That's what coaching is.  
  
I'm not going to miss her, I can tell you. She's a vicious, ferocious
competitor, so...  
  
Thank y'all for being here. Appreciate your coverage. Praise the Lord and go
Dogs.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

### [Hannah Schuchts](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36659)

### [Sophie Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30334)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Mississippi State-71, Missouri-56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Missouri. Coach, if you could please make an
opening statement.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: Obviously tough game for us. Give a lot of credit to
Mississippi State and Vic Schaefer. He's done a great job. He's got a great
team. We had our hands full tonight. We just didn't do a very good job
controlling that paint. The first time we played them, I think we had more
points than they did in the paint. We struggled with that tonight.  
  
McCowan and Anriel, both such talented kids. Obviously not only offensively,
defensively they rebounded the ball well. Any game you only get two offensive
rebounds, you're making it challenging to yourself. Shot at a good percentage.
Didn't get to the free-throw line like we would have. You're playing against a
really good team, a team that's really hungry to win a championship. We knew
it was going to be a battle.  
  
I'm proud of our kids. I'm so excited for this young lady, just her
accomplishment becoming the all-time leading scorer at the University of
Missouri. She worked her tail off for every single point she's ever scored.
It's been an honor and privilege to coach her. Excited we're not quite done
yet.  
  
I think Hannah had a great tournament, too. She really stepped up these last
couple games. It was fun to see her take that jump as a player. Overall we
just had a hard time offensively getting in any kind of flow. Had a hard time
with Anriel and McCowan.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Hannah, obviously McCowan is a matchup problem for any team. What
makes her so difficult to guard?  
HANNAH SCHUCHTS: She's a really good player. I think she is a tough load to
handle for any team. We tried our best. We fought. But she's a really good
player. I think she's going to go on to do big things. All the credit to her
really.  
  
Q. Sophie, when you hit those threes, had 11 straight, did you think you
were getting yourselves back into it and make a run?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Honestly the whole game, that was my mindset. I'm a
competitor. Until that buzzer goes, I'm going to fight till the end.  
  
Yeah, when you're feeling it, you think you're going to get really close. We
did. We got it to five. We did a lot of things to ourselves, too. Too many
turnovers on their press. We didn't rebound like we wanted to.  
  
Yeah, it's tough. Tough matchup.  
  
Q. Sophie, when you got the record and looked over at the bench,
everybody celebrating, how did that feel?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Well, I was just actually celebrating the shot. My mind was
not there. But I was feeling it for a little bit right there. Let's go. Trying
to get my team into it. That wasn't really about the record. That kind of went
out of my head a little bit.  
  
Yeah, it's cool. It's not just me getting that record. My team has gotten me
the ball, gotten me open. My coaches put me in great positions to get this
record. I worked my tail off for it. It was never actually a goal of mine
until I got close and people were telling me about it. That's definitely a
team effort.  
  
Q. Sophie, is it a little bit bittersweet maybe this SEC component of
your career is done now?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: No, no, it's not. I wish I could play every single night,
honestly. Coming into this game, we beat Mississippi State five out of the
eight quarters. Honestly, it's not a fluke. We gave them our best shot. Our
coaches know what they're doing. They're doing great game plans. We have to go
out there and execute.  
  
I wish I could play an SEC opponent every single night. We are the best league
in the whole country.  
  
Q. Sophie, you talked a lot about this team's resiliency, showing that
again today. How are you feeling going into the NCAA tournament?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, right now I'm frustrated. I wish we could have done
better. I still believe, I'm just a competitor. I still think we could have
got that win. I'm a little frustrated.  
  
I'm really happy where our team is at, too. I think we're going to go on a
deep run. We got to shore up on some things. We're still learning. I think if
we continue to have that growth mindset, we do that. It's one day at a time
for this team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. You remarked about the first game. It looked like Teaira and Anriel
did a really good job of getting deep into the lane. Did you see that as a
primary difference between this game and the first game?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I felt like they attempted to do that in our first game, too.
I think we held our ground a little bit better. But, yeah, we gave up a lot of
really deep post catches. When you're 6'7", you get it right under the rim,
that's awfully challenging to stop.  
  
I didn't think we did a good enough job holding our ground. We talked about
low man wins. Anriel is so versatile, hit those threes in the first half. You
make a little adjustment. We weren't ever planning on giving her open threes.
Once she hit a couple, tighten up. But she's also so good at getting to the
rim. Again, just a great offensive rebounder.  
  
That's a pretty tough tandem, for sure.  
  
Q. Were y'all thinking this was going to be a game that Mississippi
State was going to come out considering you had gotten that victory against
them on the road?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Come out what?  
  
Q. With particular vigor.  
ROBIN PINGETON: I think you're playing in the SEC tournament. You're playing
to go to the championship game. I don't think it matters who won, who lost.
You're just competing, trying to survive and advance.  
  
I don't think any of us like to lose in this league. Players, coaches. I think
we all look at it as we've all got 15 rivalries. It's going to be a battle
every night. I don't know if there was added incentive or not.  
  
Our focus was we wanted to compete to the best of our ability to put ourselves
in a position to be in that championship game. Been a while since the
University of Missouri has been there. We felt good about the way we were
playing. We did feel like they'd come out and really try to kind of create
some pressure, wreak some havoc in that full court. We didn't do as good of a
job with that this time around. We played rushed basketball instead of playing
at the pace we need to play at to give ourselves a chance to be successful.  
  
Q. A lot of production from several other players in the first game.
Today Sophie had 33 and no one else had more than six. What was Mississippi
State doing different, if anything, from game one?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I thought it was a really physical game. I thought they really
guarded hard on the perimeter. We had some looks that we didn't knock down,
although we shot a pretty good percentage as a team. Sophie was a pretty big
part of that. We just had a hard time getting around people.  
  
They were switching screens, getting through screens, just a tremendous
defensive effort from Mississippi State. I think you got to give them a lot of
credit. They guarded the ball hard, didn't give you a lot of opportunities to
create off the bounce.  
  
I think that's where Akira Levy makes a big difference for us. She has the
ability to create a little bit more off the bounce and get to that paint that
might open up something for someone else. She's an awfully good passer. I
thought that was really apparent tonight, how much we missed her against teams
that can pressure as well as Mississippi State does.  
  
Q. Your team is right on that four- or five-seed bubble. What has this
team showed to get an opportunity to host?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I think we've shown great resiliency. We've had some really
big wins. I don't know, four, five, top-20 wins this season. That's great. I
think we've also had some tough losses that we had to learn from, go back to
the drawing board.  
  
When you look overall at the body of the work, I'll be honest with you, I
haven't studied where everybody else is at, who else is on the bubble of
hosting, what that looks like, I think that's really hard to do when you're in
the middle of SEC play.  
  
I'm really proud of our kids. I think finish as a five seed in the SEC,
satisfied? Absolutely not. But it's a tough league. We competed. We beat some
really good teams this year. Certainly had our fair share of tough losses that
we had to own. It's a pretty special group, very resilient. It's been fun to
see the growth from the start of the season to where we're at now.  
  
Q. Jazzmun Holmes gets a lot of attention for her defense. Her ability
to run the team, get the team into the sets that coach wants. How would you
describe that? Is that underrated?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I would definitely agree with you. Things like that don't
necessarily show up in a box score. But she's such a great athlete. She plays
with great pace. She has a great demeanor. Things like that you don't get
credit for.  
  
I think she's had an outstanding season for them. She knows her role. She's
very good at it. She can create, too. She can be a lot more aggressive
offensively if she wanted to be. But I think she's such an unselfish kid, she
knows what Coach Schaefer wants, does a tremendous job for that program.  
  
Q. You had a nightmare problem with Sophie over the last four years for
other teams. What kind problem is Anriel? What has she added to that
dynamic?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Incredible athlete. I mean, incredible. Great lateral speed.
She's one of the best leapers in this league. She has a nose for the ball.
She's tough, gritty. She plays every possession hard.  
  
Yeah, I don't know if it was developed or spent time on or maybe it was always
there, but it wasn't her role at Texas A&M. Just her versatility, being able
to score from the outside, as well as create off the bounce. She's just a
great all-around player, no doubt about it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Chelsea Dungee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36599)

### [Jailyn Mason](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36664)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Arkansas-58, Texas A&M-51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arkansas. We will start with an opening
statement from coach, please.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Don't ask me any questions about how it happened because I
honestly don't know. The last thing I remember Coach Schaefer saying is they
made six of their last nine field goals and that can't happen any more. I
don't think they made another one, maybe one or two.  
  
The sequencing of events, I'm usually pretty good at remembering things that
happened. I don't remember the exact things that happened. All I know is that
our timeouts were incredibly positive, were incredibly player-driven. All we
did was make some tactical things, we stuck to it. Until Jerry said we closed
on a 17-0 run, I had no idea that was the case. Was that right? 17 or 16? I
had no idea. I just knew we buckled down.  
  
It seemed like in the fourth quarter we got every 50/50 ball. Then we created
some we probably shouldn't have had 50/50.  
  
As far as going to the championship game for the first time in our school's
history, couldn't be more proud that it's with this group of kids. We're a
blended family. Jailyn stuck around in a time, in a climate where every kid
has every opportunity to bolt on a university and a team, and she didn't.
Thank you for staying.  
  
JAILYN MASON: You're welcome.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Along with the other kids that did, y'all can go through and
list them. To get a few kids to believe in us from the get-go, like Chelsea
did, IT did, like Raven did, Lex. I couldn't be more proud to be associated
with them, get to fly around and ride on the bus with them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Jailyn, coach couldn't put into words or explain it. Can you?  
JAILYN MASON: No, I really can't. It's an unbelievable feeling right now. For
the past three years, this is the first time I've been here in this situation.
I'm extremely proud to be able to have Coach Neighbors be my head coach and
have people like Chelsea come out and be so positive, have such a great impact
on our team. We're really excited for where we're going right now.  
  
Q. Chelsea? Can you put into words, explain it?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: I don't think any of us can right now. It hasn't even hit me
yet that we're playing in the finals tomorrow. I'm sure it will tonight.  
  
But, no, like Coach Neighbors said, I'm so happy to be a part of this team, so
happy that I chose this school, to be coached by Coach Neighbors, to play with
people like Jailyn and our seniors. We have a special group, we really do.  
  
We fought through adversity together. This is something that we fought so hard
for.  
  
Q. Chelsea, things weren't working for you early. They were keying on
you. How did you stay focused and not force things?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: That's just part of the game. I just let it come to me. I
always let it come to me. My teammates do a great job of picking me up when I
need picked up, and vice versa.  
  
Q. Chelsea, throughout the game, seems like three and a half quarters
team was struggling, then it started clicking. Can you attribute that to
anything?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: We had to buckle down on defense. We had to get stops, put
them together. That created offense. That created a 17-0 run.  
  
Q. Jailyn, Coach Blair was just in here, the Texas A &M head coach, he
talked about how the Aggies were just out-hustled. At the end you were making
the plays, out-tough them. How are y'all not tired right now?  
JAILYN MASON: This is extreme confidence in every single one of our players,
five on the floor, the others on the bench, from our coaches. We knew exactly
what we had to do. We knew the possession arrow was in our favor, how many
fouls we had left to give. Having that conscious awareness of the game from
every person on the floor and bench really helps us, just keeps us really
motivated to keep our motor running.  
  
Q. Jailyn, coach mentioned how you stuck with the program. Now you're
playing for an SEC title. Did you think that was going to happen?  
JAILYN MASON: I had extreme confidence in Coach Neighbors once he got here.
He'll probably tell you we sat down and had an hour-long conversation because
I had a list of questions. He's a champion. He went through them with me and
told me what his philosophy was. I'm a part of it, I want to be a part of
this. I knew his winning record. I was excited to have him as our coach.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you came to Arkansas in a different way. For this to happen
this year after you were in so many close games, was this in your plans for
the weekend?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: I've always been a believer. With this group of girls, I know
this is a special year. This is the year that we can accomplish so many
things. Just like tonight, like I said, it's just a special group.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I want these guys to hear this. I know I'm not supposed to
talk and answer. We started working for this specifically in mid December,
taking an extra day on Fridays for what we call game after the game, where
these guys actually get two days a week off, they don't really realize it, but
they pretty much do. We start working for the post-season then. They'll figure
this out after they graduate. They can talk to Heather, my GA. We lose a few
games in the middle of the year because of the way we practice and prepare.
But it's so that when you get to this time of the year, we're fresh, we're
happy. It's the freshest we've been, the happiest we've been, the most
together we've been.  
  
We dealt with things. We didn't back down from one challenging situation all
year. We had some on our foreign trip. We had some at the pre-season. I'm
waiting for it. Any time we're together six days, we start doing something.
Isn't that right? But we're not going to do it this time because we can see.
We fought through it. We've dealt with everything. A small deficit isn't
anything compared to what this group has fought through and come out of on the
other side, a team that I'm just really, really proud of and for.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Slow start to quarters. It took a while to get things in rhythm.
Seemed like the end of the quarter was a culmination of all the previous
quarters.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We were tired. I was tired. I called two plays tonight that we
don't even have. I called two actions that we don't even have.  
  
We were tired. We were spent. A lot of energy. There was that timeout. We got
in there and talked about buckling down. They were leading it before we got in
there. From that point on, I was energized. They were energized. They
energized us.  
  
You don't want Coach Blair to have the clipboard in his hand. If he can sit
over there and draw something up, they're going to get the ball where they
want it, to the person they want it.  
  
When we were able to string together some consecutive stops, he wasn't able to
call his plays over there. I think that's one advantage to having sat on his
bench for a couple of years and followed his career obviously very closely.  
  
We wanted to make sure he didn't have the clipboard in his hand at the end. I
thought the play when Chelsea hit the three coming out that stretched the lead
out to a two-possession game was massive. Our execution was so good.  
  
They were so locked in. I think that was the difference in the end of the game
and the beginning of the game.  
  
Q. Would you say they as a team took over the game in the fourth quarter
by themselves?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Sure. They've been doing that, though. I don't have any
problem saying that. That means we did a good job in practice. If we're having
to coach a team at this time of the year, we didn't do our job in November and
December and January and February.  
  
They see things. They're our best source of information. They know how they're
feeling better than we do. We ask them what defense they want to be in,
double-team or not. They all had great answers.  
  
The less you have to hear from us the better, I think.  
  
Q. They appeared to be more active defensively in the fourth quarter.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I think we were tired to begin. We never did anything. Once we
did something good, that adrenaline just took over. Then that belief came
back. It all stayed positive. It was never a time when they were on each
other. It was very positive the entire time.  
  
I think that's what kept it going. It was everybody. There were a few people
that had every reason to get down because they did something that was a tough
play, got their shot blocked, threw the ball away, something. But they never
did. I think that's a huge sign of maturity in a team that does believe in
each other.  
  
Q. You said last night this tournament is harder to win than to get to
the Final Four.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: It is.  
  
Q. Are you seeing the residue of that?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Four games in four days, you never have to do that when you're
trying to get to a Final Four. If you have a good seed in the Final Four,
you're not playing somebody like Georgia on day one. You're usually playing a
team that got in the tournament some different way. Then the next game...  
  
It's just so hard. I've never been a part of a team that's done this. I don't
know what tomorrow is going to feel like. I know they'll be running on
adrenaline. We have the best strength and conditioning coach and the best
athletic trainer in the country. They're going to be the MVPs tonight, getting
them ready.  
  
We have to turn to a really tough Mississippi State team who presents
challenges that you could have a week to prepare for and not have a plan for,
so... I'm glad it's kind of a quick turnaround.  
  
Q. Is there any way to avoid the slow starts you had here?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I don't know. If you know, tell me. Our video coordinator has
been doing a hype video every day for us. That's something we haven't been
doing during the year. Maybe the hype video needs to be a little extra loud or
the song choice needs to be on point, as the players would say.  
  
I don't know. This is foreign territory for me, too. Four games in four days.
I know we're going to go home, get in bed. We are going to take a shootaround
tomorrow. Our seniors, everybody agreed to do it. We've not taken a
shootaround in two years on a game that was 2:00 or previous. But they all
said, We're going to go home, we're going to get in bed, we need to get up and
come shoot.  
  
Q. You and Coach Blair have a history. He had nice things to say about
you. How does it feel to get a win over him?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: It doesn't feel as good as if it had been somebody that didn't
give me the chance to start coaching. There was no reason in the world to hire
me as a high school coach. I didn't have any players that he was recruiting. I
didn't have any future players. I didn't have any experience. I just kept on
him until he finally said yes.  
  
Of course, I took a $58,000 pay cut, too. Did he mention that part?  
  
Q. He did.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Good (laughter).  
  
But every day was worth it. I wish we could have played in the finals. Now you
have Vic sitting there who I'm just as indebted to. I'm not going to be
coaching at any level without those two guys, so...  
  
To be doing it at the SEC, the three of us being the last three kind of left
standing, it's something that will sink in. Kind of like they're talking
about, it hasn't hit yet.  
  
To me, what Coach Blair has done for our game, the positive ambassador that
he's been, how many people he's helped, his coaching tree and roots are so
deep. To be a part of that is an honor.  
  
Now he treats me like a colleague. I used to feel like I worked for him still.
I don't feel that way any more. I don't know if that puts it into words well
enough. It's hard to describe how proud it makes me to make him proud.  
  
Q. Conversation earlier tonight, what does it say for a team that's the
hottest team in the league, that's made an incredible run, put the numbers up,
state your team's case for the NCAA tournament?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Just look at history. I know there's a tremendous challenge
this specific year. I follow this because of Coach Blair, as closely as
anybody. It's going to be a really hard year in that room to decide.  
  
But look at what we've done late. I always heard, how you're playing late. Who
can you beat in the field? I think Texas A&M is in the field. Probably
hosting. I hope we didn't knock them out of that.  
  
Chennedy Carter will be back. They're a different team. We haven't even
addressed that. She'll be back and they're a different team. We played them a
week ago. Trust me, she was trying to come in the game that day. She'll be
back.  
  
Am I making his case or mine (laughter)?  
  
I just hope they take an honest look at us and look at the whole body of work
and who we've played, what we've done, what we're doing lately. Regardless of
what happens tomorrow, I think we got to be on that board being talked about
because of who we've played throughout the year, our non-conference schedule,
exactly what we should have scheduled for being picked 11th in our league.  
  
We drew a tough draw in the Big 12 Challenge. We played Iowa State. I think
they finished runner-up in their league. We've had a lot of tough things. When
you line that up, you're looking for an at-large team, if you don't look at
who the schools are, I think our case is going to make itself.  
  
I just tell them, I know how hard it is. We're going to try to win tomorrow so
that we don't have to worry about it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 9, 2019

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [Ciera Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36633)

### [Shambria Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36665)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Arkansas-58, Texas A&M-51  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Texas A&M. We will start with an opening
statement from coach.  
  
GARY BLAIR: First let's give Arkansas the credit, after they went through the
first quarter, cut the lead down at the end of the first quarter, basically
they won or played even with us every quarter after that.  
  
It has nothing to do with being tired or what. I thought they out-toughed us.
They made the threes down the stretch. They got the offensive rebounds on long
rebounds and on hustle plays.  
  
Those are things that a championship team has to do to win or it will cause
you to lose. That's what happened to us. We had 21 turnovers tonight against
the zone, and we had 26 last night. That's all on us.  
  
Ciera was getting double-teamed and sometimes triple- teamed. She has to make
the pass or she's got to be able to finish. The same defense is going to be
run tomorrow against McGowan. That's what everybody has to do. They were doing
it because she played such a perfect game inside that they couldn't stop her.  
  
Offensively she was pretty good. Defensively she was pretty good. She'll work
on her passing skills just like I'll work on my coaching skills, and Sham will
work on her leadership skills. That's something all of us have to do.  
  
We take this as a team. There's not one officiating call that hurt us. It was
on us and how well Arkansas executed down the stretch. We said the stars are
going to want the ball at the end. They ran a play for Dungee that was wide
open. The same pop play that everybody in the league runs. Lack of
communication, that's what stars want. We had done a great job on her the
whole night. She only had 17 compared to what she's been shooting. I thought
we did a great job defensively. They shot 33%, 35% from the three. That's
their game.  
  
What we didn't do was execute our halfcourt offense from about the middle of
the second quarter on. It was hit, miss, hit, miss. You can't win a game that
way.  
  
Arkansas deserves to be in the NCAA tournament. Heck with somebody's computer,
okay? If a team is playing that good at the end of the year, reward them. Heck
with the 6-10 finish. They were in every ballgame.  
  
They deserve to be in the NCAA tournament, and I hope it. We deserve to still
be a No. 4 seed, okay? Our body of work, and when we're healthy a week from
now, we'll be the same old Texas A&M that has earned the No. 4 seed. I hope
all these experts out there and committee members will realize how good of a
basketball team we are.  
  
We got beat by the hottest team in the SEC, not the best team, but the hottest
team. Sometimes that's all you have to be is hot during tournament time, and
you move on.  
  
Questions for my players.  
  
Q. Ciera, coach talked a little bit about the offensive breakdown, not
being able to execute from about mid second quarter on. What contributed to
that?  
CIERA JOHNSON: Well, I turned the ball over a lot in the second half. That
contributed to most of it. Can't score if you turn it over. A lot of them were
live-ball turnovers, giving them the opportunity to run down and shoot wide
open threes. A lot of that is on me not being able to pass out of a double or
triple team.  
  
GARY BLAIR: At the same time she held their two-five players to one point, one
point, both of their two-five players. Defensively she did an excellent job.  
  
Q. Shambria, coach mentioned Arkansas is the hot team of this
tournament, is that something the team addressed going into the game?  
SHAMBRIA WASHINGTON: When we played them last Sunday, we did a good job of
executing on offense, knowing defensively what we needed to do. Tonight we
started off pretty hard. The execution comes from me, as well. I'm the point
guard, I'm supposed to run the ballclub. When I see my post players in
trouble, I have to demand the ball, just kind of keep us poised.  
  
Arkansas is playing very good basketball right now. I just don't think we were
tough enough, like coach touched on earlier. That comes from all of us, but
especially me. I'm supposed to set the tempo. When we get back, I'm going to
work on that. I think we can move forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Anything else you wanted to address with your players, coach?  
  
GARY BLAIR: Appreciate the tournament, excellent-run tournament. Good crowd.
Hopefully everybody will stay over, the crowd, for the Arkansas-Mississippi
State game tomorrow. It will be a good basketball game.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Coach Blair.  
  
Q. Any other things you can add to what Mike Neighbors has been able to
do in such a short time at Arkansas?  
GARY BLAIR: Best hire I think I ever made when I got him from high school
where he was making $72,000, and I hired him for $14,000. That was a
tremendous hire that I had.  
  
Mike and I have been friends for a long time. He's one of the innovative guys
in coaching. From his blog that he did, he gives back to the game. There's so
few coaches that do that because sometimes the eye on their forehead or the
emphasis on winning becomes paramount and they're not able to do it.  
  
Mike speaks all over the country. He does everything for the game. That's his
strength. Arkansas better realize what they have in him. He's a special coach.
He's going to do a special job for them.  
  
I'm just proud to say that Mike was part of my tree. The other part of my tree
is who he's going to have to play tomorrow. So good luck, Mike. Good luck,
Vic.  
  
All right, I appreciate you all.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Blair.

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Janiah McKay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30822)

### [Unique Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34713)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Texas A&M-64, Auburn-62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Auburn. Coach, if you could make an opening
statement.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Definitely a winnable game. We turned them over 26
times. Their offense was the problem. We didn't score enough points off of
those turnovers. The offense in the second half was bad.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Unique, you struggled a little bit in the first half, but were able
to get some rebounds, get some layups. What was the difference for you in the
second half?  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: Well, in the first half, I wasn't necessarily struggling,
they knew where I was. They had enough people boxing me out.  
  
In the second half they got a little lax. I was able to find holes, go up for
the rebounds, go up strong with them.  
  
Q. Janiah, 17 points, I know you had your battles with Texas A &M, what
did this game come down to for you?  
JANIAH McKAY: For me personally, it was having better control, put my
teammates in better positions. Like coach said, second half offensively we
were a little slow, we weren't moving the ball as well. You got to be able to
score points to beat a team like Texas A&M.  
  
Q. Janiah, as a senior, what case can you make for Auburn to be in the
NCAA tournament?  
JANIAH McKAY: I mean, we worked extremely hard. I feel like our record speaks
for itself. We beat good teams. I think we worked hard enough to deserve a
chance to be in the NCAA tournament. We play in the toughest league. It's a
battle night in, night out. I feel like from us, you're going to get a fight
for 40 minutes. I think that's the biggest thing on why we deserve to go to
the NCAA tournament.  
  
Q. Unique, same question?  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: I think it's more about showing us what we're actually
capable of. We haven't had a game all season where we've played 40 minutes
collectively. The beginning of the season, we showed in non-conference we
could have multiple people that could score in double-digits. We shied away
from that.  
  
It was more about finding our connections, what we're capable of doing,
showing everybody why Auburn should be in the tournament, how we play actual
Auburn basketball.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Your case for Auburn being in the NCAA tournament?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I mean, our record is 22-9. We played very good
teams. We've had a few wins, quality wins. There's really no reason why we
should not be in the NCAA tournament. We're definitely one of those teams that
should be one of the 64.  
  
Q. What was Texas A &M able to do in the halfcourt offense that caused
so much problems late in the game?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: I think a lot of it was 11. She was able to drive and
hit some shots. Few offensive rebounds that hurt us down at the end. That's
pretty much it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Meme Jackson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36616)

### [Evina Westbrook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36577)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Mississippi State-83, Tennessee-68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Tennessee. Coach, if you could make an opening
statement.  
  
HOLLY WARLICK: A tough day for us today. Thought we played hard. We didn't
play smart at times. Mississippi State is a great basketball team. You can't
make a lot of mistakes against them.  
  
We battled. We just didn't have enough. It's a tough day, again. But I'm proud
of our kids for fighting. Didn't give up. Didn't look at the score, so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Evina, could you talk about their press? At times you struggled to
get the ball inbounds.  
EVINA WESTBROOK: Yeah, our main thing was like our turnovers. We had 26
turnovers. They had 30 points off our turnovers. That really just killed us in
itself. We just got to do a better job really just executing, getting the ball
under pressure.  
  
Q. Evina, do you think you have done enough to get an invitation to the
NCAA tournament?  
EVINA WESTBROOK: I really hope we have. I think my team deserves at least a
chance to prove ourselves. I don't want to use the word 'talented', because
we're much more than talented. I think so. I would like to think so. I really
hope that we have a chance at just trying to prove ourselves, wherever it may
take us.  
  
Q. Meme, this is the second time you played Mississippi State. The final
score may not dictate what the actual game was like. They're No. 5 in the
country. Do you think as a team you deserve an opportunity to play in the NCAA
tournament?  
MEME JACKSON: Yes, I do. I think my team is hard working. I think we played
them tough today. We didn't give up, kept fighting. I think we deserve a
chance, yes.  
  
Q. Evina, your thoughts on going head-to-head with Jazzmun Holmes. What
was she doing so well?  
EVINA WESTBROOK: She is a great player. Primarily just her defense is all
over. Her thing is trying to keep me busy while I'm trying to run the team or
the play and everything. Her pressure was good, as well as her teammates, too.
I don't know, you'd have to ask her that question.  
  
Q. Meme, you had nine threes the whole game, six of those in the first
half. Do you think that trail-off was a result of Mississippi State adjusting
to you getting open on the wings or you going inside more?  
MEME JACKSON: I think we were trying to attack the basket a little bit more. I
think we were getting great looks in the first half and second half. We just
got to hit open shots. We did a good job of trying to attack them.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. If you take certain parts of today's game, maybe not that first four
minutes of the game, you have pretty good audition tape for the NCAA Selection
Committee based on what you did today.  
HOLLY WARLICK: I thought we played a pretty solid basketball game. The
difference is the turnovers. We only got, what, 54 attempts. Those 25 attempts
take away a possibility of you scoring.  
  
Our kids played hard. Do I think we deserve to be in the tournament?
Absolutely. We played a tough schedule. We've grinded it out. We got on a six-
game losing streak. We stepped up. We competed. This is a young group, and
they continue to get better. I went back and watched the tape even when we
played Mississippi State the first time to where we are now. We're so much
better.  
  
We compete. We play hard. Do I think we deserve a chance? Absolutely, we do.
But I don't have any friends on the committee. Wish I did. But this team is a
no-quit attitude. I thought they did that today. We just had some kids
battled. Cheridene Green stepped up, all of them, they battled, played hard.
We just couldn't get it done.  
  
Q. In that second quarter, was it more Mississippi State stepping up and
taking advantage of defensive pressure, or was it your players making
uncharacteristic mistakes?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Combination of both. You can't make a lot of turnovers and
mistakes against Mississippi State. Their defense is so solid, you just can't
do it. You can't make mistakes. I thought right at the end of the second
quarter, we missed a shot. We should have waited, used the clock, taken the
last-second shot.  
  
We opted for a layup, which, okay, I kind of like that because it's Rennia
Davis, went hard to the basket, missed it. They came down, we stayed in the
lane, gave up a three. You just can't do that. That's part of youth. You got
to understand, get back in matchup. I thought that really hurt us. We went
down 11. We could have gone in 9, 8? My math is not real good.  
  
That got some of the wind out of our sails. We just can't make mistakes.
You're not No. 1 in this league by accident. We just didn't have a lot of
wiggle room to make some mistakes.  
  
Q. How difficult is it you have to wait a really long time for
selection? What is the plan?  
HOLLY WARLICK: We'll take a couple of days off. Look, it's been a difficult --
when you lose on Sunday, have to wait till Thursday. Yeah, we're going to go
about our business. We'll give them a couple days off, practice. All we can do
is get ready. That's what we'll do, we'll continue to get ready. We'll
practice on Monday and watch the show, so...  
  
Q. Defensively you did a pretty good job of draining the shot clock.
Mississippi State still found ways to hit tough shots. Was that deflating for
your players?  
HOLLY WARLICK: We did a great job today not letting them get all the way to
the basket. But I thought Holmes, she hit some floaters, some jumpers. She was
just outstanding. Howard, too. We know what Howard can do. I think Holmes
stepped up and did a heck of a job for them.  
  
Thought we did a really, really good job against McCowan really throughout the
whole game. But we knew what they were going to do. It's a matter of you know
what they're going to do, but you got to stop it. For the most part I thought
we did. We went to zone a little bit, and it was solid. Then we went to a zone
again, they got a wide-open layup. I don't know what happened. Zone is to keep
the ball out of the middle, but they went right down the middle.  
  
For the most part I thought our defense was good. We fouled too much, put them
at the line too much. We needed to get to the line a lot more, too. We didn't
have the opportunity to get to the line. Our goal was to get in the paint,
so...  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
HOLLY WARLICK: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Dawn Staley](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=15625)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Arkansas-95, South Carolina-89  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by South Carolina. We would like to open it up
for questions for coach.  
  
Q. The high ball screen, especially from Dungee, seemed to be giving you
problems. What was the thing causing all the breakdown there?  
DAWN STALEY: She was direct line driving. It was hard to bring help. You kind
of just picked your poison, whether you wanted her to two us or them three us.
We took what we thought was the lesser of the evil in the two.  
  
Q. They weren't a great three-point shooting team coming in. Was it
their night? Did they find something in your defense?  
DAWN STALEY: I mean, they were pretty accurate. They shoot a lot more.
Probably got a lot more downhill drives against us. That's the way it was.  
  
Q. If you can, talk a little bit about Dungee, what you've seen out of
her these two games.  
DAWN STALEY: She's a good player.  
  
Q. The SEC success comes to an end. How do you regroup? What is the
message to this team?  
DAWN STALEY: The message to this team and everybody is it's a little South
Carolina fatigue. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back. We'll be back
to Greenville, South Carolina. Hopefully we won't end our tournament
prematurely.  
  
Q. Do you think this affects your placement in Charlotte in any way? Do
you think you've done enough to have a home regional?  
DAWN STALEY: I can only control the controllables. That is out of my pay
grade, out of my league. The only thing we can do is show up and play the
games. Show up, shut up, play the games. That's the way we'll approach it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
DAWN STALEY: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Vic Schaefer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=22176)

### [Jazzmun Holmes](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36617)

### [Anriel Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30842)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Mississippi State-83, Tennessee-68  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Mississippi State. Coach, if you could make an
opening statement, please.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: First of all, just want to commend Coach Warlick and Tennessee.
I think they're such a good team. That's a really good team. We've been
fortunate two times this year to play really well. Seven McDonald's All-
Americans. They are a load.  
  
Just really proud of our kids. I thought tonight second quarter obviously was
really special after getting off to a really sluggish start in the first
quarter. We were losing the horse game. You play horse in this conference,
you're going to lose every night. We were letting them stand out there and
shoot uncontested shots.  
  
But we found a way there in the second quarter. That was kind of the
difference in the game. Jazz was as good tonight as I've ever seen her. She
just was really special, ran our team, two assists, no turnovers, five steals.
Our press was really good tonight. It started with her and Jordan. I thought
they dictated a lot of what we were able to do tonight defensively. 26
turnovers, forced 15 at half. I think we turned those into 30 points off
turnovers. That's a big stat now. 48 paint points and 30 points off turnovers,
that's pretty good. Jazz was just as good as I've ever seen her. I couldn't be
prouder of her.  
  
You see tonight, our team kind of runs off of her. When she is engaged like
she was tonight, so active, so energetic, it filters through my team.
Obviously Anriel was good offensively. She didn't take a bad shot all night
long. 11 out of 15. Was just really, really good for us offensively. Battled
on the boards a little bit. That's probably as few of rebounds as she's had
all year long. Helped us win in some other ways. Offensively was really good,
really special.  
  
Bre'Amber Scott off the bench was probably as big as anything, as well. You
can sit up here and talk about everybody. Teaira did have a double-double.
We've become so accustomed to that, 13 rebounds, 17 points, one block, one
steal, 36 minutes. Bre off the bench, 5 out of 10, really, really good for us,
helped us defensively. Gives us a bigger, longer guard out there that can help
defend.  
  
It's a good win for us, but it's just one. We can't think about anything other
than the next game. Whoever it is tomorrow will be another rival game in this
conference. We have 16 rival teams. It will be a well-coached, highly-skilled
team. We're just excited to be a part of it and glad that we can be a part of
that game. That's the only thing we're thinking of.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for now Anriel Howard and Jazzmun Holmes.  
  
Q. Jazz, Evina came out, looked like you were pretty well-prepared for
that battle. How much of a challenge did you take in getting a chance to go up
against her? How do you feel you performed?  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: I just knew that they go as she goes. My team goes as I go. I
knew I had to pressure her because that's who they look for to start their
offense, make big plays.  
  
She had a good game yesterday. Coach challenged me to step up and be that
person to defend. That's what I did.  
  
Q. Anriel, when you made your decision to come to Mississippi State, is
this what you envisioned? If so, what was it like to be the star player
today?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: Well, when I came here, I envisioned just doing whatever I can
in order to help us get to where we want to go. We have a lot of goals, things
that we want to accomplish ahead of us. I just want to be able to be a part of
that, help in any way that I can.  
  
Q. Jazzmun, Anriel just said you guys have a lot of goals. How much
motivation is there for this tournament? How high is the motivation heading
into this week?  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: We just have to stay levelheaded. We have to do all the things
that we know how to do, make sure we execute the plan that coach has for us. I
mean, we just have to stay the path. We can't try to look ahead, we have to
stay one game at a time.  
  
Q. Jazz, how are you feeling right now? You took a leap and a hard
fall.  
JAZZMUN HOLMES: I feel good. I guess do whatever my team needs me to do to
win, so that's what I did.  
  
Q. Anriel, you have a motor of your own, but to see someone like Jazz,
the energy she brings, the steals, what she does at point guard offensively,
what does that do for you and your teammates?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: Like she said, when she goes, we go. I definitely believe in
that. I felt like just her energy, her motor, her defense is just awesome. It
helps us, gets us energetic. We're going to have her back.  
  
Her being able to lead us is just a really key point that I don't think she
gets recognized enough for. But we definitely need her and we're glad to have
her.  
  
Q. Tennessee starts five for eight from three-point range. How do y'all
weather that storm, get to where you're taking the fight to them again?  
ANRIEL HOWARD: We knew that's what they wanted to do, stretch us at the three-
point line. We had to make them put it on the floor, shoot over us, not by us.
We tried to get them off the three-point line, make them get it off the floor.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. You spoke highly of Tennessee. There's a lot of talk about them being
on the bubble. Do you think they're a team that belongs? If so, why?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Without question. I don't want to play them. I didn't want to
play them today. They're so talented. I tell you, that point guard, she is
special. She has a presence. The way they played yesterday under the gun,
under pressure, I don't think anybody wants to see them. They're so skilled.  
  
They're just young. I think Holly, they weathered a little bad storm in the
middle of the year, early, then they've been playing better of late. That's
what young kids do. Sometimes they struggle a little bit early in their
career.  
  
But absolutely. I think, again, I don't think you ask anybody in the field,
Would you like to play Tennessee, there would be a bunch of people that go,
Yeah, I'll take them. I don't think anybody wants them. I really believe
they're good. They're talented. Holly does a great job coaching them. So yeah.  
  
Q. You have had a special season up to this point. Guaranteed yourself
another chance at home when the big tournament starts. Did you worry or have
any questions about the motivation for this week given what you've already
accomplished?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah, sure. We were coming off really an emotional game on
Sunday at South Carolina when we clinched it outright. If you would have seen
my practice Wednesday, you would have said, They're done. That's how we have
been all year, y'all. You can come to some of ours, we have some real
stinkers.  
  
Thursday we show up, got to work out early here, we have media obligations at
11, our time on the court here was I think 10 to 10:45. We had to go early
because I had to scout the 12:00 game. We're up at 7 Eastern for an 8
practice, which is a lot earlier Central time for us. We had a great workout.  
  
I'll give you another example. I did something this morning I've never done in
34 years in coaching. Last night, because we play so early, this is 11 Central
for us, so I'm in tune with my players. They're always talking about coaches
having to be in tune with their team. 34 years.  
  
Typically for an 11 a.m. or 12 Eastern, most people aren't getting up for a
6:40 shoot-around, 30 minutes, that's all we can. Last night in film, I told
them, Look, y'all, we'll sleep in in the morning. Jazz and Jordan, if they
don't have any energy, the rest of my team ain't going to have any energy.
Those two kids are really important to get their rest.  
  
I said, We're going to stay in, we'll get up, have breakfast. Jazzmun looked
at me and said, Huh-uh, coach. We're not doing that. She didn't say, Are you
sure. We're not doing that. If I would have gone back at her, she would have
been unhappy with me, and I don't need her unhappy with me.  
  
I sat there and thought about it a minute. Okay, if you want to go shoot in
the morning, I'll take you. If anybody wants to go, I'll take them. If you
need to sleep so you're juiced, ready to go in the morning, I'll let you do
that.  
  
Never have done that. I had about half my team came and shot this morning. We
got them up at 6, shot from 6:45 to 7:10, whatever we got. The others, we let
them sleep. You have to know who needs the rest and who wanted to get up and
shoot. Boy, Jazz was special.  
  
Again, I give her a lot of credit for that because that's what she needed to
be ready to play. Not many kids would do that. Hey, man, let me sleep. Today's
youth, it's all about getting a nap. Mine are out there right now going, I
hope this first half gets over, I'm ready for a nap. I have the all-nap team,
anyway.  
  
Q. With Jazz, do you ever have to tell her to slow down when you see her
jumping into the press row, taking hard hits?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Yeah, I think our team, when we're locked in, they're all
capable of doing that. Tea went into our scorer's table when we played them
earlier this year. I just think that's who we are. I think that's our kids,
their commitment to their teammates, their commitment to our style of play.
Let's face it, it gets everybody excited.  
  
Even if you're not a Bulldog fan, you can appreciate and respect a kid that
plays the game like that. We talk about honoring the game. It's how you play
the game. The game doesn't cheat you. You get out of the game what you put
into the game.  
  
I think that's our kids understanding in the moment, Hey, I'm trying to make a
play. She jumped into my radio group. If they don't catch her, I'll fire both
of them. No, I won't either. They're both too good (laughter).  
  
Yeah, they're good. She's good.  
  
Q. The third time this tournament where when a team that played
yesterday is playing a team that's playing for the first time, they start
pretty well. Do you think there's anything to that?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I don't know. I just know that when you do play, obviously you
get comfortable in there. Also I think, too, sometimes when you're the lower
seed, you got nothing to lose, everything to win, so you're a little bit more
relaxed. I think we may have been a little tight early. I thought we really
settled in. That's why I always want them to guard. If we'll guard, use our
anxiety on that end defensively, I think we'll relax on offense. I thought we
did that tonight.  
  
Q. Seems like you were a little more aggressive defensively at the top
of the key coming into the second quarter. Was that your answer to counter how
good they were from three?  
VIC SCHAEFER: All of our problems with them shooting the three early on were
off dribble-penetration. If we were going to guard the ball, we wouldn't have
to come off anybody, leave them wide open in the horse game. It really came
down to guarding the ball. That was critical for us. It always is.  
  
We talked about that at the end of the quarter. Hey, all our heartache is off
the bounce, so let's fix it.  
  
Q. Who were some of the other players that went to the shootaround this
morning?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Let's see. Andy came, Jazz, Jessika, Anriel, and I think Bre. I
think those were the five that came. Y'all, that's fine. That's not a sign
that somebody is more interested or somebody is more committed. It's time to
be a pro. You do what's best for you. I'm not going to question it. You do
what you got to do to get yourself ready to play today.  
  
When you only have 30 minutes, y'all, for me usually in an hour we're going to
go through their offense, try to really guard them, try to get some shots up.
When you only got 30 minutes, it was just really we were only going to shoot.
When you're doing that, there's really not a lot of room. Post players, what
are you going to do?  
  
Just to make that clear, those kids were pros. I'm glad they made the decision
and I supported them 100% on it.  
  
Q. You tie a program record for most points in a SEC tournament game
today. Your defense played pretty well. What can the team do better moving
forward in this tournament?  
VIC SCHAEFER: I think defensively we got a lot of things that we can get so
much better at. I say this, you've heard me say it all year: Our top end is so
far away. We're pretty good where we are, but if we could ever tie it all
together. It's my job. If I could get them where I think they can go, man,
there's no telling how good they can be.  
  
We have so many new kids playing together. We had to do it in such a short
period of time. It takes time for your defensive chemistry to come around like
some of my teams have been in the past. We show spurts of it, flashes of it.
Consistently for 40 minutes, we don't quite have that. If we don't play hard,
then it really shows itself.  
  
Just wanting them to play hard will cover a lot of our mistakes. We gave up
some backdoors tonight. Andy gave up a couple to start the third quarter. You
don't need to be out there first play of the third quarter giving up a
backdoor dunk. It's part of it.  
  
Q. You're ranked fifth in the country. There are four of those No. 1
seeds. Is that something this week you pay attention to because you want to be
one of those No. 1's?  
VIC SCHAEFER: Sure. The answer is I want to be a No. 1 seed. But do I pay
attention to who else is playing? No. My attention will be on Kentucky and
Missouri. If we take care of ourselves, the rest will take care of itself.
That's what I believe. If you go through this league 15-1, win the
Southeastern Conference, you take care of business, to me that's all that
needs to be said.  
  
So for us, for me, as I told our kids, everybody wants to talk about
unfinished business, this and that. I can't even look at Sunday without
getting through Friday. Now I can't get there until I get through Saturday.
I'm not even concerned with what could possibly happen. I am concerned about
these two teams coming out here, and when I'm done with y'all, I can go out
there and scout because that's all that's on my mind. You got to take care of
the controllables. I can't control anybody in a room. All I can control is
what we do as a team, what my team does, what my staff does. That's it. That's
all I'm going to worry about.  
  
If I worried about the rest of it, I'd lose my mind.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
VIC SCHAEFER: Praise the Lord and go Dogs.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

### [Sophie Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30334)

### [Amber Smith](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20847)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Missouri-70, Kentucky-68 OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are now joined by Missouri. We will start with an opening
statement from coach.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: Obviously that was one heck of a tough game. I've got so much
respect for Matthew Mitchell, the University of Kentucky women's basketball
program. They've had an incredible year. They've got some really, really
talented kids.  
  
It was a battle. I thought defensively we were pretty solid, just defending
personnel. Offensively obviously way too many turnovers. But I thought we
competed. We did a good job on the boards. I was really proud of the way we
could just stay in the moment, you know, just next play, that resiliency that
we showed throughout the course of the game.  
  
It was a game of runs. We found a way to battle. I thought we hit some key
free throws at the end, found a way to get a really good win against a great
team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Amber, you led this team in rebounding all year long, continued
today. What were you able to do to get some boards against Kentucky?  
AMBER SMITH: We do a drill in practice, just widen out on each possession, go
and get the ball rather than waiting on it to come to you. Then on the
offensive end go get extra possessions, because not every team boxes out as
well. Just being relentless on both ends.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: Mind you, we still gave up way too many offensive rebounds.  
  
AMBER SMITH: Amen (laughter).  
  
Q. Sophie, you're three points away from the all-time record now. Do you
think about that at all or just next game?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: No, no. I'm so glad we won today. Yeah, my teammates got me
the ball. I'm ready for Mississippi State. I'm ready to get going, yeah.  
  
Q. You put the ball on the floor a lot today, not only just taking shots
from the outside but even posting up. What did you see out of Kentucky's
defense?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: Yeah, I really never know what type of defense the opposing
team is going to throw at me. To start off, they were kind of doubling a
little bit. As the game went on, I just found myself one-on-one. Like I said,
my teammates gave me the ball when I needed it. Helped when we were hitting
outside shots as well. That opens up some space for me. They gave me the ball
and I just went to work.  
  
Q. It seems like every time Kentucky went on a run, y'all would find a
way to respond. As two of the leaders on this team, what do y'all say when
talking on the court?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: I'm going to tell you, just being real honest, at the
beginning of the season we wouldn't have done that. When we got punched in the
mouth, we couldn't come back from it. But I think our team has matured a lot.
We've been through some ups and downs. We're in the best spot we've been in
all year long mentally and physically.  
  
When we get punched in the mouth a little bit, we stick together. We finish it
out with a game plan. We focus on what we're trying to get done. It's will. It
comes from the heart. When you're playing with that, you're going to stop
runs.  
  
Q. Amber, as someone just watching the game, not participating in it,
how does Sophie's energy leak out to the rest of the team?  
AMBER SMITH: She's definitely a high-energy player. I think we just feed off
her energy. We try not to soak it up so much, and give poor energy back into
her. I think when she gets her energy and that burst of energy going, whether
from defense or offense, she feeds it off to us a lot.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We will continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. 26 turnovers today, 13 in the first half. What particularly did you
think Kentucky was able to do to force all those turnovers?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I definitely want to give them credit where credit's due. I
think they're a really good defensive team. They've got some tremendous
athletes. They're just relentless pursuing that ball. Definitely need to give
them credit.  
  
I think we had our fair share of just not having the kind of poise that you
need to against that kind of pressure. I feel like a lot of times teams like
that, they try to speed you up, try to make you play at the pace they want the
game to be played at. We certainly had a handful of possessions where we
bought into that.  
  
But you got to give them a lot of credit. Certainly a lot of controllable
things we can do, too. They held us to 41 points the last time we played them,
switched all screens. Taylor Murray is as good as they get in regards to just
being relentless on that ball. We tried in that first half to just send our
point guard out of there, have Sophie and Jordan and at times Amber bringing
the ball up to give Lauren a break. But you got to give them a lot of credit.  
  
There's a lot of controllables we can do, but they're a really good defensive
team. What are they averaging? I think they're turning people over 21 times a
game. We're only five over the average, right (laughter)? That's the way you
want to look at it.  
  
Q. Sophie and you both mentioned resiliency of this team, how far it's
come from the beginning of the year. What have you been able to do as a coach
to foster that? Where is it coming from?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Give a lot of credit to our senior leadership. I'm a big
believer as a coach in just communication, real, authentic, genuine
conversations, tough conversations. As we've gone throughout the course of
this season, through the ups and downs, challenges that we've gone through, we
just continue to do it again and again and again, have those conversations in
that locker room. Not only teach basketball lessons but life lessons, what the
parallels are.  
  
You got to have a group of young ladies that are willing to listen, buy in,
own it. I think that's really how you grow. We haven't really swept anything
under the rug that we've gone through this year. It's been a really good year.
I told my players this. I think it's been the toughest year I've ever had as a
coach, but also the most rewarding because of the growth that we've had as a
team throughout the course of the season.  
  
You recruit kids from all different backgrounds, all different experiences,
you put them in a locker room, you can't just tell them to love each other
because you're in a locker room together. You have to build deeper-rooted
relationships than that. Every year is unique and different. The timing of
that, you never know when it's going to bloom, but you do it again and again
and again as a coach. When you got great senior leaders that can echo your
words, typically great things happen.  
  
It's just fun we're playing our best basketball, despite the fact that we had
26 turnovers, I really do think that we're playing our best basketball in
March.  
  
Q. From a game plan standpoint, what was your team able to do to prevent
Kentucky from being able to get good looks on the outside?  
ROBIN PINGETON: We're a team that we spend a lot of time breaking down film,
breaking down tendencies, trying to take away other player's strengths. Then
you have to have a group of young ladies that's willing to invest in that
scouting report. It's hard to go 24 hours later there's new numbers, who is
the three-point shooter, who is the driver, who do you force right, left?
That's the only way we know how to scheme for games. We don't have the
athleticism. We can say we're going to flat-out turn people over. We have to
really guard personnel.  
  
I thought our players did a good job of following the game plan. We try to put
them in a position to be successful. Assistant coaches obviously do a great
job with that scout, looking at those tendencies. Then our players got to go
out and execute.  
  
I thought we made them take tough shots tonight. There's some really, really
talented players on that Kentucky team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Chelsea Dungee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36599)

### [Malica Monk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34673)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Arkansas-95, South Carolina-89  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arkansas. Coach, if you could make an opening
statement, please.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I think any time you see a team celebrate like that without
going back out to cut the nets down, it's a sign of respect for how good the
team you beat was. We know what South Carolina has done in this tournament for
the last four years. That's a sign of respect for how much they've done, the
exposure they've had.  
  
Really happy for our kids to be able to get a win like that. We've been
playing really good basketball down the stretch without being able to be
rewarded with wins. To get two of them in a row like we have, really proud of
them. The effort today was tremendous. I've always said on the second day when
you play, it's your advantage in the first half, which we took advantage of,
then that advantage turns to their side in the second half, which they took
control of with a 35-point quarter.  
  
This time our kids answered back. At Arkansas we didn't. I'm proud of that.
I'm proud of our group for learning from mistakes, starting to peak, playing
our best basketball at the right time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you had 32 against this team a month ago. What kind of
confidence did that give you going into tonight?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: I continue to have the same confidence in every game. I just
take what's given.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you had 33 last night, 31. I guess you're liking Greenville,
South Carolina. How do you feel about the way you're playing in the tournament
so far?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: I felt that I performed for my team to the best of my ability.
Playing with these guys opens the floor up for me. It's not only me, it's my
teammates, what they do on the floor.  
  
Q. Malica, how satisfying a win is this for this program? Does this feel
potentially like a breakthrough win, put your team on the map?  
MALICA MONK: It does. It really is a breakthrough. We really wanted revenge
back from them, whenever we played them during the conference. To come out
here and give maximum effort like last night and today, it's really a relief
to go out there and give it our all. That's what we're always capable of
doing. Playing with a group of girls like this, it's really an amazing
feeling.  
  
Q. Chelsea, they held you scoreless in the first quarter. What did you
see from that moment on?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: That's happened a couple games this season. I know that it
will come eventually, if that's in the second quarter, third quarter or fourth
quarter. I don't press for shots, I just take what's given and take.  
  
Q. In the first half, you were able to force contested shots, what was
working so well for your defense?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: Just being active on defense. We knew they're not a great
three-point shooting team. For us to have our hands ready, stay in the gaps,
do what we're capable of doing, allowed us to get them down into the shot
clock, making them rush shots, doing things out of their main. That really
helped us out in the game.  
  
Q. Did you really feel they were having trouble matching up with you,
that you were successful shooting the ball from three, they couldn't stop you
on penetration?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: Yes, I think so. We pretty much got what we wanted the whole
game. Whether that be a drive and a kick, whether that be an open three. We
were comfortable. We just took what was given.  
  
MALICA MONK: I feel like we were able to match them offensively, too. We were
able to get out in transition. That really opened up the floodgates for us.
Not only that, we were able to change up our defense which frustrated them on
the offensive end. That really helped us out, too.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you mentioned a few minutes ago about your teammates. Three
of them scored at least 14 tonight. Talk about their performances.  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: That always makes me happy to see them succeed. To see the
ball go in the hole for them, that gets everyone going. That's something that
we all know that everyone is capable of doing. Everyone showed up tonight and
played well as a team.  
  
Q. The end of the third quarter, they bank in a three at the buzzer. Was
there anything said right there?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: They had a lot of fans here because we're playing in South
Carolina. That bank-in three put them up by one point.  
  
MALICA MONK: One point wasn't really nothing. We came out and shot a three,
too. Really wasn't nothing. We just kept our composure.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I said something (laughter).  
  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: We don't remember.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: If we would have told you at the beginning of the game we were
going to be in this position. I do say stuff sometimes.  
  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: He did say something (laughter).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. What did you tell your team coming into this game to prepare them for
this?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I think we drew back on how well we played at our place. We
watched video in the locker room of how well we played, all the good things we
did. Yesterday we challenged the kids to do one thing out of the ordinary, one
thing extraordinary, one thing great. We knew today it was going to take two
things per player. I'd have to go back and count. I bet there were five or six
things that each kid did that was out of the ordinarily. You don't count on
Alexis to block a shot at the three-point line at the end of the game. Stuff
like that.  
  
I think they really hooked up. We've been working toward this since the
beginning of the year. There's been a plan and a process. They've really
bought in and stayed hooked up. You lose seven out of eight going into this
thing, I think a lot of teams fold, don't come in here ready to play. I think
we went the other direction with that.  
  
Really proud of them. We gained that from the last game with them. Then I
think we withstood their runs. We withstood that shot going in at the buzzer,
came out, hit a three right off the bat. I thought our kids did a really good
job of taking the shots. We tell them to make them wrong, whatever they want
to be. They ran a box-and-one, a rhombus-and-two, other shapes that come. I
didn't do too good in geometry. There were a lot of defenses thrown at them,
we had a plan, the kids stayed in attack mode the whole time.  
  
Q. The first time you saw Chelsea, games like this, did you see it right
away in her?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Yeah, I used to watch them play in the summer, in San Antonio.
A friend of mine coaches it. We talk about it all the time, dribble-drive, how
he would move Chelsea around. Coaching at Washington, that's a long way to go
from home for her, being from Oklahoma. Then we played them in the NCAA
tournament. If you go back and look, Oklahoma came to Washington. We played
really well. She played really well, too.  
  
Wasn't about two weeks later I got the job at Arkansas. I got a call from some
people she was looking to transfer. When we got a release, she's prototypical.
She's exactly what we look for: versatile, hard matchup, tough enough, gritty
enough to guard a big on the other end, still be a mismatch problem. Prototype
for what we call a dragon. She worked her tail off during her redshirt year.
Pull up pictures when she transferred, look at her now. She's transformed her
body. I don't put a number on it. She looks completely different with
nutrition, sleep. Our strength and conditioning did a phenomenal job.  
  
I don't want to tell you, yeah, I knew for sure. Man, you wanted the chance to
find out.  
  
Q. Three-pointer at the end of the third quarter, what do you say to
your team to make sure that doesn't kill the momentum?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I took the blame for it. It was my fault. We went a little bit
too early in the shot clock. I should have held it longer. Sometimes I forget
how fast Mal is. We went a little too early. I'm yelling, Don't foul. That's
the worst thing you can ever yell at that point because then you just stand
there. She banged it in.  
  
We regrouped pretty fast. I said what I told them. Again, when we got ready to
get on that plane and got down here, if I would have told you going into the
fourth quarter, what are they ranked, 12th, a top 15 team, down one, would you
take it? They're like, Yeah. I thought we answered right back. We hit a lot of
big shots this week, timely.  
  
Q. You came in as an underdog playing in a hostile place. You take the
opening tap, hit a three. Talk about how you never let the fans have too many
opportunities to get in the game today.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I think that's what our pace does to people. Hey, they hit a
three and celebrate. Guess what, we're coming right back at you. If you take a
second to celebrate, one of our rabbits, which is Taylah and Kiara, run past
you for a layup. One of our locks is running down there, getting wide open for
a three. You have Mal bringing it up, A'Ty bringing it up. That's a big part
of that. When they do score, you cannot let it affect you.  
  
Chelsea is very underrated on her ability to get the ball out of the net on a
made shot, get it in quick. It is hard to do. She is phenomenal at it.  
  
I think that was big. Then whenever they did get that momentum, that crowd got
really loud at the end of the third quarter. It was really loud. But we
answered it. Our kids practice very chaotic situations. We try to put them in
as many situations in practice that will calm them down. They were way calmer
than I was. I think that speaks to these veterans, Jailyn Mason, Mal, Bailey,
Raven, those guys that have been around. I think it could have gone the other
way right there. It could have really gone the other way in a hurry, but they
didn't let it happen.  
  
Q. Can you speak about the performance of your starters.  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We don't go real deep. Especially this time of the year. We
start back in December working for March. We cut practices down to about an
hour. We give the kids a second day off during SEC play. Starting in mid
January, we work on skills.  
  
That's what allows you to come back and play your starters 70 minutes. Then
you have to have some kids like A'Ty, Raven, Bailey, accept a role. That's the
hard part, accept a role of going in there and playing four, five minutes just
to give those kids three or four minutes of break, around a media timeout,
around a dead ball, offense, defense.  
  
I think we've got a group that's really bought in. When you get that, you have
a chance to pull off an upset.  
  
Q. You have Texas A &M next. You recently played them. What can you draw
from that experience?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: We got to play the winner of this next one, right?  
  
THE MODERATOR: That game is going on right now, so we don't know who they're
playing next.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: If it happens to be Texas A&M, we did. We had a great game
with Auburn, as well. Whoever we face, unless it's Auburn, Auburn has had to
play the same number of games as we have.  
  
I think our group right now is more concerned with what we're about. Our
scouting reports are very minimal because they know and they remember. Whoever
you're playing in the semis, you know they're playing well. You don't get to
the semifinals of this tournament and not be playing well.  
  
This is a harder tournament to win than go to the Final Four. It's harder
because you play three games in three days or four in four days. There you
play a game, you get a day off, you play a game, get to rest for a week, play
a game. I think the SEC tournament, most any post-season tournament, is way
harder to win than an NCAA tournament format.  
  
We're made for it because of the way we start practicing for it. We always try
to peak in March. I think that's been a characteristic of our teams. The kids
have really bought into it. I think we have the best strength and conditioning
coach in the country, I think we've got the best athletic trainer in the
country. They buy into that, too. We start it in December. We're very diligent
about it for this day. As a result, I think it's what carries us when these
times arise. We're ready for it.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Matthew Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=18056)

### [Rhyne Howard](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36622)

### [Taylor Murray](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34695)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Missouri-70, Kentucky-68 OT  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Kentucky. Coach, an opening statement, please.  
  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: You just have to give Missouri a ton of credit today. They
were the tougher team. We knew coming into the game that it was going to be a
game about toughness. Our team was tough today, but just not quite as tough as
Missouri. You have to give them a ton of credit.  
  
They made one more play than we did. It was a really difficult ballgame to
play in. Hats off to them. I was proud of our team from bouncing back from
some really poor play at times, low focus. Got us off to such a bad start. To
have the tenacity and the grit and the toughness to come back and have a
chance to win the game says a lot about our team.  
  
We're really, really proud of the season we had in the SEC. It's an awesome
conference to compete in. I thought our team really showed up well this year
and worked hard.  
  
We're certainly disappointed to go home from this incredible tournament.
That's a real credit to Missouri tonight.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Rhyne, you didn't shoot very well tonight, but were still able to
claw back into the game. How do you use that momentum going into the
tournament knowing you can at least come back in these games?  
RHYNE HOWARD: Well, when we don't shoot well, we try to emphasize our
defensive focus, try to stop the other team from scoring when we aren't.  
  
Q. Can one of y'all tell me how Tatyana has helped you throughout the
season for you guys?  
TAYLOR MURRAY: She's just very aggressive for us when we needed her to get
baskets for us, we were able to pass her the ball in the post and she was able
to knock down shots.  
  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: I'd say she's done an unbelievable job with improving her
game throughout the conference play. I think she's really worked hard in
practice each and every day, has put a lot of work in, has worked really hard
on being more aggressive, with her mentality. She's really been big for us
down the stretch.  
  
As we were working hard to have the best SEC season we could have, she just
has improved so much over the course of the season. We're very excited about
her future. We're excited about what she can do for us in the NCAA tournament.
She's had a really, really good year of progress.  
  
Q. Rhyne, the team studying. What did you see out of Missouri's defense
that you were able to exploit today?  
RHYNE HOWARD: Well, they're a sagging team, I knew if I attacked them, I would
be able to get a power jumper or all the way to the basket, which I did.  
  
Q. Taylor, how do you use this experience for the NCAA tournament? How
will you as a captain rally the troops?  
TAYLOR MURRAY: Just about sticking together, staying positive, take the
lessons we learn from this game, try to improve it for the next game. We have
more games to go. We have to take it one day at a time, keep practicing, just
stay together as a team.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We will let you join your teammates. We'll
continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you take me back to when you recruited Tatyana, go all the way
down to Georgia.  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: Watched Tat play in club ball, summer ball with her club
team. They had a very good team, a really talented team. There were a lot of
good players on that team.  
  
Tat really stood out to me for her athleticism and her versatility. We've
really thrived off of versatile players, players who have multiple skills, who
aren't one-dimensional.  
  
I always thought she was an outstanding player in her versatility, it could
make her very special. Then she really checks the other boxes that are
extremely important for us at Kentucky. She is an outstanding student, was a
great student at Columbus High School. Our students really take their
academics seriously and achieve at a high level in the classroom. She fit our
program for that.  
  
She's a very high-character person. Has a great heart. She is a really
quality, high-character young person. It was a great fit for us. There were a
lot of schools that wanted her, great schools that wanted her. We feel very
fortunate she chose Kentucky. She has been an awesome addition to our program.  
  
Q. You were shorthanded today, 0-16 for three, yet take a good Missouri
team into overtime. What does that say about your squad?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: We certainly showed a lot of fight. Outside of the first two
games of the season, we won the Vanderbilt game by double-digits pretty
comfortably, over 15 points. Mississippi State, second game, beat us by 15.
After that, the next 15 have been real, real tough games. We've shown
throughout the season that we have the ability to hang in there. We've also
shown the ability when we get the lead, sometimes they'll evaporate. We've
been that kind of team that has played a lot of close games. This one was
extremely close and tough.  
  
Really disappointed in the way that we started the game. I was hoping we would
be more locked in and focused. I thought our start dug us a hole that we were
just climbing back out of all day. We had to be so sharp and so disciplined in
this game on a day where things weren't going our way to get that win. We just
weren't quite there.  
  
We had discipline, we had toughness, we had intensity, we had grit, we played
some really good defensive possessions. Today we needed to be a little bit
tougher. We just weren't.  
  
Like I said earlier, we've really competed hard in the conference. It's been a
tough year for us. To come out with the record that we did, I'm real proud of
the team. We got a lot out of this team. They work hard. We had to fight all
the way. We had to fight all the way today.  
  
Now we're excited to see what the next chapter holds, see if we can find out
where we're going in the NCAA tournament, make a run there. We feel like we're
the team that can do that, a team that can shoot the ball. We just didn't do
it today. Missouri had a game plan of trying to force us to make 12-footers.
It's just a tough day for us. Couldn't get the ball in the basket.
Disappointed in that.  
  
Q. Cunningham is known to be a pretty good shooter, but a lot of post
work today. Is her versatility one of the things that make it difficult to
game plan against?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: I told her in Lexington - I didn't know if I'd see her
again, I'm sorry I did see her again with the way she played today - I told
her in Lexington, if that were the final time we competed, I don't remember
anyone any tougher than her, really anyone that I admire much more just
because of the way she presents herself to the game. Today was a day where I
felt her sheer will and determination really was able to boost her team to a
victory. She was fantastic.  
  
We had to play a lot sharper against her. You have to just give her so much
credit. She wanted it today. She just sort of had that air about her that she
would not be denied today. She was fantastic. I really admire that player. I
admire players like her, who just love the game, who have a passion for the
game, who are just not going to be denied.  
  
Won't miss competing against her because she was so tough against us. That's a
player I really, really admire and always will. I hope she does real well in
her future. I'm sure she will.  
  
Q. Rhyne still had 25 points tonight. What do you tell her heading into
the NCAA tournament to keep her momentum up?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: We just keep trying to improve, keep trying to help her
improve. So many plays in the game today where she's just super special, can
make plays not because we're using the right technique or we're executing it
the right way. She just is so gifted and talented, has that quality.  
  
The idea here now is just to keep trying to get better every day, keep trying
to learn the game where you understand some nuances of the game that can help
her become an even better player. She was dynamite. We wouldn't have had a
chance to win the game had she not played the way that she did.  
  
You just keep working on improvement. You're not satisfied. You don't look at
the stat sheet and say you scored 25 points. You go back to the film, deal
with the facts. Here is where you can get better, here is where you can
improve. That's what we'll do with Rhyne.  
  
She has some time here where she can get better before the NCAA tournament.
That's what we'll do. We're real proud she's a Wildcat.  
  
Q. A lot of shots for your team today weren't falling. Was Missouri
doing anything specifically on defense that made it challenging?  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: What they're trying to do is take away the players who they
feel like are your best players, who score. They're trying to get the ball
into people who may not be as comfortable, have them shoot shots.  
  
Robin is a great coach. I have so much respect for her. They're so
disciplined. I mean, we had wide-open 10-, 12-footers that we just couldn't
get going.  
  
Another thing they did today which was just incredible is how physical they
were around the basket without fouling. It was really an amazing thing to
watch. They really became a team that could block shots today. We just kept
getting to the basket and couldn't get the ball in there. They were tougher
around the rim than we were. At some point you have to go in there and load
your hips and get the ball at your chin and get up in there and make a shot
around the basket.  
  
I thought they were extremely tough around the basket. They just played real
hard, made the plays they needed to to win the game. Have to give them a ton
of credit.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
MATTHEW MITCHELL: Thank you.

TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 8, 2019

  

### [Gary Blair](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14548)

### [Ciera Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36633)

### [Kayla Wells](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36634)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Texas A&M-64, Auburn-62  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Texas A&M. Coach, if you could give us an
opening statement.  
  
GARY BLAIR: Texas A&M has always been built in every sport next-man-up
mentality. We've done it all year. After big losses, we've rebounded. We find
a way. That's what Aggies do.  
  
There's a motto that you have on your slogan out there. Tell me again what it
is that's on the wall, the first key on the board, Ciera.  
  
CIERA JOHNSON: It's not what we do, it's how we do it.  
  
GARY BLAIR: That came from a few other coaches in this tournament as well, but
it started at Texas A&M. What we do is we play extremely well and we share. We
shared the responsibility of 18 turnovers in the first half. We made some
adjustments at half. I have a great staff that made some adjustments. We did
some things. Yes, we turned it over a few more in the second half, only three
in the third quarter. All of a sudden we had played so great for the first
eight minutes of the third quarter, but here comes Auburn again. We had a
nine-point lead. They went right back in front by one, got to two, three. We
kept making plays. We kept making plays.  
  
I know this tournament has been run tremendous. I'm asking all those people
that are out there that have tickets from South Carolina and Tennessee, some
of the other teams that have been eliminated, the best day of basketball is
always on Friday when you have eight teams playing that are all going to a
tournament, NCAA or WNIT, we're all going somewhere.  
  
You saw some of the best basketball in the country being played today. Every
game today was that special. I'm just proud of these young ladies. Yes, I was
in her ear to come get the ball on the last second. I said, Don't you give it
up. She was going to shoot it or she was going to dump it in over there. There
was no other option.  
  
We did a great job of first making the stop on the defensive end to be able to
set up that play.  
  
Questions for my players.  
  
Q. How did your conditioning pay off tonight when you had to play so
many minutes?  
CIERA JOHNSON: I guess you could say we're kind of used to it. Coach Blair, as
everyone knows, doesn't like to sub that much. Got to kind of suck it up and
just keep going.  
  
Q. Kayla, Chennedy Carter is not available for the SEC tournament. Take
us inside your mind when you hear that news, know that's going to mean more
responsibility for you.  
KAYLA WELLS: It was tough. What I was thinking was I'm going to have to step
up, I'm going to have to have the ball in my hand a lot of the time. I knew
playing a team like Auburn, that was really going to hurt us.  
  
I knew if we came together as a team, we were just tough, we were going to win
the game.  
  
Q. Kayla, looks like an offensive breakdown, then all of a sudden
there's four seconds on the shot clock, making the shot. Is that exactly how
you drew it up in your mind, what coach scripted out?  
KAYLA WELLS: It was either going to be me or Ciera. Ciera wasn't open. I got
the ball. I drove it, knew I was going to go to the basket. I made it.  
  
Q. Ciera, looking ahead to the matchup with Arkansas, what challenges
are you anticipating?  
CIERA JOHNSON: They're a very great transition team. They can keep the floor
very spread. They have a lot of shooters. We got done playing them, we beat
them, they are going to come out ready to play. Transition defense will be a
big focal point for us tomorrow.  
  
GARY BLAIR: Just think, Unique Thompson and Ciera Johnson, two very good post
players. One had 13 and five boards, played 33 minutes. This one had 12
points, eight boards, played 37 minutes. They're not even on the first or
second team all SEC. That's how good this league is. Their time is coming.
They're both sophomores. There's so many good juniors and seniors in the
league, sometimes you have to wait your turn.  
  
That was a great effort by both of those two fives. The rest were letting them
bang a little. It was good. Ciera switched off on McKay, contested that shot,
didn't give her a good look. That's a great defense by Coach Starkey. They
knew how to play that defense on the last-second shot. I thought they might
give the ball back in to Alexander, but she wasn't having a great shooting
night. McKay needed to make the shot.  
  
Give us a little bit of credit for how we played defense. Shot 59%, which is
the highest we shot all year. Take the 26 turnovers away, we played pretty
damn well. I'm so proud. But now we got to recover because we're going to face
the hottest team in the tournament, Arkansas, by how they played.  
  
They also know to get to the NCAA tournament, they probably need to get to the
championship game at least. They're going to be playing their hearts out.
We're going to be ready for them. Chennedy Carter will still not play tomorrow
either. The ones that I have here are going to play very well.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We can dismiss the student-athletes. We'll continue with
questions for coach.  
  
GARY BLAIR: Jada Walton hitting the big three in the corner, I think that's
the first one she made in conference. She was playing with cramps with her
legs bad. She showed a lot of guts coming back in. Jas Williams gave us some
good defensive minutes in there. That's all we have, folks. We got three
guards that have to play 40 minutes. Jas Williams has to come in and be able
to spot us and give us five to ten minutes somewhere down the line.  
  
Just think, the transition game tomorrow. Arkansas is going to want the score
90-88. We want the score a little bit lower because we got to rest people.
We're going to the ice tub. I'm going to somewhere where there's ice in
something else when I get home.  
  
Questions, anybody else?  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Coach Blair.  
  
GARY BLAIR: Let's go home, folks. It's been a great day of SEC basketball.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Terri Williams-
Flournoy](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=20559)

### [Janiah McKay](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30822)

### [Unique Thompson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34713)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Auburn-53, Alabama-52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Auburn. Coach, if you could make an opening
statement, please.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: It was definitely a tough game. As everybody knows,
hard to beat a team three times. Alabama was playing well. They played very
well yesterday. They came out and they played just as well today.  
  
I'm very proud of our young ladies. They continued to fight, were relentless,
kept getting after it. We knew we had to have had a good fourth quarter.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll direct questions to the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Either Janiah or Unique, what was going so well for you
defensively?  
JANIAH McKAY: I think our press starts with our tops, and our tops started to
apply more pressure. We knew we had to come up and help. We just knew we had
to come back. We didn't win a quarter, so we knew we had to increase our
pressure and try to get some turnovers.  
  
Q. What went so well for you guys offensively in the fourth quarter?  
UNIQUE THOMPSON: We began attacking them more. We realized we were in the
bonus. In the fourth quarter, we knew when we got the turnovers, we had to
score in transition. Offensive rebounds helped us a lot, too, in the fourth
quarter.  
  
Q. Now you have Texas A &M up next. What immediately comes to mind when
you think of their team?  
JANIAH McKAY: Texas A&M is always a tough team to beat. We just have to buckle
down, watch film, study the scout, just get prepared. It's an exciting part of
the season. We played them before. It was a very close game.  
  
We just want to refocus, take the good things away from that game and improve
defensively and sharing the ball offensively.  
  
Q. Janiah, it is hard to beat a team three times. You're a senior now?
Why is it so hard?  
JANIAH McKAY: It's so tough. You've seen that team multiple times. It's not
just any team, it's Alabama. That is one of the toughest games that we play
every year. We knew that they were going to come out just as hard.  
  
We came out flat to start the game, so we knew we had to pick up our
intensity, enjoy the moment, move forward. We have to learn from this. It's
going to be difficult to beat a tough Texas A&M team playing the way we played
today.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: 1975 was the last time we beat Alabama three times,
1975.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Janiah and Unique. We'll finish with questions for
head coach.  
  
Q. Texas A &M tomorrow. You probably haven't had time to do much
scouting on them yet. What do you see as maybe a difference they might show
tomorrow opposed to the first time you played them?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Just like everyone in this league, we know everybody.
I think Texas A&M has some players that are playing really well right now for
the inside and the post players. If there's an all-improved player that we
give an award to, she definitely gets it.  
  
They're hitting outside shots. They have a very good point guard. People will
say they don't have Chennedy Carter. Doesn't matter. Texas A&M is a very good
team. Coach Blair is a very good coach. He's going to come with something.  
  
Q. You were able to shake off a rough free-throw shooting game at LSU.
How big was that today? How big is that going to be moving forward?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Free throws were huge. We shot 10-for-11 in the
fourth quarter. It came down to us just having to knock down some free throws.
We didn't shoot the ball extremely well. We shoot free throws every single
day. We put them on the line. We really work at the free-throw shooting
because it does come down to it as it did today.  
  
Q. 29 points off of 26 turnovers, second half. Were you able to wear
them down throughout the first three quarters, apply the pressure?  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Yeah, we knew we had to keep pressing, we were.
That's what we do. We knew eventually we could wear them down. Cierra was
handling the ball the majority of the time. She got a little tired. We started
upping the pressure a little bit, trying to close up traps a little more,
trying to put the ball in someone else's hands.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
TERRI WILLIAMS-FLOURNOY: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Holly Warlick](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=23251)

### [Evina Westbrook](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36577)

### [Rennia Davis](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34708)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Tennessee-69, LSU-66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Tennessee. Coach, we'll start with an opening
statement.  
  
HOLLY WARLICK: Just have a tremendous amount of respect for LSU and what Nikki
has done. We knew it was going to be a hard-fought game. Our kids showed up.
We had grit. We stayed focused. We got in foul trouble, things didn't go well,
but we stayed the course.  
  
These two young ladies, they stepped up, made great plays. But that's what
great players do. They put their team on their back and they made plays.  
  
Really proud of our team and these two for giving us a chance to play
tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Rennia, could you talk about the three-point shot with three minutes
left in the fourth quarter?  
RENNIA DAVIS: I think that just gave us another momentum boost. I think the
fourth quarter for us, it's all about finishing games. Every big shot counts.
Every defensive stop counts. I think that shot was just a shift in momentum
for us.  
  
Q. Rennia, could you talk about what was said at halftime?  
RENNIA DAVIS: Just defending without fouling. First half I think three of our
starters picked up two fouls pretty quickly. Just staying in the stance
without fouling, take care of the ball definitely. Just getting back to
Tennessee basketball, which is getting stops on defense and taking good rhythm
shots on the offensive end.  
  
Q. Evina, it seemed like LSU had a defensive plan. You two were a big
part of it. When it's coming down to that pressure time in the game, you know
you're a defensive focus, how do you overcome that and stay focused?  
EVINA WESTBROOK: I just think as a team, we knew we had to get stops,
primarily on defense. Once we continue to get stops on defense, it just
generates our offense with a lot of energy.  
  
I think we just knew as a team we had to get stops. As the momentum kept on
going, we were doing a good job on rebounding the ball, boxing out. We came
down, were just making shots that I remember making in practice. Hitting shots
we practiced over and over again.  
  
It wasn't really like a scary moment for us. We practiced it so much, worked
on it so much in practice. Really just took the timeout to just realize that
we've been here before, this is a big game, big moment for us, but we weren't
really scared from the challenge.  
  
Q. Evina, you had 15 of your 20 total points in the second half. Was
that because you had a different feel? Were they giving you different looks?  
EVINA WESTBROOK: I knew I had to be more aggressive as the second half went
on. My team was giving me confidence. My coaches were giving me confidence.
Just going out there and making plays, whatever my team needed me to do.  
  
As soon as I was being more aggressive, it opened up the lane for me to pass
more for my bigs to be open, the wings to be open. As a point guard, that's my
job, just to make plays.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, ladies. We will continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. The three players, two fouls first half, you had to use your bench,
talk about that.  
HOLLY WARLICK: Yeah, we did. We got in foul trouble. Our young kids had to
step up. Did some good things. Did some things they normally don't do. I was
proud of them because they're in that situation. We have to understand our
kids can't get in foul trouble.  
  
But you got to have a strong bench. I will tell you this, this group has
gotten the experience throughout our whole season. Had some good confidence in
them.  
  
Q. You had 10 turnovers in the first half, five in the third quarter
alone. Were you impressed with how the team was able to overcome that sloppy
play?  
HOLLY WARLICK: We talked a lot about it at halftime. Unforced errors, trying
to make a home run, just get it to the open player. We talked a lot about
that.  
  
It limited our opportunities to shoot the basketball. Control the tempo, take
it when we need it. We got some great fastbreak points, but they were great
passes and they were open. We settled down the second half. I wanted us to
attack the basket.  
  
I think we shot three, went to the line three times or two times in the first
half. That's not us. We got to get great looks by getting in the paint and
attacking the basket.  
  
Q. Early in the fourth quarter, there were no turnovers. That's when you
made the run to take the lead. How much better is your team when you're taking
care of the basketball?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, it gives you that many more opportunities. We want to
play fast, but we want to be smart. I thought the first really two quarters we
weren't very smart. When we distribute the basketball, we get people great
looks, we're such a better offensive team when we move the ball, distribute
the ball, get open looks.  
  
We're not a great team at creating our own look. If I gave one of these kids
the ball, just said, Go make a play, we have a hard time doing that. After
we've moved the ball a couple of times, we're really solid on the offensive
end.  
  
Q. You used the word 'grit'. From watching warmups, the team seemed to
be together. Did you get any feeling when you took the lead, the bench
erupted?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Well, look, these kids, I know they felt pressure today, but
they battled, they worked through doing things that were probably
uncharacteristic to us. They were so focused in our huddle, all of them. Every
time we would change a defense or an offense, they were pretty spot on.  
  
You could tell the kids are together when they're having their own
conversation. It's an intelligent conversation about basketball, what we need
to do. It did take us grit. It took us a lot to stay focused.  
  
Zaay Green only played 19 minutes. She's a vital part of this basketball team.
She was in it, she was the first one off the bench to greet our kids. That's
the sign of a great basketball team.  
  
Q. In the first half, Evina took four shots, in the second half had 15
points. How much of an emphasis was put on getting the ball in her hands in
the second half?  
HOLLY WARLICK: I ran a play to Evina, she attacked the basket, was so
deliberate, shot a layup. I'm running everything as much as I can to her
because of that mindset.  
  
I put her in a position where they're makable shots for her. In the first
half, she had to kind of create her own shots. Once I saw Evina attack the
basket, I'm going to go through her and Re. Both of them stepped up. Both of
them stepped up.  
  
Q. When you look at the final stats here, points in the paint, second-
chance points, you were tied with 14. With the game that close, how big was
the free-throw shooting?  
HOLLY WARLICK: I was just glad we got to the line. We didn't get to the line.
It was huge. Our free-throw shooting has been huge down the stretch.  
  
But I have to go back and watch it, but we had kids down the stretch. Mimi
Collins, again, she had another big shot in the corner. Then Re hits a big
three. Most of our stuff was in the paint.  
  
Second-chance points, Cheridene had a big rebound and putback. Getting to the
free-throw line was huge. At the end I wanted to get the ball in Re's hands.
She's one of our best free throw shooters. She stepped up to the line and hit
big free throws for us.  
  
Q. Obviously a really good team set for tomorrow. How challenging is it
this time of year to turn around and play another good team the next day? What
will it take to win tomorrow?  
HOLLY WARLICK: It's twofold. We've played a game, Mississippi State hasn't.
That I think is an advantage for us. Now, playing back-to-back, very difficult
because of how we play, how hard that game was.  
  
We got our eye on being in great condition. There's not a whole lot of
scouting you can do. We have to rely on our basketball knowledge, listen to
our game plan.  
  
Look, we got beat by Mississippi State by I think 30. I've tried to erase it.
We didn't play well down the stretch. We have an opportunity for a rematch
which our kids are excited about.  
  
What do you do? You're playing the No. 1 seed in the conference. It is what it
is. Our kids just got to step up to the challenge.  
  
Q. Evina talked about how excited she was for that rematch with
Mississippi State because she missed the first one. How much of a difference
can she make tomorrow?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Look what we did today. She took over the game today at one
point. It's huge. You have to have somebody on the floor. Look, Jazmine did a
great job. She's a freshman in that environment. You have to have someone who
has poise, that sees the floor, knows how to run the team, knows who to get
the ball to.  
  
Yeah, it was a big loss for her not to play down there. It was a huge loss.
But she'll step up and compete. She's a competitor. She'll get the opportunity
to play them tomorrow.  
  
Q. Mimi Collins getting back-to-back starts now. How long have you seen
her develop into this starter role? How much has her game improved?  
HOLLY WARLICK: I just go back and watch tape of when she was first here. She
couldn't guard me, and I'm slow. I used to be fast, but I'm slow (smiling).  
  
What was holding Mimi back was her commitment to the defensive end. She made a
commitment. She got in the gym and worked with our assistant coaches. Now I
have confidence in her. I kept telling her, Mimi, it's not offense I'm worried
about. You can play 10, but your player can't score 20.  
  
She took that to heart, stepped up. Obviously she has hit some big offensive
plays. She has not been a liability on the defensive end. That's a kid who
will get in the gym and is willing to work and get better at what she really
wasn't good at. I commend her for that.  
  
To admit that you need to work on it, then get in the gym and work on it, it's
awesome.  
  
Q. Y'all talked a lot the other day about one game at a time. NCAA
tournament is what it is. Was there a sense of how big this game was as far as
the NCAA tournament?  
HOLLY WARLICK: Are you asking me or our players (laughter)?  
  
Yes, it was, absolutely. Absolutely. There was a sense of urgency. There's
been a sense of urgency throughout. You lose six in a row, you have a sense of
urgency. This was. We didn't beat around the bush. We talked about it. We
talked about it as a staff. We talked about it as a team.  
  
We didn't say, We have to win this game, but we talked about how hard we need
to play. If we do these things, it will take care of themselves. Yeah, my gut
was killing me on the way over here. That's me being competitive. You got to
be competitive. Today we were competitive when our backs were against the
wall. That's what basketball is all about. That's what the tournament is all
about.  
  
We're 1-0 in the tournament right now, we're 1-0. We're going to take it and
get ready for tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, coach.  
  
HOLLY WARLICK: Thank you.

### [Caliya Robinson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36598)

### [Taja Cole](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34748)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Arkansas-86, Georgia-76  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Georgia. Coach, if you could make an opening
statement, please.  
  
JONI TAYLOR: I want to start by giving Arkansas credit. They came out and
played really well tonight. We talked about how good they are, what we were
worried about happening happened. They made a lot of shots and they were able
to score in transition. We chose to make our run really, really late in the
game. Let's give them the credit for that. We said all along it's been really
tough to beat a team three times in a row.  
  
Really unfortunate that our season is ending today. Super proud of our team
for what they've done, the resiliency they've had all year long with injury
and battling through things like that.  
  
So with that we'll open it up for questions for our student-athletes.  
  
Q. Caliya, with this possibly your last game at Georgia, what are you
feeling right now?  
CALIYA ROBINSON: The way I'm feeling right now, I give credit to Arkansas, of
course. But this ain't the way I want to go out. Just to reflect on the
season, as a team we fought every game, every day. We fought. I regret no
point in time in the season.  
  
Q. Taja, as you look at the season, how it played out, as you look ahead
to your next year, what type of memories will you take away from this? How do
you think things look in terms of the future?  
TAJA COLE: I had a really, really fun season. I think we fought a lot of
adversity. We had a lot of close losses this year. You look at Maryland, you
look at South Carolina, you look at Mississippi State, a couple other games.
We fought hard with a young, young team.  
  
I just think for the future, we just have to learn how to finish. We can
compete with anybody. I've always believed it. But we just got to learn how to
finish.  
  
I think growth within our younger players, me furthering my knowledge as a
point guard, will definitely help that. Once we learn how to finish, we'll be
in good shape.  
  
Q. Y'all didn't shoot the ball particularly bad tonight. How frustrating
was it that every time y'all made a basket, they would respond to it? How
challenging is that?  
TAJA COLE: It was very difficult. I think Arkansas played very, very well
tonight. It seemed like everything they took went in. It was just one of those
nights. We tried offensively. We still shot about 40% from the field, but they
shot 56% from the field.  
  
It was just a fight all night. Really good game.  
  
Q. Did y'all ever feel like there was a point that y'all could get back
into it?  
CALIYA ROBINSON: I think when you're down, you never give up fighting. At
every point in time, we knew we could get back. It was, How do we do that? We
didn't take control of the ways we did make our runs. That's something we need
to work on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Seeing that you have the youngest team in the SEC right now, do you
think that's something that maybe makes it harder to climb to the top?  
JONI TAYLOR: We won't be the youngest team in the league next year. We had a
lot of things going on. Youngest team in the league, battled injury all year
long. Finally in the month of February we got ourselves back, got Que back,
got our rhythm going a little too late.  
  
For us to continue to stay in the conversation, we have to do exactly what
Taja said, that is to continue to learn, finish games out. That's where our
youth showed up this year. We would battle back, be in a game, but wouldn't
finish it. The expectation at Georgia basketball is to always compete for
championships. That's what we're going to continue to recruit, that's what
we're going to continue to coach our young ladies to be prepared for.  
  
Q. Will you consider a bid in the WNIT or not?  
JONI TAYLOR: I knew you were going to ask me that question. We will not. The
NIT is a great tournament. There's a lot of great teams that play in it.  
  
Again, you look at Georgia basketball, what we've done, what Coach Landers
did, former players did, what we want to do. We come to Georgia to play in the
NCAA tournament. So we will not take a bid to the NIT if given one.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate on the player that Dungee is?  
JONI TAYLOR: She's an incredible player. Our fear always is how we're going to
guard her. We give up size to her. You put a post player on her, she's going
to drive by us. When we played at Arkansas, she had a really good night, but
we were able to contain their other players. Then she struggled a bit when she
came to us at home.  
  
Playing her for the third time, we knew she was going to be really good. She
put her team on her back, got them going, made shots, got to the free-throw
line.  
  
What we did not do tonight was contain everyone else. They had five players
score in double figures. You cannot allow Chelsea to have 31, then four other
players have double-figure scores.  
  
Q. What was setting the defense back? And big picture, as you look back
on the season, what will be your memories?  
JONI TAYLOR: To answer your first question, they hammered us in transition.
That's what we've worried about. They're so fast. They put four guards on the
floor. They made some shots today that they did not make the first few times
we played them.  
  
You get back and you finally get them stopped in transition, they're shooting
the three ball the way they were tonight. They were clicking on all cylinders,
came out like they had something to prove. That hurt us defensively.  
  
We tried to switch ball screens, hedge over, give them different looks. At
that point once you let a team like Arkansas, who once they see the ball go in
the hole, they all become really, really, really, really good. They got off to
a really good start and they continued to do that for the entire game. Where
we had been good this season was we didn't allow them to get off to that good
start.  
  
To answer your second question, when I think back on the season, the memories
I have, this team fights. We have a great group of young ladies that represent
Georgia basketball and the University of Georgia the way we want it
represented.  
  
We challenged them, asked them to do a lot of hard things. We had hard days in
practice, rebounding from losses. They've always answered the call and done
everything we asked them to do. We have to continue to get better. We're not
satisfied with where we are now. It's unacceptable for us to end our season
today the way we did.  
  
But I'm proud of the team we have, and the ladies that represent us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
JONI TAYLOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Robin Pingeton](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=21391)

### [Sophie Cunningham](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30334)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Missouri-87, Florida-56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Missouri. Coach, if you could make an opening
statement.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: Just really happy for our players. It's never often that you
get to play your entire team. It feels really good as a coach to get everybody
out there obviously for several reasons.  
  
One, everybody works so hard throughout the course of season. To be able to
find minutes for them, valuable minutes for them, was big. Also to be able to
rest some kids.  
  
Cam has done an incredible job at Florida. I think he's a really, really good
coach. He's got some talent on that team. They've just battled all year long.
They gave us everything we could handle in that first half.  
  
I don't know if fatigue played a factor in that second half or not, but he's
going to build an incredible program at Florida. He's a very, very good coach.  
  
Happy for our players. I thought it was a really good team win. Different kids
stepped up. I thought we did a great job sharing the ball. That first half, we
had some defensive possessions. We missed some box outs. We had some tough
turnovers. I think that usually goes along with that first game of tournament
play. You kind of got to fight yourself through it. I thought they did that,
came out, obviously had a really good second half.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Sophie Cunningham.  
  
Q. It was a pretty back and forth game first half. Ended the half on a
10-2 run. What allowed you to get that run?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: I'm going to repeat what coach said: We had to get our legs
under us. I think us getting a game under our belt is awesome, honestly. I
think when you kind of have that experience, you take it from being a
freshman, we've been here. You kind of know what to expect.  
  
This year I think we've handled it great so far. That first half we had to get
our legs under us. People were knocking down shots. I was looking at the shot
chart here, everyone scored. That's awesome. I can't remember the last time
that's happened. Really happy for our team.  
  
Q. How big was Amber's performance?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: It's huge. I don't expect anything less. I think Amber can
do that any game she wants. But for her to come out there, especially in the
first half, when it was going back and forth, it was huge for us just to stay
in it.  
  
Down the stretch, everyone from top to bottom gave it their best shot and it
kind of worked out.  
  
Q. You mentioned everybody contributing. How fun was it to see that at
the end of the game?  
SOPHIE CUNNINGHAM: It's awesome. Those kids who don't get in as much as some
of us, I mean, they work just as hard every day in practice. They're the ones
who push us every single day to get better. For them to get their shot on this
kind of stage, I love it, absolutely love it.  
  
Especially when everyone gets a bucket, I think it's great.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Sophie. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. You missed your first five threes, then kind of picked up in the
second quarter. What led to finally the threes?  
ROBIN PINGETON: Florida has some really talented athletes. Their quickness. We
had to settle in. We weren't sure if they'd play us more man or zone, try to
junk it up with Sophie. I think it was a matter of getting comfortable out
there.  
  
I felt like some of those shots early, some of our turnovers early, we were
just playing too quick, sped up a little bit. We just really kept talking
about it in our timeouts of playing off two feet, just slowing down with
everything.  
  
I thought once we settled in, obviously did a much better job of that.  
  
Q. Was there any mention at all about this being an opportunity to
avenge that loss to Florida earlier in the year?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I think our girls are well aware of that. That wasn't the
overriding message going into this game. That was a tough loss for us. We
didn't leave Florida feeling very good. We felt like we let one slip away. We
had the lead. You go back and watch film, we had missed so many layups in that
game. It was a tough one.  
  
Yes, I mean, absolutely there was conversation about it. But that wasn't our
driving force. I think for us, just wanted to really focus on controlling what
we can control, making sure we were assignment correct on the defensive end,
and really doing a good job of taking care of the ball.  
  
We just wanted to be the best version of ourselves that we could be. Whatever
happened from there happened from there. I thought our kids did a really nice
job of that.  
  
Yes, there was conversation about it, but I don't think that was the
overwhelming motivation going into this game. It was survive and advance.
Tournament play. We know all these games are going to be tough. Florida was
first up for us. It was more about advancing than anything.  
  
Q. What did you think of Hannah's play?  
ROBIN PINGETON: What did she end up with from the three? That means in the
last two games, I think she was four for four in her last game, if I remember
correctly, so shooting the ball pretty well.  
  
To me, I think frustrating for Hannah throughout the course of the season
because she hasn't been able to do that consistently. That's what we see out
of her in practice. We talk a lot about her being more assertive offensively,
coming up wanting the shot versus I'm open and I'll take the shot. There's a
big difference in that mindset.  
  
But the last couple games she's really shot it well for us. I think that opens
up so much more for us. Certainly both her and Cierra bring so much value to
our team, two different types of ways. I think it's a completely different
look when Hannah is out on the court versus CP, and both have great value.  
  
Q. You haven't started looking at Kentucky yet, but a quick thought on
them?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I'll just say this: Matthew Mitchell is a great coach. He has
a great team. You got the freshman of the year, you have Maci Morris, Murray,
who just was a nightmare for us. We've got a lot of respect for that program,
what Matthew has been able to do.  
  
I'm really anxious to get back to the hotel and dive into film, come up with a
game plan. Like any game of the tournament, it's going to be tough. I feel
really good about where our team is at right now. I think we've been playing
really well as of late. We're looking forward to the opportunity tomorrow.  
  
Q. I know Haley has struggled at times this year. She had 10 today,
looking more like herself. What did you see out of her today?  
ROBIN PINGETON: I'm happy to see it. That's a kid I've watched a lot last year
when she was on the scout team. At times this year it's just the consistency
piece is the part that we struggled with this year from some of those kids
coming off the bench.  
  
Again, that's a kid that went 3-3 from the three-point line against Alabama,
then comes back out tonight and has a big game. Having that kind of depth and
that production off the bench I think is so important.  
  
She looked good. She looked good off the ball. She looked good with the ball
in her hands. The last five minutes she was at point. She plays with great
pace. This is the Haley that we were so excited about having in our program. I
think she has a very high basketball IQ, fundamentally sound, talented young
lady. So the consistency is the key with her.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
ROBIN PINGETON: Thank you.

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Cameron Newbauer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33311)

### [Funda Nakkasoglu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28447)

### [Delicia Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32667)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Missouri-87, Florida-56  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Florida. Coach, if you could make an opening
statement.  
  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: Hats off to Missouri. The last two games they've hit 28
threes. They played very well, shared the ball. 19 assists on 31 field goals.  
  
I think we kind of played five games the last 11 days. With a young,
inexperienced team as we had this year, that's a lot to finish the season
with. Kind of got the short end of the stick with that with how our schedule
worked out.  
  
Couldn't be more proud of our group for finishing the way we did, battling,
fighting, sticking together, trying to be better each possession.  
  
Proud of the effort we gave. Thought we fought and had some moments today
where shots didn't go really down. Thought we had good looks, great execution.
Probably some of that was the fatigue we've had from playing five games in 11
days. Even an experienced team, that would be tough on them, in the SEC.  
  
Hats off to Missouri. Proud of the growth we've shown all year, the two next
to me, the leadership they've displayed with our team. Excited about what's
next for us. Couldn't be more proud of Funda and what she's done in such a
short, short time, in two years at the University of Florida. So blessed and
grateful to have had the opportunity to coach you. Hope I get to coach more
like you.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes, please.  
  
Q. Delicia, close game, what was working well for the Gators?  
DELICIA WASHINGTON: Staying in a stance, playing defense. Giving up good shots
for great shots. Just taking the shots that we take every day in practice,
continue to focus on what we can control and what we can't control, focus in
on the small details, which is running the floor hard, hands up on defense,
setting screens tight, communicating when shooters coming through, simple
things like that. Helped us really good in the first half.  
  
Q. Funda, what did being a Gator mean to you these last two years?  
FUNDA NAKKASOGLU: I mean, it's more than you can put into words. I can't
necessarily put it in words. But I feel like I got so much experience from it.
I met so many great people that I wouldn't have if I hadn't taken this
opportunity. I've just loved it. I literally call these girls family now. It
sounds cliché, but I can go to them for anything. They always have my back.
They have that unwavering confidence in me that I sometimes don't even have in
myself.  
  
It's been incredible. I'm going to miss it. I'm going to cherish it. It hasn't
100% hit I would say that this is it. I know what it does, it will hurt. I'll
kind of wish that I could get some of those moments back.  
  
Q. Coach was saying how much of a joy it was to coach you. How much fun
did you have playing under coach?  
FUNDA NAKKASOGLU: He instills trust in me. He's wanted leadership out of me
this year, which I hope I've provided for him and the players on our team. But
it's been fun. It's been a fun ride. You never know what you're going to get
thrown at you in this league, in anything. But he's always been there just
cheering me on.  
  
Q. Delicia, what are some of the things you learned from having Funda
with you?  
DELICIA WASHINGTON: Having that leadership role, I never had to play that
leadership role. Funda is one of the type of people that I can find of being a
leader and helping me get through those ways of trying to be a leader for our
teammates.  
  
Like coach say, we have a young group of girls. Funda has been in this program
for a little minute. We know what it takes to play in the SEC. Being able to
have Funda on my back, teaching me the ways to be a leader, become a better
leader, it helps me to be able to provide for my younger teammates.  
  
Q. Delicia, when you think about what's coming back for next year, what
enthuses you about your senior season?  
DELICIA WASHINGTON: Still being able to play with a group of girls that I can
call my family, call my sisters, knowing that they're going to be behind me
each step of the way, having coaches that believe in me. I have people that
comes in that's ready to go get it. Just playing hard together, focusing on
what we can control at that moment. Just playing hard for the University of
Florida Gators.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. It seemed like a pretty back-and-forth game going into halftime until
there was the 10-2 run. What allowed them to end the half on that note?  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: I thought we were being effective when we were sharing the
ball, making good decisions offensively. We took quick shots that led to
really, really quick transition on their part. We got in trouble not getting
matched up in time, which led to some open threes they got, made us pay.  
  
But I think it was the derivative of just the shot selection we took, no pass
shot or one pass shot. I think we had four of those in maybe five possessions.
They make you pay for that because they do such a good job spreading the floor
in transition.  
  
Q. Your team held Missouri to 56 points earlier this year. What did you
see differently today out of them offensively versus January?  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: That was a problem at halftime. I noticed they had 42. They
were focused, they were fresh. They were very aggressive. Thought they would
come out aggressive. They missed their first handful of threes, too, I think
tonight. Then they kept finding a rhythm of where they were going to get their
shots. They kept shooting them.  
  
We didn't mix up our defense early enough. I think they got really
comfortable. We wanted to mix things up, disrupt them. We didn't do that early
enough. We just didn't adjust quickly enough.  
  
Q. Looking over this season, what is one thing you're truly proud of
this team for how much they've grown from the start to finish?  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: You said it, they've grown, the growth of the individual
players, the growth of our team. You look down our roster. You have a handful
of players that have never played anywhere near what was asked of them this
year in terms of minutes, in terms of roles. Then to do that and to not have a
winning season, not even close to a winning season, keep fighting, keep
competing, keep climbing that mountain of adversity every single day, it's
hard.  
  
I'm a 40-year-old man. It's hard for me to do it. So just seeing their youth,
their energy, their enthusiasm to want to be better, just makes me proud and
excited for what's to come. I just appreciate so much the character that they
displayed all year through these tough times just trying to be the best
Florida Gators we could be as a team and them as individuals.  
  
Q. How important was the experience that was gained by the youth of the
team this year?  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: I think just even going through an SEC season. You look at
how Zada has grown with her confidence and ability. Look at what's happened to
Kiki ^ . Even Delicia her last two games, and she had experience. Look at
Danielle, Arie, Paige. Even Kristina who broke her arm this year, was done for
the year.  
  
You see the growth with Delicia. She had two years of experience, let alone
all the other players that didn't have any experience. It just makes you
excited about what's to come because now all of a sudden it's not brand-new.
When those bright lights come on, there's people in the stand, on the road in
a tough environment, it's not brand-new. You open up at home, not brand-new.
So many things were brand-new to us this year, that we had to experience to
learn and to grow, to try to become better for what's next in front of us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you for joining us.  
  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Mike Neighbors](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28339)

### [Chelsea Dungee](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36599)

### [Malica Monk](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=34673)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Arkansas-86, Georgia-76  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Arkansas. Coach, an opening statement, please.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: Really proud of and for our group. We played really good
basketball the last month of the season. We couldn't get a win for whatever
reason. But these kids kept showing up every single day at practice. I'm not
going to tell you it was rainbows, unicorns and roses every single day,
because it's not. We live in reality world. They stuck together.  
  
For the second year in a row we've played our best basketball game in the
first game of the SEC tournament. I think that speaks volumes for your
leaders, which two of them are up here with me right now. We're really excited
to be able to advance and play again tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Chelsea, you shot the ball so well, the team shot the ball so well.
What is that feeling like?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: Feels good coming off a couple games, a losing streak. Feels
good to see the ball go into the basket, yeah.  
  
Q. Chelsea, coming into this game, did you have any extra anger about
you with the stuff that happened last week? Did you come in here with extra
anger?  
CHELSEA DUNGEE: Yeah, I had a little bit of a chip on my shoulder. I just
wanted to go out and play the best that I could, show everyone what I can do.  
  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: I tried to turn the chip into a boulder (laughter). I'll
elaborate on that later.  
  
Q. Malica, as one of the leaders of this team, everything coach
mentioned, the adversity, we can't get a break, how did you and the leaders
keep everybody focused and believing?  
MALICA MONK: We just really had to come together. With everybody, we like to
compete with one another. We know that we are above and beyond, we should be
up the top with the other teams. We just come out every day tackling every
task that we can. We've really proven to everybody that we're still capable of
winning games no matter what is being thrown at us.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We will continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Can you elaborate on that boulder? Was that in practice?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: It was in the lobby last night. I get it, hey, I'm going to
say exactly what I said at my press conference back at home. I ultimately
respect how hard it is to make the first team in this league. There's only
eight spots for 14 teams, of which there's a lot of great players. I get it.
It's really hard to make the first team.  
  
But if you look at our team from last year, what we added, a lot of it was
Chelsea, okay? Mal played great. Mal is probably the most improved kid I've
coached between summers. All the kids got better.  
  
We graduated Dev and brought Chelsea in. We went from losing 104-60 to Texas
A&M, taking that into the fourth quarter. South Carolina beat us 90-42. This
year it was a one-possession game at our place. If you take her off of our
team, we're playing yesterday. We're probably going home.  
  
I know how hard it is. I know there are a lot of deserving people. I don't
know who I would have taken off, I honestly don't. But she had a great season.
She had a first team all conference season. I think she backed it up with a
first team all conference first round.  
  
She's just that type of kid. You have to tell her, Maybe you can't do this,
and she can. I built it up. I'm not going to tell you I didn't. I used it to
our advantage. I don't wish it. I'm not glad that it happened. I wish we
should have been recognized.  
  
Here is another reason. Because to be recognized as an honoree here at the
SEC, you have to be first team all conference. We don't have very many. Where
is Jerry? Are we out? We don't have anybody that's been first team, and she
could have been.  
  
I know there's a lot of work to do between now and then. I know how hard that
kid worked. She sacrificed an awful lot to come play for us. Whatever it took,
I was going to take every full advantage. I would have never dreamt she would
have gone 10-for-16, 10-for-12, and played great defense for 36 minutes.
That's a heck of a performance and a heck of a game.  
  
That was a really long answer to a short question. I apologize.  
  
Q. Playing Georgia for a third time, how were you able to get over that
hump, pull it off?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: There's a reason that cliché is out there about it's hard to
beat a team three times in a year. They didn't just make that up. It is hard
to do that.  
  
I know Joni and her staff did everything they could do to try to show them
just because you got two wins, it's not going to matter today. I know they
did. It's hard. I've been in that situation before.  
  
Our job was a lot easier. It was simply do one thing better each quarter. We
were mic'd up. That's all we talked about in our pregame, every timeout: Do
one more thing we haven't been doing in these other games, that's going to be
the difference between the win and the loss.  
  
Q. From Georgia's perspective, as you've seen that program over the last
couple years, what do you see where it's headed?  
MIKE NEIGHBORS: The expectations for Georgia, I said this when we played down
there, there's not many arenas when you walk in where there's more women's
jerseys retired than men's. They have that. Their tradition is so, so rich.
The bar is set so high.  
  
They have a really good team. It's a tough year in this league where there's a
lot of people in the middle to beat each other up. I think it's going to be
the first time in SEC history a 9-1 team didn't go to the NCAA tournament. Is
that what they're telling us? I'm not in charge of that, but that's what all
the experts are saying, is that Georgia is not going to get in with nine SEC
wins. I think that will be the first in history for a nine-win team.  
  
They are headed to nothing but -- I know who they've recruited. I'm going to
send Caliya Robinson a graduation card, make sure her alarm is set, shows up
on time to walk and gets out of there. She is phenomenal. I know who they have
coming. I know it's a team that for years to come is always going to be one
you're going to have to go through to try to advance in this league, try to
catch them.  
  
See you guys tomorrow.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Nikki Fargas](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=30321)

### [Ayana Mitchell](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32658)

### [Khayla Pointer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36576)

  
_Greenville, South Carolina_  
  
Tennessee-69, LSU-66  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by LSU. Coach, an opening statement, please.  
  
NIKKI FARGAS: Obviously wanting this win for this group. They've fought hard
the entire season. It's been an emotional day for our team knowing that we
couldn't come away with a victory. A lot of credit to Tennessee. They stayed
the course. Their go-to players stepped up and made big-time plays. The two
young ladies up here next to me also played at an elite level.  
  
We have to obviously see what our chances are of post-season play, but we will
learn from this and grow from this.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Khayla, what did you feel like was the biggest difference in the
fourth quarter? You had things going up until that point.  
KHAYLA POINTER: We had a lot of defensive breakdowns, critical moments, like
she said. Letting their go-to players get open shots, second-chance rebounds.
We didn't lock in defensively.  
  
Yeah, some missed assignments. You can't give Tennessee second and third
opportunities like that.  
  
Q. Ayana, how would you characterize the physical nature of the play in
the post-season? How did this game compare?  
AYANA MITCHELL: I would say the last three to four games that we've played, I
think the intensity and the physicality has definitely increased. Everyone is
trying to get a win. They're coming hard. They're not stopping. They're coming
very aggressive.  
  
I feel like Tennessee, they have great post play. Even with their guards, you
have to attack the basket aggressively at this point in time, especially now
that we're in the SEC tournament. Everyone is stepping up their game.  
  
Q. Khayla, when you think about the building blocks from this year
leading into next year, what are those things?  
KHAYLA POINTER: I think overall each and every one of us, we need to get in
the gym and improve our game. You can always get better. We learn from losses
like this. We'll bounce back next year.  
  
Q. The last game, they really hurt you on the offensive boards. You were
able to do a much better job this time. Were you handling things better
inside?  
AYANA MITCHELL: I definitely think we did a lot better, but we still missed
opportunities at times. With Tennessee, you can't give them, like KP says,
second and third opportunities. In those critical moments, we did just that.  
  
Throughout the game I think we did a pretty good job. In critical moments, we
didn't do our job.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We will continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Your thoughts about the board work your team did today. Did you feel
that was not as much of a factor?  
NIKKI FARGAS: Well, I thought there were critical moments in the fourth
quarter where our defense, we didn't finish off our defense. We allowed some
offensive rebounds that led to not necessarily offensive put-backs, but to
kick-outs for a jumper to another reset of the possession. Those are all
energy plays, when you're able to get offensive boards.  
  
Ayana Mitchell is one of those kids, she's a dream to coach. She's selfless.
Whatever I ask of her, she's going to do it. She's going to give me everything
that she has. Very proud of her effort on the boards. She's been consistent
for us. She, too, is hard to keep off the offensive glass. She balances that
out for us with board play.  
  
Khayla Pointer, last year being a first year, to see the growth of this young
lady after the loss of her father, to see her come out today and play like
they belonged, just really played well for us.  
  
You know, I'm very excited about these two coming back. We're obviously going
to take every game. We try to get better from each game. I think that's what
these young ladies are doing, they're learning how to compete on this stage.
They're going to get better because of it.  
  
Q. You mentioned you're not sure what is next. Did you feel like you
were playing for your tournament life today?  
NIKKI FARGAS: Well, I think you don't want to ever go into the SEC tournament
hoping and praying if you're going to get in. I felt like we had opportunities
in our SEC schedule to come away with some wins where we had four games
regular season that we lost three possessions or less. You have to have a
closer. Our closer that we've had in the past has been through our guard play.
We're asking a young sophomore to do that for us. She did a great job.  
  
We're still hopeful. You just never know what the committee is looking at.
We've been in a situation a few years ago where I think there was a cluster of
us that went 7-9. We're going to, again, whatever our fate is, we're going to
take it, own it, and we're going to move forward.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
NIKKI FARGAS: Thank you.

## March 7, 2019

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

### [Shaquera Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32627)

### [Cierra Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36564)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Auburn-53, Alabama-52  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Alabama. Coach, an opening statement, please.  
  
KRISTY CURRY: Really proud of our team. Came up a little bit short. I loved
what this team has done this weekend. We certainly continue to improve.  
  
My love for Taylor Berry and Shaquera Wade, what they've given to our program
and university as student-athletes, they are special. We will continue to
build off that foundation that they've laid, continue to move this forward.  
  
We're just going to go home and get back to work. That's all we know.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Shaquera, can you talk about what the University of Alabama means to
you.  
SHAQUERA WADE: It means a lot. I'm sorry.  
  
KRISTY CURRY: It's all right.  
  
SHAQUERA WADE: Four years here, they've given me nothing but love. I wouldn't
replace this university with any other, you know. We didn't win like we wanted
to, but I love my teammates, I love my coaches, I love my university, and I
wouldn't replace it at all.  
  
Q. Shaquera, how important was it for you, for your last SEC tournament,
to show up big in these last two games?  
SHAQUERA WADE: I really wasn't worried about how many points I had. I was just
doing everything I could just to help my teammates be involved. I know Cierra,
she did everything she could to attack and stuff, get me open. Even though I
missed a few, coach was like, Attack, attack. I did everything that I could. I
laid everything out on the floor all 40 minutes.  
  
Q. Cierra, talk about Shaquera and Taylor, what it means moving forward
now without them.  
CIERRA JOHNSON: Shaq and Taylor, they played a huge role in our lives, not
even just on the court, just outside. They're perfect role models, great
leaders. Without them, it's going to be kind of hard.  
  
But we're just going to use everything, every lesson they taught us at
practice, apply it to next year. We just got to go hard for them. We're going
to miss them. Like Shaq, she's like a sister to me. Taylor, they just going to
be missed. Tonight we laid everything on the line for them. They needed that.
We came up short. I just hope they understand we left it all out for them. We
have nothing left in the tank. We left it all out there.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you. We'll continue with questions for coach.  
  
Q. Talk about how proud you are of your team.  
KRISTY CURRY: I thought we continued to improve throughout the course of the
year. I thought we had a couple of games where we would go way down, then come
back up. They would always respond. We just have to find that consistency.  
  
A lot of that is being the 11th-youngest team in the country. The most
experienced player is Shaquera, you lose Jordan Lewis for the year, our other
experienced player, who's your quarterback. I thought our kids all year long
tried to respond. We have Shelby Gibson watching at home, we have Amber
Richardson who is on that bench, learning and growing. We have De'Sha
Benjamin, who had foot surgery. We have Megan Abrams. So there's been a lot
that's happened.  
  
At the end of the day I know we've learned some valuable lessons that can
really jump-start us here in the spring. We're going to go back home and go
back to work.  
  
Q. Talk about Taylor Berry, how important it is for her to be on the
floor even if she's not scoring points.  
KRISTY CURRY: De'Sha Alexander is 0-for-9. I don't think I need to say
anything else. That's just an incredible effort.  
  
Q. You mentioned how young this team is. How excited does that get you
about the future?  
KRISTY CURRY: We're excited. Things didn't go the way we wanted to. But I
think all year long, it spoke highly of their character, work ethic, the kind
of people they are. They continued to just fight, go back to work every day,
prepare. We learned a lot about ourselves as people.  
  
There's a lot that I can continue to do to improve, continue to put them in
more of a position to be consistent. It would help if we were healthy
consistently. We weren't. How do you respond to that? I thought we tried all
year.  
  
Appreciate our staff, our kids. We went back to work every day. We're about to
hit the recruiting trail. No rest for the weary. Our team will go back for a
week, we're going to go back to work a week after spring break. We're going to
go back to work.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.  
  
KRISTY CURRY: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2019

  

### [Stephanie White](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=29603)

### [LeaLea Carter](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36563)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Alabama-74, Vanderbilt-57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Vanderbilt.  
  
Coach, an opening statement, please.  
  
STEPHANIE WHITE: I mean, I'm disappointed for our team. We've been through a
lot of adversity this year. At times we've shown great perseverance. I'm
disappointed from this game and our last two games in terms of our energy and
competitiveness. I'm proud of this kid right here who has continued to get
better, continued to grow, continued to make an impact on our program.
Certainly thankful to Bree Horrocks for the last two years and what she's
brought to our program.  
  
Certainly don't want to continue to feel this way when you're at the SEC
tournament, but looking forward to building with some of the pieces we have, a
great incoming class we have, really getting to work this summer.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions, please.  
  
Q. It seemed like you guys in that first quarter sort of dug yourself a
hole with some cold shooting. Even though you made spurts, the deficit was a
little too big. What was it about the first quarter?  
LEALEA CARTER: I think we started off rough. I think it was just the effort.
We just didn't have it. I felt like during warmup we didn't have it. I felt
like we just came in here not caring. That should never be the case.  
  
Alabama, they just pounded on us. Coach White and the coaches talk about it
every day, when we were practicing, You got to come out to want it. The start
of the practice is like the beginning of the game, first quarter. I felt like
we just didn't care. Some people cared, some people didn't. You can't have
that. You all got to be on the same page, you got to want it more than your
other opponent. Especially after we were embarrassed at home, you got to want
to win. It's earned. I felt like we didn't earn it today.  
  
We should have done a lot better. Shouldn't have lost to Alabama. At the end
of the day, you got to want it.  
  
Q. Is there any frustration at all in the fact that you played against
Mississippi State, beat Tennessee, come in, not able to meet that same
level?  
LEALEA CARTER: It's a lot of frustration. I'll start by this. Now a junior
will be a senior, the past three years I've been here, experienced it. We have
yet to get past the first round. Knowing this is my last game as a junior,
it's frustrating. Every time we step on the floor, we have a chance. Any given
night, anybody is beatable. That's an explanation with Tennessee.  
  
We have to want it just as bad as we wanted to beat Tennessee. We made
history. You have to want that every time you step on the floor. Same thing
with Mississippi State. We wanted it. I'm not speaking for Mississippi State,
but it looked like they underestimated us.  
  
I think if we can put Tennessee together, Mississippi State together, we're
unbeatable. I felt like we didn't bring that today. I felt like we haven't
brought it in the last few games. I've been inconsistent myself. I feel like
if we put those two games together, we're unstoppable any given day.  
  
We have the athletes for it. We got to want better for ourselves. We got a lot
to work on this summer, including myself.  
  
Q. You lose Bree, but really that's the only piece you lose. Does that
excite you a little bit, to know what can come back?  
LEALEA CARTER: It does. Bree played a big factor in our team. Bree, she's full
of knowledge. Bree knows everything. We all lean on Bree. Bree did everything
for us. We're truly going to miss Bree. She was a factor on this team.  
  
I'm excited to see what's coming in next, to get to know the players, to get
to play with the players. I'm excited to see what they can bring to the team.
Hopefully we can go further in the tournament, especially throughout the
season.  
  
Q. You're going to be a senior leader next year. How are you going to
participate, making sure everybody is on the same page? What can you do to get
everybody more focused for a game like today?  
LEALEA CARTER: I would start with myself. I think preparation for me, since
I'll be a senior, I think it's really working on my game, doing what I need to
do to make the team better. In preparation for the team, just being more
vocal, trying to push everybody to their next level. That's what Coach White
has done for me, especially the past three years. I think if I can take what
she's taught me, I can help somebody else that's been in the same boat as me.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, can go back and join your teammates.  
  
We'll continue with questions for Coach White, please.  
  
Q. That comment made about not caring, I noticed during the first media
timeout the coaching staff was telling players to come over. It was evident
right there. Did you get that feel?  
STEPHANIE WHITE: Yeah, I think there's a certain competitiveness that comes
with the day-in and day-out that you have to have in order to be successful.
Alabama has been able to come out in both of our games and sort of punch us in
the mouth, so to speak. We haven't really been able to respond.  
  
I'm not sure if it's not caring as much as it is about having a sense of
urgency all the time. I think with a young team, particularly a team I'm not
sure how many games we had a consistent lineup on the floor, that's still
really trying to figure ourselves out, consistency is something that we have
to be able to bring every day. Urgency is something we have to be able to
bring every day.  
  
We've shown potential at times. I think we've shown that there are pieces that
are there. Learning how to do that day in, day out, there's a maturity to
that. I think our group just has not had that.  
  
One thing that we haven't had to fight really is our team plays hard. There's
a difference between playing hard and competing. Really continuing to work on
honing in on what that means.  
  
Q. Early on it seemed like you were getting shots, they just weren't
falling. How impactful was that first quarter stretch?  
STEPHANIE WHITE: I think that's big. I'm not sure what it was. I know at one
point we were 18%. When you're not able to especially hit some easy buckets,
then you start to tighten up, you start short-arming it, second-guessing a lot
of things, as well.  
  
Offensively, especially in the first half, we couldn't quite get it going.
They were. I think one of the things that really stood out to me, and
continues to, in this game as well, they're just bigger and stronger than we
were. We have to be able to be tougher and stronger. Our off-season workout
program is a big part of that. They dominated us in the paint. It was a lot of
different ways.  
  
Our commitment to strength and conditioning is a big part of it. Being able to
answer those punches, being able to respond to those punches with toughness.
We've shown at times we're capable of doing that. I think from a strength and
conditioning standpoint, when you physically can do that consistently, the
mental part then comes on top of that.  
  
Q. Today notwithstanding, you talk about not having a consistent lineup
due to injuries, when you did have full health, Mississippi State and
Tennessee seem to happen. Does that excite you going forward?  
STEPHANIE WHITE: Absolutely. I think not just having a consistent starting
lineup, but being able to find consistent rotations. A rotation is a big part
of being able to sustain throughout the course of a game.  
  
It absolutely does. I think when you have a player like Fas who was a second
team all league player, you have Brinae Alexander who was an all freshman
player. Jordan Cambridge, talk about the heart and commitment from that kid.
We didn't know if she was going to play this year. For her to be able to come
in and do the things she does, the emergence of LeaLea Carter, Cierra Walker
has always been consistent for us. Chelsie fighting back from injury, a little
bit up and down. When you saw a healthy, confident Chelsie, we were a very
good team.  
  
Yeah, it's certainly exciting. Takes some time right now to get healthy, takes
some time to focus in this spring, laying the foundation for what happens over
the summer, our work for the summer.  
  
We have some good pieces, we got some good pieces coming in.  
  
Q. How do you really mix that many new players with a good amount of old
players as well?  
STEPHANIE WHITE: I think it's going to be certainly a growing experience for
our staff. It's going to be a growing experience for our team. I think at the
end of the day, with everybody, returners and those coming in, we have a lot
of fundamental skill work to do. Really I think embracing what it takes on a
day-to-day basis in how we work. Not skipping steps, so to speak.  
  
We have to start with a foundation. When you're bringing in a lot of new
players, the terminology is different. We're going to have to have regular
chalk-talks about terminology. The way we play is different, the things we
want to do offensively and defensively is different. It's not going to hurt
our upperclassmen to have refreshers on that, be great leaders by example for
our young kids. But primarily focusing this summer on fundamentals and skill
development.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much.  
  
STEPHANIE WHITE: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2019

  

### [Cameron Newbauer](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=33311)

### [Funda Nakkasoglu](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=28447)

### [Delicia Washington](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32667)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Florida - 64, Ole Miss - 57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll get an opening statement from coach.  
  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: Really proud of our squad for the toughness and resilience
that we showed from a defensive standpoint today. Ole Miss is a very good
defensive team. They did some things that really frustrated us, did a good job
of taking away some of our players. We talked about that in the first half at
halftime. I think what kept us in it was our defensive intensity, our ability
to disrupt at time, try to turn them over.  
  
Third quarter we came out, did a terrific job, 55% from the floor. I think
that's what kind of got us over the hump. I thought our players did a great
job of playing next play after an offensive first half, they could set back
basketball for the ages. It's hard to focus on what's next, to believe in
yourself and have the confidence it's going to get better. Our players did
that.  
  
We talked a lot about this year, playing the next play, looking to each other
for energy and enthusiasm, having confidence the shots are going to go down.
Our players did that.  
  
Second half offensive stats there, we did that. But we stayed locked in
defensively. Fourth quarter gave up too many free throws there. Overall just
really proud of the effort, proud of these two up here. These two, their last
two games have been fantastic for us. You talk about wanting to play your best
basketball in March, I think our players are focused and believing we're
playing our best basketball right now.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Coach talked about the third quarter, but what happened to help you
hit shots?  
DELICIA WASHINGTON: Coming out halftime, being a little more aggressive.
Giving up good shots for great shots. Focusing on knocking down the shots we
go through every day in practice, playing for one another, being more
aggressive.  
  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: I don't think any of us even knew what the score was, we
kept talking about defense and rebounding, staying locked in because they've
got three fifth-year players in Allen, Sessom, and Salter that are very good
scorers and had a good game against us the first time. We knew we had to stay
locked in defensively. Didn't focus much on the offensive side of the ball,
let's get defense and rebounds, we'll figure out the offense.  
  
Just next play I'd say yes from a defensive standpoint especially, not letting
them get comfortable.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Let's keep our questions focused to the student-athletes until
they're dismissed.  
  
Q. What did you like out of your team's performance in the fourth to do
what coach said, close it out?  
FUNDA NAKKASOGLU: Everyone did what they knew they needed to do. We came out
and were focused for the whole 10 minutes of the fourth quarter. We did face
adversity like coach said about fouls we may not have wanted to do right at
the end. But we stuck through it. We ran our press really well when we needed
to, when they were trying to deny us and be aggressive. We were really poised
and patient with what we got.  
  
Q. You talked a lot about defensive resiliency, intensity. How do you
motivate each other on the floor and keep your team focused when a game is
played the way the first quarter is played?  
DELICIA WASHINGTON: Telling one another to play next play, forget what
happened before and move on.  
  
FUNDA NAKKASOGLU: Just having confidence in one another. I think that's been a
huge thing. We really rely on each other and play for each other. I think
that's what gets us out of those tough situations.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Ladies, thank you very much. We'll take some questions for
coach.  
  
Q. First SEC tournament win, how does getting that win feel, just the
celebration moment in the locker room?  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: It's great because obviously it's been a tough year for us,
just fighting through so many different adversity circumstances with
inexperience, with a young team, with some games that we had leads in, just
couldn't hang on. Just the fight and resolve for our team to continue to keep
chipping away because it's hard when you're a young person to keep having
faith and confidence, to keep trusting your training. I think our players have
done that.  
  
You heard Funda say how much they play for each other. That's a big testament
to who she is as a person. If she wasn't such a good teammate and person, her
teammates wouldn't want to fight so hard to help her win.  
  
To maintain that, be like that in your senior year when you have such a tough
year is special. That's why I love these kids, because they care so much for
one another. It translates on the floor to playing next play, sticking
together, really fighting and doing everything you can for the person next to
you.  
  
Q. Did the momentum from the Vanderbilt win play any role in today's
game?  
CAMERON NEWBAUER: I think it had to. We spent a lot of time showing them
success that we had in that game from a defensive standpoint, success we had
in the game from an offensive standpoint. I think most importantly, success we
had from the energy that came from our bench, celebrations, sprinting to
huddle to talk to each other, give each other encouragement, energy. When you
play with that sense of joy and enthusiasm, I think it translates onto the
court and gives you some more energy.  
  
In a game like this today where it's tough and scrappy, you need more. From a
complete team standpoint, I just thought it was really special. Our last two
games have been like that. Everybody is locked in for doing what's best for
the team, not what's best if I'm on the floor.  
  
I would like to say something. Crystal Allen, fantastic young lady, came in
this league this year. You look at what she's done, first year in the SEC.
Prolific scorer, made second team all conference, just a tough, gritty young
lady. One of those players that you hate to play against. Hate to see her
career finish. What an addition to the SEC this year.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

### [Yolett McPhee-McCuin](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36559)

### [Crystal Allen](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36560)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Florida-64, Ole Miss-57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Ole Miss.  
  
Coach, any thoughts, please.  
  
YOLETT McPHEE-McCUIN: Obviously disappointing loss. No one wants to go home on
the first day. I'm well aware that someone has to. It just happened to be us.  
  
Just had an opportunity to spend time with the players in the locker room.
When I got this gig, I had two players that were healthy. That was it. I hired
a staff and put a team together, and we got our last play in September. They
picked us last, and we didn't finish last, we knocked off a ranked team, did
some incredible things. The future is bright.  
  
I think our kids gave all they had. The staff definitely did. I'm looking
forward to the future.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for Crystal Allen.  
  
Q. Coach Newbauer was in here moments ago saying you were a nightmare to
prepare for, one of the players in the SEC that no one wanted to play. Your
first year in the SEC, what has that whole experience been like for you?  
CRYSTAL ALLEN: It's actually been great. I was coming from the Sunbelt
Conference. For this to be my first year, I wanted to take advantage of the
opportunity I had. I got an opportunity to play in one of the best conferences
in the land. We played some of the top teams, Kentucky. We ended up beating
them on their home floor. A lot of accomplishments we had this season. I know
it didn't end out the way I wanted it to end, the way we wanted it to end.  
  
It is what it is. I just thank God for this opportunity I've been given. I
tried to take advantage of it as much and as best as I could.  
  
Q. About the future being bright, from the players' perspective, why do
you also agree with her statement about the bright future?  
CRYSTAL ALLEN: I agree big-time because I feel like the freshmen, I tried to
set a standard for them. Outside of practice, I've always tried to take my
time, take advantage of the time that I had, getting in the gym, putting in a
lot of exercise. The fact I did that, to see the young freshmen get in the
gym, they started to get in the gym more than I did. It made me happy. For
them to take advantage of the time now, they go out there and fight, I just
feel like that's a start for them. They're just freshmen, so they got a lot of
time to grow. They can grow together.  
  
From them being freshmen right now, if they stick together this year, next
year, years to come, I feel like the future is very bright for them and they
will have a lot of success in the future.  
  
Q. In the first half, obviously trying to get into a flow offensively,
what are some of the things you go back and talk about in the bench, trying to
stay on top?  
CRYSTAL ALLEN: A lot of times I just felt like we needed to focus more on
defense. Sometimes we might make mistakes on offense, might turn the ball
over. That's just the game of basketball.  
  
One thing we can control is our defense. Flying around, things like that,
doing what we have to do, knowing personnel, where the shooters are, knowing
who the driver is, being disciplined on defense. I felt like going into the
huddle, we needed to focus on things like that, getting stops. The more we got
stops, I felt like we can open up more in transition, open up more as far as
getting buckets. That's just the main thing that coach hangs her hat on, too.
I felt we needed to focus more on that.  
  
I felt like we lost focus on that, let No. 3 get off. They'll do better next
year, but that's what we focused on.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you, Crystal.  
  
Questions for head coach.  
  
Q. Coach, in the third quarter, it was a close game up until halfway
through, what did you see in that quarter that allowed Florida to get out on a
run?  
YOLETT McPHEE-McCUIN: Just what I've been seeing all year, just a lack of
focus on player personnel. In this conference, you have to know who the best
players are and where they are on the floor all the time.  
  
Thought we lost sight of Funda. She made us pay. When she hit a couple of
shots, it gave the rest of their team an incredible amount of confidence. They
just came off of a win, so where she didn't score, then when they started
scoring, they turned it around. It was like a breath of fresh air when she
started to hit those threes. I thought they ran with it. A couple miscues. The
margin of error was super small in this game. When we allowed them to make at
least two of them, it was enough to separate.  
  
When we played them the first time, we had built a little lead. We didn't make
those shots that we made in Oxford, those layups, we missed those today. We
weren't able to have a cushion. They were able to pull away because of it.  
  
Q. Almost impossible situation you were handed coming into this job. To
see what you accomplished this year, have you taken a minute to reflect on
it?  
YOLETT McPHEE-McCUIN: Not yet. I know I'm grateful. When I walked into the
arena, saw SEC Tournament, it was almost surreal. Two years ago I was watching
it in Jacksonville as the head coach at JU.  
  
I remember saying to my staff, I'll be there one day. Fast forward two years,
I wasn't expecting it to be this quick. In our profession, it doesn't really
happen like this. Usually you have to take about three more steps, then you
can get an opportunity like this.  
  
I'm grateful. I had an incredible experience. A lot of times you get into a
program your first year, coaches never talk about it, but it's usually a
nightmare. You got kids, the job is open for a reason, there are culture
issues. I had none of that. I really enjoyed this team. I thought they
represented the university at a high level. I gave them all that I had, and so
did my staff.  
  
Just excited about the future.  
  
Q. Shandricka was one of the only ones to return this year. Now that the
season is ended, what did she mean for you this year in building a culture?  
YOLETT McPHEE-McCUIN: She was an incredible ambassador for the university. I
think they used Shandricka every opportunity they had. When I first came, it
was like no one else existed. She's just a great person. She was great for me
to coach. I enjoyed her.  
  
I remember one day she told me I needed to be a little hard on her. She's such
a nice person, it's hard to be hard on a kid that's so nice. Doesn't give you
any problems, is respectful. If anything, hopefully our girls learned that.  
  
Just trying to build a tradition, I did some things with the seniors to keep
them around in the future. She'll be able to share some experiences and
insights for the next crop that comes in.  
  
Q. When you look at Crystal Allen, some of the players that transferred
with you, what they did, have you taken a minute to talk with them?  
YOLETT McPHEE-McCUIN: I just thanked them. All year I've been trying to give
life lessons. I'm just a firm believer in the process. I don't believe in
skipping steps. To be honest with you, although this loss sucks, it ended as
it probably should. A team that got put together with two seconds left on the
shot clock, through it we spoiled some people's agendas and won some games. I
think they won one game last year in the regular season.  
  
I mean, we had a lot of good times. One thing I told the young ladies,
especially Shandricka and Cece, I felt loyal to them because they stuck
around. I had nine people leave, and they stuck around, wanted to have a great
experience. By the sound of it in the locker room, they did that, mission
accomplished.  
  
For the other young ladies that came, they really took advantage of their
opportunities. It wasn't like they were at this Power 5 school when they came.
They were at a lower level and moved up and took advantage of it. That's an
example in itself for people, when you get an opportunity, you need to take
advantage of it.  
  
I'm going to do the same. Like I said, not much to reflect on. I'm really
focused on the future. I'll be out recruiting tomorrow, so... Excited about
where we're going. I can promise you it won't be a first-game-out for a longer
period of time.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you.

# [SOUTHEASTERN CONFERENCE WOMEN'S BASKETBALL
TOURNAMENT](http://www.asapsports.com/show_events.php?category=11&year=2019&title=SOUTHEASTERN+CONFERENCE+WOMEN%27S+BASKETBALL+TOURNAMENT)

  

## March 6, 2019

  

### [Kristy Curry](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=14069)

### [Shaquera Wade](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=32627)

### [Cierra Johnson](http://www.asapsports.com/show_player.php?id=36564)

  
_Nashville, Tennessee_  
  
Alabama-74, Vanderbilt-57  
  
THE MODERATOR: We are joined by Alabama.  
  
An opening statement, please.  
  
KRISTY CURRY: Just really proud of our team today. We feel like it's a brand-
new season, brand-new opportunity. This tournament is an opportunity for our
team to come out and have another opportunity with the post-season. I'm just
really proud of the response. We wanted to come out and be the more aggressive
team. I think that showed. We were really aggressive, had great balance with
four in double figures, dominated the glass.  
  
It's important when you can rebound and defend. Thought our kids really played
to tendencies today, made a big difference. I'm really proud of our effort.  
  
THE MODERATOR: Questions for the student-athletes.  
  
Q. Shaquera, this is going to be your final SEC tournament, regardless
of the outcome. Talk about what this one means to you.  
SHAQUERA WADE: Well, it's exciting. No matter what the outcome is, I'm
grateful to play with the teammates that I have and to be coached with the
coaches that I have.  
  
No matter what the outcome is, I'm just very, very excited.  
  
Q. Cierra, it seems every time you have the ball, you're very
aggressive. How much does this team need you to be aggressive on a game-to-
game basis?  
CIERRA JOHNSON: I think it's very important that I set the tone and be more
aggressive. It's like the more I'm aggressive, I get my teammates open to when
I'm going hard, they collapse on me, I find my shooter. It's very important
that I'm aggressive.  
  
Q. Cierra, Shaquera and Taylor playing in some of their final games.
What does it mean for the rest of the team? How are you playing for these
two?  
CIERRA JOHNSON: When you have good teammates like Shaq and Taylor, just going
hard at practice every day, just being around them, you just want to play
harder for them. You want to end them on a good note. You want to go as far as
you can.  
  
I know Shaq said no matter the outcome, she'll be happy. For us, it means more
because it is their last tournament. We want to just take them as far as we
can.  
  
THE MODERATOR: We'll take some questions for head coach.  
  
Q. How do you now turn the page and get prepared for Auburn?  
KRISTY CURRY: It's like I told them, enjoy this. We're going to get some ice
cream, then we'll head back to the hotel. When we walk in that hotel, our
preparation starts with how we handle our meal, our rest, preparation.  
  
We're prepared as staff. I think our kids understand what you have to do to
have a different outcome. We've had an opportunity to play them twice. That's
an advantage. We know some areas that we need to correct.  
  
Q. What do you tell your team before the game with it possibly being
their last game of the season?  
KRISTY CURRY: We want to talk about what we can control tomorrow. That's our
energy and effort. We come out with the right energy and effort, we don't have
to talk about what might happen that's negative. We want to stay positive.
That's what we've done throughout what we've weathered this season: Focus on
the next play, the next moment. That's within our control. Not to think ahead,
look back, but focus on the moment.  
  
If we can do that, I think the outcome will take care of itself.  
  
Q. Can you talk about how proud you are of your group for coming out the
way they did today.  
KRISTY CURRY: I'm telling you, we get word yesterday that Meg is out with a
concussion. That's stunning. We just lost De'Sha Benjamin to a broken foot.
That shocked us a little bit. We've had a lot of things happen.  
  
If you look at Taylor today, five rebounds, four steals, no turnovers,
assists, 37 minutes, drew the toughest defensive assignment all day and held
Walker to 11. That's what it's about.  
  
Again, it's just great to see those kind of moments. When somebody else goes
down, it's somebody else's turn to step up. Couldn't be any happier for her.
Everything we've asked, she's always done. She knew how important today was,
how important tomorrow is. We're going to need great bench play. We're
obviously very limited.  
  
Was really proud to see her team rally around her. I thought Cierra set the
tone, but everybody rallied, because of Taylor's energy, vocalness in the
locker room the past couple days. Focused on what we can control, that's our
energy and effort, who is on the floor.  
  
Q. What is the energy like at an event like this, post-season?  
KRISTY CURRY: It's a fun time of year. As a competitor, you look forward to
these moments, you look forward to having the opportunity for a brand-new
season. I think our kids understand the opportunity in front of them. We're
going to try to make the most of it.  
  
Q. Has the ice cream been all season long or is this special?  
KRISTY CURRY: It's perfect timing in the afternoon before dinner. We usually
do that after a win. I think there's a good spot close to us. We're prepared
(smiling).  
  
THE MODERATOR: Thank you very much for joining us, coach. We'll see you
tomorrow.  
  
KRISTY CURRY: Thank you.
